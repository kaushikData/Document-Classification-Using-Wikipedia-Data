The '''album-equivalent unit''' is a measurement unit in [[music industry]] to define the consumption of music that equals the purchase of one [[album]] copy.&lt;ref name="pitchfork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BillboardRule"/&gt; This consumption includes [[streaming media|streaming]] and [[music download|song downloads]] in addition to traditional [[album sales]]. The album-equivalent unit was introduced in the mid-[[2010s]] as an answer to the drop of album sales in the 21st century. Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Album Sales Are Down|url=http://www.speeli.com/articles/view/Why-album-sales-are-down|website=Speeli|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the only albums that [[Music_recording_certification|went platinum]] in the United States in 2014 were the ''[[Frozen (soundtrack)|Frozen]]'' soundtrack and [[Taylor Swift]]'s [[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|''1989'']], whereas several artists did in 2013.&lt;ref name="noplat"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2014/10/16/not-one-artists-album-has-gone-platinum-in-2014/ |title=Not One Artist's Album Has Gone Platinum In 2014 |last=McIntyre |first=Hugh |date=October 16, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |publisher=Forbes, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Sam|title=Taylor Swift, Platinum Party of One|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/11/05/361577726/taylor-swift-platinum-party-of-one|website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the album-equivalent units revolutionized the charts from the "best-selling albums" ranking into the "most popular albums" ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7393605/drakes-views-no-1-fifth-week-billboard-200|title=Drake's 'Views' Rules at No. 1 for Fifth Week on Billboard 200 Chart|first=Keith|last=Caulfield|work=Billboard|date=May 22, 2016|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) have used album-equivalent unit to measure their [[Global Recording Artist of the Year]] since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/global-artist-chart.php|title=Global Recording Artist of the Year|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses on record charts==
=== United States ===
Beginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart revised its ranking methodology with album-equivalent unit instead of pure album sales. With this overhaul, the ''Billboard'' 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by [[Nielsen SoundScan]]) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including [[Spotify]], [[Apple Music]], [[Google Play]] and [[Xbox Music]]. Known as TEA (track equivalent album) and SEA (streaming equivalent album) when originally implemented, 10 song sales or 1,500 song streams from an album were treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. ''Billboard'' continues to publish a pure album sales chart, called [[Top Album Sales]], that maintains the traditional ''Billboard'' 200 methodology, based exclusively on Nielsen SoundScan's sales data.&lt;ref name="BillboardRule"&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Trust|title=Billboard 200 Makeover: Album Chart to Incorporate Streams &amp; Track Sales|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6320099/billboard-200-makeover-streams-digital-tracks|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2014-11-20|accessdate=2014-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor Swift's ''1989'' was the first album to top the chart with this methodology, generating 339,000 album-equivalent units (281,000 units came from pure album sales).&lt;ref name="pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6334866/taylor-swift-1989-returns-no-1-billboard-200 |title=Taylor Swift's '1989' Returns to No. 1 on Revamped Billboard 200|work=billboard.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/589-why-is-taylor-swift-still-1-interpreting-the-revamped-billboard-200-album-chart/ |title=Why Is Taylor Swift Still #1?|work=pitchfork.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the February 8, 2015 issue, ''[[Now That's What I Call Music! 53 (U.S. series)|Now That's What I Call Music! 53]]'' became the first album in history to miss the top position of the ''Billboard'' 200 despite being the best-selling album of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/28306/20150212/now-53-outsells-taylor-swift-becomes-first-record-top-albums-kid-ink.htm|title=Now 53 Outsells Taylor Swift, Becomes First Record to Top Albums Chart but Not Billboard 200; Kid Ink Cracks Top 10|first=Ryan|last=Book|date=February 12, 2015|work=The Music Times|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2018, Billboard and Nielsen revised the ratios used for streaming equivalent album units to account for the relative value of streams on paid music services like Apple Music or Amazon Music Unlimited versus ad-supported music and video platforms such as Spotify's free tier and YouTube. Under the updated album equivalent ratios, 1,250 premium audio streams, 3,750 ad-supported streams, or 3,750 video streams are equal to one album unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/arts/music/drake-scorpion-streams-billboard-chart.html|title=The Music Industry’s Math Changes, but the Outcome Doesn’t: Drake Is No. 1|first=Ben|last=Sisario|date=July 9, 2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the [[Official Charts Company]] has included streaming into the [[UK Albums Chart]] since March 2015.&lt;ref name="Sam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6487512/sam-smiths-in-the-lonely-hour-tops-historic-uk-albums-chart |title=Sam Smith's 'In the Lonely Hour' Tops Historic U.K. Albums Chart|work=billboard.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change was decided after the massive growth of streaming; the number of tracks streamed in the UK in a year doubled from 7.5 billion in 2013 to just under 15 billion in 2014. Under the new methodology, Official Charts Company takes the 12 most-streamed tracks from an album, with the top two songs being given lesser weight so that the figure will reflect the popularity of the album as a whole rather than of one or two successful [[single (music)|singles]]. The adjusted total is divided by 1000 and added to the album sales figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uk-s-official-albums-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time__8012/ |title=Official Albums Chart to include streaming data for first time|work=officialcharts.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]'s ''[[In the Lonely Hour]]'' was the first album to top the chart with this rule. Out of its 41,000 album-equivalent units, 2,900 units came from streaming and the rest were pure sales.&lt;ref name="Sam"/&gt; By the end of 2017, The BPI reported that streaming now accounts for over half of music consumption in the UK (50.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/drakes-official-top-40-most-streamed-songs__21625/|title=Drake's Official Top 40 most streamed songs|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In Germany, streaming began to be included on the albums chart since February 2016. Nevertheless, [[German Albums Chart]] is used to ranking the albums based on weekly [[revenue]], instead of units. Hence, only paid streaming is counted and should be played at least 30 seconds. At least 6 tracks of one album have to be streamed to make streams count for the album, with 12 tracks being the maximum counted. Similar to the UK chart rule, the actual streams of the top-two songs are not counted, but instead the average of the following tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikmarkt.de/Aktuell/News/Deutsche-Album-Charts-integrieren-Premium-Streaming|archive-url=https://archive.is/20160201142531/http://www.musikmarkt.de/Aktuell/News/Deutsche-Album-Charts-integrieren-Premium-Streaming|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 1, 2016|publisher=Musikmarkt.de|language=German|title=Deutsche Album-Charts integrieren Premium-Streaming|date=February 1, 2016|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Deutsche-Album-Charts-jetzt-auch-mit-Streaming-Zahlen-3089360.html|title=Deutsche Album-Charts jetzt auch mit Streaming-Zahlen|first=Volker|last=Briegleb|date=February 1, 2016|publisher=[[Heinz Heise]]|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes.com]], Hugh McIntyre noted that the usage of album equivalent units has made artists release albums with excessive track lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/08/17/how-longer-albums-and-streaming-giants-are-manipulating-the-charts/2/#69d2965051b3|title=How Longer Albums And Streaming Giants Are Manipulating The Charts|publisher=Forbes|date=2017-08-17|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Josephs from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said: "If you’re a thirsty pop artist of note, you can theoretically game the system by packing as many as 20 tracks into an album, in the process rolling up more album-equivalent units—and thus album "sales"—as listeners check the album out." He also criticized [[Chris Brown]]'s album ''[[Heartbreak on a Full Moon]]'' which contains over 40 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/05/chris-brown-new-album-40-song-tracklist-heartbreak-on-a-full-moon/|title=Why Does Chris Brown’s New Album Have 40 Songs?|date=2017-05-02|publisher=Spin|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Amadeus''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[Peter Shaffer]], which gives a highly fictionalized account of the lives of the [[composer]]s [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Antonio Salieri]]. First performed in 1979, ''Amadeus'' was inspired by a short 1830 play by [[Alexander Pushkin]] called ''[[Mozart and Salieri (play)|Mozart and Salieri]]'' (which was also used as the [[libretto]] for an [[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|opera of the same name]] by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] in 1897).

In the play, significant use is made of the music of Mozart, Salieri and other composers of the period. The premieres of Mozart's [[opera]]s [[Die Entführung aus dem Serail|''The Abduction from the Seraglio'']], ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]],'' ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' are each the setting for key scenes of the play.

After being presented successfully at the [[Royal National Theatre]], London in 1979, the play moved to the [[West End theatre|West End]] followed by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. ''Amadeus'' won the 1981 [[Tony Award for Best Play]]. It was adapted by Shaffer for [[Amadeus (film)|the 1984 Academy Award-winning film of the same name]].

==Plot==
Since the original run, Shaffer has extensively revised his play, including changes to plot details; the following is common to all revisions.

At the opening of the tale, Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking directly to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart and promises to explain himself. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person, but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions, and is thrilled at the chance to meet him in person, during a [[salon (gathering)|salon]] at which some of Mozart's compositions will be played. When he finally does catch sight of Mozart, however, he is deeply disappointed to find him lacking the grace and charm of his compositions: When Salieri first meets him, Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees, engaging in profane talk with his future bride [[Constanze Weber]].

Salieri cannot reconcile Mozart's boorish behaviour with the genius that God has inexplicably bestowed upon him. Indeed, Salieri, who has been a devout Catholic all his life, cannot believe that God would choose Mozart over him for such a gift. Salieri renounces God and vows to do everything in his power to destroy Mozart as a way of getting back at his Creator.

Throughout much of the rest of the play, Salieri masquerades as Mozart's ally to his face while doing his utmost to destroy his reputation and any success his compositions may have. On more than one occasion it is only the direct intervention of the [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] himself that allows Mozart to continue (interventions which Salieri opposes, and then is all too happy to take credit for when Mozart assumes it was he who intervened). Salieri also humiliates Mozart's wife when she comes to Salieri for aid, and smears his character with the Emperor and the court. A major theme in ''Amadeus'' is Mozart's repeated attempts to win over the aristocratic "public" with increasingly brilliant compositions, which are always frustrated either by Salieri or by the aristocracy's own inability to appreciate Mozart's genius.

The play ends with Salieri attempting suicide with a razor in a last attempt to be remembered, leaving a confession of having murdered Mozart with [[arsenic]]. He survives, however, and his confession is met with disbelief, leaving him to wallow once again in mediocrity.

==Background and production==

===Historical accuracy===
Shaffer used [[artistic licence]] in his portrayals of both Mozart and Salieri. Documentary evidence suggests that there was some antipathy between the two men, but the idea that Salieri was the instigator of Mozart's demise is not taken seriously by scholars of the men's lives and careers. While historically there may have been actual rivalry and tension between Mozart and Salieri, there is also evidence that they enjoyed a relationship marked by mutual respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=A. Peter|title=''Amadeus'' and Mozart: Setting the Record Straight|journal=The American Scholar|volume=61|issue=1|url=http://www.mozartproject.org/essays/brown.html|date=7 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825183005/http://www.mozartproject.org/essays/brown.html|archivedate=25 August 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, Salieri later tutored Mozart's son [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart|Franz]] in music. He also conducted some of Mozart's works, both in Mozart's lifetime and afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Hildesheimer, Wolfgang: Mozart, 1977 {{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[David Cairns (writer)|David Cairns]] called ''Amadeus'' "myth-mongering" and argued against Shaffer's portrait of Mozart as "two contradictory beings, sublime artist and fool", positing instead that Mozart was "fundamentally well-integrated". Cairns also rejects the "romantic legend" that Mozart always wrote out perfect manuscripts of works already completely composed in his head, citing major and prolonged revisions to several manuscripts (see: [[Mozart's compositional method]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cairns|first1=David|title=Mozart and his Operas|date=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=978-0520228986|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable productions===
''Amadeus'' was first presented at the [[Royal National Theatre]], London in 1979, directed by [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Sir Peter Hall]] and starring [[Paul Scofield]] as Salieri, [[Simon Callow]] as Mozart, and [[Felicity Kendal]] as Constanze. (Callow later appeared in the film version in a different role.) It was later transferred in modified form to the [[West End of London|West End]], starring [[Frank Finlay]] as Salieri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josephdreams |url=http://frankfinlay.net/Theatre/Amadeus.html |title=Frank Finlay |publisher=Frank Finlay |date=2 July 1981|accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast also included [[Andrew Cruickshank]] (Rosenberg), [[Basil Henson]] (von Strack), [[Philip Locke]] (Greybig), [[John Normington]] (Joseph II) and [[Nicholas Selby]] (van Swieten).&lt;ref&gt;Hall, P, Goodwin J. ''The Peter Hall Diaries: The Story of a Dramatic Battle.'' Hamish Hamilton, London, 1983, p. 461, footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on 11 December 1980 at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/amadeus-4083|title=Amadeus – Broadway Play – Original – IBDB|first=The Broadway|last=League|website=www.ibdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Ian McKellen]] as Salieri, [[Tim Curry]] as Mozart, and [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] as Constanze. It ran for 1,181 performances, closing on 16 October 1983, and was nominated for seven [[Tony Awards]] (Best Actor for both McKellen and Curry, Best Director for [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]], Best Play, Best Costume Design, Lighting, and Set Design for [[John Bury (theatre designer)|John Bury]]), of which it won five (including Best Play and Best Actor for McKellen).

'''''Armello''''' is a digital [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] [[strategy video game|strategy]] [[board game]] developed by Australian [[independent game]] studio&lt;ref&gt;[[webpage|http://leagueofgeeks.com/]]&lt;/ref&gt; League of Geeks as their debut project. First announced as an [[iPad]] title in September 2012, the game has been in development since mid-2011, with music by composers [[Lisa Gerrard]] and Michael Allen.&lt;ref name="KS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/leagueofgeeks/armello-bringing-tabletop-adventures-to-life |title=Armello - Bringing Tabletop Adventures to Life by League of Geeks |publisher=Kickstarter |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between April and May 2014, a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign was created to help fund a port to [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[GOG.com]], as well as stretch goals to bring the game to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Microsoft Surface|Windows tablets]]. The game was also chosen to receive additional support from governmental funding agencies [[Screen Australia]] and [[Film Victoria]].&lt;ref name="IGN1" /&gt;

Set in a [[fantasy]] world filled with [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, up to four players assume the role of a hero chosen among their clan to take part in a campaign to become the next king or queen. The game features [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]] board-game mechanics that revolve around the use of dice and cards that are drawn from a deck, with each player's actions influencing the outcome.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Armello - Screenshot 02.png|thumb|left|''Armello'' recreates a traditional tabletop role-playing game, based on a fantasy world populated by anthropomorphic creatures.]]
''Armello'' is a digital simulation of a traditional [[fantasy]] [[tabletop role-playing game]] utilizing virtual [[dice]] and cards which allow the player to carry out specific actions. Up to four players assume the role of a Hero character that represents a specific animal clan, each with their own unique strengths, with the ultimate goal to storm the castle and become the new king or queen of the kingdom. The playing board area is divided into [[hexagon]]-shaped tiles that contain randomly generated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-09-attractive-digital-board-game-armello-on-kickstarter |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |title=Attractive digital board game Armello on Kickstarter |last=Purchese |first=Robert |date=9 April 2014 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; features such as dungeons to explore, quests to complete, rival heroes to battle, or settlements to capture.&lt;ref name="KS" /&gt; As the game progresses, players can acquire currency to purchase additional abilities for their hero using a talent tree system specific to each character.

The game uses a [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]] system where players are allowed to perform actions such as equip items and purchase talents during another player's turn to reduce downtime.&lt;ref name="KS" /&gt; Cards and dice are used to directly interact with the game world, and form the basis for the game's combat system. Players use cards they draw from a deck to cast spells, recruit followers, heal wounds, or use items that grant special abilities. Cards may also be played as "Perils" which can be laid on specific tiles to act as traps for other heroes or used immediately in combat, and other cards may be used to forge temporary alliances. ''Armello'' also features a day/night cycle where certain heroes gain advantages based on the time of day, and certain groups of enemies only appear in either the darkness or light.&lt;ref name="KS" /&gt;

==Plot and characters==
The game takes place in the "dark [[fairy tale]]" Kingdom of Armello, a world filled with anthropomorphic animals separated into numerous clans.&lt;ref name="Official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armello.com/game |title=Armello / Game |accessdate=14 April 2014 |publisher=Armello.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415170054/http://www.armello.com/game |archivedate=15 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the current king becomes corrupted by a dark force called the Rot, representatives from these faction rise up to embark on a journey to become the new king or queen in his stead.&lt;ref name="KS" /&gt;

[[File:Armello - Screenshot 08.png|thumb|A typical combat result screen, here featuring the characters of Thane the wolf and Barnaby the rabbit.]]
While the game features eight heroes available to all players at launch, more will be added to the game over time. The initial characters include Thane, The Winter Wolf, a [[wolf|lupine]] warrior who carries a large sword; River the Howling Arrow, a wolf Archer; Amber, The Far Seeker, a [[rabbit]] armed with a short sword and umbrella; Barnaby Screwloose, a rabbit with custom made armor and a hammer; Mercurio, The Grinning Blade, a sneaky [[rat]] with a rapier; Zosha the Whirlwind, a rat assassin with a join-able pair of daggers; Sana, The Forest Sister, a [[bear]] who carries a staff of magic power; and Brun Oakbreaker, a Bear Shaman with a totemic club staff.

In Armello: Usurpers, four more heroes are introduced including Elyssia the Wardress of Warrens (Rabbit), Sargon the Death Teller (Rat), Magna the Unbroken (Wolf), and Ghor the Wyldkin (Bear). In Armello: Rivals, four more heroes join the others including Hargrave Thunder Earl (Rabbit), Griotte Butcher Baroness (Rat), Yordana The Devourer (Bear) and Fang The Exiled (Wolf).

==Development==
''Armello'' was announced in September 2012 as the debut title from Australian [[independent game]] studio League of Geeks, originally as an [[iPad]]-exclusive title to be released the following year before experiencing delays.&lt;ref name="IGN1"&gt;{{cite web |title=League of Geeks Announces Armello |publisher=[[IGN]] |author=IGN AU Staff |date=19 September 2012 |accessdate=13 April 2014 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/20/league-of-geeks-announces-armello}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 15-person development includes four directors: Ty Carey, Trent Kusters, Blake Mizzi, and Jacek Tuschewski, whose total experience in the game industry includes 40 years and 50 released projects.&lt;ref name="KS" /&gt; Kusters stated that he was inspired to create the game after hearing about the success [[Greg Kasavin]] had in producing ''[[Bastion (video game)|Bastion]]'' with such a small team.&lt;ref name="GI1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/armello/b/ios/archive/2013/03/27/the-dice-are-rolling-in-armellos-favor.aspx |title=The Dice Are Rolling in Armello's Favor |work=[[Game Informer]] |last=Wallace |first=Kimberley |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; League of Geeks began work on the game after eight months of prototypes on paper, with an additional 18 months of work to arrive at the [[Software release life cycle|pre-alpha build]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/2/4175404/armello-pre-alpha-sneak-peek-shows-a-board-game-brought-to-life |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=2 April 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2014 |last=Lien |first=Tracy |title=Armello pre-alpha sneak peek shows a board game brought to life}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early version of the game was showcased at the [[Game Developers Conference]] in April 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Armello GDC 2013 Screenshots |url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/2/4175132/armello-gdc-2013-screenshots |publisher=Polygon |last=Lien |first=Tracy |date=3 April 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later at the inaugural [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX Australia]] the following July.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://armello.com/press/index.php |title=League of Geeks Presskit |accessdate=13 April 2014 |publisher=Armello.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 and October 2013, League of Geeks received assistance funding from the state government of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://film.vic.gov.au/funding/decisions/funding-decisions-201112/games-development |title=Games Development |publisher=Film Victoria.gov |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://film.vic.gov.au/funding/decisions/games-development |publisher=Film Victoria.gov |accessdate=14 April 2013 |title=Games Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2012 [[Sydney Film Festival]], it was announced that ''Armello'' was one of 14 projects chosen from a pool of 89 to receive additional support from the Australian federal government funding body [[Screen Australia]].&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt;

The content was limited to the console versions of the title and through Steam for personal computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-08-09-armello-is-coming-to-xbox-one-this-month|title=Armello is coming to Xbox One this month|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=9 August 2016|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they had planned on offering the content to all users since the Kickstarter, including those with DRM-free versions of the game as through GOG.com, League of Geeks found that being able to support the content on the DRM-free platform was a task beyond their resources. Co-found Trent Kusters stated "given infinite resources and time we could undertake the task of rewriting the underlying architecture at the core of this decision, but that's straight up not feasible for a vast number of reasons that are unique to LoG, Armello, where we're standing right now and where we see Armello's future." League of Geeks allowed those consumers that had purchased the DRM-free version to request refunds of the game because of this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techraptor.net/content/gog-is-now-offering-refunds-for-armello|title=GOG Is Now Offering Refunds For Armello|first=Patrick|last=Perrault}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-only-dlc-for-pc-game-causes-gog-to-offer-ref/1100-6443451/|title=Steam-Only DLC for PC Game Causes GOG to Offer Refunds a Year After Launch|first=Mat|last=Paget}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/armello/armello-refund|title=GOG offer refunds on year-old game, Armello, because DLC is only for the Steam version|first=Kirk|last=McKeand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/gog-is-offering-refunds-on-the-drm-free-edition-of-armello/|title=GOG is offering refunds on the "DRM Free Edition" of Armello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
In December 2015, League of Geeks partnered with [[IndieBox]], a monthly [[subscription box]] service, to produce a custom-designed, physical version of ''Armello''. This limited, individually-numbered edition included a flash-drive with a [[DRM-Free|DRM-free]] copy of the game, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual, [[Steam (software)|Steam]] key, and several custom-made collectible items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geek.com/games/redwall-meets-risk-with-the-armello-indiebox-1646421/|title=Redwall meets Risk with the Armello IndieBox - Geek.com|date=5 February 2016|work=Geek.com|access-date=3 June 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game '''Bầu Cua Tôm Cá''' ([[:wikt:bầu|bầu]] [[:wikt:cua|cua]] [[:wikt:tôm|tôm]] [[:wikt:cá|cá]] "gourd-crab-shrimp-fish") is a [[Vietnam]]ese [[gambling]] game using three [[dice]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Jones, Sanh Thông Huỳnh - Introduction to spoken Vietnamese 1957 "play Squash-crab-fish-tiger.  lớn chơi bầu cua cá cọp. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toan Ánh - ''Nếp cũ hội hè đình đám'' Volume 1 1991 "Ngoài thú xem hát ra, trẻ em còn giải trí bằng lối đánh bầu cua cá cọp (môn cờ bạc này đến nay vẫn còn thịnh hành). Người lớn có máu đỏ đen thì tha hồ mà cờ bạc làm cho bao nhiêu người phải mang nợ đến đổi phải vong gia thất thổ."&lt;/ref&gt;

The six sides of the dice, instead of showing one to six pips, have pictures of a fish, a [[prawn]], a crab, a rooster, a [[calabash]] gourd, and a stag. Players place wagers on a board that has the six pictures, betting on which pictures will appear. If one die corresponds with a bet, the bettor receives the same amount as their bet. If two dice correspond with a bet, the bettor receives two times their money. If three dice correspond with a bet, the bettor receives three times their money. For instance, if one were to place $3 on fish, and the dealer rolls 2 fish and 1 stag, then the bettor would receive $6 while keeping the $3 they had bet. Any money not rewarded for the round is kept in a central pool managed by the dealer, who rolls the dice.

''Bầu Cua Tôm Cá'' is essentially the Vietnamese variation of [[Hoo Hey How]] (Fish-Prawn-Crab) played in China, the dice game [[Crown and Anchor]] played by [[United Kingdom|British]] sailors, or [[chuck-a-luck]] played in America. ''Bau cua tom ca'' is often played at ''[[Tết]]'' (Vietnamese New Year).

[[Image:CompetitiveDanceGroup.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A dance group strikes an ending pose at the conclusion of their competitive performance. Groups such as this are typically formed from students in a dance class. The dancers in this image are members of a tap dance class.]]

'''Competitive dance''' is a popular, widespread hobby  in which competitors perform dances in any of several permitted dance styles—such as [[acro dance|acro]], [[ballet]], [[contemporary]], [[jazz dance|jazz]], [[hip-hop dance|hip-hop]], [[lyrical dance|lyrical]], [[modern dance|modern]], [[musical theatre]], and [[tap dance|tap]]—before a common group of judges. This is in contrast with other activities that involve competition among dancers based on purpose, or specific dance style, such as [[dance squad|pom squad]] and [[dancesport]].
The competitive dance industry largely consists of ''competition production companies''—also sometimes called ''dance competition companies and dance competition lines''—that conduct regional competitions at stops along their annual, nationwide tours. Dancers who compete at these regional competitions are students ranging in age from approximately four to eighteen years old. Dance schools (often referred to as dance studios) arrange for their classes to compete as groups. Advanced dancers may be chosen to compete solos, duets, trios, or in a small group dance in addition to or in place of large group routines. Competitions typically begin in January and end in July or August.

Competitive dancers must be physically fit because even short dances can be physically demanding. Dancers must continuously train to maintain and improve their technique, balance skills, strength and flexibility. Except for holidays and short breaks during the summer, competitive dancing is typically a year-round activity: dancers attend classes during competition season, to refine their competitive routines, and during off-season to prepare for the next upcoming competition season. Some dancers attend dance intensives during the summer to improve technique. These intensives normally last a few weeks and happen in various locations across the world.

==Competition==

===Dance music===

The [[music]] used in competitive dance routines is typically adapted from commercially available songs created by professional [[recording artist]]s. Dance routines are subject to time limits at most dance competitions, and consequently the original, commercial music is usually edited to conform to such time limits. 

Different styles of dance require different forms of music. Lyrical, contemporary, and modern dances often require slower music. Jazz and hip hop dances are set to more upbeat songs. The musical theatre category is composed of routines set to songs from Broadway musicals, films, and TV shows. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | title = Music Primer for Dancers
  | url = http://www.westsideacademy.com/perfco/forum/download.php?id=4 
  | accessdate = 2008-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards===
There is no industry-wide standard for scoring. The maximum number of points issued by each judge, as well as the maximum possible final score, varies among competition production companies. Although it is common for judges to issue a maximum of 100 points each, at least one company implements a system in which judges may issue up to 200 points, based on the rationale that such a scoring system is similar to that employed in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Groove Competition
  | title = Competition Rules
  | url = https://www.groovecompetition.com/rules-and-regulations
  | accessdate = 2010-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although scoring at dance competitions vary, the judges score the performances based on similar qualities. The judges usually score based off technique, performance, costume, music, and challenge level of the performance. Each competition's ranks are different. For example some competition's highest medal may be a "gold", whereas another is a "crystal." The performances are usually ranked within the category of dance (Jazz, Ballet, Lyrical, Hip-Hip, etc.) The dances are also ranked "overall". This means that out of all the dances of that age group are ranked based on their score. Overalls include all different categories of dance.

Most competitions have opportunities for dancers to win title positions. Titles include Mr. and Miss dance. These competitions normally include elite dancers who choose to pay an extra fee to run for title. The title competition includes competing a solo, entering a headshot, and being interviewed by the judges. Winners of the title competition typically receive money and a crown.

==Competitions==

===Competitive dance industry===
Dance competitions are organized and conducted by independent competition production companies. In 2007 there were at least 150 such companies operating in the United States and Canada alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DanceCompetitionHub.com |title=Dance Competition Hub |url=http://www.dancecompetitionhub.com |archivedate=November 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition production companies move from one [[metropolitan area]] to another, stopping for a few days in each area to conduct a regional competition. By touring in this manner, these companies are able to generate profits while at the same time enabling significant numbers of dancers to attend local competitions. Some companies also conduct one or more national competitions after their regional tours have ended.

The competitive dance industry has no oversight body or standards organization, although at least one effort was attempted to establish a limited set of competition rules and safety standards in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Association of Dance Conventions and Competitions| url = http://www.theadcc.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition production companies seldom coordinate their tours with each other. Tour start and end dates, as well as cities visited, vary from one company to another. Most companies conduct regional tours from approximately January through May, while National competitions generally run from June through August. It is not uncommon for two regional tours to be visiting the same metropolitan area at the same time.

===Rules and Regulations===
Age Divisions: Dancers in competitions are split into different age categories. The categories are: 4 &amp; under, 5-8 years old (mini), 9-11 years old (junior), 12-14 (teen), and 15-18 (senior). Dancers must bring proof of age to every competition in case their age is challenged. Dancers must stay within one age group of their own respective age group when dancing in groups with dancers of other ages. 

Competition Levels: Dances are split into three categories based on difficulty level. These categories are beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Studio directors and choreographers decide which level a dance is placed in. If judges feel that a dancer is in the level, they may either disqualify the dance or bump it into its right category. 

General Divisions: Solo (1 performer), Duo/trio (2-3 performers), small group (4-9 performers), large group (10-19 performers), line (19-24 performers), and production (25 or more performers)

===Videography and photography===
The choreography of a dance routine—which is the design of movement and flow of steps in the routine—is copyrightable.&lt;ref name="VanCamp2007"&gt;{{cite web
  | last = Van Camp
  | first = Julie
  | title = Copyright of Choreographic Works
  | url = http://www.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/copyrigh.html
  | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, video recording is often prohibited at dance competitions in order to steer clear of copyright infringement issues. Some competition production companies employ professional videographers to capture and sell video recordings of competitive performances with the restriction that video recordings may only be sold to the subject performers or members of their studios, thus avoiding infringement. When no professional videographer is available, competition production companies will sometimes permit each attending dance school to designate a videographer to record performances of students from that school.

Unlike videography, still photography does not infringe copyrighted choreography.&lt;ref name="VanCamp2007"/&gt; Because of this, many competition production companies permit photography at their competitions. Virtually all competitions prohibit flash photography, however, both for the safety of performers and to prevent undesirable distractions. Some competition production companies employ professional photographers to capture and sell photographs of dance performances. In such cases, photography by audience members is typically prohibited so as to provide an exclusive market for the official photographers.

Prior to his work in publishing, Blake was an actor who costarred and guest starred on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Shield, Fastlane, and Joan of Arcadia among other shows. Short Films he produced and directed won awards at the San Diego Film Festival, Worldfest Houston, and the George Sidney Independent Film Competition. He starred in commercials for Mountain Dew, Mitsubishi, and American Express, among others. His appearance in “Coverage” for Yard Fitness earned producers a Belding, Bronze Lion, London International Advertising Award, and an Adforum Creative Hit Award; the commercial was featured on ABC’s “World’s Greatest Commercials.”

'''Cuarteto''' ({{lang-es|quartet}}), sometimes called '''cuartetazo''', is a musical genre born in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Argentina]].

The roots of the cuarteto ensemble are in [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] dance ensembles. The name was coined because the early dance-hall numbers were invariably four-piece bands ([[violin]]-[[piano]]-[[accordion]]-[[Double bass|bass]]).

Cuarteto is almost always upbeat; its rhythm range is similar to that of modern [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[merengue (music)|merengue]].

In the 1970s, cuarteto became one of the cornerstones of Córdoba's cultural identity&amp;mdash;together with ''Hortensia'' magazine. Both reflected a local brand of popular culture overlooked by the establishment, and proposed an alternative to the [[Buenos Aires]]-centered culture that television was spreading to the rest of the country.

Cuarteto was one of the genres that gave birth to the Buenos Aires ''tropical'' scene, which was renamed as ''[[bailanta]]'' in the 1990s following the usage of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes province]].

==Famous Names==

[[Cuarteto Leo]] was the leading cuarteto band for almost 30 years, back in the 1970s. It established the sonic texture that prevails in cuarteto to this day.

In the 1980s, [[La Mona Jiménez|Carlos ''Mona'' Jiménez]] became the foremost exponent of cuarteto after the break-up of his two-member ''Cuarteto de Oro'' ("Golden Quartet"). He established a pattern of nonsense humour and extravagant behavior that many tried to ape without much success. One of his most popular songs was ''Quién se ha tomado todo el vino'' ("Who drank all the wine?"), which was danced with a characteristic hand move.

Others, such as producer-bandleader ''Negro'' Videla, travelled to the Dominican Republic and [[Colombia]] to expand the range of their repertoire. Videla is the unofficial ambassador of Dominican music in cuarteto, with successful covers of merengue hits.

Since the late 1980s, the [[Tru-la-lá]] band has had great support from dancers. At one point they were endorsed by the [[Catholic]] church for avoiding racy themes in their lyrics. All in all, they have sold over a million records.

[[Rodrigo (musician)|Rodrigo]] became the leading cuarteto singer in the mid-1990s, and made inroads into Buenos Aires middle-class audiences. He died in a car crash on June 25, 2000. Many people believe the crash was not an accident, as Rodrigo was (allegedly) a pawn in a feud between rival mobsters. His song ''La mano de Dios'' (The Hand of God), which celebrates [[Diego Maradona]] through his [[Hand of God goal|most famous goal]], has become a classic dance song in Argentina, and was covered by Maradona himself in his successful 2005 talk show.

[[Gary (Argentine singer)]] was another Cuarteto singer with the [[Tru-la-lá]] band, who died of natural causes in 2001.

{{lang|es|[[Walter Olmos]] fue éxito desde 2000 hasta 2002, el publico lo denomino como el sucesor de [[Rodrigo (musician)|Rodrigo]], ya que Rodrigo había fallecido en el año 2000 y el fue el descubridor del joven Catamarqueño. Walter Olmos nació en San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca en el año 1981. Después del éxito, el 7 de septiembre de 2002 falleció. Se dio un tiro en la cabeza, las pericias de la policía indicaron que el cuartetero estaba drogado y alcoholizado.}}

{{As of|2012}}, some of the most popular cuarteto artists are:
*Carlos Rolan
*Carlitos "La Mona" Jiménez
*Chebere
*La Banda XXI
*La Barra
*La Fiesta
*Tru-la-la
*Sabroso
*La Banda de Carlitos

'''Da Lata''' (meaning "from the tin" in Portuguese) are a British group formed in 1994 by [[Chris Franck]] and [[Patrick Forge]]. They combine [[Afro-Brazilian]] influences with other strands from the melting pot of their native London. Franck and Forge previously worked together with the Brighton-based group [[Batu (group)|Batu]] before setting up Da Lata as a more studio based project.  Franck is the main creative force as songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist, whereas Forge, better known as a [[DJ]] and broadcaster, is credited as co-producer. They made three albums for [[Palm Pictures]]: ''Songs from the Tin''(2000) and ''Serious'' (2003) and a collection of their remix work for other artists, ''Remixes'' which featured their interpretations of songs by [[Femi Kuti]], [[Luciano]], [[Bebel Gilberto]] and [[Sly and Robbie]], among others. After a hiatus of several years, the pair started work on a new album in 2011. It was scheduled for release in early 2013.&lt;ref name="GU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dalata.bandcamp.com/album/going-underground-2-tracks|title=Going Underground (2 tracks)|work=[[Bandcamp]]|publisher=Da Lata|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

Da Lata's first release was as '''Trio Da Lata''' for Brownswood Records in Japan. The song "Deep Water" featured former [[Batu (group)|Batu]] vocalist Sharon Scott. However, it was their next release, a version of [[Edu Lobo]]'s classic "Ponteio" that garnered attention, crossing over between [[House music|house]] and jazz-dance audiences. "Ponteio" was supported particularly strongly in Japan and in New York by the Body&amp;Soul DJs. Despite the success of this single, Da Lata was put on hold for a few years whilst Chris Franck wrote, produced and toured with [[Smoke City]]. In 1998, they recorded a song that had been initially demoed four years earlier; it was on the strength of the song "Pra Manha" that they were signed to [[Chris Blackwell]]'s Palm Pictures.

==Albums==
===''Songs from the Tin''===

Released in 2000, Da Lata's first album enlisted help from London-based Brazilian vocalist Liliana Chachian, who previously featured on "Ponteio", and percussionist Oli Savill. Strongly influenced by classic [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] from the late sixties and seventies, ''Songs from the Tin'' also bears the influence of dance music, comparing Da Lata with [[Masters at Work|Nuyorican Soul]]. [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]'s online guide said:
 
{{quote|"Impeccably produced, weighty tracks that unroll like an evening at a great dance club, where the segue is just as important as the track itself, and the transportive aspects of the music -- swelling strings, whistling synths, cool solos, and incessant percussion". -- ''Aim for Ecstasy''}}

===''Serious''===

Parting company from Liliana Chachian and Oli Savill, Da Lata's second album took on other [[world music]] influences, particularly [[Afrobeat]], to present a more diverse sound, though the Brazilian influence remained strong. Featuring guest performances from [[Baaba Maal]], Jhelisa, Bembé Segué, and Brazilian accordionist Marcelo Jeneci, ''Serious'' "proves that Da Lata are one of the few capable of an intriguing, along-lasting dance/world fusion".&lt;ref name="Bush"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/serious-mw0000326505|title=Serious|last=Bush|first=John|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fabiola''===

After leaving Palm Pictures, Da Lata released tracks in Japan ("Ronco Da Cuica") and in the UK ("This Is Not Your Job"), both of which were updated for release on their follow-up album ''Fabiola''. A [[cover version]] of [[The Jam]]'s "[[Going Underground]]", with vocals by Floetic Lara, was released as a single in December 2012.&lt;ref name="GU" /&gt; The album ''Fabiola'' was released in October 2013 on Agogo Records.

'''Discovery''' (formerly '''Discovery Channel''') is an English speaking channel which targets the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], operated by [[Discovery Networks Western Europe]]. The channel's programming is based on programming produced by Discovery Networks Europe, [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel Canada]] and [[Discovery Channel]] from the United States.

==History==
It first became available in the UK on 1 April 1989 when Discovery Channel Europe launched. It was the first extension of the Discovery Channel outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.discovery.com/pdf/timeline/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101231547/http://corporate.discovery.com/pdf/timeline/ |archivedate=1 January 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1993, UK viewers could receive the channel from [[Intelsat]] satellites at 27.5° West. In July 1993, the Discovery Channel launched on the [[Astra 1C]] analogue satellite on the popular 19.2° East position where it used to broadcast only in the evening, starting at 4{{nbsp}}pm. On Astra, the daytime space was filled by [[CMT Europe]] until 1994, when [[Discovery Real Time|TLC]] (later on [[Discovery Real Time|Discovery Home &amp; Leisure]]) moved there. Eventually, Discovery Home &amp; Leisure would broadcast from the morning to 4{{nbsp}}pm when Discovery Channel took over and would broadcast for ten hours until 2{{nbsp}}am.

With the launch of [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky Digital]] in October 1998, Discovery Channel moved its start time to 8{{nbsp}}am, broadcasting for 18 hours per day. The time-shift channel, Discovery Channel +1, launched at the same time, as did several sister channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4797847-1.html |title=Discovery Maps Out Its Digital Bskyb Services |date=19 August 1998 |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogue broadcasts were terminated in 2001.

On 22 May 2006, [[Discovery HD]] was made available on Sky as part of the [[Sky+ HD]] launch line up. It was also made available on [[Virgin Media]]'s cable service on 1 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediacentre.virginmedia.com/Stories/Virgin-Media-customers-to-get-Discovery-HD-channel-and-more-HD-programmes-on-demand-17b.aspx|title=Virgin Media customers to get Discovery HD channel and more HD programmes on demand|publisher=Virgin Media|date=10 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412034845/http://mediacentre.virginmedia.com/Stories/Virgin-Media-customers-to-get-Discovery-HD-channel-and-more-HD-programmes-on-demand-17b.aspx|archivedate=12 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 30 June 2011 Discovery HD began to [[simulcast]] Discovery Channel in [[High-definition television|high-definition]] rather than use a separate schedule.

The channel briefly had a 90-minute timeshift, called Discovery Channel +1.5. It launched on 25 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theairwaves.net/index.php/channelnews/2914-discovery-launches-second-timeshirt-service|title=Discovery launches second timeshift service|publisher=The Airwaves|date=25 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724095309/http://www.theairwaves.net/index.php/channelnews/2914-discovery-launches-second-timeshirt-service|archivedate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was replaced by [[Discovery Science (European TV channel)|Discovery Science +1]] on 21 April 2008.

An Irish advertising feed was launched in 2010. Sky Media Ireland operates the channel's output in terms of advertising, sponsorship and scheduling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Carroll |first=Tristan |url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/news/971207/Discovery-appoints-Sky-Media-TV-ad-sales-Ireland/ |title=Discovery appoints Sky Media for TV ad sales in Ireland |publisher=Media Week |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Discovery Channel UK released its new look which places its emphasis on the D-globe logo. The project was created by DixonBaxi and Double G Studios.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theidentgallery.com/discovery-2011.php Discovery Channel UK – Current Idents (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theidentgallery.com/discovery-2011-misc-1.php Discovery Channel UK – Current Bumpers (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January 2017, Discovery UK announced that they were in a dispute over the fees paid by Sky for broadcast rights and for a time it seemed as though the channels could be removed from the platform after the end of that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/discovery-in-extraordinary-row-with-sky-2017-1|title=Discovery UK is threatening to switch off its channels on Sky in an extraordinary disagreement|newspaper=Business Insider|language=en|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an agreement was reached and programming continued uninterrupted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/01/31/discovery-sky-reach-eleventh-hour-deal-stop-eurosport-blackout/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2018, Discovery moved from 520 to 125 as [[Sky plc|Sky]] changed their channel list, as well as adding [[Netflix]] and [[Spotify]]. [[TLC (UK and Ireland)|TLC]] moved from 125 to 140. TLC +2 closed on 27 April 2018 to make way for Discovery Turbo +1.

"'''Double Helix'''" is an original music composition written for 17-piece [[jazz]] orchestra in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reallygoodmusic.com/rgm.jsp?page=itemDetail&amp;iid=123206|title=Really Good Music|website=Reallygoodmusic.com|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recording of "Double Helix" also goes by the title "Twice is Nice" (as a sound file)&lt;ref name="FIRST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstcom.com/#/en/search-results.aspx?searchtype=quick&amp;predictsearch=true&amp;keyword=twice+is+nice&amp;tracks_title=Track+Title|title=FirstCom Music - Online Production Music Library|website=Firstcom.com|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; when distributed worldwide as production music. The work has been used and heard around the world for music, media, and entertainment broadcasts.

==Background==
''Double Helix'' was first written in 1991 as a commission for the [[Southern California School Band and Orchestra Association|SCSBOA]] Honor Jazz Ensemble and premiered at [[Disneyland]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linahonmusic.com/ James Linahon] called Cooper in 1991 to commission a new work for the [http://www.scsboa.org/ SCSBOA] jazz group, Linahon would conduct them later that year.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1991 Jack Bullock (jazz editor for [[Alfred Music Publishing|Columbia Pictures Publications/Belwin]], (aka [[Alfred Music Publishing|CPP Belwin]] and currently [[Alfred Music Publishing|Belwin Jazz, a Division of Alred Music Publishing]]) hired [[Jack Cooper (musician)|Jack Cooper]] as a staff writer for new jazz ensemble works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfred.com/|title=Home|website=Alfred.com|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Bullock heard his writing done for the [[The Jazz Knights|U.S. Army ''Jazz Knights'']].&lt;ref&gt;CPP/Belwin composer [[:nl:Carl Strommen|Carl Strommen]] forwarded Cooper's demo tape to [http://www.alfred.com/Company/Authors/JackBullock.aspx Jack Bullock] after hearing the [[The Jazz Knights|U.S.M.A. ''Jazz Knights'']] perform while Cooper was with the group during that time.&lt;/ref&gt; The first piece Bullock decided to publish (and record) was ''Double Helix''.&lt;ref&gt;Review: BD Guide, November/December 1993, Village Press, Inc.  J. Richard Dunscomb (reviewer), rated: ''the very best'', page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was recorded at [[Omega Recording Studios]] in [[Rockville, Maryland]] for the 1993 [[Alfred Music Publishing|CPP/Belwin]] Jazz catalogue of new published works.&lt;ref&gt;1993 CPP/Belwin New Music Jazz Ensemble Catalogue, music for credits and opening track for demo, ''Double Helix''&lt;/ref&gt; Later In 1994, Canadian beverage giant [[Seagram]] bought a part of [[Time Warner]] and the [[Warner/Chappell Music|Warner Music Publishing division]] of that company acquired [[Alfred Music Publishing|CPP/Belwin]]. ''Double Helix'' was now distributed by [[Warner Brothers Music]] publications and the company made the move to allow [[FirstCom]]&lt;ref name=FIRST /&gt; and [[Universal Music Publishing Group|Universal Publishing Production Music]] to have access to a limited number of [[Alfred Music Publishing|CPP/Belwin]] sound files. The recordings from [[Omega Recording Studios|Omega Studios]] for [[Alfred Music Publishing|CPP/Belwin]] were of very high quality as well as the music itself that was being written and acquired for the catalogue.

While the original [[Alfred Music Publishing|CPP/Belwin]] sound file of ''Double Helix'' continues to be widely used in the media, the rights to the print music were acquired back by the composer in 2006. The print music division of [[Time Warner]] was [[Corporate spin-off|sold]] to [[Alfred Music Publishing]] in June 2005 which made a great deal of the older [[Alfred Music Publishing|CPP/Belwin]] print music catalogue obsolete. At that time it was best to move ''Double Helix'' (the print music) to a company who would keep the work in distribution for a much longer period; the print music is now distributed and sold by Really Good Music Publishing.

The music and sound file of ''Double Helix'' has been and is still frequently utilized for media production in [[television]] and [[radio]].&lt;ref name=DANISH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Double Helix'' is in repeated syndicated T.V. broadcasts around the world&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ASCAP]] distributions have far exceeded the original royalty payments made through sale of the print music by [[Alfred Music Publishing|CPP/Belwin]].

==Composition==
The work itself is 170 measures and based on a [[Blues#Form|Blues form]] in the key of ''f minor''. The smaller 12 measure sub-form repeats numerous times; the overall work mimicks a hybrid [[Sonata form]] with an [[Sonata form#Exposition|exposition/statement]], [[Musical development|development]] (with improvisation section), and [[Recapitulation (music)|recap]] (or [[Repetition (music)|restatement]]).

|"Aptly titled, this original work spirals its way into the world of contemporary big band swing music.  The voicing selections are superb.  It comes off sounding much more difficult than it sctually is...The driving into the head (section) set(s) up the soloist, who emerges with a roar from the full ensemble scoring...The shout chorus is memorable and, like the rest of the chart, it contains terrific dynamic contrasts."

==Premise==
''Friday Night Dinner'' depicts [[Shabbat dinner]] in the middle-class [[Jewish secularism|secular Jewish]] Goodman family, reflecting writer and producer Robert Popper's own secular Jewish upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/03/tamsin-greig-interview|title=Tamsin Greig: 'I always think I'll never work again'|first=Emine|last=Saner|work=The Guardian|date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in suburban North London, and filmed there, in [[Mill Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/953236/friday-night-dinner-cast-simon-bird-tom-rosenthal-tamsin-greig Friday Night Dinner stars Simon Bird and Tom Rosenthal talk returning to the show]&lt;/ref&gt; The family consists of father Martin ([[Paul Ritter (actor)|Paul Ritter]]), mother Jackie ([[Tamsin Greig]]), elder son and musician Adam ([[Simon Bird]]), and younger son and estate agent Jonny ([[Tom Rosenthal]]). The stories follow the family as they have their dinner, which is often interrupted by Adam and Jonny pranking each other and by their strange, lonely, friendless next-door neighbour Jim ([[Mark Heap]]), who is sexually attracted to Jackie and terrified of his own dog Wilson. Jackie's best friend, Val ([[Tracy-Ann Oberman]]), is also a frequent visitor, as well as Jackie's mother, Grandma Nelly ([[Frances Cuka]]).

There are strong elements of farce throughout.

'''GMA Network''' ('''Global Media Arts''' or simply '''GMA''') is a major national [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial broadcast]] [[Television network|television]] and [[radio network]] in the [[Television in the Philippines|Philippines]]. GMA Network is the flagship property of publicly traded [[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network Inc.]] Its first broadcast on television was on October 29, 1961, GMA Network (formerly known as '''RBS TV Channel 7''', '''GMA Radio-Television Arts''' then '''GMA Rainbow Satellite Network''') is commonly signified to as the "Kapuso Network" in reference to the outline of the company’s logo. It has also been called the “Christian Network” which refers to the apparent programming during the tenure of the new management, which took over in 1974. It is headquartered in the [[GMA Network Center]] in [[Quezon City]] and its transmitter, [[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]] is located at Tandang Sora Avenue, Barangay Culiat also in [[Quezon City]].&lt;ref name="gmanetwork.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com|title=GMANetwork.com - Online home of the Kapuso Network|author=GMA New Media, Inc.|work=gmanetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original meaning of the GMA acronym was '''[[Greater Manila Area]]''', referring to the initial coverage area of the station. As the network expanded it changed into '''Global Media Arts'''. Today, its flagship [[television station]] is [[DZBB-TV]] (GMA 7 Manila). The network has 3 originating stations and 49 relay stations nationwide. Its programming is also available outside the Philippines through [[GMA Pinoy TV]], [[GMA Life TV]] and [[GMA News TV International]].

==History==
===1950s and 1960s===
The origin of GMA Network can be traced back to Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. through [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]],&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/about GMA Network Corporate Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816053420/http://www.gmanetwork.com/about |date=August 16, 2008 }}, GMANetwork.com&lt;/ref&gt;  which started airing its radio broadcast on March 1, 1950, and officially launched as a local radio station in [[Manila]] on June 14, 1950 and owned by [[Robert Stewart (entrepreneur)|Robert La Rue “Uncle Bob” Stewart]], an American war correspondent.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;''GMA Gold: Fifty Years of Broadcast History'', Chelo Banal Formoso (ed.), GMA Network.&lt;/ref&gt; Venturing into television in the 1960s, Stewart started its television station through RBS TV Channel 7 in the [[DZBB-TV]] station on October 29, 1961, the Philippines' third terrestrial television station. Originally, RBS's programming is composed of foreign programs from the [[United States]] and it later produced local programs to cater to Filipino audiences. It produced shows like ''Uncle Bob’s Lucky Seven Club'', a child-oriented show aired every Saturdays; ''Dance Time with Chito''; and various news programs like ''[[News at Seven]]''. And in 1963, RBS launched its first provincial television station in Cebu, [[DYSS-TV|DYSS Channel 7]] (now GMA Cebu). In the same year, from Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc, the firm was formally renamed to Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. (RBS).&lt;ref name="gmanetwork.com"/&gt;

===1970s===
On September 21, 1972, then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared [[Martial Law|martial law]] by the virtue of [[Proclamation No. 1081|Proclamation 1081]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906446,00.html|title=THE PHILIPPINES: Marcos' Martial Law|date=2 October 1972|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcos, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties; closed down [[7th Congress of the Philippines|the Congress]] and media establishments including RBS. Military personnel occupied GMA Network compound and placed it under military control to prevent alleged communist propaganda. Media outlets including RBS that was critical to the Marcos administration were ordered to be closed. But in late-December 1972, RBS was allowed by the government to return on the air this time by its blocktime agreement with the [[National Media Production Center]] (NMPC), however with limited three-month permits. But due to limited licenses, difficulty in financial obligations, and disallowing foreign citizens and entities from owning and operating media companies in the Philippines, Stewart and the [[American Broadcasting Company]], who owned a quarter of the company, was forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a Malacañang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974 and the station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for [[Greater Manila Area]], the station's initial coverage area), though Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996. His wife Loring was the president when the takeover happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/corporate/about/overview|title=GMANetwork.com - Corporate - Official Corporate Website of the Kapuso Network|date=|website=|publisher=GMA Network, Inc.|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PinoyTV"&gt;''What's the story, Pinoy TV?'', Ellen Joy Anastacio and Janine Natalie Badiola, GMA Network.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gozon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2014/12/05/henry-gozon-s-near-death-experience|title=Henry Gozon’s near-death experience|author=''Tony Lopez''|publisher=''The Standard''|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaunched GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also (until 1980) had a [[circle 7 logo]] in use, in its final years the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities.

After that, Rod Reyes, the then-general manager of RBS recruited old-timers from ABS-CBN, including from the news department and entertainment programs. Through the acquisition, the station was able to broadcast in color with a [[PhP]]8 million credit line thru buying telecine machines and acquired foreign programs. Ratings were up from #5 to #3 that time.&lt;ref name="Gozon"/&gt;

===1980s===
When [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr.]], a senator who strongly opposed the Marcos administration, was assassinated on August 21, 1983, it was only a small item on television news. The iron grip that the Marcos administration had on television began to slip, as GMA broadcast the funeral, the only local station to do so.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt; In 1984, [[Imee Marcos]], daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, attempted to take over GMA.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PinoyTV" /&gt;  However, the takeover was prevented by GMA executives. Stewart left the Philippines for good as he was utterly disappointed with the Marcos move. GMA was also instrumental during the years preceding the [[1986 EDSA Revolution|People Power Revolution]]. The network was the first to air a television interview with [[Corazon Aquino]] via ''[[Viewpoint (Philippine TV series)|Viewpoint]]'' in 1984, and when she later announced that she would run for the presidency if she receives one million signatures.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;  In February 1986, the network was also the first to report that [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] broke away from the Marcos administration.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

When democracy in the Philippines was restored in the People Power Revolution in 1986, television stations began to air, some with their original owners. The political instability of the country also added to the station's burden, when soldiers stormed into the studios for two days in a part of coup attempt to topple then president, Corazon Aquino. In 1987, it became the first VHF television network in the country to provide a new dimension to viewers by broadcasting the network's programs in full stereo (dubbed as ''GMA StereoVision''), it opened its high-end live studio, the Broadway Centrum, boosting its local programming, and inaugurated its 777-foot ''[[Tower of Power (transmitter)|Tower of Power]]'' located along Tandang Sora, [[Quezon City]], the tallest man-made structure in the country on November 7, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m6EVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jQsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6031%2C1257960 Pres. Aquino switched GMA-7's 'Power Tower], Manila Standards, November 7, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
On March 20, 1992, Congress passed Republic Act No. 7252, otherwise known as “An Act Granting the Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. A Franchise to Construct, Install, Operate and Maintain Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations in the Philippines,” granting GMA a legislative franchise for the operation of radio and television broadcasting stations, in particular, “to construct, install, operate and maintain for commercial purposes and in the public interest, radio and television broadcasting stations in the Philippines with the corresponding auxiliary, special broadcast and other program and distribution services and relay stations, and to install radio communications facilities for private use in its broadcast services” for a term of 25 years.

Under Jimenez, Gozon and Executive Vice President Antonio C. Barreiro, international reach became GMA's target in the 1990s, which began when the ''Rainbow Satellite'' launched on April 26, 1992. Through its relay stations, GMA programs were seen across the archipelago and [[Southeast Asia]]. GMA programming started airing in 60 American cities and parts of [[South America]] through the ''International Channel Network''. GMA was the official broadcaster of the 1995 [[World Youth Day]], which was the last visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to the country. During the same year, two popular TV shows, ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' and ''[[Okey Ka Fairy Ko!]]'' began broadcasting on GMA after [[TAPE Inc.]] refused [[ABS-CBN]]'s proposal to buy the airing rights of the two shows. At the same time, GMA launched a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel subsidiary, [[DWDB-TV|Citynet 27]], several new shows (among them was [[Bubble Gang]] one of the longest-running shows on TV today), and the news program, ''[[Saksi]]'' with [[Mike Enriquez]], [[Mel Tiangco]] and [[Karen Davila]]. It also has the Asian adaptation of The 700 Club series as The 700 Club Asia which the Philippines is the only originating country in Asia.

In 1995, GMA founded its film production company, ''Cinemax Studios'' (later renamed  to [[GMA Films]] in 1998) with the film ''[[Run Barbi Run]]''. Its film ''[[José Rizal (film)|José Rizal]]'' released in 1998, which was at that time the most expensive movie production ever in the country (costing over 80 million pesos to produce), became a huge success with many accolades and award nominations.

On May 16, 1996, GMA formally changed its corporate name to ''GMA Network Incorporated'', with GMA now standing for ''Global Media Arts''. [[GoBingo]], initially aired in 1996, is an interactive game show hosted by [[Arnell Ignacio]], with Maricar de Mesa as the first ''GobiGirl''. In 1998, GMA pioneered on [[Filipino language]] late night news broadcast with the news program [[GMA Network News]] as the first Filipino-language late-night television newscast after it was debuted six years ago as an [[English language]] late-night newscast, as English newscasts were started since the introduction of television in the country in 1953. As the newscast fasten to higher than its English newscasts, all networks start to follow including [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]] in 1999, [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC 13]] in 1998, [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]] in 2000, [[People's Television Network|NBN 4]] in 2001 and [[The 5 Network|ABC 5]] in 2004.

GMA was the first Philippine broadcaster to receive a [[Peabody Award]] for Investigative Reporting in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/investigative-reporting 59th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Citynet 27 became EMC, the first locally programmed music video channel, later becoming a part of the [[Channel V|Channel [V]]] franchise called [[Channel V Philippines|Channel [V] Philippines]]. Channel [V] the Philippines, however, ceased operations due to a conflict of interest between the owners of GMA and [[PLDT]] (which bought a stake in GMA), who operate [[MTV Philippines]] through their subsidiary, the [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]]. GMA was also the Philippine broadcaster for ''[[2000 Today]]'', the most-successful international television special that commemorated the dawn of the new [[Millennium]]. At the turn of the millennium, GMA was the only local network to go on 24-hour, non-stop broadcasting (However, in 2001, the network reduced back to regular broadcast hours for its regular transmitter maintenance due to NTC's rules and regulations for affiliated free-to-air TV stations).

===Digital terrestrial television===
In February 2013, GMA Network admitted that it was conducting field tests of Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial (ISDB-T), the Japanese standard in digital television, but remained unconvinced saying European standard, second-generation Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T2), is superior to ISDB-T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology.inquirer.net/23271/gma-network-continues-to-reject-japanese-digital-tv-standard |title=GMA Network continues to reject Japanese digital TV standard &amp;#124; Inquirer Technology |publisher=Technology.inquirer.net |date=2013-02-22 |accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in October 2013, National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a draft memorandum circular adopting the Japanese standard as the sole standard in the delivery of digital terrestrial TV (DTT) services in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Amojelar |first=Darwin G. |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/business/72584/philippines-adopts-japan-standard-for-digital-tv |title=Philippines adopts Japan standard for digital TV |publisher=Interaksyon.com |date=2013-10-11 |accessdate=2016-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302091844/http://www.interaksyon.com/business/72584/philippines-adopts-japan-standard-for-digital-tv |archivedate=2016-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, GMA Network announced that it will be spending at least Php 2 to 3 billion for the rollout of its digital TV service and said the company plans to produce dongles, instead of set-top boxes for the rollout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/business/177533/gma-network-invests-p3b-for-shift-to-digital-tv.html |title=GMA Network invests P3b for shift to digital TV - The Standard |publisher=Manilastandardtoday.com |date=2015-05-17 |accessdate=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, GMA topped the digital TV test commissioned by mobile phone brand Starmobile and conducted by American market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) with GMA's presence in 10 out of 14 locations in Metro Manila.

Beginning September 2013, some of the programs of the network have been produced in [[high-definition television|high definition]] format in preparation for the ongoing digital shift in the country while keeping [[digital on-screen graphics]] in [[4:3]] safe zone for their TV broadcast since the network is still broadcasting in [[480i]]. The videos uploaded on their [[YouTube]] channel and third-party [[over-the-top content|OTT]] services on the other hand are presented in [[1080p]] format.

In December 2016, it was announced that the network will spend an initial amount of 416 million pesos for the commencement of the Digital Terrestrial Television transition project of GMA, which included the purchase of three high-powered transmitters capable for providing wider and clearer signal to digital television boxes, antennas and other connectivity requirements, and a fully mirrored head-end system, which is a master facility for grouping and digitally encoding programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/591391/money/companies/gma-network-to-spend-p416m-on-digital-terrestrial-tv|title=GMA Network to spend P416M on digital terrestrial TV|publisher=[[GMA News Online]]|date=December 6, 2016|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMA Network Chairman and CEO, Felipe Gozon, the network will conclude the test phase, and it is expected to begin the rollout of the DTTV project starting in [[Metro Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/154681-gma-network-dtt-project|title=GMA Network initially spends P416M on DTT shift|last=dela Paz|first=Cherisse|date=December 6, 2016|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for the shift to digital, [[GMA New Media]] is currently working on a DTV [[Set-top box]] (originally reported to be a DTV dongle) in order to compete with ABS-CBN's own [[ABS-CBN TV Plus | TV Plus box]]. A prototype was shown at the IMMAP DigiCon congress in 2016, and is shown to be running a version of [[Android (operating system) | Android]], double-acting as a streaming device capable of running apps and games.

==Branding of the GMA Network==

===Network identity===
On October 29, 1961, Loreto F. de Hemedes Inc. launches its first television station in the Philippines, known back then as [[DZBB-TV|RBS TV Channel 7]]. GMA Network began branding its identity by eliminating call signs to its network identification. 
:* '''RBS TV Channel 7 (1961-1974)'''—From the success of its amplitude modulation band radio [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]], [[Robert Stewart (entrepreneur)|Robert La Rue "Uncle Bob" Stewart]] launches its first television and the Philippines third terrestrial channel, RBS TV Channel 7.→
:* '''GMA Radio-Television Arts (1974-1992)'''—To ascertain its presence in its coverage area, the Greater Manila Area, RBS changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts after the takeover by the new management.
:* '''GMA Rainbow Satellite Network (Rainbow Network, 1992-1995)'''—When the network launched its satellite to widen its coverage area, GMA again rebranded its network identity on April 30, 1992.
:* '''GMA Network (Rainbow Network, 1995-2002)'''-In preparation for the 45th year of responsible broadcasting, GMA Rainbow Satellite changed to GMA Network.
:* '''GMA Network (Kapuso Network, 2002-Present)'''—On October 27, 2002, GMA Network unveiled its new identity and catchphrase. In an effort to localize and transform its image into a more intrinsic Filipino network, GMA Network engaged in a rebranding course.

===Logos===
GMA Network has used a number of logos throughout its history especially when Gozon, Jimenez, and Duavit acquired the station in 1975. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s, the network used the [[Circle 7 logo]], which is also expended by several networks around the world. In the 1980s, to refine its presence in the Philippine broadcast industry, GMA Network used the slogan ''Where You Belong'', and lasted for two decades before invigorating to another catchphrase. In 1992, GMA Network redefines itself as the '''Rainbow Network,''' succeeding the ensigns of the rainbow. Throughout the 1990s, the network developed the logo before having it replaced by its current logo in 2002 and as the '''Kapuso Network'''.&lt;ref name="gmanetwork.com"/&gt; After a huge marketing campaign, and improved television ratings, the new insignia (the rainbow-colored stylized heart-shape logo known as '''''Kapuso''''') is now one of the most recognizable in the Philippines.

===Slogans===
'''''Kapuso ng Bawat Pilipino''''' ('''''One in Heart with Every Filipino''''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/corporate/about|title=GMANetwork.com - Corporate - Official Corporate Website of the Kapuso Network|author=GMA New Media, Inc.|work=gmanetwork.com|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the secondary characteristic catchphrase of GMA Network. The slogan was initially used in conjunction with the rebranding of GMA Network as the '''“Kapuso Network”''' on October 27, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com/about/GMANetwork |title=404 |author=GMA New Media, Inc. |work=gmapinoytv.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711102122/http://www.gmapinoytv.com/about/GMANetwork |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But another slogan of the network '''''Kapuso, Anumang Kulay ng Buhay''''' ('''''One in Heart, in Every Colors of Life''''') is still used in other purposes and this is the official theme song title for the network. GMA Network’s news and public affairs department meanwhile uses the slogan ''Serbisyong Totoo'' (''True Service''). It is one of the longest running slogans used for news broadcast promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/5636/gma-news-and-public-affairs-seals-commitment-to-serbisyong-totoo-via-panata-sa-bayan|title=GMA News and Public Affairs seals commitment to Serbisyong Totoo via "Panata sa Bayan" - PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz|author=PEP.ph|date=25 February 2010|work=pep.ph|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/245276/panata-sa-bayan-reaffirms-serbisyong-totoo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825184343/http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/245276/panata-sa-bayan-reaffirms-serbisyong-totoo |archivedate=2012-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; GMA Network found itself on the other end of a battle concerning the slogan, when [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] uses similar catchphrase, and immediately discontinued in order to avoid legal predicament from GMA Network. In 2006, its news department also used an accompanying slogan, ''Just News,'' for its promotional campaign together with its news media partners, INQ7.Net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20061208-37156/Philippine_Daily_Inquirer,_GMA_Network_launch_'new_INQ7.net' |title=Philippine Daily Inquirer, GMA Network launch 'new INQ7.net' - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |work=inquirer.net |accessdate=3 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131175510/http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20061208-37156/Philippine_Daily_Inquirer%2C_GMA_Network_launch_%27new_INQ7.net%27 |archivedate=31 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
Programming competition started in 2004 when production of numerous GMA Network shows was up against its rival network, [[ABS-CBN]]. Reality show, ''[[Extra Challenge]]'' started to lead the ratings and with launch of "telefantasya" ''[[Mulawin]]''. On September 23, 2004, GMA Network gained leadership in Mega Manila against its closest competitor. In 2005, GMA Network began producing ''[[Mars Ravelo's Darna]]'', a classic Filipino comic book character which became a hit, with an overnight rating of 47.7 percent, the highest rating for a pilot episode and the first "telefantasya" to reach 52.1 percent ratings; followed by ''[[Encantadia]]'' at 47.2 percent and other prime-time "telefantasyas", ''[[Mulawin]]'' (2004) and ''[[Sugo]]'' (2005) contributed to GMA Network lead in Mega Manila. In 2006, GMA Network maintained its prime time supremacy by reformatting its reality-based program ''[[Extra Challenge]]'' and another "telefantasya" ''Encantadia'' (which was succeeded by ''[[Etheria]]'' and ''[[Encantadia: Pag-ibig Hanggang Wakas]]''), and the localized subtitled versions of Korean television series ''[[Stairway to Heaven (TV series)|Stairway to Heaven]]'', ''[[Full House (2004 TV series)|Full House]]'', ''[[Jewel in the Palace]]'' and ''[[My Lovely Sam Soon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/top/14938/Top-Asianovelas-since-the-year-2002 |title=Top Asianovelas since the year 2002 |publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal |author=Salanga, Elyas Isabelo |date=2008-01-16 |accessdate=2008-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221093804/http://www.pep.ph/top/14938/Top-Asianovelas-since-the-year-2002 |archivedate=2009-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, GMA Network started producing the local version of a Mexican television series ''[[Marimar (2007 TV series)|MariMar]]''. For its pilot episode, it got 52.6 percent overnight rating, making it the only soap opera to achieve the highest ratings in GMA Network’s history. In a 2006 survey conducted by [[Pulse Asia]], seven out of 10 Metro Manila-based viewers find GMA Network a more credible network than its competitor. GMA Network managed to lead in Mega Manila and Southern Luzon demographic, which has the highest concentration of television ownership and 79 percent of advertisement placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/oct/27/yehey/business/20061027bus7.html |title=ABS-CBN leads GMA 7 in viewership share |date=October 27, 2006 |publisher=The Manila Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024115516/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2006/oct/27/yehey/business/20061027bus7.html |archivedate=2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Urban Television Audience Measurement was officially launched on October 16, 2006, to determine the television ratings and the audience share of local TV programs from urban areas in the Philippines. This changes the broadcast industry landscape and the manner in which the advertisers allocate their TV investments to achieve cost efficiency and maximization. In August 2007 audience rating data shows GMA Network maintained its lead in Mega Manila, which resulted to a 23 percent growth in its consolidated net income to [[PhP]]1.13 billion in the first half of the year from [[PhP]]915 million in the same period last year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/15/BSNS20070815100336.html GMA Network posts [[PhP]]1.13-B net income in 1st half, up 23%] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022092419/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/08/15/BSNS20070815100336.html |date=October 22, 2007 }}, ''Manila Bulletin'', n.d.

==Controversies==

===Copyright infringement with ABS-CBN===
On July 22, 2004, during the arrival of Angelo de la Cruz at the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] (a truck driver who was held hostage and threatened with beheading in Iraq abducted by armed rebels west of Baghdad while trucking fuel from Saudi Arabia), live news coverage was aired on GMA Network and other local television stations in the Philippines. GMA Network used audio-video coverage through the facilities of [[Reuters]], which GMA Network subscribed to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anytimesnews.com/2010/11/18/ca-favors-gma-in-copyright-violation-case-filed-by-abs-cbn |title=CA-favors GMA in copyright violation case filed by ABS-CBN |work=anytimesnews.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707151048/http://www.anytimesnews.com/2010/11/18/ca-favors-gma-in-copyright-violation-case-filed-by-abs-cbn |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the said broadcast, a live feed from Reuters was simultaneously aired with its own live broadcast. During the first five-second of the live feed, GMA Network did notice that the live feed from Reuters was also airing at another local station, its main competitor [[ABS-CBN]]. The live video was restricted only to ABS-CBN and Reuters did not inform GMA Network that the video coverage was only intended for ABS-CBN. The local Court of Appeals junked the case filed by ABS-CBN Corporation against GMA Network Inc. for what was claimed to be illegal copying of its live video footage. In a ruling, the local fourth division of the appellate court set aside the resolution of the local Justice Department, which approved the filing of the violation of [[Philippine copyright law|Republic Act 8293]] (or the [[Philippine copyright law|Intellectual Property Code]]) against GMA Network. It ruled out that the act of GMA Network in airing the live video coverage was focused by good faith since there was no meaning to instigate damage to [[ABS-CBN Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malaya.com.ph/11232010/news18.html |title=Live Coverage  |accessdate=March 8, 2011}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local court also said GMA Network acted in good faith when it decided to instantaneously stop using the live video feed from Reuters upon learning ABS-CBN was also covering the said news event and its following exertion to authenticate the ABS-CBN Corporation restriction arrangement with the news service, Reuters. The local court also stressed that apart from lack of intent of GMA Network to affect the video from ABS-CBN, the action also cannot be reflected intrusion of Sections 212.4 and 185.1 of Republic Act 8293 since it was just a short excerpt compared with the totality of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/206354/ca-favors-gma-in-copyright-violation-case-filed-by-abs-cbn|title=CA favors GMA in copyright violation case filed by ABS-CBN|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gregorios Xenopoulos''' ({{lang-el|Γρηγόριος Ξενόπουλος}}; December 9, 1867 – 14 January 1951) was a novelist, journalist and writer of plays from [[Zakynthos]]. He was lead editor in the now-legendary magazine ''The Education of Children'' (Η Διάπλασις των Παίδων) during the period from 1896 to 1948, during which time he was also the magazine's main author. His was the trademark signature "Σας ασπάζομαι, Φαίδων"  ("yours faithfully, Phaedon)", which he used in letters ostensibly addressed to the magazine. He was also the founder and editor of the ''[[Nea Estia]]'' magazine, which is still published. He became a member of the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] in 1931, and founded the Society of Greek Writers (Εταιρεία Ελλήνων Λογοτεχνών) together with [[Kostis Palamas]], [[Angelos Sikelianos]] and [[Nikos Kazantzakis]].

==Life==
He was born on 9 December 1867 in [[Constantinople]]. His father, Dionysios, hailed from Zakynthos and his mother, Evlalia came from [[Constantinople]]. The family moved to Zakynthos soon after, where Gregorios spent his youth until 1883, when he enrolled in the [[University of Athens]] to study Physics and Mathematics. He never completed his studies: already in the first year, he had begun writing literature, which was his sole source of income at the time.

In 1892 he moved permanently to [[Athens]] and in 1894 he married Efrosini Diogenidis. They divorced one and a half year later, having already had a daughter. In 1901 he married his second spouse Christine Kanellopoulos, with whom they had two daughters.

He cooperated with several newspapers and magazines, in which he published a lot of studies, articles, short stories and novels. In 1894 he became director in the ''Illustrated Estia'' newspaper and in 1896 the chief editor of ''The Education of the Children''. From 1901 to 1912 he published literary works and studies in the ''Panathinaia'', and from 1912 he cooperated with ''[[Ethnos (newspaper)|Ethnos]]'' newspaper, writing serialized novels. In 1927 he founded the magazine ''Nea Estia'', whose director he was until 1934.

His house with his library was destroyed during the [[Dekemvriana]] clashes in Athens in 1944. He died in Athens on 14 January 1951 and was buried at public expense.

==Works==

===Prose===
Xenopoulos was a very notable writer. He wrote over 80 novels and stories. He first became known with his novel: "Ο Άνθρωπος του Κόσμου" (''O anthropos tou kosmou'', "Man of the world"). This [[New Athenian School]] novel and his next one, "Nikolas Sigalos" (1890), were not successful. He then was inspired by his birthplace Zakynthos, and as a result he wrote some of his best novels: "Magaret Stefa" (1893), Κόκκινος Βράχος (''Kokkinos Vrachos'', "Red Rock", 1905). These were followed by further novels in the New Athenian style: "Ο πόλεμος" (''O polemos'', "War", 1914) and "Οι Μυστικοί Αρραβώνες" (''I mystikoi aravones'', "The secret engagement", 1915) and the Ionian School novel "Laura" (1915), which was also one of his best. But his most ambitious work was the trilogy: "Πλούσιοι και φτωχοί" (''plousioi kai ftochoi'', "Rich and poor", 1919), "Τίμιοι και άτιμοι" (''Timioi kai atimoi'', "Honest and dishonest ones", 1921), "Τυχεροί και άτυχοι" (''Tycheroi kai atychoi'', "Lucky and unlucky ones", 1924). Other novels are: "Αναδυομένη" (''Anadyomeni'', 1923), "Ισαβέλλα" (''Isabella'', 1923), "Τερέζα Βάρμα-Δακόστα" (''Teresa Varma-Dakosta'', 1925).

He is the rapporteur of urban prose.

===Theatrical===
His first theatrical play was: "Ο ψυχοπατέρας" (''O Psychopateras'', "The stepfather"), and was presented in 1895. He cooperated with the "Nea Skini" theatrical troupe of [[Konstantinos Christomanos]]. His most famous theatrical plays are: "Το μυστικό της Κοντέσσας Βαλέραινας" (''To mystiko tis kontessas Valerainas'', "The secret of countess Valerena", 1904), "Στέλλα Βιολάντη" (''Stella Violanti, 1909, with [[Marika Kotopouli]]), "Φοιτηταί", (''Foititai'', "Students").

He wrote 46 different theatrical plays. In 1901 he was in the front line with [[Kostis Palamas]], in order to establish the theatre "Nea Skini" and because he was fluent in a lot of languages, he was aware of the several important spiritual events that took place in big European countries at that time. In addition, he wrote introductions for [[Henrik Ibsen]] and he was "living" the theatrical acts.

He made a lot of translations and his writing was of high standards. The first play that was performed in the Royal Theatre of Athens (renamed after renovation in 1932 as the [[National Theatre of Greece]]) was his: "Ο θείος Όνειρος" (''O theios Oneiros'', "Uncle Dream").

===Categories of works===
He wrote dramas and comedies with the common subject: love. His work is a window to contemporary Greek society. His works are categorized by the place that they were written, some in [[Zakynthos]] and the rest in Athens. His work tried to balance between the Ionian School and the New Athenian School.
* Zakynthian: "Stella Violanti", "Rachil", "Fotini Saranti", "O popolaros", "The secret of Contessa Valeriana".
* Athenian: "Foititai", "Psychosavvato", "To anthropino".

===Literary criticism===
Xenopoulos is notable for his literary criticism. In magazine "Panathinaia" ("Παναθήναια"), he published a lot of reviews on famous Greek writers, like [[Alexandros Papadiamantis]], [[Demetrius Vikelas]] etc. In 1903 he was the first to introduce [[Constantine P. Cavafy]] to the Athenian readership.

'''Hildegarde Withers''' is a fictional character who appeared in several novels and films. She was created by [[Stuart Palmer]].

==Character==
Miss Withers "whom the census enumerator had recently listed as 'spinster, born Boston, age thirty-nine, occupation school teacher'" becomes an amateur sleuth 
in the first book of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Stuart|title=The Penguin Pool Murder|year=2007|publisher=Rue Morgue Press|location=Lyons, Colorado|isbn=978-1-601-87013-1 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her adventures are usually comic but are nevertheless straightforward mysteries. She is a partial variation on [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[Miss Marple]].  "A lean, angular spinster lady, her unusual hats and the black cotton umbrella she carries are her trademark. ... Hildegarde collects tropical fish, abhors alcohol and tobacco, and appears to have an irritable disposition.  However, she is a romantic at heart and will extend herself to help young lovers."&lt;ref&gt;Penzler, Otto, ''et al.''  ''Detectionary''. Woodstock, New York: Overlook Press, 1977.  {{ISBN|0-87951-041-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She collaborates, and frequently butts heads, with [[Inspector]] Oscar Piper, a high-ranking homicide detective in the [[New York Police Department]].&lt;ref name= "palmer"&gt;{{cite news |last=Schantz |first=Tom &amp; Enid |url=http://www.ruemorguepress.com/authors/palmer.html |title=Stuart Palmer |work=Rue Morgue Press |date=|accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edna May Oliver]] starred in the first three screen adaptations, produced by [[RKO Radio Pictures]], and is considered by fans of the film series the definitive Miss Withers. When Oliver left RKO in 1935 to sign with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], RKO attempted to continue the series with [[Helen Broderick]] and then [[ZaSu Pitts]], but Oliver's presence was sorely missed and the films were poorly received. Author Palmer approved of Oliver's characterization so much that he gave the actress a mention in his Hollywood-based Withers novel ''The Puzzle of the Happy Hooligan''.

In 1972, [[CBS]] made a Withers [[television movie]] with [[Eve Arden]] as Withers and [[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]] as Piper.  The movie was well-received, but failed to produce any sequels.

[[File:Postduif.jpg|thumb|A homing pigeon on a house roof]]
The '''homing pigeon''' is a variety of [[domestic pigeon]] (''Columba livia domestica'') derived from the [[rock pigeon]], [[selective breeding|selectively bred]] for its ability to find its way home over extremely long distances. The wild rock pigeon has an innate homing ability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Blechman | first =Andrew | title =Pigeons-The fascinating saga of the world's most revered and reviled bird | publisher =University of Queensland Press | year =2007 | location =St Lucia, Queensland | url =http://andrewblechman.com/learn_more.html | isbn =978-0-7022-3641-9 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080112210043/http://www.andrewblechman.com/learn_more.html | archivedate =2008-01-12 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that it will generally return to its nest, (it is believed) using [[magnetoreception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levi |first=Wendell |title= The Pigeon | year= 1977 | page=82 | publisher= Levi Publishing Co, Inc|location= Sumter, S.C.|isbn=978-0-85390-013-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This made it relatively easy to breed from the birds that repeatedly found their way home over long distances. Flights as long as {{convert|1800|km|mi|abbr=in}} have been recorded by birds in competitive [[pigeon racing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Walcott | first =Charles | title =Pigeon Homing: Observations, Experiments and Confusions | journal =Journal of Experimental Biology | url =http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/199/1/21.pdf | format =Pdf article | accessdate =2008-01-04 |pmid=9317262 | year =1996 | volume =199 | issue =Pt 1 | pages =21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their average flying speed over moderate {{convert|640|km|mi|abbr=in}}  distances is around {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=in|order=flip}} but speeds of up to {{convert|90|mph|km/h|abbr=in|order=flip}} have been observed in top racers for short{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2016}} distances.

Because of this skill, homing pigeons were used to carry messages as '''messenger pigeons'''. They are usually referred to as "[[pigeon post]]" if used in post service, or "[[war pigeon]]" during wars.

Homing pigeons are often incorrectly categorized as [[English Carrier pigeon|carrier pigeons]], a breed of [[fancy pigeons]] selectively-bred for its distinctively rounded hard [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattle]].The purpose of using them was to send messages or mails

==Sexual dimorphism==
[[File:Homing Pigeon on path.JPG|thumb|A homing pigeon on a path outside]]
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
Male and female pigeons (cocks and hens, respectively) can be differentiated by physical characteristics of the head, beak, height, and breast, though visual identification of sex by physical characteristics alone can be inaccurate. Males usually stand taller, and have larger [[beaks]], [[Crop (anatomy)|crops]], [[Beak#Operculum|wattles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex by Charles Darwin | year=2008| location=Boston | isbn=9781605016429 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOuSeUsiFecC&amp;pg=PT567}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cere|eye ceres]] (fleshy growth around the eyes), as well as round heads and thicker napes. Females, on the other hand, tend to be shorter with smaller beaks, wattles, and ceres, as well as flatter heads and fuller breasts.

Male and female pigeons show different behaviours. The "coo" of males is louder and more insistent, especially when courting. Display behaviour also differs between the sexes. Most notably, a male often turns 360 degrees with an inflated crop and a loud "coo", to show interest in a female or to defend or discourage another pigeon from entering its territory (usually a nesting box), while females almost never turn full circle, but rather do a 270-degree back-and-forth rotational motion.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Reproduction==
[[File:Squabs.jpg|thumb|One-day old squabs]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}During breeding season, usually during the warmer months, a male pigeon will court the female by puffing out his chest, bobbing his head and strutting in circles around her, all the while cooing his affections. If she accepts, she will allow him onto her back in order to copulate. After [[mating]], the male will build a nest out of gathered sticks in a suitable crevice, while the female watches and makes changes. Urban birds will gladly use a roof on a building. The female will usually lay two eggs. The first egg would be laid late in the evening, and the other egg forty hours after, which will hatch in 17 to 20 days, depending on the weather. Both parents aid in rearing the nestlings. Fledglings usually leave the nest around four to five weeks after hatching.

==History==
[[File:Great Barrier Island Pigeon-Gram stamp 1899.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Stamp for early Pigeon-Gram service]]
The sport of flying homing pigeons was well-established as early as 3000 years ago.&lt;ref name=PSM36-6&gt;{{cite journal |last=Teale |first=Edwin |title=Mile-a-Minute Pigeons |journal=Popular Science Monthly |date=June 1936 |volume=128 |issue=6 |pages=25ff }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used to proclaim the winner of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Ancient Olympics]].&lt;ref name=PSM36-6/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blechman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blechman |first=Andrew |title=Pigeons — The fascinating saga of the world's most revered and reviled bird |publisher=University of Queensland Press |year=2007 |location=[[St Lucia, Queensland]] |url=http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/book_details.php?isbn=9780702236419 |isbn=978-0-7022-3641-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Messenger pigeons were used as early as 1150 in [[Baghdad]]&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fbipigeons.com/THE%20SPORT.htm |title=The Sport of Racing Homing Pigeons |website=fbipigeons.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also later by [[Genghis Khan]]. By 1167 a regular service between Baghdad and Syria had been established by Sultan [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]].&lt;ref name="Allatt 1886"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allatt |first=Captain H.T.W. |title=The Use of Pigeons as Messengers in War and the Military Pigeon Systems of Europe |journal=[[RUSI Journal]] |year=1886 |volume=30 |pages=107–148 [111] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8tMAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=24 November 2012 |doi=10.1080/03071848609416366 |issue=133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Damietta]], by the mouth of the Nile, the Spanish traveller [[Pedro Tafur]] saw carrier pigeons for the first time, in 1436, though he imagined that the birds made round trips, out and back.&lt;ref&gt;"I saw there for the first time carrier pigeons, which take letters in their tail-feathers. They carry them from the place where they are bred to other places, and when the letters are detached they are set free and return to their homes. By this means the inhabitants have speedy news of all who come and go by sea or land." (Pedro Tafur, ''[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch8 Andanças e viajes]'').&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of Genoa]] equipped their system of watch towers in the Mediterranean Sea with pigeon posts. [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] (1750–1799) also used homing pigeons; they returned to the Jamia Masjid mosque in [[Srirangapatna]], which was his headquarters. The pigeon holes may be seen in the mosque's minarets to this day.

In 1818, a great pigeon race called the ''Cannonball Run'' took place at [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name=PSM36-6/&gt; In 1860, [[Paul Reuter]], who later founded [[Reuters]] press agency, used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and [[Aachen]], the terminus of early telegraph lines. The outcome of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] was also first delivered by a pigeon to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thenewsfromwaterloo.com/pigeon-post.html |title=Challenging the myth |accessdate=2017-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] pigeons were used to carry mail between besieged Paris and the French unoccupied territory. In December 1870, it took ten hours for a pigeon carrying [[microfilm]]s to fly from [[Perpignan]] to [[Bruxelles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vieuxpapierspo.blogspot.fr/2014/05/perpignan-bruxelles-par-pigeon-express.html |title=Perpignan–Bruxelles par pigeon-express |last1=Cardenas |first1=Fabricio |date=4 May 2014 |website=Vieux papiers des Pyrénées-Orientales |language=fr |accessdate=24 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, pigeons carried messages only one way, to their home. They had to be transported manually before another flight. However, by placing their food at one location and their home at another location, pigeons have been trained to fly back and forth up to twice a day reliably, covering round-trip flights up to 160&amp;nbsp;km (100&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref name="Micro Live Stock"&gt;{{cite book |last=National Research Council |title= Micro Livestock — Little Known Small Animals With a Promising Economic Future |year=1991 |publisher=Natl Academy Pr |location=[[Sumter, South Carolina]] |isbn=978-0-309-04437-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7P3DHeYUxhsC }}{{cite web |url=http://diglib.auburn.edu/gsdl/cgi-bin/library?e=d-000-00---0demo--00-0-0--0prompt-10---4------0-1l--1-en-50---20-about---00031-001-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;cl=CL2.1&amp;d=HASHba5213b5f3493e1ca5e721.5.6&amp;gc=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413053800/http://diglib.auburn.edu/gsdl/cgi-bin/library?e=d-000-00---0demo--00-0-0--0prompt-10---4------0-1l--1-en-50---20-about---00031-001-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;cl=CL2.1&amp;d=HASHba5213b5f3493e1ca5e721.5.6&amp;gc=1 |archivedate=2016-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their reliability has lent itself to occasional use on mail routes, such as the [[Pigeon post#Pigeon Post of Great Barrier Island (New Zealand)|Great Barrier Pigeongram Service]] established between the [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], suburb of [[Newton, New Zealand|Newton]] and [[Great Barrier Island]] in November 1897,&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1936/04/12/archives/carrier-pigeons-still-serve-even-in-modern-war-they-do-messenger.html |title=Carrier pigeons still serve; Even in modern war they do messenger duty |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 12, 1936 |page=SM26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly the first regular air mail service in the world.

Homing pigeons were still employed in the 21st century by certain remote police departments in [[Odisha]] state in eastern [[India]] to provide emergency communication services following [[natural disaster]]s. In March 2002, it was announced that India's Police Pigeon Service messenger system in Odisha was to be retired, due to the expanded use of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1892085.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Indian pigeons lose out to e-mail |date=2002-03-26 |accessdate=2010-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taliban]] banned the keeping or use of homing pigeons in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Some of the restrictions imposed by Taliban on women in Afghanistan |publisher=Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan |url=http://www.rawa.org/rules.htm |accessdate=2008-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day, pigeons are entered into competitions, with the winner receiving prize money at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pigeonmad.com/beginners_guide_to_racing_pigeons.php |title=Beginners' Guide to Racing Pigeons |website=Pigeon Mad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navigation==
{{main|Animal navigation}}

Research has been performed with the intention of discovering how pigeons, after being transported, can find their way back from distant places they have never visited before. Most researchers believe that homing ability is based on a "map and compass" model, with the compass feature allowing birds to orient and the map feature allowing birds to determine their location relative to a goal site (home loft).&lt;ref name="vern"&gt;Bingman, V. P. (1998). Spatial representations and homing pigeon navigation. In S. Healy (Ed). ''Spatial representation in animals''. (pp. 67–85). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While the compass mechanism appears to rely on the sun, the map mechanism has been highly debated.&lt;ref name="Walllraff"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallraff | first1 = H.G. | year = 2004 | title = Avian olfactory navigation: its empirical foundation and conceptual state | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 189–204 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.06.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers believe that the map mechanism relies on the ability of birds to detect the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Birds can detect a magnetic field to help them find their way home. Scientists{{Who|date=January 2016}} have found that on top of a pigeon's beak large number of [[iron]] particles are found which remain aligned to north like a man-made [[compass]], thus it acts as compass which helps pigeon in determining its home. A light-mediated mechanism that involves the eyes and is lateralized has been examined somewhat, but developments have implicated the trigeminal nerve in [[magnetoception]].&lt;ref name="wild"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mora | first1 = C. V. | last2 = Davison | first2 = M. | last3 = Wild | first3 = J. M. | last4 = Walker | first4 = M.

Near their home lofts, in areas they have previously visited, pigeons probably are guided by visual landmarks.

Research by Jon Hagstrum of the US Geological Survey suggests that homing pigeons use low-frequency [[infrasound]] to navigate.&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;Knight, Kathryn (2013). Disappearing homing pigeon mystery solved. The Company of Biologists. Retrieved 2013-01-31&lt;/ref&gt; Sound waves as low 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz have been observed to disrupt or redirect pigeon navigation. The pigeon ear, being far too small to interpret such a long wave, directs pigeons to fly in a circle when first taking air, in order to mentally map such long infrasound waves.

Various experiments suggest that different breeds of homing pigeons rely on different cues to different extents. Charles Walcott at Cornell University was able to demonstrate that while pigeons from one loft were confused by a magnetic anomaly in the Earth it had no effect on birds from another loft {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=in|order=flip}} away. Other experiments have shown that altering the perceived time of day with artificial lighting or using air conditioning to eliminate odors in the pigeons' home roost affected the pigeons' ability to return home.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Some research also indicates that homing pigeons navigate by following roads and other man-made features, making 90-degree turns and following habitual routes, much the same way that humans navigate.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news| title =Pigeons reveal map reading secret| publisher =BBC News (5 Feb, 2004) | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3460977.stm | accessdate =2008-07-02 | date=2004-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GPS tracing studies also indicate that gravitational anomalies also play a role.

==Roles==

===As postal carriers===
{{Main|Pigeon post}}

When used as carrier pigeons in [[pigeon post]] a message is written on thin light paper and rolled into a small tube attached to the bird's leg. Pigeons can only go back to one "mentally marked" point that they have identified as their home, so "pigeon mail" can only work when the sender is actually holding the receiver's pigeons. White homing pigeons are used in [[release dove|dove-releasing]] ceremonies at weddings, funerals, and some sporting events.

With training, pigeons can carry up to 75&amp;nbsp;g (2.5&amp;nbsp;oz) on their backs. The German apothecary [[Julius Neubronner]] used carrier pigeons to deliver urgent medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ref=CITEREFLes Nouveautés Photographiques1910|title=Le pigeon voyageur photographe|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k54904907.image.r=Neubronner.f70.vignettesnaviguer.langEN|year=1910|journal=Les Nouveautés Photographiques|pages=63–71|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 a similar carrier pigeon service was set up for the transport of laboratory specimens between two English hospitals. Every morning a basket with pigeons was taken from Plymouth General Hospital to Devonport Hospital. The birds then delivered unbreakable vials back to Plymouth as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19770723&amp;id=Y9MVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5xEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3259,4076496 Pigeons flying for life], ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'' – July 23, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The 30 carrier pigeons became unnecessary in 1983 because of the closure of one of the hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1106&amp;context=icwdmprobe |title=The Probe: Newsletter of the National Animal Damage Control Association, Issue 33 – June 1983 |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s a similar system existed between two French hospitals located in Granville and Avranche.&lt;ref&gt;{{url|https://web.archive.org/web/20120311215220/http://www.abc.terre.defense.gouv.fr/sites/abc.terre.defense.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/carabinier_15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During war===
{{main|War pigeon}}
[[File:Bus pigeon loft.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A B-type bus from London converted into a pigeon loft for use in northern France and Belgium during the First World War]]

Birds were used extensively during [[World War I]]. One homing pigeon, [[Cher Ami]], was awarded the French [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de guerre]] for her heroic service in delivering 12 important messages, despite having been very badly injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Webley|first1=Kayla|title=Top 10 Heroic Animals|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2059858_2059863_2060209,00.html|accessdate=17 January 2017|agency=Time Magazine|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avro Lancaster pigeons WWII IWM TR 193.jpg|thumb|left|Crewman with homing pigeons carried in bombers as a means of communications in the event of a crash, ditching, or radio failure]]

During World War II, the Irish [[Paddy (pigeon)|Paddy]], the American [[G.I. Joe (pigeon)|G.I. Joe]] and the English [[Mary of Exeter]] all received the [[Dickin Medal]]. They were among 32 pigeons to receive this award, for their gallantry and bravery in saving human lives with their actions. Eighty-two homing pigeons were dropped into the [[Netherlands]] with the First Airborne Division Signals as part of [[Operation Market Garden]] in [[World War II]]. The pigeons' loft was located in London, which would have required them to fly {{convert|240|mi|km|abbr=in|order=flip}} to deliver their messages.&lt;ref name=bridge&gt;[[Cornelius Ryan]] - ''[[A Bridge Too Far (book)|A Bridge Too Far]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Also in World War II, hundreds of homing pigeons with the [[Source Columba|Confidential Pigeon Service]] were airdropped into northwest Europe to serve as intelligence vectors for local resistance agents. Birds played a vital part in the [[Normandy Landings|Invasion of Normandy]] as radios could not be used for fear of vital information being intercepted by the enemy.

===In computing===
The humorous [[IP over Avian Carriers]] (RFC 1149) is an [[Internet]] protocol for the transmission of messages via homing pigeon. Originally intended as an [[April Fools' Day RFC]] entry, this protocol was implemented and used, once, to transmit a message in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], on April 28, 2001.&lt;ref name=bergen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/|title=RFC-1149|website=BLUG|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004221306/http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/|archivedate=2011-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, a [[South Africa]]n IT company based in [[Durban]] pitted an 11-month-old bird armed with a data packed 4&amp;nbsp;GB memory stick against the [[ADSL]] service from the country's biggest Internet service provider, [[Telkom SA|Telkom]]. The pigeon, Winston, took an hour and eight minutes to carry the data {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=in}}. In all, the data transfer took two hours, six minutes, and fifty-seven seconds—the same amount of time it took to transfer 4% of the data over the ADSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Pigeon transfers data faster than South Africa's Telkom| publisher =Reuters (September 9, 2009)| url =https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSTRE5885PM20090909 | accessdate =2009-10-09 | first=Peroshni | last=Govender | date=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =SA pigeon 'faster than broadband'| publisher =BBC (September 10, 2009)| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8248056.stm | accessdate =2009-10-09 | date=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smuggling===
Homing pigeons have been reported to be used as a smuggling technique, getting objects and narcotics across borders and into prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/cocaine-smuggling-carrier-pigeons|title=Cocaine carrier pigeons are the latest drug smuggling technique|last=Quilty-Harper|first=Conrad|work=British GQ|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, between 2009 and 2015, pigeons have been reported to carry [[cell phones]], [[SIM cards]], phone [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[USB]] cords into prisons in the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=G1 São Paulo |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/SaoPaulo/0,,MUL1101091-5605,00-POMBO+QUE+LEVAVA+CELULAR+PARA+PRESOS+E+CAPTURADO+NO+INTERIOR+DE+SP.html |title=Pombo que levava celular para presos é capturado no interior de SP (Portuguese) |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=G1 |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=G1 São Paulo |url=http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2015/08/pombo-com-celular-e-encontrado-em-penitenciaria-na-zona-sul-de-sp.html |title=Pombo com celular é encontrado em penitenciária na Zona Sul de SP (Portuguese) |date=August 4, 2015 |publisher=G1 |accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1983 Kirstein chaired the International Collaboration Board, which involved six NATO countries,  served on the Networking Panel of the [[NATO]] Science Committee (serving as chair in 2001), and on Advisory Committees for the Australian Research Council, the Canadian Department of Communications, the German GMD, and the Indian Education and Research Network (ERNET) Project.

'''Internet science''' is an interdisciplinary science, which looks at all aspects of the co-evolution in the Internet networks and society and studies it. It works in the intersection of and in the gaps among a wide range of disciplines that have had to respond to the impact of the Internet on their 'home turf' and/or offer specific conceptual or methodological contributions. These include many [[natural science]]s (e.g. complexity science, [[computer science]], [[engineering]], [[Life Sciences|life sciences]], mathematics, physics, psychology, statistics, systems and [[evolutionary biology]]), [[social science]]s (e.g. anthropology, economics, philosophy, sociology, and political science), [[humanities]]  (e.g. art, history, linguistics, literature and history) and some existing interdisciplines that cross traditional Faculty boundaries (e.g. technology, medicine, law). Professor [[Noshir Contractor]] and others have located it at the intersection of [[computational social science]],&lt;ref&gt;Lazer, D.; Pentland, A.; Adamic, L.; Aral, S.; Barabasi, A. -L.; Brewer, D.; Christakis, N.; Contractor, N.; Fowler, J.; Gutmann, M.; Jebara, T.; King, G.; Macy, M.; Roy, D.; Van Alstyne, M. (2009). "SOCIAL SCIENCE: Computational Social Science". Science 323 (5915): 721–723&lt;/ref&gt; [[network science]], [[Computer network|network engineering]] and [[Web science]]. By understanding the role of society in shaping Internet networks and being shaped by them Internet science aims to take care of the Internet in a way similar to that in which Web science aims to take care of the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Network Science, Web Science and Internet Science: comparing interdisciplinary areas  - ePrints Soton|url = http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/376676/|website = eprints.soton.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lingua franca in this interdisciplinary area include Internet standards and associated implementation, social processes, Internet infrastructure and policy.

There are a lot of disciplines, which support 'Internet science' using different analysis tools, designs and languages. In order to have a productive and effective dialogue between disciplines, network will have to know the incentives to make cooperation opportunities. There are three main elements of Internet science: Multidisciplinary convergence, [[Observability]] and Constructive experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.internet-science.eu/network-excellence-internet-science|title = The Network of Excellence In Internet Science|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission funded a Network of Excellence on Internet Science (project acronym [http://www.internet-science.eu/ EINS]) over the period December 2011-May 2015 under the FP7 funding programme. The Network in May 2015 had 48 member universities and research organisations and 180 individual affiliate researchers. Two major international Internet science conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Internet Science Conference 2015 - 27-29 May, Brussels|url = http://internetscienceconference.eu|website = 2nd Internet Science Conference|accessdate = 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were held in April 2013 and May 2015 together with an [[unconference]] at the [[University of Bologna#Affiliates and other institutions|University of Bologna]] in May 2014 and official workshops at international academic conferences such as [[Evolutionary psychology#Academic societies|Human Behavior and the Evolution of Society]] and international inter-governmental and multistakeholder conferences such as the 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = From Mantra to Metrics: Measuring Multi-Stakeholderism (JRA4/JRA6/SEA2 workshop) Technical standards, law-making, and other governance instruments and metrics for a measurable impact of multi-stakeholderism {{!}} Network of Excellence in InterNet Science (EINS)|url = http://www.internet-science.eu/igf-workshop-2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Nations [[Internet Governance Forum]].

==Research==
Significant areas of current Internet science research include:

===Net neutrality===

[[Net neutrality]] is the rule where Internet service providers should treat all the traffic on their networks equally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://vpnreviews.online/what-does-net-neutrality-mean/ |title= What Does Net Neutrality Mean?|accessdate= October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This means that companies should not slow down access or block any website content on the [[World Wide Web|Web]]. In the United States, high-speed Internet service providers (ISPs), including AT&amp;T, Comcast, Time Warner and Verizon, have sought support for a two-tiered Internet service model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/Net-neutrality|title = Net neutrality definition|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, President Obama announced a new plan to preserve "net neutrality" and to prevent Internet service providers from blocking or slowing websites or creating different tiers of speed. He said-, "No service should be stuck in a ‘slow lane’ because it does not pay a fee," he wrote in a statement. "That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet’s growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/internet/net-neutrality-debate-underlying-dynamics-research-perspectives|title = The net neutrality debate and underlying dynamics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet privacy===

[[Internet privacy]] (online privacy) is an opportunity of individuals to regulate the flow of information and have access to data, which is generated during a browsing session. Moreover, internet privacy may include some risks, like [[phishing]], [[pharming]], [[spyware]] and [[malware]].

===Sustainability===

The fact is that [[Google Search|Google]] has signed two contracts with wind developers to power its data center in Finland with 100% renewable energy.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/internet-sustainability-renewable-power|title = The internet can be a force for sustainability if powered by renewables|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook's decision was to build a data center in Iowa and has helped to drive the local energy provider in order to scrap plans to build a nuclear power plant, and instead build a $2bn(£1.23bn) wind farm, which has led to the biggest single order of wind turbines on record.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Internet as a socio-technical critical infrastructure===

Infrastructure provides a large range of vital services, for example an ability to move goods, people and information. Also it provides a range of vital services such as the ability to move goods, people, and information safely. It is necessary to support social life and nation's economic because it is essential that such infrastructural services continue in the face of various hazards.&lt;ref name="internet-science.eu"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.internet-science.eu/internet-critical-infrastructure|title = The Internet as Critical Infrastructure|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It concerns of the idea that infrastructural services gas, electricity, water, transport, banking are highly interconnected and mutually dependent in various complex ways,&lt;ref name="internet-science.eu"/&gt; being linked both physically and through important ICT systems, in order to breakdowns quickly escalate into whole infrastructure failure.

An initial listing of datasets, analytic tools and [[e-Infrastructures]] is available in a dedicated [http://evidence.internet-science.eu Internet science evidence base].There is ongoing activity on the development of Internet Science curricula,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deliverable 10.3: Description of Internet Science Curriculum {{!}} Network of Excellence in InterNet Science (EINS)|url = http://www.internet-science.eu/publication/934|website = www.internet-science.eu|accessdate = 2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially on a postgraduate level.

A '''sports rivalry''' is intense competition between athletic teams or athletes, but not directly related to the formal sport and the practice thereof. This pressure of competition is felt by players, coaches, and management, but is perhaps felt strongest by the [[fan (aficionado)|fan]]s. The intensity of the rivalry varies from a friendly competition on one end to serious violence on the other that, in one case (the [[Football War]]), was suggested to have led to military conflicts. Owners typically encourage rivalries as they tend to improve game attendance and [[Audience measurement|television ratings]] for rivalry matches, but a rivalry that gets out of control can lead to [[violence in sports|fighting]], [[football hooliganism|hooliganism]], [[riot]]ing and some, with career-ending or even fatal consequences. Clubs can reduce fan aggression surrounding rivalry games by acknowledging rather than downplaying the conflict&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16184742.2018.1424226?journalCode=resm20|title=Rivalry and Fan Aggression|last=European Sport Management Quarterly|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the rivalry is an integral part of fan identity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Enemies With Benefits|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16184742.2016.1188842|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Rivalries stem from various sources. Simple geographic proximity as well as frequent meetings in important games can lead to rivalries. Games between two rivals of close geographical proximity are usually called a '''local derby''', or simply just '''derby''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|'|d|ɑr|b|i}} {{respell|DAR|bee}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|d|ɜr|b|i}} {{respell|DUR|bee}}); a sporting fixture between two teams from the same town, city or region, particularly in [[association football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/08/sports/soccer/derby-days.html|title=When a City Stops for Soccer|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=8 May 2015|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase most likely originated from [[Derby (horse race)|The Derby]], a horse race in England, founded by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby|12th Earl of Derby]] in 1780. The 19th Earl has since confirmed the Derby name was given to only two sporting events: the Rugby league game from either end of the family's Knowsley estate between St Helens and Wigan being the other. Since at least as early as 1840 'derby' has been used as a noun in English to denote any kind of sporting contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of derby|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/derby|publisher=Collins dictionary|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible origin of the term is that the town of [[Derby]] was renowned as the site of a chaotic and exuberant game that involved the whole town and often resulted in fatalities. The goals were at Nuns Mill in the north and the Gallows Balk in the south of the town, and much of the action took place in the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] or the [[Markeaton Brook]]. Nominally the players came from All Saints' and St Peter's parishes, but in practice the game was a [[Wiktionary:free-for-all|free-for-all]] with as many as 1,000 players. A Frenchman who observed the match in 1829 wrote in horror, 'if Englishmen call this play, it would be impossible to say what they call fighting'. The traditional [[Royal Shrovetide Football|Shrovetide football match]] is still an annual event in the town of [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/City-s-Shrovetide-match-birth-local-derby-phrase/story-17187254-detail/story.html#axzz2ddonmh62|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130901121515/http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/City-s-Shrovetide-match-birth-local-derby-phrase/story-17187254-detail/story.html%23axzz2ddonmh62#axzz2ddonmh62|dead-url=yes|title=City's Shrovetide match give birth to 'local derby' phrase|work=Derby Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the term '''crosstown rivalry''' is more commonly encountered for this type of rivalry.

'''Madge Bertha Weinstein'''  is a [[fictional]] Internet personality who maintains '''''Yeast Radio''''', which has developed a [[cult following]] and was among the 50 most-subscribed-to podcasts in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= USA Today| title=Radio to MP3 degree: podcasting|   url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2005-02-09-podcasting-usat-money-cover_x.htm| accessdate=2007-06-15 | date=2005-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein is the creation and alter ego of underground filmmaker [[Richard Bluestein]] and was described by [[USA Today]] as "representative of the type of over-the-top content that would never see the light of day at a mainstream media outlet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= USA Today| title=Radio to MP3 degree: podcasting|   url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2005-02-09-podcasting-usat-money-cover_x.htm| accessdate=2007-06-15 | date=2005-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Weinstein is a fictional character (and never admitted as such), the majority of opinions, social-political commentary and oblique characteristics of her personality are clearly reflective of Bluestein's own. In essence, Weinstein is both an extension and distortion of Bluestein's actual personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Richard Bluestein| year= 2006| title=Yeast 2: My response to Adam's response to Madge's rant| url=http://yeast2.com/?p=119| accessdate=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character history==
Weinstein is an outspoken [[breast cancer]] survivor and opinionated [[Jewish]] [[lesbian]] activist. She is a [[Vassar College]] graduate, a "woman of Luna" and claims to be a co-founder of the [[Lilith Fair]]. She was also the band manager of the now disbanded [[riot grrrl]] rock group, 'Goddess Riot Juice'. She is the self-professed "[[Margaret Mead]] of podcasting" as she is an amateur [[cultural anthropologist]] who, in her free time, studies the sordid sexual activities of [[homosexual]] men. She is well known for her advocacy on a variety of women's issues including her long tenure as a spokeswoman on behalf of women suffering from [[Candidiasis|vaginal yeast]]. Weinstein also suffers from [[food allergies]] and [[fibromyalgia]].

Weinstein is the daughter of Irving Weinstein, a funeral director and owner of Weinstein &amp; Schlump Funeral Homes. She grew up in the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] in the borough of the [[Bronx]] in [[New York City]]. She is the former lover of [[Ethel Merman]] (although she tends to exaggerate the details of their now infamous 1967 tryst during Ethel's daughter's funeral) and has had affairs with [[Martina Navratilova]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Melissa Etheridge]] and [[Rosie O'Donnell]]. In her youth, she claims to have performed [[oral sex]] on [[Nancy Reagan]] which she now regrets. Weinstein's most notable lesbian relationship was with Gussie Iscowicz (the alter ego of Bluestein's late partner Juan Montealegre), an elderly hairdresser living in [[Miami, Florida]] who suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]]. For many years, Weinstein edited gay pornography for an urban audience (for a company known only as 'the Dorm'). She currently resides in Miami, Florida with her Italian greyhound Trotsky.

==Biography==
Weinstein co-manages the sister site, Insane Films, which features personal [[video blog]]s of Madge's alter ego, [[Richard Bluestein]], as well as features by underground filmmakers and miscellaneous visual content. Insane Films is one of the earliest videoblogs ever created, originating sometime in 2000. However, Madge Weinstein's fame grew largely from her indie [[podcast]] Yeast Radio, which began in late November 2004 . Weinstein gained notoriety for her [[viral video]], ''Cooking With Madge: Lesbians On Acid'', which featured a disheveled Madge and her unstable, ambiguously gendered friends attempting to cook "les beans" while high on LSD. A pioneer of the podcasting medium, [[Adam Curry]], helped promote the show in its early life. In late April 2005, Weinstein created Yeast2, a free-form experimental channel in which "anyone (could) contribute to the strange, ugly, pretty macabra [sic] and surreal." Yeast2 closed in 2008.

In early July 2005, Weinstein became one of the first members of [[Adam Curry]]'s [[PodShow]] and was featured heavily in the program, which aired on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] from 6-10 p.m. [[North American Eastern Standard Time Zone|EST]] on weekdays before the company's ties with the radio network were controversially severed on May 1, 2007. Weinstein's contract with [[PodShow]] ended in April 2008.

Around the same time, Madge Weinstein co-created ''Eat This Hot Show'' a collaborative [[podcast]] featuring five notable members of the ever-growing "queercast" community: Weinstein, [[Ragan Fox]], Wanda Wisdom, Fausto Fernos and his partner Marc Felion. However, Fausto and Marc were expelled from the show after ten episodes due to internal conflicts with fellow hosts, and the three featured a weekly guest in the episodes following. The show eventually dissipated in this format although, in April 2008, the show was revived with Madge, Wanda and new co-host Auntie Vera Charles. As of 2014, after another hiatus and the departure of Auntie Vera Charles, new episodes are being recorded sporadically with current co-hosts Ragan Fox and Wanda Wisdom. Madge Weinstein and [http://www.luckybitchradio.com/ Wanda Wisdom] also co-created the online community Qpodder.org, which collects podcasts by gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people or characters. Sibling site NellyGator.com allows listeners to subscribe to a single RSS feed containing all podcast episodes from the members of Qpodder. In mid-October 2005, Weinstein, a self-described "pioneering lesbian," began heavily promoting the medium of [[queer]] video blogging to coincide with the advent of the video [[iPod]]. Her new endeavor Faggregator.com does to videoblogging what Nellygator did for podcasting, and features a single page which houses all the video material submitted by members of the Qpodder community.

Bluestein experienced two personal losses in 2006. Juan Montealegre died on February 11, 2006, after a battle with cancer. Not long thereafter, on May 2, 2006, his 14-year-old dog Chauncey, a heavy fixture on the show in its early days including a memorable episode where Weinstein angrily cleaned up his feces, also died. On September 27, 2006, [[Richard Bluestein]] announced on Yeast Radio that he was retiring the character Madge and taking over hosting duties himself due to creative concerns. Madge was reported to be in a hospital in Guadalajara, Mexico, where she received [[adjustable gastric band]] surgery for her ongoing weight problem. The surgery went horribly wrong, leaving her in a critical condition. Madge eventually recovered and returned to the show on November 7, 2006.

In early January 2008, with the threat of her expiring [[PodShow]] contract, Weinstein relaunched Yeast Radio as a live show, airing on her website from 10:00 [[Central Time Zone (North America)|CT]] on Fridays. The live format continued until the end of May 2008 when Weinstein decided to return to a more free-form, unscheduled format. In early 2009, Weinstein resumed streaming live shows sporadically. The 1000th episode of Yeast Radio was streamed live on February 12, 2010.

Weinstein's rebellious, queer punk ethics and her podcast's unconventional content, strong, coarse language and stream-of-consciousness structure have made her an endlessly controversial icon within the more conservative podcasting community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= The Register| year= 2005| title=Harvard Man in lesbian mix-up wants satire clearly labeled|   url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/17/podcast_drag_queen_confusion/| accessdate=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her show serves as an ongoing protest against censorship, the commercialization of mainstream radio and the continued marginalization of gays and lesbians by the growing monoculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Richard Bluestein| year= 2006| title=Yeast 2: My response to Adam's response to Madge's rant|   url=http://yeast2.com/?p=119| accessdate=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable guests==
Weinstein features a variety of crude and eccentric characters on her show. Some frequent contributors:

* '''[[Sylvia Browne]]''', a famous psychic who is now a bloated corpse, who could never quite find her purse. Her spirit lives on and is continuously celebrated by Madge Weinstein in the form of audio clips.
* '''Berbacia Clemons''', a Los Angeles-based "big, black, bloated, bisexual, bipolar, overweight blesbian blacktress" who sporadically guests on the show to "peel open the pussy lips of [[Hollywood]]", allowing the audience to have a "peek inside". She is often delusional and obsesses over certain celebrities, in particular former talk show host [[Star Jones]] (who she views as her stalker and her "only competition"), her "lesbian lover" [[Oprah Winfrey]] and her "close friends" [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]].
* '''[[Cher]]''', the glamorous and unhinged singer, actress, part time yoga teacher and close friend of Madge. Talks constantly and proudly about her transgender son "Chazzie".
* '''Grizelda''', a panty-pooping marathon runner and Madge's close friend who shares her interests in obesity and the bizarre. Grizelda (Shishaldin Hanlen) is also a provocative multimedia performance artist, world cake-eating champion and sports coach who made headlines in 2004 for invoking an obscure clause in the French civil code and petitioning the government for permission to marry the long deceased French surrealist poet [[Comte de Lautréamont]].
* '''Victoria LaMarr''', a schizophrenic transgender crack whore with multiple personalities who appeared heavily in Weinstein's infamous Lesbians On Acid trilogy and in early episodes of Yeast Radio. She went on to play a larger part in the [[Feast of Fools (podcast)|Feast of Fools]] podcast. Victoria (Matthew Bogseth) died from complications of HIV/AIDS in November 2013.
* '''Rachel Kann''', an emo/gothic performance poet and 'new age' spiritual healer. Her trademark is her deep, robust voice and often speaks with inflections that suggest she is continuously relieving her bowels. Madge's chemistry and banter with her is very popular with listeners and she enjoys a cult following.
* '''Ali Mahajani''', also known as Ali My Vagina, an Indian man who enjoys mutaliating and sticking unusual objects in his [[urethra]]. He is estranged from his amputee wife after a complication with stump to uretha sexual intercourse. He soon went on to play a large role in Cheryl's Whorehole podcast and is part of the That Is Real Good Tech podcast with Rob Average Penis.
* '''Andy Melton''', later known as '''Schrockbella Mortenstein''', a housebound gay twenty-something with the unique predicament of hyper morbid obesity. From his father's house in Tennessee, he formerly hosted the podcast "Andy Not Andrew" and unsuccessfully launched the program "Sissy Fried" under the pseudonym, Declan Channing. He has since left his home and podcasting to pursue a romantic relationship with a man known only to listeners as 'Yellow Fatty'. 
* '''Cheryl Trig Merkowski''', a self-described beautiful, [[paedophile|paedophilic]] 25-year-old woman, smoker and owner of three fourths of a lung. Though she makes a point to introduce herself as such, it seems clear that she is much older than she lets on. Cheryl speaks candidly and obsessively about her prolapsed [[vagina]], bodily fluids, abortions, black people, her prized [[Cadillac Cimarron]] and the children at the daycare centre that she runs. She has a croaky, frightening voice, the results of [[lung cancer]]. She also tans obsessively to the point that her skin has become very leathery. She worked under [[Oprah Winfrey]] (who she has a bizarre, masochistic relationship with) and was caught up in a global conspiracy of celebrities pooping their panties. She has many famous 'sisters', including psychic [[Sylvia Browne]], former governor [[Jan Brewer]] and controversial celebrity chef [[Paula Deen]]. Originally only appearing on the show sporadically she has grown to become a full-fledged co-host. In February 2014, her music video 'Walls Fall Out' went viral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= James St. James| title=The Wow Report: NSFW! NSFW! Must-See Video for "Walls Fall Out" by Cheryl Merkowski|   url=http://worldofwonder.net/walls-fall-out/| accessdate=2015-07-19 | date=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Alex Farrell | title=Sick Chirpse TV: IS THIS THE MOST DISTURBING MUSIC VIDEO ON YOUTUBE?|   url=http://www.sickchirpse.com/most-disturbing-music-video/| accessdate=2015-07-19 | date=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Abortion Hotline Girls''', a series of bewildered anti-abortion hotline workers who befriend and attempt to help poor Cheryl and Debra through their various pregnancies and troubles.
* '''Hagatha von Taterbugs''', a gleefully disgusting HIV positive drag queen with borderline personality disorder who hangs out in public restrooms and drinks urine/fecal matter. Her trashy exploits and long history of atrocities have shocked and astounded even Madge and Cheryl. Cheryl despises Hagatha and undercuts her at every turn.
* '''Debra Wilkerson''', an elderly, insane Christian woman who thinks Madge and Cheryl need to "get saved". She had a complete mental breakdown after the television show The Facts Of Life was cancelled and talks endlessly about "Natalie", "Jo" and the "GURLS". After smoking copious amounts of chiffon, she developed multiple personalities, most notably as Heather Feather, a South Californian teen girl who frequents phone sex lines and has many strange boyfriends. Heather's most notable boyfriend is Fill, a foul mouthed, mentally handicapped pervert who talks obsessively about his 'cream'. She also has a gay grandson who burns crosses in her backyard in tribute to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Like Cheryl, she has grown to become a full-time co-host on the show.
* '''Kathy''', a dominant transsexual lesbian who the gurrrlls randomly found through a phone sex hotline. Kathy is borderline bankrupt and not-so-secretly wants Heather's sugardaddy funding. However, Heather eventually became homeless, much to Kathy's dismay, and lost all the money forcing Heather to live in her car. Kathy constantly berates Heather for being dumb and mildly retarded in nature. Through the phone calls between Kathy and Heather, it is clear Kathy needs Jesus. Not to mention Heather needing to learn what being a lesbian is all about...

The show regularly features audio clips involving psychic [[Sylvia Browne]], feminist writer [[Helen Gurley Brown]], ''Big Meets Bigger'', ''[[My Strange Addiction]]'' and other television programs about morbid obesity and bizarre personal habits.

Weinstein has also interviewed political activist [[Cindy Sheehan]], [[Wigstock]] founder [[Lady Bunny]], [[Democracy Now!]] reporter [[Amy Goodman]], pioneer of the transgressive art movement [[Nick Zedd]], collaborative documentary filmmaker Kent Bye of The Echo Chamber Project and the experimental, underground filmmakers [[Usama Alshaibi]] and Kristie Alshaibi. The show frequently features original compositions from Taylor E. Ross (described as Madge's "cunt doctor"), the mysterious "Mr. Zeeche" and Dave from the Chub Creek's podcast. Because of her prominence within the community, Madge also regularly features fellow queer podcasters on her show such as [[Ragan Fox]], Wanda Wisdom, Auntie Vera Charles, Lady Raptastic and Rebecca Nay.

The '''Next Issue Project''' is a series of [[United States|American]] [[comic-book]] [[comics anthology|anthology]] [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]] published by [[Image Comics]] beginning in February 2008. The multi-title project, edited by [[Erik Larsen]], creator of [[Savage Dragon]], features comic book characters that have fallen into the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10858 The Golden Age is Back in "The Next Issue Project"], [[Comic Book Resources]], July 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=15624 One Fan's Opinion], by [[Erik Larsen]], [[Comic Book Resources]], August 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The premise behind the series, according to Larsen, is:
{{cquote|... for any fan of comics, not just fans of Golden Age books. Often, the promise of Golden Age comics—where creators were making up the rules as they went along and were blazing new trails—was more exciting than the reality..., where creators were essentially mimicking some of the same dull formulaic writing found in other mediums at the time. Everyone who contributes to [the ''Next Issue Project''] was intent on fulfilling the promise of the Golden Age and delivering a book that was more than a mere homage, but also a thrilling glimpse of what comics could be—if only creators were allowed to run wild with the characters they were handed!&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Eric. [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=28602 ''Crack Comics'' "#63" press release], Comic Book Resources (Sept. 30, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Publication history ==
Each issue of the Next Issue Project utilizes features from a title published during the 1930s and 1940s period historians and fans call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], with similar dimensions and page count, both larger than the modern-day standard. Each issue continues the name and numbering of each title.

The first issue, ''[[Fantastic Comics]]'' #24 came out in February 2008. It was followed by  ''[[Silver Streak Comics]]'' #24 in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Wigler |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=24049 |title="Next Issue Project" Returns With "Silver Streak Comics" #24 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later ''[[Crack Comics]]'' #63.

The '''Oppenheim Toy Portfolio''' was founded in 1989 as the only independent consumer review of children's media by [[child development]] experts Joanne Oppenheim and her daughter Stephanie Oppenheim.

In 1989 Joanne was already an expert on children's play and [[toy]]s with her books, Kids &amp; Play and Buy Me! Buy Me!. In addition to her 40 plus children's books, Joanne's by-line appeared in Working Mother Magazine, [[Parents (magazine)|Parents]], [[Parenting (magazine)|Parenting]], [[Child (magazine)|Child]], [[Family Circle]] and [[Ladies' Home Journal]]. She wrote other parenting books while on the publication staff at The [[Bank Street College of Education]], where she received her Masters in Children's Literature. Her books have won the Mott Literacy Award, the National Council for Social Studies Carter G. Woodson Book Award and she is the recipient of the Curious George Award for Literacy. (For a fuller bio visit joanneoppenheim.com.)

In 1989 Stephanie was practicing [[corporate law]] in [[New York City|NYC]]. Since she was five she wanted to be a [[lawyer]]—like her dad, grandfather, great uncle and brother. It was amusing that her mother played with toys for a living. Her friends starting calling for toy advice from Joanne...which mobile? which ride on? Quite honestly, Stephanie couldn't quite understand what the big deal was...you go to the store and buy a toy. When Stephanie had her first son, everything changed. She quickly discovered that there was no independent consumer information about children's media. After many lengthy conversations, Stephanie convinced Joanne to start the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio.

The original [[newsletter]] was a big hit and the mother/daughter team wrote their first book together for [[HarperCollins]] in 1994, The Best Toys, Books, Videos and Music for Kids. In 1998, they formed their own [[publishing company]] and published the first annual Oppenheim Toy Portfolio. They also published their Read It! Play It! Literacy Series. During this time, Joanne published several more books for and about children and welcomed seven grandchildren into the family. Stephanie had another child and received a Masters in [[Psychology]] from [[New York University|NYU]] with a specialization in [[parenting|parenthood]].

Their Oppenheim Toy Portfolio awards have become a [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] of excellence with consumers, toy makers and the media. They have appeared on OPRAH, [[CNN]], [[NBC Nightly News]], ABC World News Tonight, [[MSNBC]], Lifetime, and both are Contributors to NBC's TODAY Show.

==Collaboration with Valve==
On October 18, 2012, [[Valve Corporation]] announced an agreement granting Perfect World exclusive rights to market and distribute ''[[Dota 2]]'' in mainland China. CEO Robert Hong Xiao stated that his company was "confident that adding this action strategy game to our diverse portfolio of games will bring additional world-class entertainment and premier gaming experiences to our players in China."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2012/10/18/4922820/perfect-world-and-valve-announce.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021212129/http://www.sacbee.com/2012/10/18/4922820/perfect-world-and-valve-announce.html |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2016, Perfect World hosted Dota 2's [[Shanghai Major]]. While the tournament itself was well received in regards to the player performances, the event garnered criticism due to delays on stream, spotty broadcasts and various other problems within the tournament, including the theft and deterioration of the competing teams' equipment.&lt;ref&gt;http://steamed.kotaku.com/disastrous-dota-2-tournament-ends-with-missing-gear-pi-1763412162&lt;/ref&gt; In the month that followed the event, the president of Perfect World, Yunfan Zhang, apologized for the issues with the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/perfect-world-apologises-for-shanghai-major-mess/|title=Perfect World apologises for Shanghai Major mess|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2017, Valve announced on the Counter-Strike blog that Perfect World would also be distributing ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'' in the Chinese market through the company's service.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2017/09/19277/&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2018, Perfect World announced their subsidiary Perfect World Zhengqi (征奇，"Steam" in Chinese Pinyin) would collaborate with Valve and build "[[Steam China]]". All games on Steam China will be checked by the [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://weibo.com/1647397792/GkYOsn84i?type=comment|title=Perfect World announced "Steam China"|last=|first=|date=|website=weibo.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Steam users criticized Perfect World, believing it will destroy the Chinese game market. [[China Central Television|China Central Television (CCTV)]] has also mentioned these concerns during their "Live News" on Channel 13 (News Channel).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Porn groove'''{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} is the music [[soundtrack]] to typical [[Pornographic movie|pornographic films]], or a [[Music genre|genre]] of music that imitates such music. The [[electric guitar]] with [[wah-wah pedal]] is the most common instrument associated with porn groove, and synonymous with the genre. Simple, often [[minimalist music|minimalistic]]-sounding drums, with the [[rimshot]] sound being commonly associated with porn groove.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In some movies such as the popular and influential ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', the film is cut with the music in mind, making the thrust in the scenes flow with the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fusedmagazine.com/Past_Issues/Issue_22/Deep_Throat.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105051415/http://www.fusedmagazine.com/Past_Issues/Issue_22/Deep_Throat.aspx |archivedate=2008-01-05 |title=Archive - ''Deep Throat'' |work=[[Fused Magazine]] |quote=Gerard Damiano edited the film to its music, so the actions would match and the beat would match…like up and down strokes on the old shaft…it was pretty clever.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation==
The legal situation in Papua New Guinea is complex. The Summary Offences Act 1977 makes keeping a brothel and living on the earnings of prostitution offences. The idea of the law was to decriminalise prostitution but criminalise those who sought to exploit or profit from it. In 1978, a Papua New Guinea court interpreted ‘living on the earnings of prostitution’ to include 'profit from one's own prostitution'. (Wemay v Tumdual)&lt;ref name="amnesty" /&gt; The ruling effectively made all prostitution illegal.&lt;ref name="spl"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://spl.ids.ac.uk/sexworklaw/countries |title= Sex Work Law |last= |first= |date=  |website= Sexuality, Poverty and Law Programme |publisher= |access-date= 21 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further case it was ruled that "occasional transactional sex for small amounts of money was insufficient to warrant a conviction".&lt;ref name="amnesty" /&gt; This may be a unique legal situation in that prostitution is made illegal not by [[Statute law]] but by [[case law]].

In rural areas, 'customary law' is also in force.&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; These laws are not written down, but are based on the knowledge of the laws of the indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="amnesty" /&gt;

There have been calls to legalise prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calls to decriminalise sex work in PNG to combat high HIV rates|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/programs/pacific-beat/2018-02-02/calls-to-legalise-prostitution-in-png-to-combat/9387596|website=ABC News|accessdate=7 February 2018|language=en-AU|date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, a private member's Bill was introduced to Parliament by the Member for [[Sumkar District|Sumkar]], [[Ken Fairweather]], to instigate legalisation. Prime Minister [[Peter O'Neill]]&lt;ref name="kare"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kare|first1=David|title=Prostitution Bill|url=https://sundaychronicle.com.pg/?p=1067|website=Sunday Chronicle: PNG's Weekly Newspaper|accessdate=7 February 2018|date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oro Province|Oro]] Governor Gary Juffa said they would oppose any call for legalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Keith|title=Controversy erupts over legalisation of prostitution in PNG|url=http://asopa.typepad.com/asopa_people/2016/11/controversy-erupts-over-legalisation-of-prostitution-in-png.html|website=Asopa|accessdate=7 February 2018|date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law enforcement==
Law enforcement is inconsistent. Sex workers and [[NGO]]s report corruption amongst police.&lt;ref name="amnesty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; There also report violence, intimidation, abuse, extortion and rape at the hands of the police.&lt;ref name="amnesty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spl" /&gt; Knowingly transmitting HIV contrary to the  HIV/AIDS Management and Prevention Act (HAMP) Act 2003 is sometimes used to detain sex workers, but there is no evidence of any charges being brought under this legislation.&lt;ref name="amnesty" /&gt;

==HIV==
{{see also|HIV/AIDS in Papua New Guinea}}
The country has the highest HIV prevalence in the Pacific.&lt;ref name="unaids"&gt;{{cite web|title=Papua New Guinea|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/papuanewguinea|website=[[UNAIDS]]|accessdate=7 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex workers are one of the high risk groups, although HIV response in the country is now being directed towards the high risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV and sexually transmitted infections in Papua New Guinea|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/papuanewguinea/areas/hiv_aids/en/|website=[[WHO]] Western Pacific Region|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to healthcare is poor for sex workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIDS 2014 - Abstract Sex workers in Papua New Guinea call for reforming laws around sex work and HIV transmission|url=http://pag.aids2014.org/Abstracts.aspx?AID=6797|website=AIDS2014|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNAIDS]] estimated an HIV prevalence of 17.8% amongst sex workers in 2016.&lt;ref name="unaids" /&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Papua New Guinea}}
Papua New Guinea is a source, transit, and destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Foreign and local women and children are subjected to sex trafficking, including near logging, mining, and palm oil sites. “Mosko Girls”, young girls employed in bars to provide companionship to patrons and sell an alcoholic drink called mosko, are vulnerable to [[human trafficking]], especially around major cities. Within the country, children and women from rural areas are deceived, often by relatives, with promises of legitimate work or education to travel to different provinces where they are subjected to sex trafficking. NGOs report some parents receive money from traffickers who exploited their teenage daughters in prostitution, including near mining and logging sites. Children, including girls as young as 5 years old from remote rural areas, are reportedly subjected to sex trafficking by members of their immediate family or tribe. Tribal leaders reportedly trade with each other the service of girls and women for guns and to forge political alliances.

Young girls sold into polygamous marriages may be exploited in prostitution. In urban areas, parents reportedly exploit their children in sex trafficking directly or in brothels as a means to support their families or to pay for school fees. Government officials reportedly facilitate trafficking by accepting bribes to allow undocumented migrants to enter the country or ignore trafficking situations, and some may exploit sex trafficking victims or procure victims for other individuals in return for political favours or votes.

Malaysian and Chinese logging companies arrange for some foreign women to enter the country voluntarily with fraudulently issued tourist or business visas. After their arrival, many of these women, from countries including [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[China]], and the [[Philippines]], are turned over to traffickers who transport them to logging and mining camps, fisheries, and entertainment sites, and exploit them in [[forced prostitution]].&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Papua New Guinea 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271261.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=7 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Papua New Guinea as a "[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 3]]" country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Papua New Guinea 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282728.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramanattam''' ([[Malayalam]]: രാമനാട്ടം, [[IAST]]: Rāmanāṭṭaṃ) is a temple art in [[Kerala]], India. The dance drama presents the story of [[Rama]] in a series of eight plays and was created under the patronage of Veera Kerala Varma (AD 1653-1694) ''alias'' Kottarakkara Thampuran. Ramanattom is based on a story from the epic ''[[Ramayana]]'', covering the incarnation of Rama to the Rama-Ravana War, Ravana's defeat and Rama's crowning at Ayodhya. The story was written by Kottarakkara Thampuran and is divided into eight poetic sections so that each section can be enacted in one day. These eight sections are puthrakameshti, seetha swayamvaram, vicchinnabhishekam, kharavadham, balivadham, thoranayudham, sethubandhanam and yudham (war). Ramanattam is widely believed to be the immediate stem of the well known classical art form of Kerala, [[Kathakali]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keralahistory.ac.in/tradition.htm www.keralahistory.ac.in]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328111650/http://www.keralahistory.ac.in/tradition.htm |date=March 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

After the staging and creation of [[Krishnattam]] by the then [[Zamorin]] Raja of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] in 1657&amp;nbsp;AD, its fame spread all over Kerala. Its success induced the neighbouring chief of the Raja of [[Kottarakkara]] (Kottarakkara Thampuran) to request the Zamorin for the loan of a troupe of performers on the eve of some festive occasion. It is said that due to internal feuds and political rivalry between the chieftains of the neighbouring States, the Zamorin, besides refusing to send the performers, insulted and humiliated the Raja of Kottarakkara with the remark,

''" It is useless to depute the troupe, because your (Raja of Kottarakkara's) court would be neither able to appreciate nor understand anything of the highly artistic Krishnattam and the high standard of the performance "''

Here the political rivalry between the two chieftains turned into art rivalry and lead to the Kottarakkara Thampuran, initiating a parallel mode of entertainment, which he called Ramanattam. While the Zamorin of Calicut, Manaveda's Krishnattam was written in [[Sanskrit]], the "language of the gods"; Ramanattam was in [[Malayalam]], the language of the people.

== Evolution into Kathakali ==

The Raja of Kottayam (Kottayathu Thampuran) refined Ramanattam into Kathakali. Kottayathu Tampuran who belonged to the first part of eighteenth century was a poet and a preceptor of dramatics who gave a scientific basis to Kathakali and Attakkatha literature. Bakavadham, Kirmeeravadham, Kalyana saugandhikam and Nivathakayacha kalakeyavadham are the four perfect Kottayam works. And these works are foremost in literary beauty and musical quality and have substantial acting possibilities. Simple arrangement of padams, sweetness of expressions, and depth in conception appear in the works of Thampuran from start to finish. The contributions of Kottayathu Tampuran are invaluable as far as literature, music and technical aspects are concerned. Acceptance of the theory that the literature must be beautiful and sublime if its enactment is to be fully relished was another important development. The most important contribution of Tampuran towards refining Ramanattom to Kathakali was that he steadied the scientific basis of its literature, music and acting.

'''Rebolation''' is a style of Brazilian dance that originated in [[rave parties]]. The dance, which gained popularity after videos of people practicing the dance were uploaded to popular [[Internet]] video sharing websites, such as [[YouTube]], is mainly danced to [[electronic music]], and involves moving the arms and legs loosely while the correct footwork makes the dancer seem to slide on the floor.

When dancing Rebolation, several steps are used, and the main move is to "walk" putting a foot forward and using the heel as a pivot point to turn the back foot backwards, while the front foot is turned inwards around the heel. The reverse movement is used when walking backwards. This, when properly performed, gives the impression that the dancer is somewhat sliding on the floor, and the loose movements of the hands create the impression that the dancer is not totally in control of the direction of movement. 

This step dance is considered by many dancers as the Brazilian version of [[Melbourne Shuffle]] and [[Hard Style]].

It is unknown which came first, but a similar type of dance that originated from Johannesburg, South Africa called "Stepping" or "Skitting" began in 2006. Unlike 'Rebolation', it did not originate through video sharing websites, such as [[YouTube]], although some dancers have posted videos on the website.

'''''RoboCop''''' is a 2014 American [[cyberpunk]] [[Superhero film|superhero]] [[action film]] directed by [[José Padilha]] and written by Joshua Zetumer, [[Nick Schenk]], [[Edward Neumeier]] and Michael Miner. It is a [[remake]] of the [[RoboCop|1987 film of the same name]] also written by Neumeier and Miner. The film stars [[Joel Kinnaman]] as the [[RoboCop (character)|title character]], with [[Gary Oldman]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Abbie Cornish]] and [[Jackie Earle Haley]] in supporting roles.

[[Screen Gems]] first announced a remake in 2005, but it was halted one year later. [[Darren Aronofsky]] and [[David Self]] were originally assigned to direct and write the film, respectively, for a tentative 2010 release. The film was delayed numerous times, and Padilha signed on in 2011. In March 2012, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (successor company to [[Orion Pictures]] until September 11, 2014, the studio that released the original film) announced an August 2013 release, but that was then changed to February 2014. The principal characters were cast from March to July 2012. [[Principal photography]] began in September 2012 in [[Toronto]]&lt;ref name="collider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/robocop-new-armor-set-image/195784/ |title=ROBOCOP Remake Set Image Reveals New Armor |publisher=Collider |date= |accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vancouver]] in Canada,&lt;ref name="vancityfilming"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancityfilming.com/robocop-reshoot-set-video-with-gary-oldman/ |title=RoboCop: set video with Gary Oldman |publisher=Vancity Filming|date= |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with additional locations in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], in Canada, and [[Detroit]] in the United States.

The film was released in the United States on February 12, 2014. ''RoboCop'' received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances, updates, style and political/media satire, but criticism for its lack of violence, social satire and humor compared to the original film, and grossed $242 million against its $100 million budget.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- See [[WP:FILMPLOT]] for guidelines on film plots, which should be kept between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
In 2028, multinational conglomerate OmniCorp revolutionizes warfare with the introduction of robotic [[Peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] capable of maintaining law and order in hot spots such as [[Vietnam]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iran]]. Led by CEO Raymond Sellars, the company moves to market its technology to domestic law enforcement, but the passage of the Dreyfus Act, forbidding deployment of drones in the United States, prevents this. Aware that most Americans oppose the use of military systems in their communities, Sellars asks Dr. Dennett Norton and his research team to create an alternative. The result is a proposal for a [[cyborg]] police officer. However, Norton informs Sellars that only someone who is stable enough to handle being a cyborg can be turned into one, and some candidates are rejected.

A [[Detroit Police Department|Detroit]] police detective, [[RoboCop (character)|Alex Murphy]], is chosen after he is critically injured in a car bomb explosion arranged by crime boss Antoine Vallon in revenge for Murphy's investigation into his activities. Norton persuades Murphy's wife Clara to sign off on the procedure. Upon waking up and realizing the extent of his transformation, Murphy flies into a rage and escapes from the lab, but Norton shuts him down and brings him back to the lab. As Norton reveals to Murphy that the only remnants of his human body are most of his head (excluding parts of the brain), his respiratory organs, his heart, and his right hand, Murphy is disgusted, and asks for [[euthanasia]]. Norton reminds Murphy about his wife's and son's patience, and convinces him to live on. During combat training with trainer Rick Mattox, Murphy proves unable to compete with the standard OmniCorp drones in efficiency. Norton alters his programming to make him more efficient by having drone programming take over his actions, but make him think they are his.  This increases his efficiency dramatically, but also makes him less [[empathy|empathetic]] due to his human nature being bypassed.

Shortly before he is to be publicly unveiled, Murphy has an [[emotional breakdown]], forcing Norton to remove his emotions. During the ceremony, RoboCop identifies and apprehends a criminal in the crowd. He goes on to reduce crime in Detroit dramatically, simultaneously increasing public support for repealing the Dreyfus Act. Aware that Clara has begun to ask questions, Sellars orders Norton to keep her away from her husband.

Clara nevertheless manages to confront RoboCop, telling him of their son David's nightmares. The experience leads Murphy to override his programming and access the previously sealed files on his attempted murder. From them, he learns his son was devastated after witnessing the explosion. Murphy pursues Vallon's gang to exact revenge. He takes heavy damage from their armor-piercing weapons, but manages to kill the boss and his men. Murphy returns to the station and joins with his old partner, Jack Lewis, to confront the two corrupt cops who betrayed him to Vallon, shooting one and tazing the other. Learning that the [[Chief of police|Chief of Police]] was also involved, Murphy moves to arrest her, but is remotely shut down by Mattox.

With the help of Pat Novak, a pro-OmniCorp talk show host, Sellars uses the incident to get the Dreyfus Act repealed. Clara goes to the press and angrily demands to see her husband. Fearful of being exposed, Sellars orders Mattox to destroy RoboCop while he's being repaired, while he lies to Clara, saying that Alex died. Norton is able to reach him first and reveals the truth. RoboCop narrowly escapes from the building just as it undergoes lockdown.

Murphy returns and storms the building, fighting his way through the [[RoboCop (franchise)#ED-209|ED-209]] drones sent to stop him, while Lewis and his fellow police arrive to hold off the rest of OmniCorp's forces. Mattox subdues Murphy and prepares to finish him off, but is killed by Lewis. Murphy then makes his way to the roof where Sellars is waiting for a helicopter with Clara and David as hostages. Murphy's programming initially prevents him from arresting Sellars, but he overcomes it long enough to kill Sellars when Sellars overconfidently continues to taunt him.

OmniCorp's parent company, [[Omni Consumer Products (RoboCop)|OCP]], shuts down the project. The [[President of the United States|President]] vetoes the repeal of the Dreyfus Act based on the testimony of Norton, to Novak's anger. Murphy's body is rebuilt in Norton's laboratory, and he waits for Clara and David, who are coming to visit him.

==Release==

===Marketing===
An OmniCorp website was set up in early 2012. A film-specific ''RoboCop'' site was launched nearer the release date. A rough trailer and some film footage featuring [[Samuel L. Jackson]]'s and [[Michael Keaton]]'s characters was shown at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]. According to director Padilha, the first theatrical trailer was supposed to debut with ''[[Elysium (film)|Elysium]]'', but it was instead released online on September 5, 2013, and was attached to showings of ''[[Riddick (film)|Riddick]]''. Two further trailers were also released, one of which was uploaded to [[Yahoo! Movies]] with an introduction from Padilha, in which he said, "I'm thrilled to have had the chance to direct this movie... I'm a fan of the original movie because it was ahead of its time both aesthetically and thematically. Back in '87, it was talking already about automated violence — both in war and law enforcement. And now, we actually have that happening in our lives and it's going to be more and more present. So we already have the drones. Now we're going to have automated robots doing law enforcement and replacing soldiers in the battlefield. So we had a chance to make this movie and talk about this." Two main posters were released in late 2013, with one showing [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|CTBA]] complex in [[Madrid]]. TV spots were uploaded to Sony Pictures and StudioCanal UK's YouTube channels from January 2014. [[List of RoboCop video games#RoboCop (2014)|A video game]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] was released as a [[tie-in]] to the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sarkar |first=Samit |title=Free-to-play RoboCop movie tie-in game now available on iOS |url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/8/5288126/robocop-remake-game-free-to-play-ios-android |work=Polygon |date=January 8, 2014 |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jada Toys]] released a range of action figures, including a radio control RoboCop on his Police Cruiser and roleplay merchandise including the new RoboCop helmet and chestplate. Two detailed figures from the film were released in April 2014 from Play Arts Kai.{{Update inline|date = July 2014}} The company threezero is also creating two RoboCop figures and a camo-coloured ED-209. [[RoboCop (comics)#RoboCop: The Human Element|Four one-shot comic tie-ins]] were published weekly starting from the week of theatrical release in the US. They were collected in a trade paperback edition under the title ''RoboCop: The Human Element'' to coincide with the home media releases.

===Home media===
''RoboCop'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on June 3, 2014 in the United States by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=13698 |title=RoboCop (2014) |publisher=Blu-ray |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Best Buy]] had an exclusive Metalpak edition, while the [[Target Corporation|Target]] edition came with an exclusive digital download of the previously unreleased comic "Gauntlet". In the UK, an exclusive [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] steelbook was made available on June 9.

===RoboCop Day===

''RoboCop'' received several comparisons to the 1987 film; the consensus was that it fell short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-robocop-remake-movie-reviews-critics-20140211-story.html|title='RoboCop' a lumbering remake, reviews say|last=Gettell|first=Oliver|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy Lodge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that "It's a less playful enterprise than the original, but meets the era's darker demands for action reboots with machine-tooled efficiency and a hint of soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Guy |last=Lodge |title=Film Review: RoboCop |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-robocop-1201086982/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=February 5, 2014 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Felperin from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that the remake "has a better cast, more meticulous script and, naturally, flashier effects, but it lacks the original's wit and subversive slipperiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Leslie |last=Felperin |title=RoboCop: Film Review |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/robocop/review/676751 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=February 5, 2014 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Viner]] from ''[[Daily Mail]]'' said that while he was "not predisposed to like this shiny new RoboCop for making me feel ancient, it does have an appealing vitality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Viner |title=Robocop Return isn't too rusty... but crowd-pleasing action flick lacks satirical wit of Verhoeven's Eighties original |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/reviews/article-2553416/Robocop-Return-isnt-rusty-crowd-pleasing-action-flick-lacks-satirical-wit-Verhoevens-Eighties-original.html |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=February 6, 2014 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Osmond from ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' says, "It’s not a classic like [[Paul Verhoeven]]'s 1987 original, but it is an excellent, intelligent SF drama", believing it is "one of the boldest Hollywood reboots we’ve seen yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=RoboCop Review |url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2014/02/05/robocop-review-2/ |work=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]] |date=February 5, 2014 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Hewitt from ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' wrote, "there’s a sense that Padilha, or perhaps his corporate overlords, don’t really get what made the original so special."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Hewitt |title=RoboCop |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=137679 |work=Empire |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigel Andrews]] from ''[[Financial Times]]'' called it "a leaden, needless remake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nigel |last=Andrews |title=RoboCop – film review |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/65c9c0be-8f32-11e3-be85-00144feab7de.html |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=February 6, 2014 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote it was "a dumbed-down shoot-em-up frontloaded with elaborate but perfunctory new 'satirical' material in which the movie loses interest with breathtaking speed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Peter |last= Bradshaw |title= RoboCop – review |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/06/robocop-review |work= [[The Guardian]] |date=February 6, 2014 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fellow ''Guardian'' film critic [[Mark Kermode]] rated it 3 out of 5 stars, writing that "against the odds, this emerges as far less depressing fare than one might have expected, retaining the key elements of political satire and philosophical musings that powered Verhoeven's original" and "at least it appears to have been made by someone who understands what made the original great."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Mark Kermode |first= Mark |last= Kermode |title= RoboCop – review |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/09/robocop-mark-kermode-review |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= February 9, 2014 |accessdate= February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silicon Sisters''' is a [[Video game development|video game developer]] based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. The studio creates games aimed at a female audience and is the first [[Canada|Canadian]] video game studio owned and run solely by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Braganza|first=Chantal|title=Silicon Sisters developing games for women|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/948631|accessdate=February 5, 2012|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by Brenda Bailey Gershkovitch and Kirsten Forbes in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watters |first=Audrey |title=Silicon Sisters Builds Videogames for Women by Women |url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/06/silicon-sisters-builds-videogames-for-women-by-women178.html|accessdate=February 5, 2012|newspaper=PBS|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon Sisters released their first game, ''School 26'', in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chalk|first=Andy|title=Silicon Sisters Say Game Industry Still Doesn't Understand Women|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112508-Silicon-Sisters-Say-Game-Industry-Still-Doesnt-Understand-Women|accessdate=February 5, 2012|newspaper=The Escapist|date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''School 26'' used the tool of empathy to advance in the game, and was downloaded more than 1,000,000 times in English, French and Japanese in 36 different countries. The game gained recognition from parenting groups and game reviewers for the diversity represented in the game, as well as the positive skills gained by exploring empathy. Its sequel, ''School 26: Summer of Secrets'', followed in the summer of 2012 and saw the exchange of secrets to advance or hinder the forward movement in the game.

In 2013, the studio released ''Everlove: Rose'', a [[Gamebook|choose your own adventure]] light [[Romance (love)|romance]] [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] geared towards adult women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Oxford |first1=Nadia |title=Everlove: Rose Review - Gamezebo |url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2013/08/26/everlove-rose-review/ |website=Gamezebo |accessdate=19 September 2018 |date=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=APP REVIEW: Everlove by Silicon Sisters |url=http://bookthingo.com.au/everlove-by-silicon-sisters/ |website=Book Thingo |accessdate=19 September 2018 |date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was well received critically, but was not a commercial success.

It was founded by Jerry Lucey in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/ontherecord/2014/06/24/sir-henrys-to-re-open-in-cork/ |title= Sir Henry’s to re-open in Cork (as an exhibition on campus in UCC) |publisher= Irish Times |date= 24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was derived from Henry O'Shea, a baker and building owner in the South Main Street area of Cork city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/pleased-to-meet-you-sir-henry-is-my-name-275144.html | title = Pleased to meet you.

Gigs held there included a number by [[The Golden Horde (band)|The Golden Horde]], [[Toasted Heretic]], [[Sonic Youth]]/[[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Therapy?]], [[The Wedding Present]] and [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]].

During late 1980s the club ran a series of three-night long [[acid house]] weekenders, which attracted DJs such as [[Laurent Garnier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.ie/dj-legend-laurent-garnier-talks-to-the-scene/ |title= DJ Laurent Garnier talks to The Scene |publisher=[[Irish Daily Star]] |date=15 March 2014 |accessdate= 4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shades of Rhythm]] and [[Justin Robertson]]. From the mid 1990s its dance nights were mostly [[deep house]]. The venue closed in June 2003 and the building demolished soon after.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Carroll (journalist)|Carroll, Jim]].

Retrieved 4 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Sir Henrys was a rock bar for many of its early years, a large video screen in front of the stage showed rock videos for customers. In the early to mid 1980s its clientele included members of [[Nun Attax]] (later "Five Go Down To The Sea") and Belsonic Sound.&lt;ref name="avoy"&gt;McAvoy, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The club at the time also held gigs by an older and more traditional "pub rock" element, but this scene had died out by circa 1987.&lt;ref name="avoy" /&gt;

Many of Ireland's up-and-coming young bands performed here&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/siry-henrys-cork-memorabilia-exhibition-archive-1468805-May2014/ | title=Go clubbing in Sir Henry’s in Cork? They want your memorabilia |publisher=The Journal| date=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 'Battle of the Bands' was held there for a number of years where unsigned talent competed for a recording contract.  Artists that performed there over these years included [[Phil Lynott]], [[John Martyn (singer)|John Martyn]], ex-Clash [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones']] [[Big Audio Dynamite]], [[The Pogues]] and [[The Sisters of Mercy]].

On August 20, 1991, [[Sonic Youth]] played Sir Henry's, supported by the then virtually unknown band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/artsvibe/cork-91--when-nirvana-came-to-town-264185.html |title=Cork '91 - When Nirvana came to town|date=4 April 2014|work=Irish Examiner|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/stage/sonic-youth-nirvana-the-frank-walters-remember-when-they-played-sir-henrys-1.1847768 |publisher=Irish Times |date=28 June 2014 |title= Sonic Youth, Nirvana, The Frank &amp; Walters – remember when they played Sir Henrys?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scenes were featured in the documentary ''[[1991: The Year Punk Broke]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The documentary documents Sonic Youth and Nirvana's 1991 European tour. The list of cities are shown at the beginning of the documentary and it includes the Cork date&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dance venue ==
As dance music became more popular and the demand for small venue live gigs decreased, Sir Henry's became a venue for the "Sweat" night.

Over the 1990s Sweat built up an international reputation, being variously described as "a gorgeous blend of underground house" (i-D), a "deep house frenzy" (The Face) and "the best music on that side of the Irish Sea" (DJ Magazine). By the mid 1990s Sir Henry’s had become a house venue, playing host to some of genre's better known artists such as [[Kerri Chandler]], [[Jerome Sydenham]], [[Roger Sanchez]], [[Glenn Underground]], [[Cajmere]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], [[Miguel Migs|Migs]], [[Fred Everything]], [[Charles Webster (musician)|Charles Webster]], [[Kevin McKay (musician)|Kevin McKay]], [[DJ Deep]], and [[Mike Pickering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzo42oScRfY#t=00m37s|title=Kerri Chandler describing atmosphere in Sir Henry's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Switch Drag Race'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.mega.cl/programas/the-switch/|title=The Switch Drag Race - Official Site|journal=Mega.cl ''(Title translated to English)''}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Chile|Chilean]]  [[Reality television#Reality competition/game shows|reality competition]] television series, presented by [[Mega (Chilean television channel)|Mega]] as a local version of American show ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://worldofwonder.net/rupauls-drag-race-is-heading-to-chile/|title=RuPaul’s Drag Race is Heading to Chile!|author=Blake Jacos|date=September 24, 2015|journal=World of Wonder.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://realscreen.com/2015/09/24/drag-race-heads-to-chile-for-local-version/|title=“Drag Race” heads to Chile for local version|author=Daniele Alcinii|date=September 25, 2015|journal=Realscreen.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the series is to find the best "transformista", or drag entertainer, of Chile (Season 1) and of Spanish language (Season 2). Similarly to its [[United States|American]] counterpart, ''The Switch'' requires its contestants to sing live, lip-sync, dance, and perform impersonations.

Hosted by Karla Constant, the first season of ''The Switch'', subtitled ''El Arte de Transformismo'', premiered on October 8, 2015 and ended on January 17, 2016, when Luz Violeta of Chile was crowned the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/todos-los-detalles-tras-la-final-de-the-switch/|title=All of the Details About the Finale of The Switch|date=January 15, 2016|journal=La Tercera. ''(Article in Spanish. Title translated to English)''}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After over a year on hiatus, ''The Switch'' returned to Mega for a second season, subtitled ''Desafío Mundial'', on Sunday, March 25, 2018. Season 2 ended on June 15, 2018 when Miss Leona, from France, was crowned the winner.

==Format==
Season 1 of ''The Switch'' consisted of the seventeen participants, generally split into two groups, that were challenged with demonstrating their ability to perform makeovers, impersonate female characters, dance, lip-sync, and sing live on stage. Along with the demonstration of their skills, ''The Switch'' shows each contestant's life story, giving details of their personal experiences to Chilean viewers.

Season 2 consists of six returning contestants from the previous season as well as seven new contestants from outside of Chile. The participants being split up into two groups; one group consisting of the returning contestants and the other group formed from their challengers from around the world.

==Season 1==
===Challenges===
Each episode, with the guidance of the four celebrity coaches, the contestants compete in the following challenges;

*'''Artistic Challenge:''' In this first test, each contestant has to characterize a TV personality or pop culture icon either on themselves, another contestant, or a guest. This test is judged individually as well as in groups. Depending on the episode, one of two outcomes occur; 
**Immunity from elimination is offered to the highest performer (of the winning group, if applicable) or a nominee is chosen to head directly to the Elimination Duel
**Or the winning contestants (or team) progresses to the Imitation Challenge to compete for immunity, with the competitors who don't win continuing on to the Singing Challenge.

*'''Imitation Challenge:''' In this second test, each contestant has to maintain the characterizations of their character/icon make-over from the previous challenge and add an element of acting, singing, dancing, or lip-sync performance. Immunity and nominations are chosen in the outcome of this challenge as well. In the first episode of Season 1, the weakest performer was eliminated from this challenge by majority vote from the judges.

*'''Singing Challenge:''' In this third test, each individual contestant has to sing a song of their own choosing live in front of the judges and a studio audience. At the end of each presentation, each member of the judges panel assigns a point score ranging from 1 to 7, based on the quality of each contestant's performance. After the first score is given, the first contestant must sit in the "Elimination chair" until another performer replaces them by having a lower score than them. If the next performer receives a higher score than the person in the chair, they are safe from elimination and proceed backstage to prepare for the next episode. Ultimately, the contestant with the lowest score is nominated to go up for elimination in the Elimination Duel.

*'''Elimination Duels:''' In this last test, the lowest scored performer in the episode's Singing Challenge is put up against the performer nominated from one of the other challenges. They both perform a live song of their choosing and the judges vote by majority who will be eliminated from ''The Switch''. Typically, contestants that aren't competing that episode are shown watching the Elimination Duel backstage in the make-up room alongside singing coach Patricia Maldonado Aravena. In the event of a tie in the voting, Juan Pablo González acts as the president of the judges panel and casts a final vote for the elimination. The eliminated contestant is typically honored with a montage of their run on the show and is ultimately shown writing a farewell with a tube of lipstick on a mirror in the briefing room à la the American ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race|Drag Race]]''.

===Finale===
*'''Quarter-finals:''' The final ten contestants are split up to compete in two episodes (19 and 20). One immunity is given the winner of the Imitation Challenge in each episode, allowing them to progress to the Semi-finals episode. The other four contestants performing in a Singing Challenge with the judges announcing which two contestants will continue on to the Finale via majority vote. The two remaining contestants perform in an Elimination Duel to fight for the fourth spot in the two-part Finale episode.

*'''Semi-finals:''' The eight contestants are again split up into groups of two to compete in two episodes (21 and 22), with one contestant being eliminated each episode. The contestants must all compete in an Imitation challenge and a Singing Challenge, with the judges all assigning point scores for each contestant overall. The contestant with the highest score in each episode automatically advance to compete as finalists. The contestant with the lowest score in both episodes are eliminated from the competition, with the two remaining contestants being safe. In the third episode (23) of the Semi-finals, the four previously safe contestants perform the challenges once more, with the highest scored performer advancing to the finale; the lowest scored performer being eliminated; and the two remaining "safe" performers being nominated to duel against each other in the final episode. For dramatic effect, one judge is chosen for each episode in the Semi-finals to withhold their scores for the contestants until the end of the episode, where it is revealed who gets to progress to the finale and who gets eliminated based on the final tally.
**'''Secret Votes:'''
***Episode 21: Nicole Gaultier
***Episode 22: Juan Pablo González
***Episode 23: Sebastián Errázuriz

*'''Finale:''' The two previously nominated contestants from the third round of the Semi-finals go head-to-head in an Elimination Duel, with one contestant ultimately being eliminated from the competition and the other advancing as a finalist. Following this, the four finalists perform individually in a Singing Challenge one last time to determine the outcome of the competition. After eliminating the weakest performer by the judges' vote, the winner of ''The Switch'' is crowned the best "transformista", or drag entertainer, of Chile and the runners-up are named. 

The winner of ''The Switch'' receives a grand prize of [[Chilean peso|CLP]]$10,000,000 (approximately [[United States dollar|USD]]$15,700) and a one-year supply of products and accessories from AnyHair, a Spanish company by way of Chile that specializes in [[Artificial hair integrations#Clip-in or clip-on hair extensions|hair extensions]], [[wig|wigs]], and hairpieces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.mega.cl/imperdibles/17122-luz-violeta-recibio-su-gran-premio.html|title=Luz Receives Her Grand Prize!|date=January 18, 2016|journal=Mega.cl ''(Article in Spanish.

==Season 2==
===Challenges===
Each episode, with the guidance of the six celebrity coaches, the contestants compete in the following challenges;

*'''Leaders Challenge:''' In this first test, each contestant from the Chilean group gets paired together with a contestant from the opposing group of "foreigners" to form duos. Together, they must impersonate a celebrity à la Season 1's Artistic Challenge. The duo that succeeds earned immunity and the power of leadership over both respective groups.

*'''Artistic Challenge:''' In this second test, the remaining contestants compete within their respective teams (one team consisting of the Chileans and the other consisting of the "foreigners") in a performance-based Artistic Challenge, similar to that of Season 1. Both groups compete in one Imitation Challenge each. The lowest performing contestant gets nominated by the judges to be a duelist in the Extreme Imitation Duel.

*'''Extreme Imitation Duel:''' The two lowest scoring performers in each of the teams' Artistic Challenges go up against each other in an extreme, rapid-paced Imitation challenge, in which they must transform into famous pop singers and perform a number within a given time frame, with the assistance of their respective team leaders. The loser of this duel effectively sends their entire team to the Elimination Gala.

*'''Nomination Mirror:''' The safe team will each nominate someone from the losing team to go straight to the Elimination Duel. The contestant with the most votes will not be able to participate in the Elimination Gala.

*'''Elimination Gala (Singing Challenge):''' The team whose member lost the previous duel must compete against each other in a singing gala à la Season 1, where their performances are scored from 1 to 7 by each judge, with the lowest scoring performer being sent to the Elimination Duel.

*'''Elimination Duel:''' The lowest scored performer in the Elimination Gala is put up against the contestant nominated during the Nomination Mirror round. They both perform a live song of their choosing and the judges vote by majority who shall be eliminated.

[[File:Hemlock Overlook - Swamp Crossing - 02.jpg|thumb|''Swamp Crossing'' game where kids have to come up with a team strategy that will allow them to cross a "swamp" using limited number of portable islands (boards) without drowning (touching the ground).]]
'''The floor is lava''' (also known as '''hot lava'''){{cn|date=November 2018}} is a game in which players pretend that the floor or ground is made of [[lava]] (or any other lethal substance, such as [[acid]] or [[quicksand]]), and thus must avoid touching the ground, as touching the ground would "kill" the player who did so.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The players stay off the floor by standing on [[furniture]] or the room's [[architecture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fosberry|first=Deven|last2=Lakhotia|first2=Pratik|year=2014|title=Playing 'The Floor is Lava' in Real Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FnUhBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22the+floor+is+lava%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20floor%20is%20lava%22&amp;f=false|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary Science Topics|publisher=University of Leicester|volume=3|pages=37-38|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players generally may not remain still, and are required to move from one piece of furniture to the next. The game can be played with a group or alone for self amusement. There may even be a goal, to which the players must race. The game may also be played outdoors in playgrounds or similar areas. Players can also set up obstacles to make the game more challenging. This is a variation of an [[obstacle course]].

Typically, any individual can start the game just by shouting "The floor is lava!" Any player remaining on the floor in the next few seconds is "out" and can not rejoin the game for some period of time.

There often are tasks, items or places that can "regenerate" lost body parts or health. Depending on the players, these could be embarrassing tasks, or simple things like finding a particular person.

In one version called "Hot Lava Monster", usually played on playgrounds, players must stay off the ground (sand, rubber, woodchips, etc.) and on the play equipment. The person who is posing as 'monster' can be on the 'lava' with the objective of attempting to tag another player. 'Monster' must try to tag or catch the other players. In some versions, 'monster' is not allowed to touch certain obstacles, such as wooden platforms or may only touch objects of a certain colour.  The "Monster" player must navigate across structures such as across [[playground slide]]s, [[Monkey bars]], [[Ropes course]]s, etc. instead of the main platform.

==Factual accuracy==
By using the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]] and taking [[convection]] into account, [[University of Leicester]] scientists have calculated that a high stakes version of the game would not be playable with actual lava, as the air above the lava would have a temperature too high for humans to survive for more than a few seconds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
===Film===
This activity is addressed in the 2015 animated film ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'', in which it is enjoyed by a girl named Riley Andersen in her childhood.  The activity then becomes part of her long-term memory, creating a lake of lava inside her mind, filled with floating architecture.  After being accidentally sent to long-term memory, two of her chief emotions, Joy and Sadness, must cross the lake in search of a way to return to their control headquarters.  The former enjoys reenacting the activity to find a way back, but the latter complains about the experience being too interactive.

===Television===
* The third season of ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' features an episode, ''"El Contador"'', where the activity is literally referenced when one of the characters (Cheryl Tunt) vividly hallucinates the floor of the bathroom turn to lava, after being experimentally drugged by a co-worker (Dr. Krieger). She shouts "the floor is lava!".
*The sixth season of ''[[Orange Is The New Black (TV series)|Orange is the New Black]]'' has an episode where the activity appears, titled "Mischief Mischief".  In that episode, Frieda watches Suzanne hop from tile to tile in the common area of the [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security prison]].  When Frieda then suddenly declares that the floor is lava, Suzanna responds by leaping to safety on a nearby table, aware of the game.
*The fifth season of ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' has an episode titled "[[Geothermal Escapism]]", in which a campus-wide lava contest is held with a collector's comic book at stake.

===Video games===
* As with the film ''Inside Out'', the activity is also referenced in [[Disney Infinity 3.0#Inside Out|the ''Inside Out'' playset]] for the video game ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]''.  There is at least one sequence where the player must lead any of Riley's five emotions to cross the aforementioned lava lake, although Anger can safely wade through the lava without injury.
* In 2016, [[Klei Entertainment]] announced development of a video game adaptation of the activity, titled ''[[Hot Lava (video game)|Hot Lava]]''.  It is played from a first-person perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/152912/20160422/somebody-finally-made-a-video-game-based-on-the-floor-being-lava.htm |title=The Floor Is Lava In This Video Game Adaptation Of Every Kid's Imagination |access-date=September 15, 2016 |archive-date=September 15, 2016 |dead-url=no |website=Tech Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915024451/http://www.techtimes.com/articles/152912/20160422/somebody-finally-made-a-video-game-based-on-the-floor-being-lava.htm |date=April 22, 2016 |first=Cameron |last=Koch |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ketchapp]] released an official mobile game adaptation of the activity in the summer of 2017, titled ''The Floor is Lava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Play Store listing for ''The Floor Is Lava'' |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.thefloorislava&amp;hl=en_US |website=Google Play |accessdate=14 July 2018 |date=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Board games===
* "The Floor is Lava" board game by Italian Cousins is only tangentially related to the folk game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Listing for ''The Floor Is Lava'' |url=https://thefloorislava.bigcartel.com/product/the-floor-is-lava |website=Big Cartel |accessdate=2 August 2018 |date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toastmaster''' is a general term, prevalent in the [[United States]] in the middle 20th century, referring to a person in charge of the proceedings of a [[public speaking]] event. The toastmaster is typically charged with organization of the event, arranging the order of speakers, introducing one or more of the speakers, and keeping the event on schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/toastmaster|title=toastmaster {{!}} Definition of toastmaster in US English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such meetings typically include civic events, [[service organization]] meetings, and banquets of various purpose.  In many meetings, a toastmaster typically addresses the audience from behind a [[dais]] or from a [[podium]].{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} At stage entertainment events, especially ones broadcast on live [[television]], the toastmaster often takes the form of a [[master of ceremonies]], introducing the entertainment acts.{{or|date=June 2018}} {{citation needed span|The term has fallen out of use to a large degree.|date=June 2018}}

James Toole, father of actor [[John Lawrence Toole]] was possibly the first professional Toastmaster during the 1840's in London&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallalieu|first=Huon|date=18 May 2016|title=Raise a Toast|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.slv.vic.gov.au/docview/1791987622?accountid=13905|journal=Country Life|volume=|pages=126-127|access-date=4 June 2018|subscription=Yes|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

William Kingsmith was the first to wear the red coat now associated with London society of Toastmasters, as he wanted to be distinguished from waitstaff and footmen. He was the public announcer at the 1908 London Olympic games,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-17688625|title=Stylish start for the 1908 Games|last=Mower|first=Jane|date=27 April 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and presided over court functions at St. James's Palace, ceremonies at the House of Commons and Royal Albert Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16840785|title=Famous Toastmaster Dead.|last=|first=|date=15 February 1932|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=4 June 2018|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many{{Weasel-inline|date=June 2018}} service organizations and businesses, the role of toastmaster was a permanently assigned role, but often rotating among members. Toastmasters were largely expected to keep the event from becoming boring, and a cottage industry arose in the middle century  to cater to the desire of businessmen and other leaders to overcome the [[fear of public speaking]]. Would-be toastmasters were typically counseled to use light [[humor]], and to have [[anecdote]]s and [[epigram]]s handily memorized. [[Toastmasters International]] is an organization dedicated to helping people in public speaking and in fulfilling the role of toastmaster.{{or|date=June 2018}}

Such was the importance of a toastmaster remaining sober in order to conduct events, he may have had a special cup, called the toastmaster's glass which, although of the same size and shape as others at the event, in fact was of much lower capacity due to an almost solid interior. Several such glasses are now displayed at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/toastmasters-glass|title=Toastmaster's glass|last=|first=|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=4 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Thomson "Tommy" Bartlett''' (July 11, 1914 – September 6, 1998) was an American showman and entertainment mogul from [[Wisconsin]]. He is most often associated with the [[water skiing]] thrill show based in [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]], known as [[Tommy Bartlett's Thrill Show]]. The success of this and other traveling water ski shows led to Bartlett's induction into the [[Water Ski Hall of Fame]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="WSHoF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterskihalloffame.com/pages/Bios/Tommy%20Bartlett.htm|title= Tommy Bartlett|publisher=[[Water Ski Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=2008-06-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040628180635/http://www.waterskihalloffame.com/pages/Bios/Tommy%20Bartlett.htm|archivedate = 28 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; His shows have toured the United States, the [[Far East]], and four [[World Fair]]s, and have seen 50 million spectators.&lt;ref name="WSHoF" /&gt;

==Early career==
Born in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], Bartlett began his career in entertainment by becoming a broadcaster at radio station [[WISN (AM)|WISN]] at the young age of 13.&lt;ref name="WSHoF" /&gt; After moving to [[Chicago, Illinois]], he became a staff announcer at the [[CBS]]-owned [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] radio station.&lt;ref name="WSHoF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WIHistoricalSociety" /&gt; He continued here until the outbreak of [[World War II]], when he learned to fly and subsequently became a flight instructor for the [[United States Army Air Corps]].&lt;ref name="WIHistoricalSociety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/bartlett/index.asp|title=Tommy Bartlett|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=2008-06-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819095607/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/bartlett/index.asp|archivedate=19 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, he returned to radio, hosting a show called ''Meet Tommy Bartlett.'' In 1947, he hosted the ''Tommy Bartlett Show'' and ''Welcome Travelers''.&lt;ref name="WSHoF" /&gt;

During his WBBM tenure, Bartlett was popular as host of two transcribed daily shows catering to housewives, ''Meet the Missus'' and ''The Missus Goes to Market''. Both shows would become the top-rated local daytime radio shows in the Chicago market, and were sponsored by Fitzpatrick Brothers, manufacturers of Kitchen Klenzer, Big Jack Soap and Automatic Soap Flakes.&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune061108&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-tommy-bartlettjun11,0,7716499.story|publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|date=2008-06-11 |title=Famed for skiing, he only did it once |accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water skiing==
In 1949, Bartlett went to the [[Chicago Railroad Fair]], where he witnessed a water skiing show on the Chicago lakefront.&lt;ref name="WSHoF" /&gt; After seeing several more such shows over the course of the fair, Bartlett decided to create and produce his own traveling water ski show using surplus equipment that he bought from the performers.&lt;ref name="WSHoF" /&gt; The "Tommy Bartlett Water Ski &amp; Jumping Boat Thrill Show", as it was first called, was highly successful. In 1953, after the show called at Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, Bartlett was asked by the local Chamber of Commerce to keep the show in the city permanently.&lt;ref name="WIHistoricalSociety" /&gt; Bartlett agreed to the request, keeping one arm of the show at Wisconsin Dells for daily performances on [[Lake Delton]], while four additional road groups continued touring in cities across the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="WIHistoricalSociety" /&gt; The success of the shows led the [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) to ask Bartlett to send the show overseas to entertain U.S. soldiers in the Far East, launching a branch of the tour in Asia.&lt;ref name="WSHoF" /&gt; Bartlett had a long-term partnership with motor manufacturer [[Mercury Marine]]'s owner [[Carl Kiekhaefer]].&lt;ref name="WSHoF" /&gt;

Through his show, Bartlett has been credited both with popularizing water skiing from a smalltime hobby to a major sport, and with the establishment of Wisconsin Dells as a [[tourism|tourist]] mecca. He is credited with introducing colorful costumes, and establishing themes for "dancing water", jumping boats, night shows, Polynesian dancers, show ski jumping, and skydivers.&lt;ref name="WSHoF" /&gt; Bartlett's Wisconsin Dells show offered [[bumper stickers]] for its visitors to put on their cars, thus becoming advertisements for the show and the city across the nation, especially so in the Chicago metropolitan area. In addition to his water ski show, Bartlett invested in other tourist attractions in Wisconsin Dells, building "Tommy Bartlett's Robot World", a hands-on science museum, in the 1970s. The attraction is now known as the [[Tommy Bartlett Exploratory]]. 

Bartlett also continued his career in broadcasting while both his ski show and Wisconsin Dells ventures were ongoing. He was an announcer at the [[Calgary Stampede]] from 1966 to 1992, as well as at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name="WIHistoricalSociety" /&gt; Bartlett's widespread ventures in the entertainment industry led him to become very wealthy. In 1997, Bartlett purchased one of three spare core modules for the space station [[Mir]] from a [[Moscow]] museum.&lt;ref name="NYTimes09252007" /&gt; The object is now the centerpiece of the Tommy Bartlett Exploratory in Wisconsin Dells.&lt;ref name="NYTimes09252007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/science/space/25dest.html?_r=1&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=%22tommy+bartlett%22&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin|title=Space Age Artifacts? The Smithsonian Is Just the Beginning|last=Fountain|first=Henry|date=2007-09-25|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a backdrop by [[CNN]] while the network reported on Mir's re-entry to the atmosphere in 2001.

Bartlett was inducted into the Water Ski Hall of Fame in 1993 for his contributions to promoting the sport, despite having only water skied once in his life, on his seventieth birthday in 1984.&lt;ref name=ChicagoTribune061108 /&gt; He was elected to the [[Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 2003.

==Death==
On September 6, 1998, Bartlett died of kidney failure at the age of 84.&lt;ref name="WIHistoricalSociety" /&gt; His name, however, lives on in the Tommy Bartlett Show and [[Tommy Bartlett Exploratory]], which each continue to entertain thousands of visitors every year.

== History ==
Verity! first aired January 2013.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://doctorher.com/?tag=verity-podcast|title = Verity!|date = 3 January 2013|accessdate = 27 April 2015|website = Doctor Her|publisher = |last = Roberts|first = Tansy Rayner|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150418130605/http://doctorher.com/?tag=verity-podcast|archive-date = 18 April 2015|dead-url = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deborah Stanish, the moderator of the podcast, met most of the other participants at conventions or other ''Doctor Who'' events or by working with them on non-fiction, ''Doctor Who''-related books.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Stanish wanted to hear the female and minority voices of ''Doctor Who'' fans and decided to start a podcast where several women could lend their view to the show and issues surrounding it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The format of having only women on the podcast made it stand out among the many other ''Doctor Who''-related podcasts.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.macworld.com/article/2138122/how-to-get-started-in-podcasting-preparation.html|title = How to Get Started in Podcasting: Preparation|last = Miller|first = Dan|date = 1 April 2014|journal = MacWorld|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The podcast's name is a homage to [[Verity Lambert]], the first producer of ''Doctor Who''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://veritypodcast.wordpress.com/about/|title = Our Inspiration|date = |accessdate = 27 April 2015|website = Verity!|publisher = |last = Roberts|first = Tansy Rayner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
Verity! shows consist of a discussion of various topics touching on and about ''Doctor Who ''among the cast members.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fandomania.com/ann-recommends-verity-podcast/|title = Ann Recommends: Verity! Podcast|date = 3 February 2014|accessdate = 27 April 2015|website = Fandomania|publisher = |last = Wells|first = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a "proper" episode every other week that is about an hour long and is based on a theme that the podcasters follow all year.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The other episodes are shorter, about twenty to forty minutes and can be on any topic the women choose.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Erika Ensign and Stanish participate in every episode: Stanish is the moderator and Ensign does the technical work.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The other four cast members rotate, except for large celebratory episodes where all six come together for the show.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Each contributor to Verity! lives in a different part of the world, so they record in their own locations and are connected via a [[Skype]] call.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.macworld.com/article/2138681/how-to-get-started-in-podcasting-capturing-the-audio.html|title = How to Get Started in Podcasting: Capturing the Audio|last = Miller|first = Dan|date = 2 April 2014|journal = MacWorld|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verity! is not scripted, except for some contributors, like Ensign and Stanish, who use occasional notes in order to stay on topic.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Overall, the show is not heavily edited and is meant to sound like a natural conversational flow.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4459">[[Image:WindsorRegatta 35Crimestoppers.jpg|thumb|240px|Windsor Pumpkin Regatta]]The '''Windsor Pumpkin Regatta''' is an annual water race held in October on [[Avon River (Nova Scotia)|Lake Pesaquid]] in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]]. The course is a half mile (800 m) from start to finish. The race features brightly coloured giant pumpkins as the sole means of flotation.

The race was founded in 1999 by Danny Dill,&lt;ref&gt;Farmers Almanac [http://www.farmersalmanac.com/best_days/a/the_great_pumpkin_raft_race The Great Pumpkin Raft Race!]&lt;/ref&gt; son of Howard Dill, breeder of the [[Atlantic Giant]] pumpkin.

Leo Swinamer of [[New Ross, Nova Scotia]] has dominated the competition, winning six out of the first ten races, including one at the age of 73.&lt;ref&gt;USA Today, [https://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/item.aspx?&amp;type=photo&amp;photo_id=0fK90w7gaE1WQ&amp;pn=1&amp;tid=00UM6uQ4A9g6W Scott Bryson congratulates Leo Swinamer], October 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his dominance, the race's popularity continues to grow, with 10,000 spectators and 60 entries in the 2008 race.&lt;ref&gt;UPI [http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2008/10/13/Racers_compete_in_big_floating_pumpkins/UPI-49481223908725/ "Racers compete in big floating pumpkins"], October 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three classes: motor, experimental and paddling. Not all classes attract competitors each year. The paddling class is the best known and most popular in terms of entries.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;Nick Timiraos, ''Wall Street Journal'', [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119283224266365303 "Out of Their Gourds? Paddling Pumpkins On Lake Pesaquid"], October 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The race gained a degree of notability in 2005 when [[Martha Stewart]] announced her intention to participate. While her pastel-coloured pumpkin did appear in the race, Ms Stewart could not participate as permission to enter Canada was delayed after her release from incarceration in the [[ImClone stock trading case|ImClone affair]]; when permission was finally granted, weather prevented her from reaching Nova Scotia on time.&lt;ref&gt;CBC, [http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/10/10/martha_pumpkin_20051010.html "Leo Swinimer a winner in Martha Stewart's absence"], October 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Various other celebrity participants have raced, notably local member of parliament [[Scott Brison]], who has appeared in several of the races.

Windsor was not the first to feature a giant pumpkin as a water-borne craft. That distinction falls to Wayne Hackney of [[Winchester, New Hampshire]] who paddled in a pumpkin he grew in 1996.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com" /&gt; However, the regatta has inspired several other pumpkin regattas, including one at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (held since 2005) and on Lake Champlain ([[Colchester, Vermont]]).

'''Zen Pinball 2''' is a [[pinball]] video game developed by [[Zen Studios]] for the [[Wii U]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], Android, and [[PlayStation Vita]].&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.zenstudios.com/press/press_archive/Zen_Pinball_2_Wii_U_Announcement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zen Pinball Official Website|url=http://www.zenpinball.com|publisher=Zen Studios|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was announced on April 9, 2012. The first PlayStation versions was released on September 4, 2012 in North America and September 5 in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-09-zen-pinball-2-announced-for-ps3-vita|title=Zen Pinball 2 announced for PS3, Vita|date=9 April 2012|work=Eurogamer.net|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5900579/zen-studios-brings-its-free-pinball-platform-to-the-playstation-3-and-ps-vita|title=Zen Studios Brings Its Free Pinball Platform to the PlayStation 3 and PS Vita|author=Mike Fahey|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/08/08/zen-pinball-2-on-ps3-vita-popcap-table-this-september/|title=Zen Pinball 2 on PS3/Vita, PopCap table this September|author=Alexander Sliwinski|work=Engadget|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Wii U version was released on March 21, 2013 in North America and January 31, 2013 in Europe.

''Zen Pinball 2'' is an upgrade to the original ''[[Zen Pinball|Zen Pinball (3D)]]''. It features a new UI and an upgraded version of the game engine which improves graphics and physics. There is also a new social sharing feature which allows players to post their scores on Facebook.

Although ''Zen Pinball 2'' is fundamentally a free download, users who already own ''Zen Pinball'' or ''[[Marvel Pinball]]'' for the PlayStation 3 are able to use all their [[downloadable content]] in the PS versions of ''Zen Pinball 2'', which imports automatically. There were 26 tables at launch (available separately as premium DLC) each of which are available as a free trial (though packs like ''Marvel Pinball: Vengeance'' and ''Virtue'' will still have to be bought as a whole). Users who purchase a pinball table on one Sony console are able to play it for free on the other.

==Features==
*''Zen Pinball 2'' is cross-platform entitled in the PlayStation versions. Any content bought are playable on both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita at no extra charge.
*Free trials are available for each table so players can try each table before purchasing.
*Those who already own ''Zen Pinball'' or ''Marvel Pinball'' content are able to import their purchases into ''Zen Pinball 2'' for free, receiving graphics, physics and social system upgrades at no extra cost.
*''Zen Pinball 2'' launched with 26 different pinball tables including a mystery table based on one of [[PopCap Games|PopCap]]'s games.
*New trophies for all tables.
*New social system with in-game score notifications, challenges, Facebook posting, ProScore (personal performance across all tables) and TeamScore (a combined score ranking players and their friends).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/zen-pinball-2-review/|title=Zen Pinball 2: Avengers Chronicles DLC review|author=Lucas Sullivan|date=19 June 2012|work=GamesRadar+|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*New rule sheets to help a player better understand the tables, while still providing opportunity for players to discover the secrets of the table on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kigyossy|first=Zsolt|title=Zen Pinball 2 Scores on PS3, Vita September 4th With PopCap Table|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/08/08/zen-pinball-2-scores-on-ps3-vita-september-4th-with-popcap-table/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
