      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2128">[[File:Headbands brown with comb and red with dots.jpg|thumb|150px|Alice bands made of plastic and stiffened fabric]]

An '''Alice band''' (the technical term for a hair band) is either a flexible [[Horse shoe|horse-shoe]] shaped garment or a loop of [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material which is designed to fit over the head and hold long hair away from the face, but let it hang freely at the back.

==History==
The Alice band is said to have originated in the period around 1871, following the publication of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s novel ''[[Through the Looking Glass]]''. In [[John Tenniel]]'s illustrations for this book, Alice is shown wearing a ribbon which keeps her long hair away from her face.&lt;ref name="Valerie Cumming"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cumming|first1=Valerie|last2=Cunnington|first2=C.W.|last3=Cunnington|first3=P.|title=The Dictionary of Fashion History|date=2010|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781847887382|page=4|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7NOj8Mc7GowC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=history+of+the+Alice+band&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m7pyFxLCAZ&amp;sig=twrBk-rWSEQ0iHp2gW7TtotXRag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sCusVLyaIILsare3gtgC&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20the%20Alice%20band&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alice band has had periods of popularity in adult fashion, most recently in the late 20th century, when velvet versions were popular among [[Sloane Ranger]]s in the UK.&lt;ref name="Valerie Cumming"/&gt;

The Alice band used to be an almost universally female item of clothing, but recently has gained popularity amongst men in some countries, owing to a fashion for long hair. The use of Alice bands by men was possibly first made popular by [[David Beckham]] and [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/16/article-0-0064150400000258-439_235x347.jpg|title=David Beckham with hairband|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=dailymail.co.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States an Alice band is known as a head band or "[[headband]]".

[[File:Fiddler in Wichita Riverfest.jpg|thumb|Fiddler in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] Riverfest]]
'''American fiddle'''-playing began with the early settlers who found that the small ''viol'' family instruments were portable and rugged. According to Ron Yule, "John Utie, a 1620 immigrant, settled in the North and is credited as being the first known fiddler on American soil".&lt;ref name="louisianafolklife1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/LFF_FiddlingInLouisiana.html |title=Living Traditions: Articles and Essays |publisher=Louisianafolklife.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early influences were Irish fiddle styles as well as Scottish and the more refined traditions of classical violin playing. Popular tunes included "[[Soldier's Joy (fiddle tune)|Soldier's Joy]]", for which [[Robert Burns]] had written lyrics, and other such tunes as "Flowers of Edinburgh" and "[[Tamlin]]," which were claimed by both Scottish and Irish lineages.

Soon these tunes were Americanized; local variations developed in the Northern and Southern colonies. In contemporary American fiddle styles, the [[New England]] states are heavily influenced by all Celtic styles, including [[Cape Breton]] fiddle-playing; whereas Southern or "Dixie" fiddle styles have tended to develop their own traditions, which emphasize [[double stop]]s and in some instances the incorporation of dance calls or simple lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Rye Whiskey, fiddle tune&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary fusionist trends==

In a radical departure from tradition, groups such as Trio Chipontepec are cropping up at American fiddle festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centrum.org/fiddle/2010/11/early-look-at-2011-festival-of-american-fiddle-tunes-faculty.html |title=Early Look at 2011 Festival of American Fiddle Tunes Faculty - Fiddle Tunes at Centrum |publisher=Centrum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110705062212/http://www.centrum.org/fiddle/2010/11/early-look-at-2011-festival-of-american-fiddle-tunes-faculty.html| archivedate= 5 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock is fusing with country, jazz with rock, and classical violinists are retooling in an era characterized by home recording studios and the easy availability of [[new media]] such as MP3 downloads.

==Fiddle playing distinguished from violin playing==

Some folk fiddlers distinguish "fiddle" from "violin", though this is far from universal - many classical violinists refer to their "fiddle". Nevertheless, a few common differences may be observed;

===Instrument===
Generally, the setup of the instruments is different:

* Fiddle bridge top may be slightly flatter
* String action height may be lower
* Strings more often steel than synthetic or gut
* Fiddle more commonly set up with pickup
* Fiddle more commonly set up with four fine tuners; violinists more likely to use a single tailpiece E tuner

===Playing technique===

Fiddle playing generally avoids vibrato except for occasional slow tempo pieces and even then uses less [[vibrato]]. Shorter bow strokes are also consistent with the fiddle players' tendency to use less [[legato]] and more [[detache]] bow strokes. Some, but not all, styles use double stops and open tunings. [[Trick fiddling]] is employed, often built upon [[cross bowing]] technique such as used in [[Orange Blossom Special (song)|Orange Blossom Special]] or [[Beaumont Rag]].
Bowing by fiddle players is quite different in that they may intentionally grip the frog in a crude manner and typically choke up on the bow. See for instance Rhiannon Giddens of the [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNaK_nBp2Yc&amp;NR=1 Massachusetts performance] of ''Genuine Negro Jig'' in May 2010.

===Fiddle repertoire distinguished===

Fiddle players tend to play fiddle "tunes" rather than sonatas and other classical types of compositions. There are exceptions. For instance, [[partita]]s have been popular with fiddle players, particularly since publication of the Open House CD by [[Kevin Burke (musician)|Kevin Burke]], an Irish style player based in Portland, Oregon. Fiddles are typically associated with country and other genres of popular music while violins are usually associated with classical and other genres of art music.

==Types of tunes==
[[File:HillbillyFamilyBandDLange.jpg|thumb|Woman playing fiddle (right) with her family in a California migrant camp, 1939]]
* [[Reel (dance)|Reels]]
* [[Hornpipe]]s
* [[Polka]]s
* [[Jig]]s
** Slip Jigs
** Double Jigs
* [[Waltz]]es
* Songs with lyrics

=== Canonical Tunes ===

==== Orange Blossom Special ====
{{Main article|Orange Blossom Special (song)}}
Also known as "OBS", Orange Blossom Special exploits the capacity of fiddle or violin to imitate various mechanical tones. Authorship is controversial.

==== The Devil Went Down to Georgia ====
The canonical American fiddle tune, "[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]" was written by [[Charlie Daniels]] as an interpretation the "Lonesome Fiddle Blues" by Vassar Clements and has been covered innumerable times. Although classified as [[country rock]], the tune uses licks based on old-time fiddle playing and rock guitar riffs. Unlike most old-time playing, the instrument ranges high up the neck, exploiting both the legendary association of the fiddle as "the devil's instrument" and the intensity of rapid sixteenth or thirty-second notes. These effects are achieved through rapid detache bowing bordering on outright [[tremolo]]. The motif of a [[deal with the Devil]] may have been influenced by [[Cross Road Blues]], by Delta blues singer Robert Johnson.

==Blues fiddle==

According to London-based music writer Chris Haigh, fiddle  " was among the primary instruments used by the rural blacks..." &lt;ref&gt;name=Haigh http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/blues/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; He contends that by  1930 over 50 different black blues fiddle players had recordings. Many musicians who were guitar stars also played fiddle including:

* [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]]
* [[Big Bill Broonzy]]
* [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]]

[[Blues]] fiddle uses the pentatonic blues scale to create riffs for breaks and over guitar chords typically in the standard [[blues progression]]. Vibrato is not often used, although may occasionally be used in an exaggerated manner for special effect.

==Old time fiddle==
{{Main article|Old time fiddle}}
Old time fiddle uses a profusion of double stops and authentic players typically tune their instruments in "open tunings" or [[Scordatura|cross tunings]]. The set ups often include flattened bridges and in some cases no chin rest. The most popular tuning ia AEAE for the key of A, but the instrument can be down tuned to GDGD, which may put less tension on the neck when playing solo. ADAE is also popular for the key of D, and standard (GDAE) is often used for G. Some of the earliest popular repertoire includes "Turkey in the Straw," "Arkansas Traveler," "Billy in the Lowground." Accompanying instruments include washboard, jug bass, banjo, dulcimer, guitar, and occasionally kazoo.

According to some sources, old time music is actually the "early recorded country music of the 1920s and 1930s, particularly of the southeastern states" thus narrowing the definition considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmet Baycu |url=http://www.1001tunes.com/LINKS.htm |title=Roots of American Fiddle Music |publisher=1001tunes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707054457/http://www.1001tunes.com/LINKS.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a broader definition usually prevails which incorporates unrecorded music with roots long before radio transmission and sound recording were invented. Within old time music there are regional subgenres, such as the Deep South and Appalachia, where fiddle music is often intertwined with cultural phenomena such as [[Appalachian music#Coal mining and protest music|coal mining]].

A comprehensive review of old time fiddle styles was written by David Reiner and Peter Anick and published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Oldtime Fiddling Across America, by David Reiner and Peter Anick (1989), Mel Bay Publications. {{ISBN|0-87166-766-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bluegrass fiddle==

[[Bluegrass music]] originated in the person of Bill Monroe. According to Haigh, "Monroe always considered the fiddle to be the key instrument of bluegrass".&lt;ref name="fiddlingaround1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/bluegrass/index.html |title=Bluegrass Fiddle |publisher=Fiddlingaround.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Chubby Wise]] Played with Monroe. Also a Texas Swing player &lt;ref name="fiddlingaround1"/&gt;
* [[Byron Berline]] a bluegrass player, has appeared with the Rolling Stones, Gram Parsons and The Flying Burrito Brothers
* [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]] Played with Monroe. Classical training, old time. Band: Seatrain. tric violin. COMPOSITION: "What if Mozart had played with Bill Monroe; a concerto for violin and orchestra"

==Cajun fiddle==
According to Ron Yule, "Louisiana fiddling had its birth roots in Europe, with fiddling being noted as early as the 15th century in Scotland."&lt;ref name="louisianafolklife1"/&gt; The most widely known Cajun fiddler is [[Doug Kershaw]].

[[Zydeco]] music is closely related.

==Rock fiddle==
{{Main article|Electric violin}}
Rock fiddle, like rock music in general, owes much to American blues. Incorporation of fiddle or violin into rock, as with jazz, has been a slow process, resisted by some critics as an"unlikeliest and perverse misuse of an instrument".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/rock%20violin/index.html |title=Rock Violin |publisher=Fiddlingaround.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock has roots in [[folk music]] particularly the [[American folk revival]] of the 1960s, and thus as a matter of usage some writers refer to "rock fiddle" when discussing playing by classically trained musicians who join rock bands and thus import classical style rather than fiddle style into their playing.

* [[Papa John Creach]] ([[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Hot Tuna]]) played in a style more closely approaching true fiddle as opposed to violinistic style.
* [[Sugar Cane Harris]] (violin,technically), played with [[John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Little Richard]] and  [[Johnny Otis]].
* [[Jerry Goodman]] (violin, technically), with [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]]'s album ''[[Birds of Fire]]''.
* [[Scarlet Rivera]] (violin, technically), played with [[Bob Dylan]] on "[[Hurricane (Bob Dylan song)|Hurricane]]".
* [[David LaFlamme]] (violin, technically) (born Gary Posie), [[It's A Beautiful Day]], also performed with [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Dan Hicks (singer)|Dan Hicks]].

Rock violinists often use solid body [[electric violin]]s to reduce feedback. Rock is an international phenomenon and is consequently influenced by cross fertilizations from rock players such as Ashley MacIsaac&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brad Wheeler |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/music/why-ashley-macisaac-decided-to-rock-his-fiddle/article2065835/ |title=Why Ashley MacIsaac decided to rock his fiddle |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, American rockers continue to experiment. For instance, eclectic rocker Natalie Stovall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nataliestovall.com/2011/01/29/amarillo-article-about-todays-show/ |title=News – Amarillo Globe-News Article « Natalie Stovall |publisher=Nataliestovall.com |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2011-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326083848/http://www.nataliestovall.com/2011/01/29/amarillo-article-about-todays-show/ |archive-date=2012-03-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a graduate of Berkelee Conservatory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystarsonline.com/CSO/IAS/2007/NatalieStovall_IAS.htm |title=Natalie Stovall - Indie Artist Spotlight on |publisher=Countrystarsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110704090815/http://www.countrystarsonline.com/CSO/IAS/2007/NatalieStovall_IAS.htm| archivedate= 4 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; covers [[Led Zeppelin]], [[AC/DC]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[The White Stripes]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], all the while alternating between standard rock vocals and fiddle/violin riffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnRjMq_kDVU |title=Natalie Stovall - Crazy Rock/Fiddle Medley - Chicago |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-03-13 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rock fiddle or violin players include

* [[Byron Berline]] a bluegrass player, has appeared with [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Gram Parsons]] and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]]
* [[Rufus Thibodeaux]] ([[Neil Young]])
* [[John Cale]] of [[The Velvet Underground]] notable tracks include "Heroin"

==American jazz fiddle==

Jazz playing on the fiddle is often called jazz violin but there are some instances in which "jazz fiddle" is discussed. For instance Mel Bay contributor Martin Norgard presents jazz fiddle in numerous media (book, website).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzfiddlewizard.com/Frame.htm |title=A Practical Guide To Jazz Improvising For Strings |publisher=Jazz Fiddle Wizard |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719024330/http://www.jazzfiddlewizard.com/Frame.htm| archivedate= 19 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, instructional jazz playing was preceded by  the highly influential 1992 Oak Publications volume Jazz Violin" by Matt Glaser and [[Stephane Grapelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Jazz Violin| Grappelli and Glaser| Publisher: Music Sales America |(January 1, 1992)|{{ISBN|0-8256-0194-0}}|{{ISBN|978-0-8256-0194-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic is indeed covered on the Wikipedia online encyclopedia at the article page entitled [[Jazz violin]].

== Texas swing ==
{{see also|Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys|Chris Daring|Buddy Spicher|Benny Thomasson}}
This music, usually considered to be synonymous with [[Western swing]], is ''bona fide'' fiddle music and is deeply intertwined with country and folk music as played by Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Vince Gill, Dale Watson, the Wheel's Jason Roberts, Jesse Dayton, and Garrison Keillor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnygimble.com/ |title=Welcome to Johnny Gimble's world of Texas Swing! |publisher=Johnnygimble.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724102847/http://www.johnnygimble.com/| archivedate= 24 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well-known example of this music is "[[Faded Love (Bob Wills song)|Faded Love]]", which despite some controversy is generally attributed to Bob Wills.:&lt;ref&gt;^ Wolff, Country Music, p. 112: "It ['Faded Love'] originated with western swing pioneer Bob Wills, who grew up in the 1910s and '20s fiddling in rural Texas with his father, John Wills. They wrote the melody together when Bob was very young; it wasn't until 1950 that the song gained lyrics, courtesy of Bob's younger brother, Billy Jack.&lt;/ref&gt;*[[Mark O'Connor]] is a legendary performer who also plays bluegrass and jazz but got started as a youth contender in fiddle contests.

== New England, "Down East," Yankee, or Boston fiddle ==

One of the most prominent examples of the New England fiddle tradition was Maine's [[Mellie Dunham]], who was a sensation in his day. Today New England fiddle playing is exemplified by [[Rounder Records]] artist Frank Ferrel.&lt;ref&gt;Notable as heard on ''A Prairie Home Companion.'' In the Boston Globe he was referred to  as "one of the finest living masters," of that genre.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to the style as "Down East" in his volume ''Boston Fiddle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frankferrel.com/ |title=Official Website |publisher=Frank Ferrel |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other fiddle traditions, piano accompaniment is common, and, he notes occasionally saxophone or clarinet would join in.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rhapsody.com/#/artist/frank-ferrel/album/boston-fiddle-the-dudley-street-tradition&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature is frequent use of minor keys particularly G minor and also the "flat keys" of F Major and B flat Major, which are not typically used in Old Time and other indigenous music traditions.  Ferrell traces his roots into the 1800s Boston Scottish and Irish cultures as typified in musicians such as William Bradbury Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan's Mammoth Collection&lt;/ref&gt; Like all Celtic American fiddle traditions, his is influenced by the publication of Chief O'Neil's massive directory of fiddle tunes in 1903 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiddlingaround.co.uk/ireland/index.html |title=Irish Fiddle |publisher=Fiddlingaround.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Ferrel and others in the North East tradition use the full panoply of Irish fiddle ornamentation.

Other influences include [[Scottish fiddling]] and Cape Breton style, which has its own blend of Celtic traditions which include also Normandy styles.

==Canadian and other international influence==

American fiddle traditions are deeply influenced by international influence from numerous immigrations and ordinary commerce particularly from Anglo-Celtic and [[Canadian fiddle|Canadian]] sources. Québécois French, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.

'''Arthur Meier Schlesinger Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|l|ɛ|s|ɪ|n|dʒ|ər}}; born '''Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger'''; October 15, 1917 – February 28, 2007) was an American [[historian]], [[social critic]], and [[public intellectual]]. The son of the influential historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr.]] and a specialist in [[American history]], much of Schlesinger's work explored the history of 20th-century [[American liberalism]]. In particular, his work focused on leaders such as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. In the 1952 and 1956 presidential campaigns, he was a primary speechwriter and adviser to the Democratic presidential nominee, [[Adlai Stevenson II]].&lt;ref&gt;(Martin, pp. 630–643)&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger served as special assistant and "court historian"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/weekinreview/04tanenhaus.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. – History, Written in the Present Tense|author=Tanenhaus, Sam|date=March 4, 2007|accessdate= October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to President Kennedy from 1961 to 1963. He wrote a detailed account of the Kennedy administration, from the 1960 presidential campaign to the president's state funeral, titled ''[[A Thousand Days|A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House]]'', which won the 1966 [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography]].

In 1968, Schlesinger actively supported the presidential campaign of Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]], which ended with [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination in Los Angeles]]. Schlesinger wrote a popular biography, ''Robert Kennedy and His Times'', several years later. He later popularized the term "[[Imperial Presidency|imperial presidency]]" during the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] in his [[The Imperial Presidency|book of the same name]].

==Early life and career==
Schlesinger was born in [[Columbus, Ohio]], the son of [[Elizabeth Bancroft Schlesinger|Elizabeth Harriet (née Bancroft)]] and [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr.|Arthur M. Schlesinger]] (1888–1965), who was an influential social historian at [[Ohio State University]] and [[Harvard University]], where he directed many PhD dissertations in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOSU Presents Ohioana Authors, Arthur Schlesinger Jr |website=Ohioana Authors |publisher=[[The WOSU Stations|WOSU]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.ohioana-authors.org/schlesinger/highlights.php |accessdate=September 5, 2006 |archivedate=September 7, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907011425/http://www.ohioana-authors.org/schlesinger/highlights.php |deadurl=no |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather was a [[Prussia]]n [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jew]] who converted to [[Protestantism]] and then married an Austrian Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Arthur|accessdate=December 20, 2011|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/a-life-in-the-twentieth-century-by-arthur-m-schlesinger-jr/|title=A Life in the Twentieth Century, by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr|website=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, a [[Mayflower descendant]], was of [[German Americans|German]] and [[New England]] ancestry, as well as a relative of historian [[George Bancroft]], according to family tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=December 20, 2011|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2000/dec/21/the-age-of-schlesinger/|title=The Age of Schlesinger by James Chace |website=The New York Review of Books|date=December 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family practiced [[Unitarianism]].

Schlesinger attended the [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], [[New Hampshire]], and received his first degree at the age of 20 from [[Harvard College]], where he graduated ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'' in 1938.&lt;ref name="NYTOBIT" /&gt; After spending the 1938–1939 academic year at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] as a Henry Fellow, he was appointed to a three-year Junior Fellowship in the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]] in the fall of 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.socfell.fas.harvard.edu/current%20and%20former%20jf%20term.html |title=Current and Former Term|access-date=January 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116051400/http://www.socfell.fas.harvard.edu/current%20and%20former%20jf%20term.html |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Fellows were not allowed to pursue advanced degrees, "a requirement intended to keep them off the standard academic treadmill"; as such, Schlesinger would never earn a doctorate.&lt;ref name="NYTOBIT"/&gt; His fellowship was interrupted by the United States entering [[World War II]]. After failing his military medical examination, Schlesinger joined the [[Office of War Information]]. From 1943 to 1945, he served as an intelligence analyst in the [[Office of Strategic Services]], a precursor to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/opinion/2008/08/20/arthur-schlesinger-jrs-not-so-secret-career-as-a-spy.html |title=Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s Not-So-Secret Career as a Spy: My father's OSS records reveal no James Bond, but a World War II career like so many others |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |last=Schlesinger |first=Robert |date=August 20, 2008 |archivedate=September 27, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927061646/http://www.usnews.com/articles/opinion/2008/08/20/arthur-schlesinger-jrs-not-so-secret-career-as-a-spy.html |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schlesinger's service in the OSS allowed him time to complete his first [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning book, ''The Age of Jackson'', in 1945. From 1946 to 1954, he was an associate professor at Harvard, becoming a full professor in 1954.

==Political activities before 1960==
In 1947, Schlesinger, together with former First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], Minneapolis mayor and future [[United States Senate|Senator]] and Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]], economist and longtime friend [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], and Protestant theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wightman Fox, _Reinhold Niebuhr: A Biography_&lt;/ref&gt; founded [[Americans for Democratic Action]]. Schlesinger acted as the ADA's national chairman from 1953 to 1954.

After President [[Harry S. Truman]] announced he would not run for a second full term in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]], Schlesinger became the primary speechwriter for and an ardent supporter of [[Governor of Illinois|Governor]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai E. Stevenson]] of [[Illinois]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956 election]], Schlesinger, along with 30-year-old Robert F. Kennedy, again worked on Stevenson's campaign staff. Schlesinger supported the nomination of Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy, as Stevenson's vice-presidential running mate, but at the [[Democratic convention]], Kennedy came second in the vice-presidential balloting, losing to Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] of [[Tennessee]].

Schlesinger had known John F. Kennedy since attending Harvard and increasingly socialized with Kennedy and his wife [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]] in the 1950s. In 1954, the ''[[Boston Post]]'' publisher John Fox Jr. had planned series of newspaper pieces labeling several Harvard figures, including Schlesinger, as "reds", Kennedy intervened on Schlesinger's behalf, which Schlesinger recounted in ''A Thousand Days''.

During the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1960|1960 campaign]], Schlesinger supported Kennedy, causing much consternation to Stevenson loyalists. At the time, however, Kennedy was an active candidate while Stevenson refused to run unless he was drafted at [[1960 Democratic National Convention|the convention]]. After Kennedy won the nomination, Schlesinger helped the campaign as a (sometime) speechwriter, speaker, and member of the ADA. He also wrote the book ''Kennedy or Nixon: Does It Make Any Difference?'' in which he lauded Kennedy's abilities and scorned Vice President [[Richard M. Nixon]] as having "no ideas, only methods.... He cares about winning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EGotj0CmbiwC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=kennedy+or+nixon+schlesinger |title=Nixon's shadow: the history of an image – David Greenberg – Google Books |accessdate=December 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230041/https://books.google.com/books?id=EGotj0CmbiwC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;sig=P-QqDv-UdqL5WoZNYU0qZWCXt-Y&amp;resnum=6 |archivedate=January 11, 2014 |deadurl=no |isbn=9780393048964 |last1=Greenberg |first1=David |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kennedy administration==
After the election, the president-elect offered Schlesinger an ambassadorship and Assistant Secretary of State for Cultural Relations before Robert Kennedy proposed for Schlesinger to serve as a "sort of roving reporter and troubleshooter." Schlesinger quickly accepted, and on January 30, 1961, he resigned from Harvard and was appointed Special Assistant to the President. He worked primarily on Latin American affairs and as a speechwriter during his tenure in the [[White House]].

Kennedy|President Kennedy]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Vice President Johnson]], [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie Kennedy]], and [[Arleigh Burke|Admiral Arleigh Burke]] in the White House Office of the President's Secretary, May 5, 1961]]
In February 1961, Schlesinger was first told of the "Cuba operation," which would eventually become the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. He opposed the plan in a memorandum to the president: "at one stroke you would dissipate all the extraordinary good will which has been rising toward the new Administration through the world. It would fix a malevolent image of the new Administration in the minds of millions."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House'', Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; He, however, suggested,

One can conceive a [[black operation]] in, say, [[Haiti]] which might in time lure Castro into sending a few boatloads of men on to a Haitian beach in what could be portrayed as an effort to overthrow the Haitian regime. If only Castro could be induced to commit an offensive act, then the moral issue would be butted, and the anti-US campaign would be hobbled from the start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foreign Relations of the United States 1961–1963|year=1997|publisher=United States Department of State|url=https://fas.org/irp/ops/policy/docs/frusX/31_45.html|chapter=Cuba, 1961–1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the Cabinet deliberations, he "shrank into a chair at the far end of the table and listened in silence" as the [[Joint Chiefs]] and CIA representatives lobbied the president for an invasion. Along with his friend, Senator [[William Fulbright]], Schlesinger sent several memos to the president opposing the strike;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The New York Public Library|url= http://www.nypl.org/press/2007/Schlesinger_papers.cfm|title=NYPL Acquires Papers of Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr|publisher=Nypl.org|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, during the meetings, he held back his opinion, reluctant to undermine the President's desire for a unanimous decision. Following the overt failure of the invasion, Schlesinger later lamented, "In the months after the Bay of Pigs, I bitterly reproached myself for having kept so silent during those crucial discussions in the cabinet room. ... I can only explain my failure to do more than raise a few timid questions by reporting that one's impulse to blow the whistle on this nonsense was simply undone by the circumstances of the discussion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JGLkwCNI7sIC&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=bay+of+pigs+i+bitterly+reproached+myself+for+having+kept+so+silent+during+those |author=Howard Zinn |title=The Zinn Reader: Writings on Disobedience and Democracy |year=1997 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113142312/https://books.google.com/books?id=JGLkwCNI7sIC&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;sig=56gK99HNZrGgKfJMRIipQml05cg |archivedate=November 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 11, 2009 |isbn = 9781888363548}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the furor died down, Kennedy joked that Schlesinger "wrote me a memorandum that will look pretty good when he gets around to writing his book on my administration. Only he better not publish that memorandum while I'm still alive!"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During the [[Cuban missile crisis]], Schlesinger was not a member of the Executive Committee of the National Security Council ([[EXCOMM]]) but helped [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations|UN Ambassador]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] draft his presentation of the crisis to the [[UN Security Council]].

After President Kennedy was [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated on November 22, 1963]], Schlesinger resigned his position in January 1964. He wrote a memoir/history of the Kennedy administration, ''A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House'', which won him his second Pulitzer Prize in 1965.

==Later career==
Schlesinger returned to teaching in 1966 as the Albert Schweitzer Professor of the Humanities at the Graduate Center of [[The City University of New York]]. After his retirement from teaching in 1994, he remained an active member of the Graduate Center community as an emeritus professor until his death.

==Later politics==
After his service for the Kennedy administration, he continued to be a Kennedy loyalist for the rest of his life, campaigning for Robert Kennedy's tragic [[Robert F. Kennedy presidential campaign, 1968|presidential campaign in 1968]] and for Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] in 1980. Upon the request of Robert Kennedy's widow, [[Ethel Kennedy]], he wrote the biography ''Robert Kennedy and His Times'', which was published in 1978.&lt;ref name="NYT 1978"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/26/specials/schlesinger-robert.html |title=Fierce in His Loyalties and Enmities |first=Gary |last=Wills |website=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 12, 1978 |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he greatly criticized Richard Nixon as both a candidate and president. His prominent status as a liberal Democrat and outspoken disdain of Nixon led to his placement on the [[master list of Nixon's political opponents]]. Ironically, Nixon would become his next-door neighbor in the years following the [[Watergate scandal]].

After he retired from teaching, he remained involved in politics for the rest of his life through his books and public speaking tours.  Schlesinger was a critic of the Clinton Administration, resisting President Clinton's cooptation of his "Vital Center" concept in an article for Slate in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=It's My Vital Center |author=Arthur Schlesinger Jr. |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/briefing/articles/1997/01/its_my_vital_center.html |date=January 10, 1997 |accessdate=September 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger was also a critic of the 2003 [[Iraq War]] and called it a misadventure. He put much blame on the media for not covering a reasoned case against the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Good Foreign Policy a Casualty of War; Today, it is we Americans who live in infamy |author=Arthur Schlesinger Jr. |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/23/news/war-opschlesinger23 |date=March 23, 2003 |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |archivedate=March 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303064359/http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/23/news/war-opschlesinger23 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Schlesinger's name at birth was Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger; since his mid-teens, he had instead used the signature ''Arthur M.

==Death==

==Works==
He won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for History in 1946 for his book ''The Age of Jackson'', covering the intellectual environment of [[Jacksonian democracy]].

His 1949 book ''[[The Vital Center]]'' made a case for the [[New Deal]] policies of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and was harshly critical of both [[Economic liberalism|unregulated capitalism]] and of those liberals such as [[Henry A. Wallace]] who advocated coexistence with [[communism]].

In his book ''The Politics of Hope'' (1962), Schlesinger terms conservatives the "party of the past" and liberals "the party of hope" and calls for overcoming the division between both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans |publisher=Writing [[University of Pennsylvania]] |date=August 2, 2004 |url=http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html |accessdate=October 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303064359/http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html |archivedate=March 3, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He won a second Pulitzer in the Biography category in 1966 for ''A Thousand Days''.

His 1986 book ''The Cycles of American History'' was an early work on cycles in politics in the United States; it was influenced by his father's work on cycles.

He became a leading opponent of [[multiculturalism]] in the 1980s and articulated this stance in his book ''[[The Disuniting of America]]'' (1991).

Published posthumously in 2007, ''Journals 1952–2000'' is the 894-page distillation of 6,000 pages of Schlesinger diaries on a wide variety of subjects, edited by Andrew and Stephen Schlesinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Social Historian |authorlink=Maureen Dowd |first=Maureen |last=Dowd |work=The New York Times |date=October 7, 2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/books/review/Dowd-t.html&amp;OQ=_rQ3D2Q26refQ3DreviewQ26pagewantedQ3Dall&amp;OP=42e1da6bQ2FPz2hPJmGAQ26mm)IPIQ51Q51Q60PfQ51PQ51Q60PhmmgAPQ262.e2zPQ27mzJp)rQ5E)jY |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Astronomical symbols in 1833 Nautical Almanac.png|thumbnail|right|This excerpt from the 1833 Nautical Almanac demonstrates the use of astronomical symbols, including symbols for the phases of the moon, the planets, and zodiacal constellations.]]
[[File:Bezeichnung der Himmelskörper Encke 1850.png|thumb|upright=0.75|"Designation of celestial bodies" in a German almanac printed in 1850&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Franz Encke]], ''Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch für 1853'', Berlin 1850, p. VIII&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Astronomical symbols''' are abstract pictorial [[symbol]]s used to represent [[astronomical object]]s, theoretical constructs and observational events in [[astronomy]]. The earliest forms of these symbols appear in Greek [[papyrus]] texts of late [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]]. The Byzantine [[codex|codices]] in which many Greek papyrus texts were preserved continued and extended the inventory of astronomical symbols.&lt;ref name="neugebauer-1975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neugebauer-1987" /&gt; New symbols were further invented to represent many newly-discovered [[planet]]s and [[minor planet]]s discovered in the 18th to the 20th centuries.

These symbols were once commonly used by professional [[astronomer]]s, amateur astronomers, [[Alchemical symbol|alchemists]], and [[astrologer]]s. While they are still commonly used in almanacs and astrological publications, their occurrence in published research and texts on astronomy is relatively infrequent,&lt;ref name=pasko&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some exceptions such as the Sun and Earth symbols appearing in [[astronomical constant]]s, and certain zodiacal signs used to represent the [[Solstice|solstices]] and [[Equinox|equinoxes]].

[[Unicode]] has formally assigned code points to most symbols, mainly in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] Block &lt;ref name="Unicode-2600"&gt;{{cite web

== Symbols for the Sun and Moon ==
The use of astronomical symbols for the Sun and Moon dates to antiquity. The forms of the symbols that appear in the original papyrus texts of Greek horoscopes are a circle with one ray ([[File:Old symbol for sun.svg|x15px|old sun symbol]]) for the Sun and a crescent for the Moon.&lt;ref name=neugebauer-1987&gt;{{cite book

[[File:F4.v. zodiac circle with planets - NLW MS 735C.png|thumb|Medieval depiction of the [[zodiac]] and the [[classical planets]]. The planets are represented by seven faces.]]

A diagram in Byzantine astronomer Johannes Kamateros's 12th century ''Compendium of Astrology'' shows the Sun represented by the circle with a ray, Jupiter by the letter ''zeta'' (the initial of [[Zeus]], Jupiter's counterpart in [[Greek mythology]]), Mars by a shield crossed by a spear, and the remaining classical planets by symbols resembling the modern ones, without the cross-mark seen in modern versions of the symbols. These cross-marks first appear around the 16th century. According to Maunder, the addition of crosses appears to be "an attempt to give a savour of Christianity to the symbols of the old pagan gods."&lt;ref name=maunder /&gt;

The symbols for [[Uranus]] were created shortly after its discovery. One symbol, [[File:Uranus symbol.svg|15px|Uranus]], invented by [[Johann Gottfried Koehler|J. G. Köhler]] and refined by [[Johann Elert Bode|Bode]], was intended to represent the newly discovered metal [[platinum]]; since platinum, commonly called white gold, was found by chemists mixed with iron, the symbol for platinum combines the alchemical symbols for [[iron]], ♂, and [[gold]], ☉.&lt;ref name=bode-uranus&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol also combines the symbols of Mars (♂) and the Sun (☉) because in Greek mythology Uranus represented heaven, and represents the combined power of Mars's spear and the Sun.&lt;ref name=Cain&gt;{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraser|title=Symbol for Uranus|url=http://www.universetoday.com/19126/symbol-for-uranus/|website=Universe Today|accessdate=2013-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103224135/http://www.universetoday.com/19126/symbol-for-uranus/|archive-date=2017-01-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another symbol, [[File:Uranus's astrological symbol.svg|15px|Uranus]], was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as "un globe surmonté par la première lettre de votre nom" ("a globe surmounted by the first letter of your name").&lt;ref name=Francisca&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The meaning of the symbol H+o for the planet Uranus |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1917Obs....40..306H&amp;link_type=ARTICLE&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high= |author=Francisca Herschel|date=1917|journal=The Observatory |volume=40 |pages=306 |bibcode=1917Obs....40..306H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several symbols were proposed for [[Neptune]] to accompany the suggested names for the planet. Claiming the right to name his discovery, [[Urbain Le Verrier]] originally proposed the name ''Neptune''&lt;ref name="littmann-standish"&gt;

The [[International Astronomical Union]] discourages the use of these symbols in journal articles.

The symbol for [[2 Pallas]], the spear of [[Athena|Pallas Athena]], was invented by Baron [[Franz Xaver von Zach]], who organized a group of twenty-four astronomers to search for a planet between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. The symbol was introduced by von Zach in his ''Monatliche correspondenz zur beförderung der erd- und himmels-kunde''.&lt;ref name=mcbeh-v6&gt;von Zach, Franz Xaver (1802). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nR04AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 Monatliche correspondenz zur beförderung der erd- und himmels-kunde, Volume 6]''. pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a letter to von Zach, discoverer [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers]] (who had named the newly discovered asteroid) expressed his approval of the proposed symbol, but wished that the handle of the sickle of Ceres had been adorned with a pommel instead of a crossbar, to better differentiate it from the sign of Venus.&lt;ref name=mcbeh-v6 /&gt;

German astronomer [[Karl Ludwig Harding]] created the symbol for [[3 Juno]]. Harding, who discovered this asteroid in 1804, proposed the name [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and the use of a scepter topped with a star as its astronomical symbol.&lt;ref name=mcbeh-v10&gt;{{cite book

The symbol for [[4 Vesta]] was invented by German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. Dr. Olbers, having previously discovered and named 2 Pallas, gave Gauss the honor of naming his newest discovery. Gauss decided to name the new asteroid for the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], and also designed the symbol ([[File:Simbolo di Vesta.svg|18px|Vesta]]): the altar of the goddess, with the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|sacred fire]] burning on it.&lt;ref name=mcbeh-v15&gt;{{cite book

[[Johann Franz Encke]] made a major change in the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (BAJ, Berlin Astronomical Yearbook) for the year 1854, published in 1851. He introduced encircled numbers instead of symbols, although his numbering began with [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], the first four asteroids continuing to be denoted by their traditional symbols. This symbolic innovation was adopted very quickly by the astronomical community. The following year (1852), Astraea's number was bumped up to 5, but Ceres through Vesta would be listed by their numbers only in the 1867 edition. The circle later became a pair of parentheses, and the parentheses were sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades.&lt;ref name="hilton"/&gt;

A few asteroids were given symbols by their discoverers after the encircled-number notation became widespread. [[26 Proserpina]], [[28 Bellona]], [[35 Leukothea]], and [[37 Fides]], all discovered by German astronomer [[Karl Theodor Robert Luther|Robert Luther]] between 1853 and 1855, were assigned, respectively, a pomegranate with a star inside;&lt;ref name=an-proserpina&gt;{{cite journal

== Symbols for zodiac constellations and signs ==
The zodiac symbols have several astronomical interpretations. Depending on context, a zodiac symbol may denote either a constellation, or a point or interval on the ecliptic plane.

Lists of astronomical phenomena published by almanacs sometimes included conjunctions of stars and planets or the Moon; rather than print the full name of the star, a Greek letter and the symbol for the constellation of the star was sometimes used instead.&lt;ref name=naae-1833&gt;

{{cite book

}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The ecliptic was sometimes divided into 12 ''signs'', each subdivided into 30 degrees,&lt;ref name=britannica-1823&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''sign'' component of ecliptic longitude was expressed either with a number from 0 to 11&lt;ref name="naae-1834-signs"&gt;

{{cite book
| title = The Nautical Almanac and the Astronomical Ephemeris for the year 1834
| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Bf8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR13
| date = 1833
| page = xiii
}} The 1834 edition of the Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris abandoned the use of numerical signs (among other innovations); compare the representation of (ecliptic) longitude in the editions for the years [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bf8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 1834] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=3fMNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA2 1833].

&lt;/ref&gt; or with the corresponding zodiac symbol.&lt;ref name=joyce /&gt;

In modern academic usage, all the constellations, including the twelve of the zodiac, have dedicated three-letter abbreviations.&lt;ref name=iau-style-manual-constellations&gt;

{{cite book
| title = The IAU Style Manual
| url = https://www.iau.org/static/publications/stylemanual1989.pdf

| archive-date=2018-06-21 
| dead-url=no
}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The zodiac symbols are also sometimes used to represent points on the ecliptic, particularly the solstices and equinoxes. Each symbol is taken to represent the "first point" of each sign.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ♈︎ the symbol for Aries, represents the [[March equinox]]; ♋︎, for Cancer, the [[June solstice]]; ♎︎, for Libra, the [[September equinox]]; and ♑︎, for Capricorn, the [[December solstice]].

== Other symbols ==

Symbols for [[Astrological aspect|aspects]] and [[Orbital node|nodes]] appear in medieval texts, although medieval and modern usage of the node symbols differ; the modern ascending node symbol (☊) formerly stood for the descending node, and the modern descending node symbol (☋) was used for the ascending node.&lt;ref name=neugebauer-1987 /&gt; In describing the [[Keplerian elements]] of an orbit, ☊ is sometimes used to denote the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitude]] of the ascending node, although it is more common to use Ω (capital omega), which was originally a typographical substitute for the astronomical symbol.&lt;ref name=covington&gt;{{cite book

Symbols for a comet (☄) and a star ([[File:Astronomical symbol for star.svg|x10px]]) have been used in published astronomical observations of comets. In tables of these observations, ☄ stood for the comet being discussed and [[File:Astronomical symbol for star.svg|x10px]] for the star of comparison relative to which measurements of the comet's position were made.&lt;ref name=an-comet-star/&gt;

{{other uses|Black knight (disambiguation)}}
The '''black knight''' is a literary [[stock character]] who masks their identity and that of their liege by not displaying [[heraldry]]. Black knights are usually portrayed as [[villain]]ous figures who use this anonymity for misdeeds. They are often contrasted with the [[knight-errant]] (white knight). The character appeared in [[Arthurian literature]] and has been adapted and adopted by various authors, in cinema and [[popular culture]]. The [[Character (arts)|character]] is sometimes associated with death or [[Black-and-white dualism|darkness]].

==Historical significance==
*Edward of Woodstock, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall, Prince of Aquitaine. The eldest son of King Edward III, father to King Richard II of England, was an exceptional military leader popularly known as the "[[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]]".
*[[James Stewart, the Black Knight of Lorn]], a descendant of [[Robert I of Scotland]], lived in the late 14th and early 15th centuries.
*[[Knights Hospitaller]], distinguished by their black mantles.
*[[Zawisza the Black of Garbów]] also known as "the Black Knight" or "First knight of Europe", was a Polish knight and nobleman. He served as a soldier and diplomat under the Polish king [[Władysław II Jagiello]] and Hungarian-Bohemian king [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]]. During his life, he was regarded as a model of knightly virtues and was renowned for winning multiple tournaments in Europe. His nickname is due to his black hair and his custom-made, black armor, which is kept at the [[Jasna Góra Monastery]]. In 1410 he took part in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] against the [[Teutonic Order]]. In 1412 he participated in the conference between Sigismund, and [[Tvrtko II of Bosnia]] at Buda, where he won the tournament held there, with 1500 knights present. In 1416 he participated in a tournament in [[Perpignan]] in which he defeated the well-known knight/king [[John II of Aragon]]. In 1428, Zawisza, with his retinue as a commander of light horse banner of 500 horsemen, joined the forces of Sigismund in the king's war against the [[Ottoman Turks]]. During that disastrous campaign he fought the Turks at the [[Siege of Golubac]] on the [[Danube]] in modern-day [[Serbia]]. Sigismund's army was defeated by the Turkish forces. They had to retreat across the Danube, with only a few boats to ferry the troops over to safety. Zawisza's banner was guarding the retreating army. Being a man of importance, he was personally sent for by king Sigismund. He allegedly refused to retreat, disheartened by the king's apparent cowardice. He was either killed in combat or executed in Turkish captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beata Możejko|author2=Sobiesław Szybkowski|author3=Błażej Śliwiński|title=Zawisza Czarny z Garbowa herbu Sulima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Xy8AAAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Wydawn.

Then the damosel, when she saw that knight, she bade him flee down that valley, for his horse was not saddled. Gramercy, said Beaumains, for always ye would have me a coward. With that the Black Knight, when she came nigh him, spake and said, Damosel, have ye brought this knight of King Arthur to be your champion? Nay, fair knight, said she, this is but a kitchen knave that was fed in King Arthur's kitchen for alms. Why cometh he, said the knight, in such array? it is shame that he beareth you company. "
* ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' by [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]
* ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]]: [[Richard the Lionhearted]] poses as an unknown black knight to avoid detection while in England, fighting alongside Ivanhoe in a tournament and helping the assault on Front-de-Boeuf's castle.

* ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lambdin |first=Laura C. |authorlink=Laura C. Lambdin |title=Encyclopedia of medieval literature |year= 2000|publisher= |quote=The black knight condemns Fortune, who introduced him to the perfect woman, and allowed him ... | url=https://books.google.com/?id=wGDxxU-LDHkC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Black+knight+in+literature |isbn=0-313-30054-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Die Jungfrau von Orleans'' (''[[The Maid of Orleans (play)|The Maid of Orleans]]'') by [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1801).

* [[Marvel Comics]] has different characters that went by the name [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]].

==Video Games==

* In Fortnite Battle Royale the tier 70 battle pass skin of season 2 is the Black Knight.

==Sports ==
* The [[Army Black Knights|Black Knights]] are the United States Military Academy at West Point's mascots in a number of sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Army West Point unveils new brand identity, logo for athletic teams '=' NCAA.com'='url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/ncaa/article/2015-04-14/army-west-point-unveils-new-brand-identity-logo-athletic-teams'='website=ncaa.com'='publisher=national collegiate athletic association|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Black Knight is a moniker given to golfer [[Gary Player]] in the 1960s by the media for his penchant for black attire on and off the golf course and for his courteous demeanour. The Black Knight logo identifies all the companies of the Gary Player Group.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Finance==
In [[business sector | business]], a [[White knight (business) |white knight]] is a friendly investor or savior, while a [[Black knight (business)|black knight]] functions as a destroyer. Typically, a black knight will enter a [[business]] or [[company]] as an influential person such as a major investor or as a member of the board of directors and will dismantle a profitable or asset-rich business to enrich themselves, which typically leaves the previously profitable company in a weaker financial position.{{citation needed|date= August 2013}}

Such black knights achieve their aims by:
* siphoning out cash through high personal expenses, salaries and bonuses
* selling off profitable parts of the business to a private company related to the black knight
* buying unprofitable businesses / assets previously owned by the black knight
* selling assets at below market value to persons related to the black knight
* buying assets at inflated prices

Occasionally, the term ''black knight'' describes an investor who acquires a firm in opposition to the will of its [[business management | management]], as in a [[hostile takeover]]. The label may not be accurate if the ultimate intention of the acquirer is unknown. It could be for commercial reasons (rather than personal reasons), such as merging the entity with another entity owned by the acquirer to promote [[synergy]].{{citation needed|date= September 2013}}

'''Gay balls''', '''cross dressing balls''' or '''drag balls''', depending on the place, time, and type, were public or private balls, celebrated mainly in the first third of the twentieth century, where [[cross dressing]] and [[ballroom dancing]] with same sex partners was allowed. By the 1900s, the balls had become important cultural events for gays and lesbians, even attracting tourists. Their golden age was during the [[Interwar period]], mainly in [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]], even though they could be found in many big cities in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]].

By the end of the 17th century, a [[gay subculture]] is documented in Europe, with their [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] areas, their [[gay bar|bars]], their parties and balls, their [[cross-dresser]]s, and their own [[Gay slang|slang]]. Scholars like [[Randolph Trumbach]] consider it is the moment when gay subculture appears in Europe. On the contrary, historian [[Rictor Norton]] considers unlikely that such a subculture would appear fully formed, and thinks that it was actually the increase in surveillance and police procedures that brought to the surface an underground culture that had not been visible up to that moment.&lt;ref name="RNorton"&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Rictor|author-link=Rictor Norton|title=The Gay Subculture in Early Eighteenth-Century London|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/molly2.htm|access-date=2013-10-12|work=Rick Norton's Web Page|date=2008-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archives of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] in [[Lisbon]] preserve information of the so-called "''danças dos [[fanchono]]s''" from the beginning of the 17 century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rapp|first=Linda|title=Portugal|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/portugal.html|access-date=2013-10-12|work=glbtq: An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture|date=2010-05-18|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129065151/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/portugal.html|archive-date=2014-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1620, the "''fachonos''", the baroque equivalent of modern [[drag queen]]s, organized big parties in the ''Gaia Lisboa'', the gay Lisbon. These itinerant celebrations, called "''escarramão''", or "''esparramão''", used to include [[pantomime]]s with racy scenes, where some of the participants were dressed as women, and other as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tríbades galantes, fanchonos militantes|last=Torrão Filho|first=Almilcar|publisher=GLS|pages=140|language=pt|year=2000|isbn=85-86755-24-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Majesty's High Court in [[Mexico City]] discovered in 1656 a similar case, when Juan Correa, an old man, over 70 years old, confessed that he had been committing the unspeakable vice since his childhood. Correa's house, in the outskirts of the city, had been used as a meeting point to celebrate balls, where many men dressed as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Quemando Mariposas.

Several studies have not found similar phenomena in the judicial cases in [[Aragon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Au nom du sexe : inquisition et répression sexuelle en Aragon, 1560-1700|author=Fernandez, André|publisher=L'Harmattan|location=París|language=fr|year=2003|isbn=2747545261}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catalonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sodomites catalans.

By the end of the 17th century, there was a completely developed gay subculture in [[London]], with the [[molly house]]s used as clubs, where gays met regularly to drink, dance and have fun. These taverns are well known thanks to the [[Mother Clap]]'s molly house scandal from 1726, when a police raid discovered that her molly house was a gay brothel.&lt;ref name="RNorton"/&gt;

== Cross dressing balls ==
[[File:Teschenberg Hermann von (1866-1911).jpg|thumb|Hermann von Teschenberg (1866-1911) dressed as woman. Teschenberg, a cross-dresser, was one of the founders of the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]].]]

=== Germany ===
==== The Empire ====
Berlin's clandestine gay underground can be followed up to the 18th century, in spite of the persecution gays were suffering. In [[Prussia]], Paragraph 143 of the penal code, and later the introduction of [[Paragraph 175]] in the [[Strafgesetzbuch|German penal code]], with other laws for [[public scandal]], and [[child protection]], made the life of gays extremely difficult. Clearly, not the activities of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] or the [[LGBT social movements#LGBT movement emergence|first homosexual movement]] could avoid the regular police raids and closing of premises in the 1900s. And not just the premises were being watched by the police, in 1883, the moral police had 4799 "transvestite" and [[transgender]] woman under vigilance, even though "permits" could be handed out to cross-dressers in cases considered "medical".&lt;ref name="AS1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Goodbye to Berlin? 100 Jahre Schwulenbewegung|last=Sternweiler|first=Andreas|authorlink=Andreas Sternweiler|publisher=Verlag Rosa Winkel|location=Berlin|pages=70–74|language=de|year=1997|editor1=Sternweiler, Andreas|editor2=Hannesen, Hans Gerhard|isbn=3-86149-062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thus surprising that, beginning mid 19th century, the ''Urningsball'' or ''Tuntenball'' came to be, balls of [[uranian]]s, or queens, tolerated, but watched by the police. By the 1900s, these balls had achieved such a fame in Germany, that people from all around the country, and even foreign tourists, would travel to Berlin to participate.&lt;ref name="AS1997"/&gt; These balls were celebrated in large ballrooms, as the Deutscher Kaiser, in the Lothringer Straße, or the Filarmonía, in the Bernburgstraße, the Dresdner Kasino, in the Dresdner Straße, or the Orpheum, in the Alter Jakobstraße 32.&lt;ref name="WT1984"&gt;{{cite book |title=Eldorado. Homosexuelle Frauen und Männer in Berlin 1850-1950. Geschichte, Alltag und Kultur|last=Theis|first=Wolfgang|last2=Sternweiler|first2=Andreas|publisher=Fröhlich und Kaufmann|location=Berlín|pages=60–61|language=de|year=1984|editor=Berlin Museum|isbn=3-88725-068-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''[[Berliner Morgenpost]]'' described extensively on October 17, 1899, a gay ball that had taken place in the hotel König von Portugal, where balls were still being celebrated in 1918.&lt;ref name="AS1997"/&gt; The ball season used to begin in October and go until Easter, with a frequency of several baa week, sometimes two the same day.&lt;ref name="WT1984"/&gt; Hirschfeld, in his book ''Berlins drittes Geschlecht'' (1904; "Berlín's Third Sex"), described the balls in following fashion:

{{quote|The innkeepers of uranian taverns, but certainly not just them, organize large urning balls, especially in the course of the winter, that, in their size and type, are a specialty of Berlin. Outstanding strangers, especially foreigners, who want to see something very special in the youngest European world-cities, are shown by higher officials [to these balls] as one of the most interesting sights. [...] During the high season from October to Easter, these balls are held several times a week, often even several a night. Even though the entrance fee is rarely less than 1.50 [[German marks|marks]], these events are usually well visited. Almost always, several secret policemen are present that make sure that nothing disgraceful happens; as far as I am informed, there was never any occasion to intervene. The organizers have the right to admit, if possible, only people who are known to them as homosexual.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Own translation from original: {{quote|''Von einigen Wirten urnischer Lokale, aber durchaus nicht von diesen allein, werden namentlich im Winterhalbjahr große Urningsbälle veranstaltet, die in ihrer Art und Ausdehnung eine Spezialität von Berlin sind. Hervorragenden Fremden, namentlich Ausländern, die in der jüngsten der europäischen Weltstädte etwas ganz Besonderes zu sehen wünschen, werden sie von höheren Beamten als eine der interessantesten Sehenswürdigkeiten gezeigt. [...] In der Hochsaison von Oktober bis Ostern finden diese Bälle in der Woche mehrmals, oft sogar mehrere an einem Abend statt. Trotzdem das Eintrittsgeld selten weniger als 1,50 Mark beträgt, sind diese Veranstaltungen meist gut besucht. Fast stets sind mehrere Geheimpolizisten zugegen, die achtgeben, daß nichts Ungeziemendes vorkommt; soweit ich unterrichtet bin, lag aber noch nie ein Anlaß vor, einzuschreiten. Die Veranstalter haben Ordre, möglichst nur Personen einzulassen, die ihnen als homosexuell bekannt sind.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the balls were especially well known, particularly those shortly after New Year, on which the new, often self-made dresses are presented. When I visited this ball last year with some medical colleagues, there were about 800 people participating. Around 10 o'clock in the evening, the large halls are still almost deserted. The rooms begin to fill only after eleven o'clock. Many visitors dress in formal or street suit, but many are costumed. Some appear densely masked in impenetrable [[Domino mask|dominoes]], they come and go without anyone knowing who they are; others reveal their faces at midnight, some come in fantastical costumes, a large part in evening gowns, some in simple, others in very elaborate toilets. I saw a South American man in a robe from Paris, it's price had to be over 2,000 francs.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Own translation from original: {{quote|''Einige der Bälle erfreuen sich eines besonderen Renommées, vor allem der kurz nach Neujahr veranstaltete, auf dem die neuen, vielfach selbst gefertigten Toiletten vorgeführt werden. Als ich diesen Ball im letzten Jahr mit einigen ärztlichen Kollegen besuchte, waren gegen 800 Personen zugegen. Gegen 10 Uhr abends sind die großen Säle noch fast menschenleer. Erst nach 11 Uhr beginnen sich die Räume zu füllen. Viele Besucher sind im Gesellschafts- oder Straßen-Anzug, sehr viele aber auch kostümiert. Einige erscheinen dicht maskiert in undurchdringlichen Dominos, sie kommen und gehen, ohne daß jemand ahnt, wer sie gewesen sind; andere lüften die Larve um Mitternacht, ein Teil kommt in Phantasiegewändern, ein großer Teil in Damenkleidern, manche in einfachen, andere in sehr kostbaren Toiletten. Ich sah einen Südamerikaner in einer Pariser Robe, deren Preis über 2000 Francs betragen sollte.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not few seem so feminine in their appearance and movements, that even connoisseurs find it hard to recognize the man. [...] Real women are only very sparse on these balls, only now and then does a uranist bring his landlady, a friend, or... his wife. In the case of the uranist, one does not proceed so strictly as on the analogous urninde balls, on which "real men" are strictly denied access. Most distasteful and repulsive [sight] on the balls are the not so infrequent gentlemen that, in spite of coming "as women", keep their stately mustaches or even a full-beard. The most beautiful costumes are greeted by a sign of the ceremony master with a thundering fanfare and guided by him through the hall. Between 12 and 1 o'clock the ball usually reaches its peak. At about 2 o'clock, the coffee break — the main source of income for the owner — takes place. In a few minutes, long tables are installed and layed, with several hundred people sitting at them; some humorous songs and dances of the attendant "lady imitators" season the conversation, then the cheerful activity continues until the early morning.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Own translation from original: {{quote|''Nicht wenige wirken in ihrem Aussehen und ihren Bewegungen so weiblich, daß es selbst Kennern schwer fällt, den Mann zu erkennen. [...] Wirkliche Weiber sind auf diesen Bällen nur ganz spärlich vorhanden, nur dann und wann bringt ein Uranier seine Wirtin, eine Freundin oder – seine Ehefrau mit. Man verfährt im allgemeinen bei den Urningen nicht so streng wie auf den analogen Urnindenbällen, auf denen jedem »echten Mann« strengstens der Zutritt versagt ist. Am geschmacklosesten und abstoßendsten wirken auf den Bällen der Homosexuellen die ebenfalls nicht vereinzelten Herren, die trotz eines stattlichen Schnurrbartes oder gar Vollbartes »als Weib« kommen. Die schönsten Kostüme werden auf ein Zeichen des Einberufers mit donnerndem Tusch empfangen und von diesem selbst durch den Saal geleitet. Zwischen 12 und 1 Uhr erreicht der Besuch gewöhnlich seinen Höhepunkt. Gegen 2 Uhr findet die Kaffeepause – die Haupteinnahmequelle des Saalinhabers – statt. In wenigen Minuten sind lange Tafeln aufgeschlagen und gedeckt, an denen mehrere hundert Personen Platz nehmen; einige humoristische Gesangsvorträge und Tänze anwesender »Damenimitatoren« würzen die Unterhaltung, dann setzt sich das fröhliche Treiben bis zum frühen Morgen fort.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Magnus Hirschfeld, ''Berlins Drittes Geschlecht'' (1904), «[http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/6275/3 Kapitel 3]»}}

As a consequence of the [[Harden–Eulenburg affair]], and the subsequent social upheaval, the balls where prohibited; in 1910 they were allowed again, but they never achieved the splendor of this golden age.&lt;ref name="WT1984"/&gt;

==== The Weimar Republic ====
After the [[I World War]] appeared the first mass movements for homosexuals, the ''Freundschaftsbund'', popular associations of gays and lesbians that dedicated an important part of their effort to socialization and diverse activities for their members, like excursions, visits, sports, and balls. For example, the club ''Kameradschaft'' ("camaraderie") organized on November 1, 1929, celebrating their anniversary, a Böser-Buben-Ball ("Bad Boys Ball"); the club reached 100 members, and survived until 1933. ''Kameradschaft'' tried to offer some support and activities for gays from lower extraction; so their balls were celebrated on weekends, Saturdays or Sundays, and gathered about 70 men, many without a job, who could pay the low entry price.&lt;ref name="AS21997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Goodbye to Berlin? 100 Jahre Schwulenbewegung|last=Sternweiler|first=Andreas|authorlink=Andreas Sternweiler|publisher=Verlag Rosa Winkel|location=Berlin|pages=95–104|language=de|year=1997|editor1=Sternweiler, Andreas|editor2=Hannesen, Hans Gerhard|isbn=3-86149-062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 the association Gesellschaftsklub Aleksander e.V. celebrated balls every day, beginning 7 o'clock p.m., with a quality orchestra. In 1927 the [[Bund für Menschenrecht]] (BfM) bought the Alexander-Palast, but that same year they changed to the Florida and the Tanz-Palast salon of the Zauberflöte, in the Kommandantenstraße 72, in Berlin. The BfM balls took place from Tuesdays to Sundays; the entry was free, but you had to pay 50 [[Pfennig]] for a [[dance card]] that allowed you to actually dance.&lt;ref name="WT19842"&gt;{{cite book |title=Eldorado.

And not just in Berlin, several other cities in Germany organized smaller balls for gays.&lt;ref name="AS21997"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-0121-500, Berlin, Bar "Eldorado".jpg|thumb|The Eldorado of the Motzstraße, in Berlín, 1932. The sign includes their motto: "Hier ist's Richtig!".]]
In the 1920s and 30s, there were uncountable bars, cafés, and dance halls in Berlin. The most elegant could be found in [[West Berlin]], near the area formed by the Bülowstraße, the Potsdamer Straße, and the Nollendorfplatz, reaching up to the Kurfürstendamm.&lt;ref name="WT19842"/&gt; No doubt, the most famous was [[Eldorado (Berlin)|Eldorado]], that really was two, one on the Lutherstraße, and a second one in the Motzstraße.&lt;ref name="AS31997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Goodbye to Berlin? 100 Jahre Schwulenbewegung|last=Sternweiler|first=Andreas|authorlink=Andreas Sternweiler|publisher=Verlag Rosa Winkel|location=Berlin|pages=126–128|language=de|year=1997|editor1=Sternweiler, Andreas|editor2=Hannesen, Hans Gerhardhea|isbn=3-86149-062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Curt Moreck]] (Konrad Haemmerling) described it in 1931, in his ''Führer durch das „lasterhafte“ Berlin'' ("Guide through the 'dissolute' Berlin"), as "an establishment of [[transvestite]]s staged for the morbid fascination of the world metropolis." The program at the Eldorado included loud and racy shows by [[drag queen]]s, addressed mostly to an [[heterosexual]] audience, that, now as then, wanted to "satisfy their curiosity, and dared to visit the mysterious and infamous Berlin".&lt;ref name="raber"&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertito – Jahrbuch für die Geschichte der Homosexualitäten, 5. Jahrgang|last=Raber|first=Ralf Jörg|pages=50–52|language=de|year=2003|isbn=3-935596-25-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreck continues, even though he himself was encouraging, and was part of this kind of [[voyeur]]istic tourism with his travel guide:

{{quote|A dance hall of a larger style, with an extremely elegant audience. Tuxedos and tailcoats, and full evening dresses – this is the normality that comes to observe here. The actors are present in large numbers. Bright posters are already luring at the entrance, and paintings, where the perversity mocks itself, decorate the corridor. At the wardrobe begins the swindle. "Here it's right!"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The original German, ''Hier ist's richtig!'', can be translated in several ways; ''richtig'' can be translated as "right", "correct", "good", "adequate", "real", or "authentic". As can be seen in the text that follows, the meaning was not clear in German either.&lt;/ref&gt; A mysterious motto, that can mean anything. Everything is staged scenery, and only the worldly innocent believe in its authenticity. Even the real transvestites, who put their anomaly at the service of the business, become comedians here. Between the dances, where even the normal man can afford the naughty pleasure of dancing with an effeminate man in female dress, there are cabaret performances. A tomboy chanteuse sings with her shrill soprano voice ambiguous Parisian chansons. A very girlish [[revue]] star proceeds under the spotlight with female graceful pirouettes. He is naked except for the breast plates and a loincloth, and even this nakedness is deceptive, it still makes the spectators question, it still leaves doubts whether man, or woman. One of the most enchanting and elegant women present in the hall is often the dainty Bob, and there are enough men who, in the depths of their hearts, are sorry that he is not a girl, that nature, through an error, has deceived them of a delicate lover.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Own translation from original: {{quote|''Ein Tanzsaal größeren Stils mit einem äußerst eleganten Publikum. Smokings und Fräcke und große Abendroben – so präsentiert sich die Normalität, die zum Schauen hierher kommt. Die Akteurs sind in großer Zahl vorhanden. Grelle Plakate locken schon am Eingang, und Malereien, in denen die Perversität ihrer selbst spottet, schmücken den Gang. An der Garderobe setzt der Nepp ein. ‚Hier ist’s richtig!‘ heißt es auf den Affichen. Eine geheimnisvolle Devise, unter der man sich allerhand vorstellen kann. Alles ist Kulisse, und nur der ganz Weltfremde glaubt an ihre Echtheit. Selbst die echten Transvestiten, die ihre Abart in den Dienst des Geschäftes stellen, werden hier Komödianten. Zwischen den Tänzen, bei denen auch der Normale sich den pikanten Genuss leisten kann, mit einem effeminierten Manne in Frauenkleidern zu tanzen, gibt es Brettldarbietungen. Eine männliche Chanteuse singt mit ihrem schrillen Sopran zweideutige Pariser Chansons. Ein ganz mädchenhafter Revuestar tanzt unter dem Scheinwerferlicht weiblich graziöse Pirouetten. Er ist nackt bis auf die Brustschilde und einen Schamgurt, und selbst diese Nacktheit ist noch täuschend, sie macht den Zuschauern noch Kopfzerbrechen, sie läßt noch Zweifel, ob Mann ob Frau. Eine der entzückendsten und elegantesten Frauen, die im ganzen Saale anwesend sind, ist oft der zierliche Bob, und es gibt Männer genug, die in der Tiefe ihres Herzens bedauern, daß er kein Mädchen ist, daß die Natur sie durch einen Irrtum um eine deliziöse Geliebte betrogen hat.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Curt Moreck (1931)&lt;ref name="moreck"&gt;{{cite book |title=Führer durch das "lasterhafte" Berlin|last=Moreck|first=Curt|publisher=Verlag Moderne Stadtführer, Nicolaische Verlagsbuchhandlung|location=Leipzig|pages=180 f.|language=de|year=1931|isbn=3-87584-583-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the end of the 1920s, the German society had taken their image of homosexuals from this kind of establishment: decadent, refined, depraved, degenerate, tightly linked to drugs, wild sex, and prostitution. The [[Bund für Menschenrecht]] tried to distance gays of this kind of milieu in 1927, but to no avail. In 1932 the chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] started a campaign against the "depraved night of Berlin", and in October of that same year all balls for homosexuals were prohibited.&lt;ref name="WT19842"/&gt; On January 30, 1933, the nazi party came to power, and on February 23, 1933, the Prussian Interior Minister ordered that all bars "that have abused [their permit] to promote immorality" be closed. He was referring specially to those "that are frequented by those who pay homage to the anti-natural immorality". On March 4, 1933, the ''Berliner Tagblatt'' informed about the closing of some establishments the day before. Of the over 100 establishments catering to homosexuals in Berlin very few survived, and those would be used to help watch and control the homosexual population.&lt;ref name="grau"&gt;{{cite book |title=Homosexualität in der NS-Zeit|last=Grau|first=Günter|publisher=Fischer Taschenbuchverlag|location=Frankfurt am Main|pages=54, 56 f.|language=de|year=1993|isbn=3-596-11254-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, until the end of the 19th century, gays and lesbians met usually in private homes and [[literary salon]]s, hidden from the public, with the Opera Ball in [[Paris]] one of the few exceptions. The Opera Ball, celebrated yearly for carnival, allowed some small leeway. The first big public ball that allowed cross dressing was the Bal Bullier in 1880, in the Avenue de l'Observatoire, followed by the Bal Wagram in 1910.&lt;ref name="Dictionnaire"&gt;{{cite book | editor = [[Didier Eribon|Eribon, Didier]] | title = Dictionnaire des cultures gays et lesbiennes | chapter = Bals | publisher = Larousse | place = Paris | year = 2003 | isbn = 2035051649 | language = fr | pages = 55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War I, Paris became one of the nightlife centers in Europe, with focal points in [[Montmartre]], [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]], and [[Montparnasse]], and numerous short-lived bars catering to gays and lesbians, surviving between police raids, ruinous scandals, and the public's insatiable thirst for new thrills.

In the 1920s there were several balls in the [[Bastille]] area, mainly in the [[Rue de Lappe]], where workers, drunken sailors, and colonial soldiers gathered to dance. It wasn't strictly a homosexual milieu, but men could dance together, and you could find a partner for the night. [[Daniel Guérin]] described one of the dens as a place where "[...] workmen, prostitutes, society women, [[John (prostitution)|johns]], and [[LGBT slang|aunties]] all danced. In those relaxed and natural days, before the cops took over France, a chevalier could go out in public with a mate of the same sex, without being considered crazy.» On the other hand, Willy presents a completely different aspect of the milieu, "What you see are little delinquents, not too carefully washed but heavily made up, with caps on their heads and sporting brightly colored [[foulard]]s; these are the guys who, when they fail to make a buck here, will certainly be found hauling coal or other cargo."&lt;ref name="FT2006"/&gt;

The so-called ''bal de folles'', and later ''bal de invertis'', flourished in Paris after the I World War, and even in other French cities as [[Toulon]]. In Paris, homosexuals were attracted mainly to the Bal Musette de la Montaigne de Sainte-Geneviève, in the number 46 of the Rue Montaigne de Sainte-Geneviève, where you could find gays and lesbians.&lt;ref name="Dictionnaire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FT2006"/&gt; Later, the big balls for carnival attracted a gay public, as the one celebrated yearly in the Magic-City, in the [[Rue de l'Université (Paris)|rue de l'Université]], 180, inaugurated in 1920, and active until the prohibition on February 6, 1934. In time, the "Carnaval interlope" in Magic-City became a big event, visited by prominent [[vedette (cabaret)|vedette]] from the [[varieté]]s, like [[Mistinguett]], or [[Joséphine Baker]], that handed over awards to the best [[drag queen]]s. The Bal Wagram offered the opportunity to cross dress twice a year; at 1 a.m., the drag queens did the ''pont aux travestis'', a costume competition, doing the catwalk in front of the most selected people of Paris, that came to walk on the wild side for a night.&lt;ref name="Dictionnaire"/&gt; The drag queens participating came from all walks of life, and ages, and presented a savage satire of the society, its values, and its traditional hierarchies, with images of exaggerated femininity, and masculinity: countesses dressed in [[crinoline]], crazy virgins, oriental dancers, sailors, ruffians, or soldiers; theirs names were correspondingly colorful: Duchess of the Bubble, the Infante Eudoxie, the Mauve Mouse; the Dark One, Sweetie Pie, Fréda, the Englishwoman, Mad Maria, the Muse, the Teapot, the She-wolf, Sappho, Wet Cat, Little Piano, Princess of the Marshes, Marguerite if Burgundy, etc.&lt;ref name="FT2006"/&gt; [[Charles Étienne]], in his novel ''Notre-Dame-de-Lesbos'', describes "Didine" in following fashion:
{{quote|Stuffed into a yellow [[brocade]] dress, wearing a red wig topped by a trembling tiara of paste, the dress low-cut and in the back naked to the waist, revealing the physique of a prize fighter, a man climbed the staircase, twisting adroitly and with meticulous gestures lifting the long train of her skirts.|Charles Étienne, ''Notre-Dame-de-Lesbos''; translation Tamagne (2006)&lt;ref name="FT2006"/&gt;}}

{{quote|After the bruising attack outside, here the reception was more restrained, but quite as bitter, inside.

=== England ===
[[File:The Illustrated Police News - Police raid on a drag ball in Hulme.jpg|thumb|Front page of the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] ''[[The Illustrated Police News]]'' on the week of the raid at Temperance Hall, in [[Hulme]], [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name="TVV150607"/&gt;]]

There are at least two instances of cross dressing balls that have been documented in England. The first one was known through a police raid of a ball celebrated in [[Temperance Hall, Manchester|Temperance Hall]], in the [[Hulme]] area of [[Manchester]]. On September 24, 1880, the chief constable of Manchester received an anonymous information about an event "of an immoral character" that was about to take place in the Temperance Hall of Hulme. The detective [[Jerome Caminada]] introduced two policemen dressed as women amongst those that had been gathering in the ball room after 9 p.m. Of the 47 men that congregated, all dressed in the most wild dresses, 22 as women; a pair was dressed as [[Henry VIII]] and [[Anne Boleyn]], and another as [[Romeo and Juliet]]. Detective Caminada observed the ball from a neighboring roof, all young men between 20 and 30 years old, that had begun dancing about 10 p.m.; every now and then, a couple disappeared into a side room. About 1 a.m., after detective Caminada thought enough crimes had been committed, he gained entry shouting the password "sister" in an effeminate manner. After the door was opened, the police raided the building, and detained all participants.&lt;ref name="TVV150607"&gt;{{cite web|last=Buckley|first=Angela|title=Detective Caminada and the cross dressing ball...|url=http://virtualvictorian.blogspot.de/2014/06/detective-caminada-and-cross-dressing.html|work=The Virtual Victorian|language=en|date=2014-06-24|access-date=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LGBT History Source Guide Launch: Manchester’s Drag Ball, Mon 22 August|url=https://manchesterarchiveplus.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/lgbt-history-source-guide-launch-lgfoundation-manclibraries-manchesterpride/|work=Archives+|language=en|date=2011-08-17|access-date=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial showed that the dancers were not from Manchester, they were regulars of similar balls that were organized in several cities, as [[Leeds]], or [[Nottingham]]. The judge, thinking about the possible scandal for the city, let them go free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zagria|title=The Temperance Hall, Hulme.|url=http://zagria.blogspot.de/2012/02/temperance-hall-hulme.html#.VXQY-7z1G1E|work=A Gender Variance Who's Who|language=en|date=2012-02-10|access-date=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Matt Houlbrook, of the [[University of Liverpool]], affirms that in the 1920s and 30s, cross dressing balls were being held secretly almost every weekend, gathering 50 to 100 men. And this, in spite of it being illegal, and being a big personal risk for those participating: they didn't just risk prison, if found out, they could loose their livelihood, be isolated socially, and finally suffer a nervous breakdown, or try suicide. In 1933 headlines informed about "[[Lady Austin's Camp Boys]]" scandal. The affair begun when 60 men were detained in a private ball room, in [[Holland Park Avenue]], in [[London]], after cross dressing police officers had been watching them dancing, made up, dressed as women, and having sex. Twenty seven men were arrested, and convicted between 3 and 20 months of jail. Even so, many stood up for their behavior, notoriously Lady Austin, who said "There is nothing wrong [in who we are]. You call us nancies and bum boys but before long our cult will be allowed in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Branigan|first=Tania|title=Pride and prejudice in the gay 1920s|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jul/03/gayrights.world|work=The Guardian|language=en|date=2004-07-03|access-date=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Transpontine|title=A London Drag Ball, 1930s|url=http://history-is-made-at-night.blogspot.de/2008/05/london-drag-ball-1930s.html|work=History is made at night|language=en|date=2008-05-27|access-date=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
Mid 19th century, during the reign in [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]], appeared the ''sociedades de baile'', "ball societies", mostly groups of young people that tried to rent some premises to organize a ball; but there were also other, more elegant, or pretentious, that rented theaters for their balls. The ball societies exclusively catering to gays appeared shortly after, mainly in [[Madrid]], and [[Barcelona]], as there were no special requirements to create one, and could be established, and broken up very easily. The most important ball society for the "[[Uranian]] flock" met at the El Ramillete, in the calle Alvareda, in Madrid, where you could count "over a hundred [[sodomy|sodomites]] with elegant suits, and rich jewelery". In Barcelona, later, during the regency of [[Maria Christina of Austria|Maria Christina]], the biggest number of gay dancers met at the Liceo Rius.&lt;ref name="PF1999"&gt;{{cite book |title=homo. tod@ la historia. El cambio finisecular|last=Fuentes|first=Pablo|publisher=Bauprés|location=Barcelona|pages=15|language=es|year=1999|editor=Navarro, Francesc|isbn=84-345-6842-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FVG2011"&gt;{{cite book |title=«Los Invisibles»: una historia de la homosexualidad masculina en España, 1850-1939|last=Vázquez García|first=Francisco|last2=Cleminson|first2=Richard|authorlink2=Richard Cleminson|publisher=Comares|location=Granada|page=263|language=es|year=2011|isbn=978-84-9836-783-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dancing public was off all types, but mainly transvestites and young men of the working class —workers of trade, and commerce, workshop apprentices, and servants—, for whom the balls were the highest point of their lives: exploited by their employers, and frightened of being discovered by the society. The balls allowed them to forget their situation for a couple of hours, express themselves with freedom, mingle with their equals, and, with a little luck, meet someone. Other, less fortunate, as was the case for transvestites, effeminate men, and «chulitos de barrio», neighborhood thugs, without a job, or rejected by their families, they used the balls to find their first time customers. For carnival, huge balls were celebrated, and the boys spend the whole year preparing their costumes for that important day.&lt;ref name="PF1999"/&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, all these balls had already disappeared, and were just a memory of the past, as recounts the author [[Max Bembo]] in his book, ''La mala vida en Barcelona'' ("The Bad Life in Barcelona"): "I could not find in the homosexualism of Barcelona the appearance it used to have; the parties where the baptism of homosexuals were celebrated; the very scandalous balls; the [[Sardanapalus|sardanapalic]] festivities, the shame of the city". It's very probable that the disappearance of these public balls was due to the application of laws of [[public indecency]], and the consequent withdrawal of the homosexual life into private residencies, and clubs.&lt;ref name="FVG2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PF1999"/&gt;

=== United States ===
==== Stag dance ====
[[File:Nr.28. COWBOY 'DANCE STAG'.jpg|thumb|Cowboy stag dance from about 1910.]]
During the 19th century, in the United States, mainly in the [[American frontier|Great West Frontier]], there were many towns where women were few and far between. So, for [[cowboy]]s, [[miner]]s, [[Lumberjack|loggers]], or railroad workers, it was very difficult to find a woman, and marry. In these groups, men often formed intimate friendships, that sometimes ended in real love stories, that were accepted as a fact of life. It is difficult to know up to what point this was simply due to the lack of women, or if precisely this kind of life attracted those men that preferred the company of other men.&lt;ref name="BGB2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gleich und anders|last=Beemyn|first=Brett Genny|publisher=Murmann|location=Hamburg|pages=158–159|language=de|year=2007|editor=Aldrich, Robert|isbn=3-938017-81-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this environment, and in the military,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In military circles it was not uncommon to organize balls where men would dance with each other, as women could not be part of the military, and very often were not available. There are several short films documenting the fact, as ''[http://www.britishpathe.com/video/jacks-the-dasant/query/FRENCH Jacks 'the Dasant']'', from 1922, that shows a ball celebrated on the HMS Hood, with Brazilian, U.S., French, and Japanese sailors participating; ''[http://www.britishpathe.com/video/interned-sailors-1/query/homo-erotic Interned Sailors]'', from about 1914-1918, is a short film of unknown origin, depicting a group of sailors looking, while two play the accordion, and other dance together; or ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl81x0eWmzY male soldiers dancing together during WWI]'', that shows a group of sailors dancing on a ship.&lt;/ref&gt; is where the [[stag dance]]s developed, and where men danced with each other, without it having any special meaning. Beemyn talks about the stag dances celebrated in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] during the [[California Gold Rush|gold rush]], in 1849. Thousands of young men arrived to the city from all continents, converting a small frontier town into an amusement city, where everything was possible. Thanks to the lack of women, and prejudices, men had fun with each other, also dancing. In these balls, the men that took the role of the woman usually wore a handkerchief knotted around their arm, but there were also those that dressed as women.&lt;ref name="BGB2007"/&gt;

==== Drag ball ====
[[File:1900s-Gay-Private-Party-Portland_Oregon_USA_crop.jpg|thumb|Drag ball at a private home in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], in the 1900s.]]
Drag balls in the United States can trace their origins to the [[Debutante|débutante balls]], and the [[costume party|costume parties]], at the end of the 19th century. In the beginning, they were simple parties where men dressed as women, and women dressed as men could go, and where two men could dance with each other; but there are also records of more exclusive balls by the 1880s, where homosexuals —men, and women— could be counted in the hundreds, up to 500 same sex couples, that slowly waltzed the night away at the sound of an excellent orchestra. In the 1920s these balls had already become big social events in the gay and lesbian world, where —mainly men— competed for the best costume. Often, they included a "parade of the fairies", to show the costumes, and the participants with the most spectacular gowns received a price, in the form of money. The judges often were personalities from literature, and the show business. It was mainly in the black communities of [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Baltimore]], and [[New Orleans]] where these balls took place, sometimes bringing in white party-goers. In [[Manhattan]], these balls got to have official permits, and police protection, and security, in places like the [[Webster Hall]], and the [[Madison Square Garden]], the [[Astor House|Astor Hotel]], the [[Manhattan Casino]] (later called [[Rockland Palace]]), [[The Harlem Alhambra]], and the [[Savoy Ballroom]] in the [[Black Harlem]], and the [[New Star Casino]], in the [[Italian Harlem]]. The planners of these balls became well known: H. Mann in the 1910s, Kackie Mason in the 1920s, and 30s, Phil Black in the 1930s to 60s, were celebrated in many a novel.&lt;ref name="MW2011"&gt;{{cite web|author=Weems, Mickey|title=Drag Ball|url=http://www.qualiafolk.com/2011/12/08/712/|access-date=2014-08-02|work=Qualia Folk|date=2011-12-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GC1994"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gay New York.

{{quote|On the floor of the hall, in every conceivable sort of fancy dress, men quaver and palpitate in each other's embrace.

Chauncey (1994)}}

[[File:Drag Ball in Webster Hall--1920s.jpg|thumb|Drag ball from the 1920s, celebrated in the [[Webster Hall]], [[Greenwich Village]], in New York.]]
The most famous drag ball was the [[Masquerade and Civic Ball]] —also known as "Faggots Ball" or "Fairies Ball"—, in New York's Harlem. The Masquerade and Civic Ball was celebration held every two years, beginning in 1869, organized by the [[Grand United Order of Odd Fellows]], an afro-American association independent of other American [[fraternal order]]s that did not accept black men. The ball was enormously popular, attracting even white public, but that didn't stop critics, and hecklers. And in spite of there being racial tensions, gender restrictions —two men could only dance together if one of them was dressed as a woman—, and class barriers, these balls became some of the few places where black and white people could socialize, and homosexuals might even find some romance.&lt;ref name="MW2011"/&gt; So, one day a year, the "faggots", mainly the effeminates, didn't have to hide, had a place where they could feel free, leave behind their apprehension, and embrace fun without fear. In a world where homosexuals were harassed, and despised routinely, the possibility to see several thousands of them together celebrating themselves, interacting with their equals, allowed the creation of an extensive network, and an underground of mutual help. The balls were a central piece in the lives of many gays: the gowns were prepared for months before, and whatever happened there, the gossip was discussed for months after.&lt;ref name="GC1994"/&gt;

Mainly the smaller balls were the objective of police raids, that sometimes arrested those participating. The justify the arrests, they used a law from 1846 that prohibited being in disguise in public, even though it had practically only been used since the change of the century to harass transvestites. Drag balls celebrated in private establishments, and homes, even though they were somewhat safer, also were often visited by the police. By the 1930s the tension with the police had extended to the balls with official permit, signaling a change in the social mores that finally had the two last grand balls in the season 1930-31 canceled.&lt;ref name="GC1994"/&gt; The balls entered a definitive decadence after the derogation of the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1933, with the libertine culture of the [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]], where cross dressing was allowed, disappearing with it.&lt;ref name="MW2011"/&gt;

In [[Mexico]], the biggest scandal at turn of the twentieth century was the so-called "[[Dance of the Forty-One]]" or "Dance of the Forty-One Faggots".&lt;ref name="Monsiváis"&gt;{{Cite web | title= La Gran Redada | publisher= Enkidu | date= November 2001 | url= http://www.enkidumagazine.com/art/2007/200707/e_1007_063_a.htm | access-date= 2007-12-16 | language= es | author= Monsiváis, Carlos | author-link= Carlos Monsiváis | deadurl= bot: unknown | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130405175406/http://www.enkidumagazine.com/art/2007/200707/e_1007_063_a.htm | archivedate= 2013-04-05 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cabrera"&gt;{{Cite web | title= Los "cuarenta y uno", cien años después | publisher= Isla ternura | year= 2002 | url= http://www.islaternura.com/APLAYA/HOMOenHISTORIA/HomoHistoria2005/Los%2041%20en%20mexico/En%20el%20centenario%20de%20los%2041%20Diciembre2005.htm | access-date= 2007-12-16 | language= es | author= Hernández Cabrera, Miguel | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130430183621/http://www.islaternura.com/APLAYA/HOMOenHISTORIA/HomoHistoria2005/Los%2041%20en%20mexico/En%20el%20centenario%20de%20los%2041%20Diciembre2005.htm | archivedate= 2013-04-30 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a police raid on November 18, 1901, during the government of [[Porfirio Díaz]], on a private home, situated in the calle de la Paz (nowadays calle Ezequiel Montes), where at that moment a group of 41 men, 22 dressed as men, and 19 as women, were celebrating a ball. The Mexican press mocked cruelly the dancers, even as the government tried to cover up the incident, as many of the participant belonged to the higher echelons of the [[Porfiriato|porfirian]] society. The list of names was never revealed.&lt;ref name="Monsiváis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cabrera" /&gt;

{{quote|On Sunday night, at a house on the fourth block of Calle la Paz, the police burst into a dance attended by 41 unaccompanied men wearing women's clothes. Among those individuals were some of the dandies seen every day on Calle Plateros. They were wearing elegant ladies' dresses, wigs, false breasts, earrings, embroidered slippers, and their faces were painted with highlighted eyes and rosy cheeks. When the news reached the street, all forms of comments were made and the behavior of those individuals was subjected to censure. We refrain from giving our readers further details because they are exceedingly disgusting.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Own translation from original text:{{quote|''La noche del domingo fue sorprendido por la policía, en una casa accesoria de la 4a. calle de la Paz, un baile que 41 hombres solos verificaban vestidos de mujer.

Estos vestían elegantísimos trajes de señoras, llevaban pelucas, pechos postizos, aretes, choclos bordados y en las caras tenían pintadas grandes ojeras y chapas de color.

No damos a nuestros lectores más detalles por ser en sumo grado asquerosos.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Contemporary press report.&lt;ref name="Cabrera"/&gt;}}

Even though the raid did not have any legal grounds, and was completely arbitrary, the 41 detained men ended up forcefully conscripted into the military:

The number 41 —or 42, as it was rumored that Ignacio de la Torre, Porfirio Díaz's son-in-law, had escaped— became part of Mexico's popular culture as a way to refer to homosexuals, [[Bottom(sex)|passive]] homosexuals for the number 42.&lt;ref name="glbtq México"&gt;

In 1906 [[Eduardo A. Castrejón]] published a book titled ''Los cuarenta y uno. Novela crítico-social''. [[José Guadalupe Posada]]'s engravings alluding to the affair are famous, and were frequently published alongside satirical verses:&lt;ref name="Cabrera" /&gt;

muy chulos y coquetones.

Hace aún muy pocos días
Que en la calle de la Paz,
Los gendarmes atisbaron
Un gran baile singular.
Cuarenta y un lagartijos
Disfrazados la mitad
De simpáticas muchachas
Bailaban como el que más.
La otra mitad con su traje,
Es decir de masculinos,
Gozaban al estrechar
A los famosos jotitos.
Vestidos de raso y seda
Al último figurín,
Con pelucas bien peinadas
Y moviéndose con chic.|Here are the Faggots
very Pretty and Coquettish.

It has only been a few days 
that on La Paz street,
the police came upon 
a grand and peculiar dance.
Forty-one lizards
half of whom were disguised
as cute girls
were dancing with much gusto.
The others with their suits,
that is, masculine attire,
enjoyed hugging
the famous little faggots.
Dressed in taffeta and silk
in the latest style,
with well-coiffed wigs
and moving with ''chic''.

==== Tango ====
{{see also|Queer Tango}}
The [[Argentine tango]], as a dance, was developed by the end of the 20th century among men, and by men that danced with other men in streets and [[brothel]]s:

{{quote|The society that begins to dance tango was mainly male, and thus, in public, it was danced by two men only, as the [Catholic] church applied its [[Catholic moral theology|morals]], and did not allow the union of a man and a woman in this type of dance [...] The [[Pope Pius X]] banished it, the [[Kaiser]] outlawed it to his officers.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Own translation from original: {{quote|''La sociedad en la cual se comienza a bailar tango era mayoritariamente masculina, por la tanto, a la luz pública se bailaba entre parejas de hombres únicamente, ya que la iglesia aplicaba su moralismo y no permitía la unión de un hombre y una mujer en esta clase de baile. [...] El Papa Pío X lo proscribió, el Káiser lo prohibió a sus oficiales.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Juliana Hernández Berrío: ''El Tango nació para ser bailado.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hernández Berrío, Juliana|title=El Tango nació para ser bailado|url=http://www.reddebibliotecas.org.co/Cultura/Multimedias/tango/baile1/baile1.html|access-date=2014-07-31|work=Medellín Cultura|language=es|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140801013949/http://www.reddebibliotecas.org.co/Cultura/Multimedias/tango/baile1/baile1.html|archive-date=2014-08-01|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:Tango_NEP_postcard_1920s.JPG|thumb|Two women dancing the tango on a postcard from 1920.]]
At the beginning of the 1910s the tango was discovered by Europeans, and became fashionable in Paris, but as a dance between man and woman, in a more "decent" style, without "''[[tango|cortes y quebradas]]''". Historical postcards of the 1920s and 30s also show women dancing tango. But these postcards come from [[cabaret]]s in Paris, and have a particularly masculine, and [[voyeur]] accent.&lt;ref name="Marinnas"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mariñas, J.

==== Rio Carnival ====
In Brazil, homosexuality was legalized in 1830, and kept it legal in the new penal code of 1890. But there were many different laws about [[public indecency]], [[Rogue (vagrant)|vagrancy]], [[transvestism]], or "[[libertine]]" behavior that were used to control, and repress homosexuals.&lt;ref name="glbtq Brasil"&gt;{{cite web | author = Green, James N. | year = | url = http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/brazil.html | title = Brazil | work = glbtq | access-date = 2015-08-09 | language = en | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141026010526/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/brazil.html | archive-date = 2014-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; But once a year, during the [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnival]], the social mores relaxed, allowing transvestism, and dancing among men —and womwan—, beginning in the 1930s. The costumes in the [[Rio Carnival]] became more and more elaborate, and a jury begun to give prizes to the best; these shows evolved into full balls, where only 10% of the dancers were dressed as [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="glbtq Río de Janeiro"&gt;{{cite web | author = Green, James N. | year = | url = http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/rio_de_janeiro.html | title = Rio de Janeiro | work = glbtq | access-date = 2015-08-09 | language = en | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141026010612/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/rio_de_janeiro.html | archive-date = 2014-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
There are reports of gay balls (''baly zhenonenavistnikov'', literally "balls of woman-haters") in [[Russia]] before the I World War, specifically in [[Moscow]]. These balls, even though they were celebrated in the ''zhenonenavistnik'' ("[[misogyny|woman-haters]]") subculture, a hyper-masculine group of homosexuals, also accepted cross-dressers.&lt;ref name="DH2013"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Beredtes Schweigen.

[[File:Russia gay 1921.jpg|thumb|Members of a clandestine gay group in Petrograd, in 1921.]]
In 2013 a photograph (to the right) was published for the first time: it depicts a group of cross-dressed men from [[Petrograd]] that were celebrating a drag party on February 15, 1921, during the first years of the [[Soviet regime]]. The photo was taken by the forensic experts of the police that had raided the party being held in a private apartment, after receiving an anonymous tip-off about "antinatural activities" in a house in the Simeon street, number 6. Ninety-eight sailors, soldiers, and civilians were arrested —even though sodomy had been legalized in 1917. They had met to celebrate a "transvestite wedding", many dressed in feminine gowns, "Spanish dresses", and "white wigs", to dance the [[waltz]] and the [[minuet]], and socialize with other men. The responsible Justice Commissar justified the raid saying that a public show of homosexual tendencies could endanger "non mature personalities". Even though none of the participants were condemned, the owner of the apartment was accused of running a brothel, according to article 171 of the [[Soviet penal code]], a felony that could be punished with up to three years of prison, and confiscation of all, or some of the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Петроград, 1921 год: полицейский рейд на «гей-клуб» | url=http://outloudmag.eu/events/item/148-unikalnaya-fotografiya-figurantov-dela-o-gey-pritone-v-petrograde | access-date= 2014-08-01 | work=OUTLOUD | date= 2013-09-19 | language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DH2013"/&gt;

=== Lesbian balls ===
[[File:Lautrec Two women waltzing original size.jpg|thumb|''Two women dancing the waltz'' (ca. 1892) by [[Toulouse Lautrec]].]]
Balls for [[lesbian]]s were also quite common, even though not so much as male ones. Not only were they less in number, but there is less information about them, a problem common to all [[lesbian history]]. On the other hand, in western societies, two woman dancing together publicly is still acceptable nowadays, and can be done without any suspicions of lesbianism.

In Mexico, on December 4, 1901, shortly after the raid to the Dance of the Forty-One, there was also a police raid of a lesbian ball in Santa María, but the incident had a much smaller social impact than the male equivalent.&lt;ref name="glbtq México" /&gt;

Hirschfeld, in his book ''Berlins drittes Geschlecht'' (1904), talks also about lesbian balls:

{{quote|In a big hall, where the uranians celebrate their balls, every week there is an equivalent evening ball for ''[[lesbian|uranierinnen]]'', most of whom participate in men's clothing. Most homosexual women can be found at the same spot every year on the costume ball a lady from Berlin organizes. The ball is not public, but usually only accessible those that are known to one of the ladies on the committee. One of the participants drafts following portrayal: "On a beautiful winter evening, after 8 p.m., cars and cars drive in front of one of the first hotels in Berlin, where ladies and gentlemen descent in costumes of all countries, and epochs. Here you can see a dashing [[Studentenverbindung|fraternity student]] with a prominent [[dueling scar]], there a slim [[rococo]] gentleman helps gallantly his lady out of the equipage. More and more people fill the brightly lit rooms; now a fat [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] enters, to whom bow gypsies, [[Pierrot]]s, sailors, clowns, bakers, [[lansquenet]]s, smart officers, ladies and gents in riding gear, [[Boer]]s, Japanese, and delicate [[Geisha]]s. A [[Carmen]] with fire in her eyes burns a jockey, a passionately hot Italian befriends intimately a snow man. The in brightest colors [dressed] dazzling, happy multitude offers a unique, attractive tableau. The participating women first strengthen themselves on tables decorated with flowers. The director, in a charming velvet jacket, welcomes the guests in a short, sharp speech. Then, the tables are cleared. The "[[waltz|Danubian waves]]" sound, and accompany the happy dancing couples, that turn the night away in circles. From the neighboring rooms you can hear clear laughter, the clinking of glasses, and animated singing, but nowhere –wherever you look– are the limits of a fine, elegant fancy-dress ball overstepped. No discordant note tarnishes the general happiness, until the last participants leave the place in the dull crepuscular lights of a cold February morning, where for a few hours they could dream themselves as that what they are inside, amongst those that share their feelings.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Own translation from original text: {{quote|''In einem der großen Säle, in welchem die Urninge ihre Bälle veranstalten, findet auch fast jede Woche ein analoger Ballabend für Uranierinnen statt, von denen sich ein großer Teil in Herrenkostüm einfindet. Die meisten homosexuellen Frauen auf einem Fleck kann man alljährlich auf einem von einer Berliner Dame arrangierten Kostümfest sehen. Das Fest ist nicht öffentlich, sondern gewöhnlich nur denjenigen zugänglich, die einer der Komiteedamen bekannt sind. Eine Teilnehmerin entwirft mir folgende anschauliche Schilderung: »An einem schönen Winterabend fahren von 8 Uhr ab vor einem der ersten Berliner Hotels Wagen auf Wagen vor, denen Damen und Herren in Kostümen aller Länder und Zeiten entsteigen. Hier sieht man einen flotten Couleurstudenten mit mächtigen Renommierschmissen ankommen, dort hilft ein schlanker Rokokoherr seiner Dame galant aus der Equipage. Immer dichter füllen sich die strahlend erleuchteten weiten Räume; jetzt tritt ein dicker Kapuziner ein, vor dem sich ehrfurchtsvoll Zigeuner, Pierrots, Matrosen, Clowns, Bäcker, Landsknechte, schmucke Offiziere, Herren und Damen im Reitanzug, Buren, Japaner und zierliche Geishas neigen. Eine glutäugige Carmen setzt einen Jockey in Brand, ein feuriger Italiener schließt mit einem Schneemann innige Freundschaft. Die in buntesten Farben schillernde fröhliche Schar bietet ein höchst eigenartiges anziehendes Bild. Zuerst stärken sich die Festteilnehmerinnen an blumengeschmückten Tafeln. Die Leiterin in flotter Samtjoppe heißt in kurzer kerniger Rede die Gäste willkommen. Dann werden die Tische fortgeräumt. Die »Donauwellen« erklingen, und begleitet von fröhlichen Tanzweisen, schwingen sich die Paare die Nacht hindurch im Kreise. Aus den Nebensälen hört man helles Lachen, Klingen der Gläser und munteres Singen, nirgends aber – wohin man sieht – werden die Grenzen eines Kostümfestes vornehmer Art überschritten. Kein Mißton trübt die allgemeine Freude, bis die letzten Teilnehmerinnen beim matten Dämmerlicht des kalten Februarmorgens den Ort verlassen, an dem sie sich unter Mitempfindenden wenige Stunden als das träumen durften, was sie innerlich sind.«''}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Magnus Hirschfeld, ''Berlins Drittes Geschlecht'' (1904), «[http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/6275/3 Kapitel 3]»}}

Later in Germany, the "bowling club" ''Die lustige Neun'' ("The Funny Nine""), created in Berlin in 1924, continued organizing lesbian balls with 200 to 300 women at least until April 1940. It is unknown if the balls, known thanks to the descriptions in the [[Gestapo]] files, continued throughout the war years; fact is, the track is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Dobler, Jens | editor1 = Boxhammer, Ingeborg|editor2=Leidinger, Christiane | year = 2003 | url = http://www.lesbengeschichte.de/staedte_d_fram.html?http://www.lesbengeschichte.de/staedte_berlin_d.html | title = Lesbische Berliner Subkultur im Nationalsozialismus | work = Online-Projekt Lesbengeschichte | access-date = 2009-05-09 | language = de | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120113060237/http://www.lesbengeschichte.de/staedte_d_fram.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesbengeschichte.de%2Fstaedte_berlin_d.html | archive-date = 2012-01-13 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later development ==
=== From the II World War to Stonewall in Europe ===
In Switzerland, even with many difficulties, the homosexual movement kept its structures over the war. ''[[Der Kreis|The Circle]]'', a gay magazine, organized weekly club evenings in [[Zürich]], that only subscribers could visit. Several elaborate systems were used to secure the anonymity of the participants, and only "[[Karl Meier|Rolf]]", the editor of the magazine, had the names and addresses of everyone.  For spring, summer, and fall big balls were organized, and there was also a big costume ball for carnival. An important effort was done to keep everything decent, respectable, and contained, and Rolf made sure that no man under 20 was present. This secrecy mentality was no longer acceptable to gays by the mid-1960s, and in 1967 the magazine and its organization disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steinle|first1=Karl-Heinz|editor1-last=Sternweiler|editor1-first=Andreas|editor2-last=Hannesen|editor2-first=Hans Gerhardt|title=Goodbye Berlin? 100 Jahre Schwulenbewegung|date=1997|publisher=Verlag Rosa Winkel|location=Berlin|isbn=3-86149-062-5|pages=241–242|edition=1st|language=de|chapter=Der Kreis - Entwicklungshilfe aus der Schweiz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, during the [[occupation of Paris]], all balls were prohibited, a situation that did not change after the [[Allies of World War II|allies]] entered the city.&lt;ref name="Dictionnaire"/&gt; During the war, the only possibility was to meet in the outskirts of Paris, as gays did on the Christmas eve of 1935, when hundreds of men traveled 50&amp;nbsp;km in a bus from Paris to celebrate the traditional dinner.&lt;ref name="FT2006"/&gt; After the war, the only possibility was to travel by train to the Bal de la Chervrière, in [[L'Étang-la-Ville]], [[Yvelines]], an establishment owned by a lesbian, "la Colonelle", that had been part of the [[Resistance (France)|resistance]], and had enough contacts to keep her place open. The situation improved with the reopening of the [[Bal de la montaigne de Sainte-Geneviève]] in 1954, organized by Georges Anys, who would keep it open until the 1960s. Possibly the most important ball was the one celebrated every Sunday evening by the magazine and association [[Arcadie]], the Cespala (Club littéraire et scientifique des pays latins), in the number 9 of the Rue Béranger, reserved exclusively to the members of the club.&lt;ref name="Dictionnaire"/&gt;

There was a short revival of the gay pre-war scene after the war in Germany. The Walterchens Ballhaus organized drag balls already in 1946, and the parties at [[Alexander Kropotkin|Prince Sasha]]'s were one of the centers of gay nightlife. In [[Frankfurt]], in 1949 reopened the bar Fellsenkeller; the bar had a police permit that allowed men to dance together. By the beginning of the 1950s this revival had been thoroughly eliminated, and gay subculture had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stienle|first1=Karl-Heinz|editor1-last=Sternweiler|editor1-first=Andreas|editor2-last=Hannesen|editor2-first=Hans Gerhardt|title=Goodbye Berlin? 100 Jahre Schwulenbewegung|date=1997|publisher=Verlag Rosa Winkel|location=Berlin|isbn=3-86149-062-5|pages=195–196, 200|edition=1st|language=de|chapter=Homophiles Deutschland - West und Ost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, [[Amsterdam]] became something of a [[gay mecca]]: the biggest gay dance hall in Europe was DOK (De Odeon Kelder), initially belonging to the [[COC Nederland|COC]] (Cultuur en Ontspanningscentrum, "Center for Culture and Leisure"), it became independent under the direction of Lou Charité three years after. The COC opened then another dance club, De Shakel ("The Chain Link"). The city was quite accepting of these clubs, and gay men from all around the world traveled there for the opportunity to dance freely with other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hekma|first1=Gert|editor1-last=Sternweiler|editor1-first=Andreas|editor2-last=Hannesen|editor2-first=Hans Gerhardt|title=Goodbye Berlin? 100 Jahre Schwulenbewegung|date=1997|publisher=Verlag Rosa Winkel|location=Berlin|isbn=3-86149-062-5|page=210|edition=1st|language=de|chapter=Amsterdam - Die schwule Hauptstadt der Nachkriegszeit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggles of the [[homophile movement]] to resist the pressure of society and the authorities, trying to gain respectability, and acceptance by [[Passing (sociology)|passing]], but at the same time tying to accommodate the need to socialize, and vent for gay men, can be illustrated by the [[Café 't Mandje]]: a small den in gay-accepting [[De Wallen|Amsterdam's Red-Light District]], where prostitutes, pimps, seamen, gays and lesbians came openly together, allowed the dancing of two men only on the [[Koningsdag|Queen's Birthday]], once a year, as it did not have a dancing license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Café ’t Mandje was sinds 1927 het café van de legendarische Bet van Beeren (12 februari 1902 – 16 juli 1967)|url=http://www.cafetmandje.amsterdam/geschiedenis/|website=Café ’t Mandje webpage|accessdate=25 June 2017|language=en|quote=But Bet would not allow kissing in the bar. There were vice-laws to consider and the liquor license could be at stake. The bar did not have a dance license. There was a custom-made billiard table in the middle of it, no room for dancing. Only on the Queen’s birthday (in those days on April 30th) almost anything was permitted, even dancing in a bar without a proper license.

Additionally, the fact that there had been some prostitution going on had disastrous consequences for all the participants, most of them innocent, and ended with three suicides, one man fleeing the city, and many losing their jobs. A subsequent [[witch hunt]] against gays in Italy covered the whole land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bolognini|first=Stefano|title=I Balletti verdi, storia di uno scandalo|url=http://www.stefanobolognini.it/storia/balletti/estrattopride.html|access-date=2014-07-31|work=Stefano Bolognini's Web Page|date=March 2001|language=it|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508214232/http://www.stefanobolognini.it/storia/balletti/estrattopride.html|archivedate=2008-05-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scalise|first=Daniele|title=Balletti verdi uno scandalo omosessuale|url=http://www.stefanobolognini.it/storia/balletti/libro.html|access-date=2014-07-31|work=[[L'Espresso]]|date=2001-05-16|language=it|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508205613/http://www.stefanobolognini.it/storia/balletti/libro.html|archivedate=2008-05-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1973, in the last years of [[Franco's dictatorship]], ten men were arrested in [[Sitges]], Spain, for going out dancing in women's clothes.

=== Ball culture ===
In the U.S., cross dressing balls evolved into the [[ballroom community]], or [[ball culture]], that started in the [[Harlem]], and in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the 1960s.
{{quote|[black men in the Harlem took the balls to ...] heights undreamed of by the little gangs of white men parading around in [[frock]]s in basement taverns. In a burst of liberated zeal they rented big places like the [[Elks Lodge]] on 160 West 129th Street, and they turned up in dresses [[Madame Pompadour]] herself might have thought twice about. Word spread around Harlem that a retinue of [[drag queen]]s was putting together outfits bigger and grander than [[Rose Parade]] floats, and the balls began to attract spectators, first by the dozens and then by the hundreds, gay and straight alike. People brought liquor with them, sandwiches, buckets of chicken. As the audiences grew, the queens gave them more and more for their money. [[Cleopatra]] on her barge, all in gold [[Lamé (fabric)|lamé]], with a half dozen attendants waving white, glittering palm fronds. Faux fashion models in feathered coats lined with [[mylar]], so that when the coat was thrown open and a two-thousand-watt incandescent lamp suddenly lit, the people in the first few rows were blinded for minutes afterward.|Michael Cunningham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cunningham|first=Michael|title=The Slap of Love|url=http://opencity.org/archive/issue-6/the-slap-of-love|access-date=2014-08-05|work=Open City|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soon the balls were divided in "houses", or "families", lead by a charismatic figure.
{{quote|Some regular house parties became institutionalized as drag "houses" and "families." The leader, or "mother," often provided not only the opportunity for parties but also instruction and mentoring in the arts of make-up, selecting clothes, lip-synching, portraying a personality, walking, and related skills. Those taught became "drag daughters," who in turn mentored others, creating entire "drag families." Drag houses became the first social support groups in the city’s gay and lesbian community [in Washington, D.C].|Rainbow History Project&lt;ref name="dc"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rainbow History Project: Drag in DC|publisher=Rainbow History Project|date=2000–2007|url=http://www.rainbowhistory.org/html/drag.html|accessdate=2007-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614052021/http://www.rainbowhistory.org/html/drag.html|archive-date=2014-06-14|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ballroom community is still active, as has been documented in the film ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]]'' (1990). It has had a notable influence, mainly through [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s [[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]] video, where the dancers use the [[Vogue (dance)|vogue]] dancing style, developed in the ball culture, imitating the movements of models on the catwalk. [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]] has also mentioned she was influenced by the ball culture, "how inspired she's been by the whole drag-house circuit in the States, an unsung part of black American culture where working-class gay men channel ultra-glamour in mocked-up catwalk shows. 'I still have that in me', she says of the 'confidence and the fire you see on stage [...]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyoncé Knowles: Queen B|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article1223035.ece|work=The Independent|date=2006-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001104054/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article1223035.ece|archive-date=2007-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Marlon M. |title=Global Circuits of Blackness|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|last=Bailey|first=Marlon M.|year=2011|title=Gender/Racial Realness: Theorizing the Gender System in Ballroom Culture|work=Feminist Studies|number=37(2)|pages=365–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|last1=Rowan|first1=Diana|last2=Long|first2=Dennis D.|last3=Johnson|first3=Darrin|title=Identity and Self-Presentation in the House/Ball Culture: A Primer for Social Workers|work=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Social Services|date=April 2013|volume=25|issue=2|pages=178–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Stonewall ===
[[File:Night of a Thousand Gowns (2375438193).jpg|thumb|The Imperial Court of New York's annual Night of a Thousand Gowns Coronation Ball in [[Times Square]].]]
After the [[Stonewall riots]], and the appearance of the modern [[Gay liberation|LGBT liberation movement]], these extensive cross-dressing balls, as they had been celebrated until then, practically disappeared. There are a few notable exceptions, as the [[Life Ball]] in [[Vienna]], celebrated yearly since 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Müller |first= Nina|title=»Alles pailletti« am Tuntenball|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/freizeit/events/baelle/3556484/alles-pailletti-tuntenball.story|access-date=2014-07-31|work=Kleine Zeitung|date=2014-02-22|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the annual [[Night of a Thousand Gowns]] in New York City, organized by the [[Imperial Court System]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Curtis M.|title=The Imperial Court's 'Night Of A Thousand Gowns' Brings Style And Sass To New York For A Great Gay Cause|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/19/night-of-a-thousand-gowns_n_7094358.html|website=HuffPost|accessdate=25 June 2017|date=2015-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in general they have been substituted by the [[dance club]].

By the mid 1970s, initially in New York City, appeared the [[discotheque]], with the corresponding [[disco music]], and [[disc jockey]]s, in close relationship with the [[gay scene]] —see for example [[Studio 54]]. Discotheques, and their music soon became favorites of gay men, who found in its songs [[gay anthem]]s, as ''[[It's raining men]]'', ''[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]'', ''[[I'm coming out]]'', or ''[[So many men, so little time]]'', in spite of the [[homophobia]] of some of the [[diva]]s singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionnaire des cultures gays et lesbiennes|last=Thévenin|first=P.|publisher=Larousse|pages=154–155|language=francés|editor=[[Didier Eribon|Eribon, Didier]]|isbn=2-03-505164-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Para entendernos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7128">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Cultural influence of Plato's ''Republic''}}
[[Plato]]'s [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] has been influential in literature and art.

==Similarities in literature==

===Aristophanes===
Around the same time that the ''Republic'' was being composed, the [[playwright]] [[Aristophanes]] produced the play ''[[Assemblywomen]].'' The state formed by the women in this play bears many similarities to the ideal government described by Plato. It is not discernible which was released first; most likely Aristophanes had heard an early form of the ''Republic'' before it was completed and used it as the basis for ''Assemblywomen''.  Certainly, the similarities have long been commented upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

year=1987|
isbn=0-88706-395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utopias===
[[Thomas More]], when writing his ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', invented the technique of using the portrayal of a "utopia" as the carrier of his thoughts about the ideal society. In Thomas More's [[Utopia]], the island Utopia is also similar to Plato's ''Republic'' in some aspects, among them common property and the lack of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;
Imterpreting Thomas More's Utopia By John Charles Olin Fordham Univ Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-8232-1233-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Function of the Ideal in Plato's 'Republic' and St. Thomas More's 'Utopia' " by K. Corrigan ''Moreana'' 1990, vol. 27, no.104, pp. 27-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Thomas More: On the Margins of Modernity " by [[J. H. Hexter]] ''The Journal of British Studies,'' Vol. 1 (Nov., 1961), pp. 20-37 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/175096 JSTOR] "We find it in Plato's Republic, and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"More on Utopia" by Brendan Bradshaw ''The Historical Journal,'' Vol. 24, No. 1 (Mar., 1981), pp. 1-27 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638902 JSTOR] "claims that Utopia not merely emulated Plato's Republic but excelled it."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dystopias===
The form of government described in the ''Republic'' has been adapted in several modern [[dystopia|dystopic]] novels and stories. The separation of people by professional class, assignment of profession and purpose by the state, and the absence of traditional family units, replaced by state-organized breeding, was included by authors in descriptions of totalitarian dystopic governments. Government which bears resemblance to Plato's ''Republic'' is found in Aldous Huxley's ''[[Brave New World]]''&lt;ref&gt;Franck, Matthew. "Aldous Huxley’s City in Speech: Brave New World and the Republic of Plato" Paper presented at the annual meeting of The Midwest Political Science Association, Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, Illinois, Apr 15, 2004 [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p84006_index.html abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lois Lowry's ''[[The Giver]]''.

The [[Orwellian]] [[dystopia]] depicted in the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' had many characteristics in common with Plato's description of the [[allegory of the Cave]] as Winston Smith strives to liberate himself from it.&lt;ref&gt;"From Plato to Orwell: Utopian Rhetoric in a Dystopian World." by Deatherage, Scott. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Speech Communication Association (73rd, Boston, MA, November 5–8, 1987).  [http://eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED290192&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED290192 ERIC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heinlein===
Another satiric presentation of Platonic style government would be Robert A. Heinlein's [[Starship Troopers]].  His citizen can be compared to a Platonic Guardian, without the communal breeding and property, but still having a militaristic base.  Although there are significant differences in the specifics of the system, Heinlein and Plato both describe systems of limited franchise, with a political class that has supposedly earned their power and wisely governs the whole.  ''Republic'' is specifically attacked in ''Starship Troopers''.  Indeed, the arachnids can be seen as much closer to a ''Republic'' society than the humans.&lt;ref&gt;Donald McQuarie "Utopia and Transcendence: An Analysis of Their Decline in Contemporary Science Fiction" ''The Journal of Popular Culture'' xiv (2), 242–250. (1980) [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0022-3840.1980.1402_242.x Blackwell Synergy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Although not directly referenced at any point the ''Mega City One'' of [[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]'s [[Judge Dredd]] storyline has broad similarities to the Platonic Republic – mainly in that it is governed by a Guardian Class (the Judges) raised from infancy to govern in the interests of the polity and bound by far stricter rules than apply to the common citizen.

The comic book [[Morning Glories]] takes place at a violent and secretive boarding school which is built on the grounds above Plato's Cave.

The experience of Jack in Emma Donoghue's 2010 novel "[[Room (novel)|Room]]" contains many similarities to the experience of the people in Plato's Cave.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10565">The '''[[Klondike Gold Rush#Culture|Klondike Gold Rush]]''' is commemorated through film, literature, historical parks etc.

==Literature==
[[File:Jim Mason plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque to Skookum Jim Mason]]
Amongst the many to take part in the gold rush was writer [[Jack London]], whose books ''[[White Fang]]'', ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', and ''[[To Build a Fire]]'', a collection of short stories, were influenced by his northern experiences. London was inspired to write stories by various adventurers he met. ''The Thousand Dozen'' for instance was inspired by a brief market corner on eggs created by [[Bill Gates (frontiersman)|"Swiftwater" Bill Gates]]. Part I of Jack London's 1910 novel ''Burning Daylight'' is centered on the Klondike Gold Rush. Another literary luminary connected with the rush, and whose cabin still stands in Dawson City, was folk-lyricist [[Robert W. Service]], whose short epics [[The Shooting of Dan McGrew]] and other works describe the fierce grandeur of the north and the survival ethic and gold fever of men and women in the frozen, gold-strewn north. Service's best-known line is the opening of [[The Cremation of Sam McGee]], which goes;

:''There are strange things done in the midnight sun
:''By the men who moil for gold;

One of the last books of [[Jules Verne]], ''Le Volcan d'Or'' (''The Volcano of Gold''), deals with the terrible hardships endured by the gold-seekers in the Klondike. The book was written circa 1899 but was not published until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Dumas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VyVidJFp26oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22the+golden+volcano%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nUzs9QiCer&amp;sig=dinajx-4HX_UHKRbCGIRfI6cEnY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9tiPS-2HHI3SsgO9t_yfCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Preface to ''The Golden Volcano''], 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James A. Michener]]'s novel ''[[Alaska (novel)|Alaska]]'' (chapter VIII) and his short novel ''Journey'' describe the harsh realities of the Klondike Gold Rush using fictional characters.

[[Image:TheGoldRush.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin]] carving up a boot in ''[[The Gold Rush]]'']]  The 1997 book "Jason's Gold" by [[Will Hobbs]] (not published until 1999) was about a boy who went to Klondike in search for gold and his experience there.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs, Will. ''Jason's Gold'', HarperCollins, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian author [[Vicki Delany]] writes the Klondike Gold Rush series of mystery novels from Dundurn Press, which include '''Gold Digger''' (2009) and '''Gold Fever''' (2010) and '''Gold Mountain''' (May 2012)

==Film and television==
[[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[silent film]] ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925), the highest grossing silent comedy, was set in the Klondike, as was the silent epic ''[[The Trail of '98]]'' (1928) and [[Mae West]]'s ''[[Klondike Annie]]'' (1936). A silent-era film by Russian director [[Lev Kuleshov]] ''By the Law'' (1926), based on [[Jack London]]'s story "The Unexpected" also dramatizes the life of the gold-seekers.

The 1946 comedy, ''[[Road to Utopia]]'' is set during the Rush. 

Life in Dawson City during the gold rush was also the subject of the award-winning 1957 [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) documentary ''[[City of Gold (1957 film)|City of Gold]]'', narrated by Pierre Berton.

The 1955 film''[[The Far Country]]'' is a Western set in Skagway and Dawson City during the gold rush era. It was directed by [[Anthony Mann]] and written by [[Borden Chase]]. The 1978 [[Television|TV]] [[Television special|special]] ''[[What a Nightmare, Charlie Brown!]]'' is also set during the Gold Rush but is disputed to be the [[1925 serum run to Nome]].

The [[Irish language]] TV series ''[[An Klondike]]'' (2015) also takes place during the Rush.

==Music and Theater==
The ''Klondyke march and two step'' with music by [[Oscar Telgmann]] was published in [[Kingston, Ontario]] by the Music Emporium, c. 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/m5-bin/Main/ItemDisplay?l=0&amp;l_ef_l=-1&amp;id=544315.1058422&amp;v=1&amp;lvl=1&amp;coll=17&amp;rt=1&amp;itm=23831798&amp;rsn=S_WWWbeaPPbvVu&amp;all=1&amp;dt=AW+%7cTelgmann%7c&amp;spi=-&amp;rp=1&amp;vo=1 |title=Klondyke march and two step |publisher=Amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=2007-10-18 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dawson City was also the starting place of impresario [[Alexander Pantages]]. He opened a small theater to entertain the miners. He also became the partner and lover of [["Klondike Kate" Rockwell]]. Soon, however, his activities expanded and he became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons.

The song "Gold Dust" by Canadian independent artist Right On Yukon makes multiple references to the hardships endured by fortune seekers and animals along the White Pass trail from Skagway to Dawson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rightonyukon.bandcamp.com/track/gold-dust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

While Barks was content with leaving Scrooge's backstory of his Klondike days at the level of short flashbacks, his successor [[Don Rosa]] has gone to extend Barks's legacy of short glimpses into Scrooge's gold rush exploits into a number of adventure stories, particularly ''Last Sled to Dawson'' and individual chapters of his opus magnum ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', which are chapter 8a: ''[[King of the Klondike]]'', chapter 8b: ''[[The Prisoner of White Agony Creek]]'', and chapter 8c: ''Hearts of the Yukon''.

Soapy Smith is the villain in the [[Lucky Luke]] album ''Le Klondike'', by [[Morris (comics)|Morris]], Yann and Jean Léturgie. The story features Smith's saloon and fake telegraph, but set in Dawson rather than Skagway.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Lefty Frizzell]]'s 1964 song [[Saginaw, Michigan (song)|"Saginaw, Michigan"]] tells the tale of a poor fisherman who feigns the discovery of Klondike gold in a plot to remove the hostile father of the woman he loves.

A game called [[The Yukon Trail]] was created by [[MECC]] in 1994. There is also a populaire solitaire called [[Klondike (solitaire)|Klondike]].

In addition, the Klondike gold rush proved to be one of the most famous eras of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's history. Not only did the exemplary conduct of the force ensure its continuation at a time when its dissolution was being debated in the [[Parliament of Canada]], but the Force's depiction in popular western culture is often set at this time. The most popular examples include dramatic depictions such as the radio series ''[[Challenge of the Yukon]]'' and comedic ones like ''[[Dudley Do-Right]]''.

A certain amount of [[slang]] came out of the gold rush. Experienced miners were often known as [[Sourdough]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sourdough |title=Merriam-Webster online – Sourdough |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential miners new to the Klondike  were known as Cheechakos, from [[Chinook Jargon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cheechakos |title=Merriam-Webster online – Cheechakos |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two names live on in Dawson City, in tourist literature, and enjoy occasional usage by miners still working the tributaries of the Yukon River and Klondike River as well as in literature relating to the Klondike gold rush era.

==Celebrations==
The gold rush was celebrated in the city of [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], with [[K-Days|Klondike Days]] (now simply K-Days), an annual summer fair with a Klondike gold rush theme. Although far away from Dawson City and the Klondike River, Edmonton became known as a "Gateway to the North" for gold prospectors en route to Canada's North. It was in the city that many would collect the necessary goods for trekking up north in search of wealth. Individuals and teams of explorers arrived in Edmonton and prepared for travel by foot, [[York boat]], [[Sled dog|dog team]], or horses. Travel to the Yukon over land via what was sometimes called the "all Canada" route—and the prospectors that took this route—were often referred to as "overlanders". Few overlanders made it to the Klondike (160 out of about 1,600 that started&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klondiketrail.ca/chalmersprint.htm Chalmers Trail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812143900/http://www.klondiketrail.ca/chalmersprint.htm |date=2009-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Alberta's Northlands Association, which is based in Edmonton, honoured the memory and spirit of the overlanders with Klondike Days. For many years, Klondike Days was a fun summer exhibition with themed events such as the Sunday Promenade, the Sourdough raft race, free pancake breakfasts, saloons, gold panning and era costume parties.  Despite the many sad realities of the gold rush, Edmonton appreciated the Klondike spirit, which was characterised by a tenacious hope for success in the face of hardship, and an energetic zest for life. As a fair theme it was meant to provide the impetus for fun fantasy characters (e.g., Klondike Mike (Bobby Breen), Klondike Kate, The Klondike Kid (Ken Armstrong), Klondike Kitty (Debra Cook), Klondike Kattie to mention but a few) and fun events celebrating an interesting time. Many in the Yukon resented Edmonton's Klondike celebrations because of their historical inaccuracy and the perceived competition with the Yukon's tourism. The sentimental aspect of the gold rush lost its popular appeal in the 1980s and 90s and in 2003 the theme was dropped.

In addition, every other summer, on odd numbered years, the sleep away camp Camp Shohola for Boys has what it calls Klondike Day. In the morning an area of camp, including the creek that runs through the camp, are staged as Dawson City and campers run into the creek to search for "gold." In the afternoon they receive "money" for their prospecting and attend a camp wide carnival.

'''Côte des Landes''' or '''Côte landaise''' is a tourist name given to a section of the French sea shore. It is a section of [[Côte d'Argent]].

All along the French coasts, the different parts of the sea shore have particular names.

In south west of France, facing the [[Atlantic Ocean]], "la Côte des Landes" is limited at its north by [[Arcachon Bay]] and at its south by the [[Adour]] river mouth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5703">A '''deaf-community sign language''' is a [[sign language]] that emerges when [[deaf]] people who do not have a common language come together and form a community. This may be a formal situation, such as the establishment of a school for the deaf, or informal, such as migration to cities for employment and the subsequent gathering of deaf people for social purposes.&lt;ref name=MSPA&gt;{{cite book|last1= Meir |first1= Irit |last2= Sandler |first2= Wendy |last3= Padden |first3= Carol |author-link3= Carol Padden |last4= Aronoff |first4= Mark |author-link4= Mark Aronoff |year= 2010 |chapter= Chapter 18: Emerging sign languages |chapter-url= http://sandlersignlab.haifa.ac.il/html/html_eng/pdf/EMERGING_SIGN_LANGUAGES.pdf |chapter-format= 
PDF |editor1-last= Marschark |editor1-first= Marc |editor2-last= Spencer |editor2-first= Patricia Elizabeth |title= Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0mmJAgAAQBAJ |volume= vol. 2 |location= New York |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-19-539003-2 |oclc= 779907637 |access-date= 2016-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
An example of the first is [[Nicaraguan Sign Language]], which emerged when deaf children in [[Nicaragua]] were brought together for the first time, and received only [[oral education]]; of the latter, [[Bamako Sign Language]], which emerged among the tea circles of the uneducated deaf in the capital of [[Mali]]. Nicaraguan SL is now a language of instruction and is recognized as the national sign language; Bamako SL is not, and is threatened by the use of [[American Sign Language]] in schools for the deaf. 

Deaf-community sign languages contrast with [[village sign language]] in that they tend to be used only by the deaf, at least at first, and most communication is between deaf people. Village sign languages, on the other hand, develop in relatively isolated areas with high incidences of [[congenital]] deafness, where most hearing people have deaf family, so that most signers are hearing. These differences have [[linguistic]] consequences. Urban deaf communities lack the common knowledge and [[social context]] that enables village signers to communicate without being verbally explicit. Deaf-community signers need to communicate with strangers, and therefore must be more explicit; it is thought this may have the effect of developing or at least speeding up the development of grammatical and other linguistic structures in the emerging language. For example, only deaf-community sign languages are known to make abstract and grammatical use of [[sign space]].&lt;ref name=MSPA/&gt; Both types of deaf sign language differ from speech-taboo languages such as the various [[Aboriginal Australian sign languages]], which are developed by the hearing community and only used secondarily by the deaf, and are not independent languages.

Deaf-community languages may develop directly from [[home sign]], or perhaps from [[idioglossic]] sign (in families with more than one deaf child), as was the case with Nicaraguan SL, or they may develop from village sign languages, as appears to have been at least partially the case with American SL, which arose in a school for the deaf where [[French Sign Language]] was the language of instruction, but seems to have derived largely from two or three village sign languages of the students.

==Languages==
Once a sign language is established, especially if it is a language of education, it may spread and spawn additional languages, such as in the [[French Sign Language family]]. The following are languages thought to have been established in new deaf communities, without the direct transmission of an existing sign language. There are presumably others; with many sign languages, we have no records of how they formed.

*[[British Sign Language]] (urban→school)
*[[German Sign Language]] (urban)
*[[Old French Sign Language]] (urban)
*[[Lyons Sign Language]] (urban)
*[[American Sign Language]] (school sign; village sign with significant input from FSL)
*[[Thai Sign Language]] (urban sign with significant input from ASL)
*[[Japanese Sign Language]] (school?)
*[[Chinese Sign Language]] (school)
*[[Bamako Sign Language]] (urban)
*[[Mbour Sign Language]] (urban)
*[[Hausa Sign Language]] (urban)
*[[Tanzanian sign languages]] (school sign, seven languages)
*[[Israeli Sign Language]]
*[[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]]
*[[Nicaraguan Sign Language]] (school sign)
*[[Tibetan Sign Language]] (standardization of several community languages)
*[[Venezuelan Sign Language]]
*[[Sri Lankan sign languages]] (school sign, fourteen languages)

Other locally developed sign languages which may have formed this way are:
:(in Africa) [[Burkina Sign Language]], the various [[Ethiopian sign languages]], [[Guinea-Bissau Sign Language]], [[Kenyan Sign Language]], [[Libyan Sign Language]], the various [[Sudanese sign languages]], [[Ugandan Sign Language]], [[Zambian Sign Language]], [[Zimbabwean Sign Language]]
:(in America) [[Brazilian Sign Language]], [[Colombian Sign Language]], [[Ecuadorian Sign Language]], [[Jamaican Country Sign Language]], [[Peruvian Sign Language]]
:(in Asia) [[Old Bangkok Sign Language]], [[Old Chiangmai Sign Language]], [[Penang Sign Language]], [[Hanoi Sign Language]], [[Saigon Sign Language]], [[Haiphong Sign Language]], [[Yogyakarta Sign Language]], [[Nepalese Sign Language]]
:(in Europe) [[Catalan Sign Language]], [[Spanish Sign Language]], [[Swiss German Sign Language]], [[Swedish Sign Language]]

The '''Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport''' ('''DCMS''') is a [[Departments of the United Kingdom government|department]] of the [[United Kingdom government]], with responsibility for [[English culture|culture]] and [[Sport in England|sport]] in [[England]], and some aspects of the [[Media of the United Kingdom|media throughout the whole UK]], such as [[broadcasting]] and [[internet]].

It also has responsibility for the [[tourism in England|tourism]], [[leisure industry|leisure]] and [[creative industries]] (some joint with [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]]). The department was also responsible for the delivery of the [[2012 Olympic Games]] and [[2012 Paralympic Games|Paralympic Games]] and the building of a [[Digital Economy]].

==History and responsibilities==
{{PoliticsUK}}

DCMS originates from the '''Department of National Heritage''' ('''DNH'''), which itself was created on 11 April 1992 out of various other departments, soon after the [[Second Major ministry|Conservative]] [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|election victory]]. The former [[Minister for the Arts|Ministers for the Arts]] and for [[Minister for Sport (United Kingdom)|Sport]] had previously been located in other departments.

DNH was renamed as the '''Department for Culture, Media and Sport''' ('''DCMS''') on 14 July 1997, under the [[Premiership of Tony Blair]]. It was renamed to '''Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport''' on 3 July 2017, staying '''DCMS''' under the [[Premiership of Theresa May]] to reflect the department's increased activity in the Digital sector.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/change-of-name-for-dcms&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 Olympics===
DCMS was the [[2012 Summer Olympics bids|co-ordinating department for the successful bid]] by [[London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics|London to host the 2012 Olympics]] and appointed and oversees the agencies delivering the Games' infrastructure and programme, principally the [[Olympic Delivery Authority]] (ODA) and [[LOCOG]].

The [[Brown Ministry|June 2007 Cabinet]] [[reshuffle]] led to [[Tessa Jowell]] MP taking on the role of [[Paymaster General]] and then [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] while remaining [[Minister for the Olympics]].  Ministerial responsibility for the Olympics was shared with Ms Jowell in the [[Cabinet Office]], but the staff of the [[Government Olympic Executive]] (GOE) remained based in DCMS.

===2010–present===
Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], ministerial responsibility for the Olympics returned to the Secretary of State. Although [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt's]] full title was [[Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport]], the Department's name remained unchanged. On 4 September 2012, Hunt was appointed Health Secretary in a cabinet reshuffle and replaced by [[Maria Miller]]. Maria Miller later resigned due to controversy over her expenses. Her replacement was announced later that day as [[Sajid Javid]].

After the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], [[John Whittingdale]] was appointed as Secretary of State, tasked with initiating the [[BBC Charter]] review process. DCMS received full responsibility for the digital economy policy, formerly jointly held with [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|BIS]], and sponsorship of the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] from the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]].

Whittingdale was replaced by [[Karen Bradley]] after the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum on the UK's membership of the EU]] in July 2016.  The '''Office for Civil Society''' moved from the [[Cabinet Office]] to DCMS as part of the same reshuffle.

In January 2018, [[Matthew Hancock]], previous Minister of State for Digital, was appointed Secretary of State as part of the Cabinet Reshuffle. 

On 9 July 2018, [[Jeremy Wright]] became the Secretary of State for Digital, Media and Sport as part of the Cabinet Reshuffle.
====Policy areas====
It is responsible for [[government policy]] in the following areas:
* the [[Arts]]

* [[Internet]] and [[Information and Communications Technology|international ICT policy]]
* [[Telecommunications]] and [[broadband]]
* [[Civil society]]
* [[Charities]]
* [[Creative industries]]

=====Other responsibilities=====
Other responsibilities of DCMS include [[List of heritage registers#United Kingdom|listing of historic buildings]], [[Schedule of Ancient Monuments|scheduling of ancient monuments]], export licensing of [[Cultural industry|cultural goods]], and management of the [[Government Art Collection]] (GAC).

The Secretary of State has responsibility for the maintenance of the land and buildings making up the historic Royal Estate under the [[Crown Lands Act 1851]]. These inherited functions, which were once centralised in the [[Office of Works]], are now delivered as follows:

* The [[Royal Parks]] are maintained by an [[executive agency]] within DCMS, the [[Royal Parks Agency]];
* The [[List of British royal residences|Unoccupied Royal Palaces in England]] are managed by a contract with [[Historic Royal Palaces]];
* Maintenance of the [[List of British royal residences|Occupied Royal Palaces in England]] was funded by an annual Grant-in-Aid to the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]] until 31 March 2012.  The Secretary of State for Culture retains legal responsibility for these palaces, but from 1 April 2012 this funding was amalgamated with the [[Civil List]] into a single [[Sovereign Grant Act 2011|Sovereign Grant]] administered by HM Treasury.  DCMS continues to make a separate small grant to the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]] for the maintenance of [[Marlborough House]]

The Department also has responsibility for state ceremonial occasions and royal funerals.  However, responsibility for the [[Civil List]] element of Head of State expenditure and income from the separate [[Crown Estate]] remains with the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. 

DCMS works jointly with the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS) on [[design]] issues, including sponsorship of the [[Design Council]], and on relations with the [[computer games]] and [[Publishing industry|publishing industries]].

DCMS organises the annual [[Remembrance Day|Remembrance Day Ceremony]] at the [[Cenotaph]] and has responsibility for providing [[humanitarian assistance]] in the event of a [[disaster]]. In the Government's response to the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] the department coordinated humanitarian support to the relatives of victims and arranged the memorial events.

DCMS has also supported U.K Cyber [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/386093/The_UK_Cyber_Security_Strategy_Report_on_Progress_and_Forward_Plans_-_De___.pdf initiatives] such as the [https://www.ukcybersecurityforum.com/ UK Cyber Security Forum] to support innovation in the cyber industry.

==Headquarters==
The main offices are at 100 [[Whitehall|Parliament Street]], occupying part of the building known as [[Government Offices Great George Street]].

'''''Deranged''''' (also known as '''''Deranged: Confessions of a Necrophile''''')&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; is a 1974 Canadian-American [[horror film]] directed by [[Alan Ormsby]] and Jeff Gillen, and starring [[Roberts Blossom]]. Its plot, loosely based on the crimes of [[Ed Gein]], follows Ezra Cobb, a middle-aged man in a rural Midwestern community who begins a string of serial murders and [[grave robbing|grave robberies]] after the death of his mother, a religious fanatic who raised him to be a [[misogynist]]. Though based on Gein, the film's title is misleading since Gein never experimented with [[necrophilia]]; although a necrophile is also defined as "an obsessive fascination with death and corpses."

Funded by an American concert promoter on a small budget, the production took place in [[Oshawa]], Ontario in the winter of 1973, with a largely Canadian cast and crew. The film premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on March 20, 1974. 

==Plot==
Middle-aged Ezra Cobb helps operate a farm in the rural [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] with his elderly mother, Amanda, a religious fanatic who has indoctrinated him since childhood to abhor women. Amanda dies following a protracted illness, and Ezra withdraws. Nearly a year after her death, he experiences [[auditory hallucination]]s that compel him to exhume his mother. He arrives at her grave one night and digs up her decomposed body, returning it to his home where he cobbles it together using discarded fish skin and wax.

Ezra becomes acquainted with Maureen Selby, an eccentric middle-aged woman and proclaimed [[psychic]]. One night during a preemptive sexual encounter, he murders her, an event that sets him off on a chain of [[serial killer|serial killings]]. He first sets his attention on a 34-year-old waitress, Mary Ransum, whom he becomes acquainted with. He slashes her tires one night, leaving her stranded at the restaurant after-hours, and then appears under the guise of offering her a ride. She reluctantly agrees to ride with him to his house, where he says he has spare tires. After waiting in the truck for an extended period of time, Mary goes to look for him. In the house, she finds Ezra in a bedroom surrounded by the corpses of his mother and others, his face obscured with a mask made of human flesh. She attempts to flee, but he incapacitates her.

Later, Mary awakens bound in a closet, wearing only undergarments. Ezra escorts her to the dining room, where he seats her at a table surrounded by corpses. He becomes aroused and begins molesting her, during which she convinces him to free her arms. She manages to smash a bottle over his head, but he beats her to death with a human [[femur]] bone. A short time later, Ezra visits his friend, Harlon, at his house, and discusses Mary's disappearances. In conversation, Ezra references her "being over at his place," a comment Harlon takes in jest. Harlon's teenage son, Brad, arrives with his girlfriend, Sally Mae, who immediately catches Ezra's interest. He later visits her while she works her cashier job at a local store, and shoots her with a rifle; the bullet grazes her head, but does not kill her.

Ezra places Sally Mae in the bed of his truck and drives away, but she awakens and escapes on foot, fleeing into the woods. She inadvertently runs over a [[Trapping|bear trap]] earlier set by Harlon and Brad. The trap mangles her foot, and she attempts to hide amidst the underbrush, but Ezra finds her and shoots her to death. Harlon and Brad return to the store and find blood and broken glasses at the cash register, but no sign of Sally Mae; Brad recalls to the sheriff that Ezra was the last person he saw at the store.

Ezra brings Sally Mae's corpse to his farm, where he hangs it upside down in the barn and begins [[skinning]] the body. Harlon, Brad, and the sheriff arrive and find him in his kitchen, laughing over a bowl of blood.

==Production==
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}
===Screenplay===
''Deranged'' is presented as a true story, and features a unique [[narration|narrative]] method in which Tom Simms, a reporter who purportedly covered the events depicted in the film, narrates onscreen, sometimes appearing within the [[diegesis]] of individual sequences.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} 

===Filming===
Principal photography took place over a period of two months between February and March 1973 in [[Oshawa]], Ontario, Canada, on a budget of $200,000.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; Producer Tom Karr, who had been fascinated with Ed Gein for many years, funded the film himself with income he had earned as a concert promoter for [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Three Dog Night]].&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; The Canadian location was chosen to ensure the film achieved a wintry setting.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; Locations used included an abandoned farmhouse, a local hardware store, and a basement location in the hotel in which the cast and crew were lodging.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; The majority of interior scenes were shot on sets constructed at a local motion picture studio.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt;

The film's art director, Albert Fisher, dressed the sets with stacks of crime serials and pornographic magazines; Fisher garnered inspiration by reading newspaper stories about Ed Gein and his crimes.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt;

==Release==
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}
===Censorship===
In order to achieve an R-rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), several sequences were truncated or excised entirely.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; Among these included an extended murder sequence involving Mary, as well as a protracted dissection sequence in which Ezra mutilates a corpse.&lt;ref name=afi/&gt;

===Theatrical release===
''Deranged'' had its theatrical premiere in [[Los Angeles]], California on March 20, 1974.&lt;ref name=afi&gt;{{cite web|work=[[American Film Institute|American Film Institute Catalog]]|title=Deranged|accessdate=May 20, 2018|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/67635?sid=a68d66ce-d566-4d67-9bc7-f869ec947ce9&amp;sr=1.479148&amp;cp=1&amp;pos=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Home media===
In 2002, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] released ''Deranged'' as part of its "[[Midnite Movies]]" collection of double feature [[DVD]]s. It was released along with the 1980 feature film ''[[Motel Hell]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blu-ray.com/dvd/Deranged-and-Motel-Hell-DVD/9563/| title=Deranged / Motel Hell DVD| work=Blu-ray.com| date=| accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second release of the film was also made available in the United States on DVD from Desert Island Classics on March 5, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.amazon.com/Deranged-Roberts-Blossom/dp/B00J5GV9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430397296&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=deranged+dvd| title=Deranged| work=[[Amazon.com]]| date=| accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Germany]] released a 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition. Where the U.S. DVD received a cut R-rating, the German version is unrated and uncut, with a brain-scooping scene which is cut from the U.S. version, it is also in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, with both an [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] (dubbed) audio track and optional English and German subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blu-ray.com/dvd/Deranged-DVD/32790/| title=Deranged DVD| work=Blu-ray.com| date=| accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Deranged'' was released on [[Blu-ray]] format in the United Kingdom via [[Arrow Films]] on August 19, 2013, which contains both a Blu-ray and DVD of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.arrowfilms.co.uk/deranged/| title=Deranged| work=[[Arrow Films]]| date=| accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on Blu-ray in the United States on July 7, 2015 by [[Kino Lorber]] distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Deranged-Blu-ray/123900/| title=Deranged Blu-ray| work=Blu-ray.com| date=| accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}
''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'''s review of the film was mostly positive, writing,  "The more sensationalist aspects of the story are admirably underplayed, and Blossom's nicely gauged performance lends the film surprising conviction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/deranged|work=Time Out|location=London|title=Deranged|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' awarded the film three out of five stars, praising Blossom's performance and calling it "an accurately recounted horror film inspired by the life of crazed Wisconsin farmer Ed Gein, who actually murdered, skinned and preserved body parts of dozens of women in the late 1950s... A sick little film but told with a disturbing sense of humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/deranged/review/112704/|author=TV Guide Staff|accessdate=May 22, 2018|title=Deranged - Review|work=[[TV Guide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Remer from [[DVD Talk]] gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars, writing, "''Deranged'' is a cult classic that deserves a massively larger cult. Its performances are surprisingly vivid and realistic, its script is smart and subtly funny, its gore is stomach-churning, and its suspense scenes are genuinely nerve-jangling."&lt;ref name="remerdvdtalk"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Remer |first1=Justin |title=Deranged (Blu-ray) : DVD Talk Review of the Blu-ray |url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/68591/deranged/ |website=DVD Talk.com |publisher=Justin Remer |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Donald Guarisco of [[AllMovie]] wrote: "''Deranged'' is interesting because it as witty as it is scary. The film suffers from rough edges, the main problems being inconsistent pacing and a stilted framing device involving an investigative reporter, but remains compelling because it adds some perceptive social satire into the mix."&lt;ref name="allmovierewiew"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guarisco|first1=Donald|title=Deranged (1974)|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/deranged-v13321/review|work=[[AllMovie]]|accessdate=  August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fall guy''' is a colloquial phrase that refers to a person to whom [[blame]] is deliberately and falsely attributed in order to deflect blame from another party.

== Origin ==

&lt;!-- Numerous, perhaps spurious origins are currently cited (even if they are of "unreliable" origin. This can and should be pared down once more as authoritative sources come to light. Currently, all viable word origins are included to help the search/verification process. All original thought in this article needs to be stricken. --&gt;
The origin of the term "fall guy" is unknown and contentious. Many sources place its origin in the early 20th century, while some claim an earlier origin. In April 2007, [[William Safire]] promoted a search to unearth its origins.&lt;ref&gt;William Safire, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/magazine/01wwln-safire.t.html?_r=2&amp;ref=magazine&amp;oref=slogin&amp; "Sweet Spot"], New York Times Magazine, 1 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Safire, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/29/magazine/29wwlnsafire.t.html?ref=magazine "Fall Guy"], ''The New York Times'' Magazine, 29 Apr 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Four slightly different usages for "fall guy" survive and their origins are probably different. These usages are:

# An innocent [[scapegoating|scapegoat]] is unjustly punished for another's action.
# A scapegoat takes the blame for the actions of a group.
# A dupe takes the butt of jokes.
# A worker takes on the responsibilities of others.

The phrase may have multiple, separate origins. Criminal usage goes back to the original sense of "felon" (derived from fallen, morally).

=== Other alternatives and citations ===

&lt;!-- This can/should be pared down once more authoritative sources come to light. Currently, all viable word origins are included to help the search/verification process. --&gt;

* The term "fall guy" appears in an April 26, 1903, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article "PLOT TO DEFEAT MUELLER BILL"&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/407128001.html?dids=407128001:407128001&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr+26%2C+1903&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=PLOT+TO+DEFEAT+MUELLER+BILL&amp;pqatl=google PLOT TO DEFEAT MUELLER BILL] April 26, 1903 ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lighter's Historical Dictionary of American Slang (HDAS) places the origin in 1904 (although it is apparently missing citations for 1906). The usage here may have a flavor relating more to the innocent rather than the guilty scapegoat.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/alt.usage.english/browse_thread/thread/01f4571ca01a5354/c7794bc822a3d42c?lnk=raot&amp;&amp;_done=%2Fgroup%2Falt.usage.english%2Fbrowse_thread%2Fthread%2F01f4571ca01a5354%2Fc7794bc822a3d42c%3Flnk%3Draot%26 |title=Origin of "fall guy" - alt.usage.english &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) places the origin in 1906 (Green At Actors' Boarding House 226). The usage here conforms to that of the guilty scapegoat.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;
* In ''[[The New York Times]]'': This article is concurrent with the OED citation (no within year dates for OED citation yet found).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0C1FF83A5A12738DDDA00A94DC405B868CF1D3 |title=Who Planned the Steunenberg Murder? - Forthcoming Trial of the Men Charged With Conspiracy in the Assassination of Idaho's Ex-Governor.

* The Online Etymological Dictionary places the origin at 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Fall&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual passage they cite is unstated, although probably citing the OED.
* Gary Martin dates the origin to at least 1904 (''Oakland Tribune'', December 1904) although possibly earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/fall-guy.html |title=Fall guy |publisher=Phrases.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the citation Martin provides shades meaning more closely to "one who takes on the responsibilities or workload of others" (this sense seems analogous to the modern phrase "delegate down") than to the more criminal connotation. He also makes a connection to the phrase "fall money" that existed in late 19th-century American idiom. If fall guy derives from "fall money", then this may be the earliest possibility.
* "POOLROOM SHARPS SWOOP ON BASEBALL; Crippled Badly by Race Track Legislation, Gamblers Turn to National Game."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', February 28, 1911, Tuesday&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "fall guy" here refers, apparently, to a sucker who makes bets at bad odds. There is a reference to being unable (or finding it difficult) to hedge bets against a "'Dutch book – with reverse English." No guilt is associated with the fall guy, only [[gullibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1911/02/28/archives/poolroom-sharps-swoop-on-baseball-crippled-badly-by-race-track.html |title=POOLROOM SHARPS SWOOP ON BASEBALL - Crippled Badly by Race Track Legislation, Gamblers Turn to National Game. - Article - NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The phrase was in prominent usage by at least 1930,  when Hammett published ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. Hammett adopts the guilty scapegoat interpretation.
* Various compiled glossaries:
** ''The New York Times'': An article about John Wilstach included a jargon dictionary has both 'fall guy' and 'fall money', implying that phrases were well known by then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A16FC3C5F1B728DDDA00994DF405B818FF1D3 |title=WORDS NOT WHAT THEY SEEM - In Underworld Argot They Have Different Meanings From Those Found in Dictionaries - Article - NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Possibly arose from hobo lingo predating the 20th century. Alternatively, they may have picked it up from the criminal classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=452013|title=Hobo Lingo|first=Nicholas|last=Klein|date=1 January 1926|publisher=|journal=American Speech|volume=1|issue=12|pages=650–653|doi=10.2307/452013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*** to fall, n. to get in trouble with the law

=== Discredited origins ===

==== Guy Fawkes ====

Various sources attribute the origin of fall guy to [[Guy Fawkes]] and the [[Gunpowder Plot]]. This has been largely discredited.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==== Teapot connection ====

One popular myth is that the word's origin dates to the 1920s, during the administration of [[U.S. President]] [[Warren G. Harding]] (1921–1923), when [[Albert B. Fall]], a [[U.S. Senator]] from [[New Mexico]] who served as [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] during Harding's years in office, became notorious for his involvement in the infamous [[Teapot Dome Scandal]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Though this is a popular story, references to 'fall guy' and Albert Fall have not been found. The book ''The Tempest Over Teapot Dome'' contains no references to "fall guy". A ''Time'' article from the period makes no reference to "fall guys", although the scandal may have had yet to fully play out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928930-1,00.html |title=National Affairs: Villains? Goat? |publisher=TIME |date=1928-10-29 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this event may have popularized the phrase (via post-hoc [[eponymy]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}&lt;!-- Probably need to check WSJ from the era, as WSJ helped cover/break the story --&gt;

=== Political crossover ===

Legitimization occurred in the 1940s, primarily with the meaning of "take on work/responsibility". A paper on "Isolationism is not dead" quotes an anonymous editorial from a paper in the Pacific Northwest on the topic of the Bretton Woods and the Food Conferences upon which the US became the "fall guy, the one to carry the load".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} By 1950 in the context of unions and industrial society, the term referred to the low man on the totem pole, to whom the unpleasant tasks would be assigned, specifically that of filling out questionnaires.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

By the 1950s and 1960s, "fall guy" came to mean public "whipping boy" in the abstract, metaphorical sense. In a 1960 paper called the "Politics of Pollution", Robert Bulard writes public officials, to deflect criticism over landfills, found a "fall guy", but they blamed abstract, faceless bodies: "the federal government, state governments and private disposal companies" rather than an individual.&lt;ref name=bullard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bullard|first=Robert D.|author2=Beverly Hendrix Wright |title=The Politics of Pollution: Implications for the Black Community|journal=Phylon|date=1986|volume=47|issue=1|pages=71–78 |jstor=274696 |doi=10.2307/274696}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other abstract 'fall guys' included the railroad and bank capital.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Use of the political "fall guy" is exemplified in the following three events:
# The [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy]]: Oswald was not commonly referred to as a "fall guy" until 1964 when Joachim Joesten used the term in his book title ''Oswald, Assassin or Fall Guy?''. Oswald “was ‘a fall guy’" to use the parlance of the kind of men who must have planned the details of the assassination”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://karws.gso.uri.edu/jfk/The_critics/Joesten/Joestenbio.html |title=Biography of Joachim Joesten |publisher=Karws.gso.uri.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205201538/http://karws.gso.uri.edu/jfk/The_critics/Joesten/Joestenbio.html |archivedate=2012-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Iran Contra Scandal]]: The term entered into public consciousness, if not quite into everyday parlance. Before this scandal Richard Safire seems to have kept the phrase alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40B14F63B5C0C758DDDAC0894DB484D81|title=ESSAY; TO PAY PAUL|first=William|last=Safire|date=16 May 1983|publisher=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B13FD385C0C7A8EDDAE0894DD484D81|title=ESSAY;   Help Wanted: Villain|first=William|last=Safire|date=29 July 1985|publisher=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase's use increased after Iran-Contra in 1987; Representative [[Louis Stokes]]' used the phrase during a session of Congress in regard to [[Oliver North]]'s steadfastness and loyalty during the hearings.&lt;ref&gt;See official transcript, but also "The discourse of American civil society: A new proposal for cultural studies".

'''Feminism''' is a range of [[political movement]]s, [[ideologies]], and [[social movement]]s that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social [[Gender equality|equality of sexes]].&lt;ref name="Hawkesworth"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hawkesworth | first=Mary E.|title=Globalization and Feminist Activism |year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |pages=25–27 |isbn=9780742537835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beasley"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Beasley |first=Chris |title=What is Feminism? |year=1999|publisher=Sage |location=New York |pages=3–11 |isbn=9780761963356}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men.

[[Feminist movement]]s have campaigned and continue to campaign for [[women's rights]], including the right to [[Women's suffrage|vote]], to hold public office, [[Right to work|to work]], to earn fair [[wages]] or [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]], to [[Right to property|own property]], [[Right to education|to receive education]], to enter contracts, to have equal rights within [[marriage]], and to have [[maternity leave]]. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and [[social integration]], and to protect women and girls from [[rape]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="Echols"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Echols |first=Alice |authorlink=Alice Echols |title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-1787-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |magazine=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical [[Social change|societal changes]] for [[women's rights]], particularly in [[Western world|the West]], where they are near-universally credited with achieving [[women's suffrage]], [[gender neutrality in English]], [[reproductive rights]] for women (including access to [[contraceptive]]s and [[support for the legalization of abortion|abortion]]), and the right to enter into contracts and [[property|own property]].&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Messer-Davidow |first=Ellen |title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse |year=2002 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, [[North Carolina|NC]] |isbn=978-0-8223-2843-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including [[bell hooks]], argue for the inclusion of [[men's liberation]] within its aims because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="hooks"/&gt;
[[Feminist theory]], which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.&lt;ref name="Chodorow1989"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Chodorow, Nancy |title=Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory |year=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=978-0-300-05116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gilligan1977"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |year=1977 |title=In a Different Voice: Women's Conceptions of Self and of Morality|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=47|issue=4 |pages=481–517|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-47,-issue-4/herarticle/women-s-conceptions-of-self-and-of-morality_917 |accessdate=8 June 2008 |doi=10.17763/haer.47.4.g6167429416hg5l0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism have been [[feminism#Civil rights movement and anti-racism|criticized]] for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism led to the creation of ethnically specific or [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] forms of feminism, including [[black feminism]] and [[Intersectionality|intersectional feminism]].&lt;ref name=Weedon/&gt;

The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] comprised women's suffrage movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, promoting women's right to vote. The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] was associated with the ideas and actions of the [[women's liberation movement]] beginning in the 1960s. The second wave campaigned for legal and social equality for women. The [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] is a continuation of, and a reaction to, the perceived failures of second-wave feminism, which began in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Suffragettes to Grrls"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krolokke |first1=Charlotte |first2=Anne Scott |last2=Sorensen |title=Gender Communication Theories and Analyses: From Silence to Performance |year=2005 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-2918-5 |page=24 |chapter=Three Waves of Feminism: From Suffragettes to Grrls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] which introduced the [[Tender years doctrine]] for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1 872 870 57 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=L.

For example, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] passed legislation in 1884, [[New South Wales]] in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's [[suffrage]], though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's [[Sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual]], [[reproductive rights|reproductive]], and [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]] as well.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464&gt;{{cite book |author=Freedman, Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back : The History of Feminism and the Future of Women |year=2003 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's suffrage]] (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain's [[Australasia]]n colonies at the close of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of [[Feminism in New Zealand|New Zealand]] granting women the [[right to vote]] in 1893 and South Australia granting female suffrage in 1895.

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] the Suffragettes and the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies|Suffragists]] campaigned for the women's vote, and in 1918 the [[Representation of the People Act 1918|Representation of the People Act]] was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property.

According to Nawar al-Hassan Golley, Arab feminism was closely connected with [[Arab nationalism]].

In [[Women in France|France]], women obtained the [[Women's suffrage#France|right to vote]] only with the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] of 21 April 1944. The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by [[Fernand Grenier]], they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier's proposition was adopted 51 to 16. In May 1947, following the [[French legislative election, November 1946|November 1946 elections]], the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the "[[gender differences|gender gap]]", stating in ''[[Le Populaire]]'' that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] period, feminism waned in importance. Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles.&lt;ref name=Bard&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christine |last=Bard |url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&amp;rub=dossier&amp;item=7 |title=Les premières femmes au Gouvernement (France, 1936–1981) |trans-title=First Women in Government (France, 1936–1981) |journal=[[Histoire@Politique]] |issue=1 |date=May–June 2007 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mid-twentieth century ===
By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, women still lacked some significant rights. Feminists in these countries continued to fight for voting rights. In [[Women in Switzerland|Switzerland]], women gained the [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland|right to vote]] in federal [[Elections in Switzerland|elections]] in 1971;&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=United Nations press release of a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), issued on 14 January 2003 |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Liechtenstein]], women were given the right to vote by the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]]. Three prior referendums held in [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1968|1968]], [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1971|1971]] and [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1973|1973]] had failed to secure women's right to vote.

Feminists continued to campaign for the reform of [[family law]]s which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the 20th century [[coverture]] had been abolished in the UK and the US, in many [[continental European]] countries married women still had very few rights. For instance, in France married women did not receive the right to work without their husband's permission until 1965.&lt;ref name=Guillaumin&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillaumin|first=Colette|year=1994 |title=Racism, Sexism, Power, and Ideology |pages=193–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meltzer&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Françoise |year=1995 |title=Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have also worked to abolish the [[marital rape|"marital exemption" in rape laws]] which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite book |last=Allison |first=Julie A. |year=1995 |title=Rape: The Misunderstood Crime |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], [[Victoria Woodhull]] and [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy]] to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed;&lt;ref name=Bland&gt;{{cite book |last=Bland |first=Lucy |year=2002 |title=Banishing the Beast: Feminism, Sex and Morality |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cl8nLdfgz1IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |accessdate=25 August 2013 |pages=135–49|isbn=9781860646812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1040-0656 | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 54–68 [60] | last = Palczewski | first = Catherine Helen | title = Voltairine de Cleyre: Sexual Slavery and Sexual Pleasure in the Nineteenth Century | journal = NWSA Journal | date = 1995-10-01 | jstor = 4316402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries, but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowell |first1=Nancy A. |last2=Burgess |first2=Ann W. |year=1997 |title=Understanding Violence Against Women |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] provided a [[Marxist]] solution and an [[existentialist]] view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' (''[[The Second Sex]]'') in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bergoffen |first=Debra |title=Simone de Beauvoir |date=16 August 2010 |origyear=17 August 2004 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/ |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice.

Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;

Second-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author [[Carol Hanisch]] coined the slogan "The Personal is Political", which became synonymous with the second wave.&lt;ref name=Echols/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanisch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |title=Hanisch, New Intro to 'The Personal is Political' – Second Wave and Beyond |accessdate=8 June 2008 |last=Hanisch |first=Carol |date=1 January 2006 |website=The Personal Is Political |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515014413/http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |archivedate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved.&lt;ref name="Dooling" /&gt;

In 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Feminism in Egypt|Egypt]] initiated "[[state feminism]]", which outlawed [[Human rights in Egypt#Status of women|discrimination based on gender]] and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political [[activism]] by feminist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badran |first=Margot |title=Feminists, Islam, and nation: gender and the making of modern Egypt |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-691-02605-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]]'s presidency, his wife, [[Jehan Sadat]], publicly advocated further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new [[Islamist]] movement and growing conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Bonnie G. |title=Global feminisms since 1945 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-18491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [[Islamic feminism]], which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/16-31Jan04-Print-Edition/1631200425.htm |title=Islamic feminism means justice to women |website= The Mili Gazette |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Feminism in Latin America|Latin America]], revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as [[Role of women in Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]], where [[feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution]] aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.&lt;ref name="parpart"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parpart |first=Jane L. |last2=Connelly |first2=M.

In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]]'s book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' was published and helped voice the discontent that American women felt. The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/us/betty-friedan-who-ignited-cause-in-feminine-mystique-dies-at-85.html|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85|date=5 February 2006|author=Margalit Fox|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's success also meant that Friedan could lecture her views while she was on tour in 1970.

[[File:Lozu mont oct8 bellhooooooooks.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Feminist, author and social activist [[bell hooks]] (b. 1952).]]
[[Third-wave feminism]] is traced to the emergence of the [[Riot grrrl]] feminist [[punk subculture]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Feliciano (New York Public Library, 2013): "The emergence of the Riot Grrrl movement began in the early 1990s, when a group of women in Olympia, Washington, held a meeting to discuss how to address sexism in the punk scene. The women decided they wanted to start a 'girl riot' against a society they felt offered no validation of women's experiences. And thus the Riot Grrrl movement was born."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement|url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Anita Hill]]'s televised testimony in 1991—to an all-male, all-white [[Senate Judiciary Committee]]—that [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]], nominated for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], had [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] her.

Third-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's [[Essentialism|essentialist]] definitions of [[femininity]], which, third-wave feminists argued, over-emphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on "[[wikt:micropolitics|micro-politics]]" and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Astrid |title=Not my mother's sister: generational conflict and third-wave feminism |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-21713-4 |pages=1–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillis |first1=Stacy |last2=Howie |first2=Gillian |last3=Munford |first3=Rebecca |title=Third wave feminism: a critical exploration |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-0-230-52174-2 |pages=xxviii, 275–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faludi&gt;{{cite book |last=Faludi |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Faludi |title=Backlash: the undeclared war against women |year=1992 |publisher=Vintage |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-922271-2}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities.&lt;ref name=Gillis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leslie |first1=Heywood |last2=Drake |first2=Jennifer |title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-3005-9}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between [[difference feminism|difference feminists]], who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to [[social conditioning]].&lt;ref name=Gilligan&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |authorlink=Carol Gilligan |title=In a different voice: psychological theory and women's development |year=1993 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-44544-4 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view that believes a persons' social position influences their knowledge.  This perspective argues that research and theory treats women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = standpoint theory {{!}} feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/standpoint-theory|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, [[Standpoint feminism|standpoint feminists]] have argued that the feminist movement should address [[global issue]]s (such as rape, [[incest]], and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as [[female genital mutilation]] in some parts of [[Women in Africa|Africa]] and [[Women in Arab societies|Arab societies]], as well as [[glass ceiling]] practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, [[homophobia]], [[classism]] and [[colonization]] in a "[[matrix of domination]]".&lt;ref name="BFT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harding2003&gt;{{cite book |last=Harding |first=Sandra |authorlink=Sandra Harding |title=The Feminist Standpoint Theory Reader: Intellectual and Political Controversies |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-94501-1 |pages=1–16, 67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fourth-wave feminism]] refers to a resurgence of interest in feminism that began around 2012 and is associated with the use of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=4thWave-Guardian20131210/&gt; According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to [[sexual harassment]] and [[violence against women]].

Fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology", according to [[Kira Cochrane]], and is characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]] and further [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|website=NOW Toronto|publisher=|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"/&gt;

Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include [[street harassment|street]] and [[workplace harassment]], [[campus sexual assault]] and [[rape culture]]. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement. These have included the 2012 [[2012 Delhi gang rape|Delhi gang rape]], 2012 [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile allegations]], the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault case|Bill Cosby allegations]], 2014 [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]], 2016 [[trial of Jian Ghomeshi]], 2017 [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein allegations]] and subsequent [[Weinstein effect]], and the 2017 [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals|Westminster sexual scandals]].&lt;ref&gt;For Cosby, Ghomeshi, #MeToo, and fourth wave, see Matheson, Kelsey (17 October 2017).

==== Post-feminism ====
The term [[post-feminism]] is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being "anti-feminist", post-feminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third and fourth wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth |title=Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) |year=2000 |publisher=Totem Books |isbn=978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other post-feminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modleski |first=Tania |title=Feminism without women: culture and criticism in a 'postfeminist' age |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-90416-2 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Amelia |chapter=Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art |title=New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action |editor1-first=Joana |editor1-last=Frueh |editor2-first=Cassandra L. |editor2-last=Langer |editor3-first=Arlene |editor3-last=Raven |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1994 |pages=16–41, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Chunn notes a "blaming narrative" under the post-feminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for [[gender equality]] in a "post-feminist" society, where "gender equality has (already) been achieved." According to Chunn, "many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them."&lt;ref&gt;Chunn, D. (2007).

== Theory ==
{{main|Feminist theory}}
{{see also|Gynocriticism|écriture féminine}}
Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work in a variety of disciplines, including [[feminist anthropology|anthropology]], [[feminist sociology|sociology]], [[feminist economics|economics]], [[women's studies]], [[feminist literary criticism|literary criticism]],&lt;ref name=Zajko&gt;{{cite book |author=Zajko, Vanda |author2=Leonard, Miriam |title=Laughing with Medusa: classical myth and feminist thought |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-927438-3 |page=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Howe&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Mica |last2=Aguiar |first2=Sarah Appleton |title=He said, she says: an RSVP to the male text |year=2001 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location=Madison, NJ |isbn=978-0-8386-3915-3 |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art history#Psychoanalytic art history|art history]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Griselda |last=Pollock |title=Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=1–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist theory#Psychoanalysis|psychoanalysis]]&lt;ref name=matrixial_borderspace&gt;{{cite book |author=Ettinger, Bracha |authorlink=Bracha Ettinger |author2=[[Judith Butler]] |author3=Brian Massumi |author4=Griselda Pollock  |title=The matrixial borderspace |year=2006 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-3587-0 |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[feminist philosophy|philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brabeck, M. and Brown, L.

While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, [[stereotyping]], [[objectification]] (especially [[sexual objectification]]), [[oppression]], and [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name=Chodorow1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=gilligan1977/&gt;
In the field of [[literary criticism]], [[Elaine Showalter]] describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls "feminist critique", in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls "[[gynocriticism]]", in which the "woman is producer of textual meaning". The last phase she calls "gender theory", in which the "ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored".&lt;ref name=showalter1979&gt;{{cite book |last1=Showalter |first1=Elaine |authorlink1=Elaine Showalter |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Jacobus |title=Women Writing about Women |year=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-85664-745-1 |pages=25–36 |chapter=Towards a Feminist Poetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was paralleled in the 1970s by [[French structuralist feminism|French feminists]], who developed the concept of ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (which translates as 'female or feminine writing').&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; [[Helene Cixous]] argues that writing and philosophy are ''[[Wikt:phallocentric|phallocentric]]'' and along with other French feminists such as [[Luce Irigaray]] emphasize "writing from the body" as a subversive exercise.&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; The work of [[Julia Kristeva]], a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and [[Bracha Ettinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, 'The Matrixial Borderspace'.

However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, "none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] world".&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moi1986&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kristeva |first1=Julia |last2=Moi |first2=Toril |authorlink2=Toril Moi |title=The Kristeva reader |year=1986 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-06325-8 |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent feminist theory, such as that of Lisa Lucile Owens,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite journal |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |first=Lisa Lucile |last=Owens |journal=Alabama Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=5 |page=1 |year=2003 |ssrn=2439294}}&lt;/ref&gt; has concentrated on characterizing feminism as a universal emancipatory movement.

== Movements and ideologies ==
{{Main|Feminist movements and ideologies}}
[[File:Woman-power emblem.svg|upright=0.45|thumb|right|A symbol of feminism based on the [[Venus symbol]] ]]
Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years.

=== Political movements ===
Some branches of feminism closely track the political leanings of the larger society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. [[Liberal feminism]] seeks individualistic equality of men and women through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality.&lt;ref name="rotten"/&gt; Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;Catherine Rottenberg, "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502386.2013.857361 The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism]", Cultural Studies. (2014) Vol. 28 (3), pgs. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radical feminism]] considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary.&lt;ref name="Echols" /&gt; [[List of conservative feminisms|Conservative feminism]] is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. [[Individualist feminism|Libertarian feminism]] conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-liberal/#ClasCri |title=Liberal Feminism |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Separatist feminism]] does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist.&lt;ref name="hooks"&gt;{{cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |authorlink=Bell hooks |year=2000 |title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-629-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eco-feminist|Ecofeminists]] see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the [[ecology|natural environment]]; ecofeminism has been criticized for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.&lt;ref name="Biehl"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Biehl |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Biehl |title=Rethinking eco-feminist politics |year=1991 |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-392-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materialist ideologies ===
[[Rosemary Hennessy]] and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Hennessy |first= Rosemary |first2=Chrys |last2=Ingraham |title=Materialist feminism: a reader in class, difference, and women's lives |location= London |publisher=Routledge | pages=1–13 |isbn=978-0-415-91634-9 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist feminism]] argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies.&lt;ref name="Bottomore"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bottomore, T.B. |title=A Dictionary of Marxist thought |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | page=215 |isbn=978-0-631-18082-1 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist feminism]] distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Socialist-Feminism.html |title=What is Socialist Feminism? |author=Barbara Ehrenreich |publisher=feministezine.com |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcha-feminism|Anarcha-feminists]] believe that [[class struggle]] and [[anarchism|anarchy]] against the [[State (polity)|state]]&lt;ref name="farrow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunbar-Ortiz |first=Roxanne |title=Quiet Rumours |publisher=AK Press |isbn=978-1-902593-40-1 |year=2002 |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.

=== Black and postcolonial ideologies ===
[[Sara Ahmed]] argues that [[Black feminism|Black]] and [[Postcolonial feminism|Postcolonial]] feminisms pose a challenge "to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought."&lt;ref name="Ahmed"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ahmed, Sarta |title= Transformations: thinking through feminism |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-22066-8 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; During much of its [[history of feminism|history]], feminist movements and [[Feminism#Theoretical schools|theoretical developments]] were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walker, Alice |title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose |year=1983 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |isbn=978-0-15-144525-7 |page=397|title-link=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFT"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill Collins |first=P. |title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |pages=1–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Narayan"/&gt; However women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms.&lt;ref name="BFT" /&gt; This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the collapse of European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in [[Third World|developing nations]] and [[postcolonialism|former colonies]] and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms.&lt;ref name="Narayan" /&gt; [[Womanism]]&lt;ref name="Ogunyemi"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/494200 |title=Womanism: The Dynamics of the Contemporary Black Female Novel in English |year=1985 |last1=Ogunyemi |first1=Chikwenye Okonjo |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=63–80 |jstor=3174287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolawole"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Kolawole, Mary Ebun Modupe |title=Womanism and African Consciousness |year=1997 |publisher=Africa World Press |location=Trenton, N.J. |isbn=978-0-86543-540-7 |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless.&lt;ref name=Weedon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weedon |first=Chris |title=Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective |year=2002 |url=http://www.genderforum.org/issues/genderealisations/key-issues-in-postcolonial-feminism-a-western-perspective/ |journal=Gender Forum |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002056/http://www.genderforum.org/issues/genderealisations/key-issues-in-postcolonial-feminism-a-western-perspective/ |archivedate=3 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Third-world feminism]] and [[Indigenous feminism]] are closely related to postcolonial feminism.&lt;ref name="Narayan"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Narayan |first=Uma |title=Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third-World Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91418-5 |pages=20–28, 113, 161–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism,&lt;ref name="Acholonu"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Obianuju Acholonu |first=Catherine |title=Motherism: The Afrocentric Alternative to Feminism |year=1995 |publisher=Afa Publ. |isbn=978-978-31997-1-2 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiwanism,&lt;ref name="Ogundipe-Leslie"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ogundipe-Leslie |first=Molara |title=Re-creating Ourselves: African Women &amp; Critical Transformations |year=1994 |publisher=Africa World Press |isbn=978-0-86543-412-7 |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; negofeminism,&lt;ref name="Nnaemeka"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nnaemeka |first=Obioma |title=Feminism, Rebellious Women, and Cultural Boundaries: Rereading Flora Nwapa and Her Compatriots |journal=Research in African Literatures |year=1995 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=80–113 |jstor=3820273}}&lt;/ref&gt; femalism, [[transnational feminism]], and [[Africana womanism]].&lt;ref name="Hudson-Weems"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hudson-Weems |first=Clenora |title=Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves |year=1994 |publisher=Bedford Publishers |location=Troy, Mich. |isbn=978-0-911557-11-4 |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to 2015 poll, 18 percent of Americans consider themselves feminists, while 85 percent reported they believe in "equality for women". Despite the popular belief in equal rights, 52 percent did not identify as feminist, 26 percent were unsure, and four percent provided no response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Allum |first=Cynthia  |date=9 April 2015 |title=82 percent of Americans don't consider themselves feminists, poll shows |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/04/09/82-percent-of-americans-dont-consider-themselves-feminists-poll-shows/ |accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2014 [[Ipsos]] poll covering 15 developed countries, 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists, and 87% agreed that "women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency, not their gender". However, only 55% of women agreed that they have "full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations".&lt;ref name=ipsos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=6511 |last=Clark |first=Julia |title= Can Men Be Feminists Too?

Among women, some of the strongest support for feminism was found in Sweden, where one in three (36%) agreed very much that they defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by women in Italy (31%) and Argentina (29%). Those in the middle of the ranking were from Great Britain (22%), Spain (22%), United States (20%), Australia (18%), Belgium (18%), France (18%), Canada (17%), Poland (17%), and Hungary (15%). Women least likely to agree very much were from Japan (8%), Germany (7%) and South Korea (7%).&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

One quarter of men in Italy (25%) and Argentina (25%), and two in ten of those in Poland (21%) and France (19%), defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by those from Sweden (17%), Spain (16%), the United States (16%), Canada (15%), Great Britain (14%), Hungary (12%), Belgium (11%) and Australia (10%). Men least likely to identify this way were from South Korea (7%), Germany (3%) and Japan (3%).&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

Women were more likely to self-identify as being feminists than men in every country in the study except for Poland, where 21% of men were and only 17% of women were likely to agree very much with the statement, and South Korea, where there was no difference between men and women (7%) on this measure.&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

== Sexuality ==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexuality}}
[[Feminist views on sexuality]] vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the [[sex industry]], sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the [[feminist sex wars]], which pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.&lt;ref name=Duggan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Karen Tranberg |last2=Philipson |first2=Ilene J. |title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-87722-630-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-11204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leidholdt |first1=Dorchen |authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt |last2=Raymond |first2=Janice G. |title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-08-037457-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=978-0-04-440593-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the [[sexual revolution]] from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and [[bisexuality|bisexual women]] as part of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=Lesbian History|url=http://www.outhistory.org/exhibits/show/lesbians-20th-century/sex-wars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex industry ===
{{main|Sex industry|Feminist views on pornography|Feminist views on prostitution|Feminist sex wars| Male prostitution#Feminist studies}}
Opinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality. For the views of feminism on male prostitutes see the article on [[Male prostitution#Feminist studies|male prostitution]].

Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of [[violence against women]], to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91036-1 |pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance/&gt; Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affirming female sexual autonomy ===
For feminists, a woman's right to control her own [[Right to sexuality|sexuality]] is a key issue. Feminists such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement, and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rohana Ariffin|author2=Women's Crisis Centre (Pinang, Malaysia)|title=Shame, secrecy, and silence: study on rape in Penang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfsDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=1997|publisher=Women's Crisis Centre|isbn=978-983-99348-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett L, Manderson L, Astbury J.

University of Melbourne, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} cultures, men do not believe that a woman has the right to reject a man's sexual advances or to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} parts of the world, especially in [[conservative]] and religious cultures, marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jewkes R, Abrahams N |title= The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview|pmid=12365533|year=2002|volume=55|issue=7|pages=1231–44|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00242-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen P. Ending the presumption of consent: nonconsensual sex in marriage. London, Centre for Health and Gender Equity, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In more liberal cultures, this entitlement takes the form of a general [[sexualization]] of the whole culture. This is played out in the [[sexual objectification]] of women, with pornography and other forms of sexual entertainment creating the fantasy that all women exist solely for men's sexual pleasure, and that women are readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on a man's terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon |date=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn Hankinson Nelson notes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women, and to "uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them" to account for a range of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1990|title=Who Knows: from Quine To a Feminist Empiricism|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-0-87722-647-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"/&gt; Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortina |first1=L.

One criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1997|title=Feminism, Science, and the Philosophy of Science |publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4611-1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Haack]] also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women's thinking (as intuitive and emotional, etc.); [[Meera Nanda]] further cautions that this may in fact trap women within "traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/ |title=Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science |author=Anderson, Elizabeth |accessdate=6 December 2011|year=2011 |journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |issue=Spring 2011 |editor=Edward N.

Feminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects.

Gender-based inquiries into and conceptualization of architecture have also come about, leading to [[Feminism and modern architecture|feminism in modern architecture]]. Piyush Mathur coined the term "archigenderic". Claiming that "architectural planning has an inextricable link with the defining and regulation of gender roles, responsibilities, rights, and limitations", Mathur came up with that term "to explore&amp;nbsp;... the meaning of 'architecture' in terms of gender" and "to explore the meaning of 'gender' in terms of architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09699089800200034 |title=The archigenderic territories: Mansfield park and a handful of dust |year=1998 |last1=Mathur |first1=Piyush |journal=Women's Writing |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Businesses ===
Feminist activists have established a range of [[feminist businesses]], including women's bookstores, feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, and feminist restaurants.

The feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]]. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel  |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a close link between feminist literature and [[activism]], with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.

Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandra M. |last=Gilbert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260 |title=Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 May 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Broadview Press]] continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the [[University of Kentucky]] has a series of republications of early women's novels.

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) by [[Virginia Woolf]], is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Literary genre|genres and subgenres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies has entered new territories such as the "[[Gothic fiction#The female Gothic and the supernatural explained|female gothic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976).

According to Elyce Rae Helford, "Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helford, Elyce Rae |editor-first=Gary |editor-last=Westfahl |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=Feminist Science Fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15328023top1703_17 |title=Using Science Fiction to Teach the Psychology of Sex and Gender |year=1990 |last1=Lips |first1=Hilary M. |journal=Teaching of Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=197–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts of this kind are [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1970), [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985).

Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, [[Maya Angelou]]'s ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings]]'' was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2018/08/10/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-review-maya-angelou/|title=I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings: Angelou's Quest to Truth and Power|last=Shah|first=Mahvish|date=2018|website=Feminism in India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many feminist movements have embraced [[poetry]] as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/144696/a-change-of-world|title=A Change of World|last=Poetry Foundation|date=2018-11-29|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminism became a principal concern of [[Musicology|musicologists]] in the 1980s&lt;ref name=mus&gt;Beard, David; Gload, Kenneth. 2005. Musicology : The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[New Musicology]]. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of [[Western canon|canon]], genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt; Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like [[Susan McClary]], [[Marcia Citron]] and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and [[Female education|education of women]]; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt;

While the [[music industry]] has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end|first=Jessica |last=Duchen |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[Record producer|music producers]], the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rosina |last=Ncube |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women in Audio? |website=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013 |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/people/sounding-why-so-few-women-audio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{main|Feminist film theory}}
{{see also|Women's cinema}}

Feminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of [[feminist film theory]] in the late '60s and early '70s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward S., ''Cinema Studies – The Key Concepts'', 3rd edn, Routledge, 2006;134–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Differences were particularly marked between [[Feminist film theory#History|feminists on either side of the Atlantic]]. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, [[List of film periodicals|''Women and Film'']]. Trailblazers from this period included [[Claire Johnston]] and [[Laura Mulvey]], who also organized the Women's Event at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival|Edinburgh Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Erens, P., ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism'', Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991; 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include [[Teresa de Lauretis]], Anneke Smelik and [[Kaja Silverman]]. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.

It has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. 'Deconstruction' concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kuhn |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Radstone |editor2-first=S. |title=Women's Companion to International Film |publisher=Virago |year=1990 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/what-really-makes-a-film-feminist/281402/ |title=What really makes a feminist film? |work=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Holly L. |last=Derr |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of "feminist film" approaches has centred around a Swedish rating system called the [[Bechdel test]].

During the 1930s–1950s heyday of the big Hollywood studios, the status of women in the industry was abysmal.&lt;ref&gt;Giannetti L, ''Understanding Movies'', 7th ed. Prentice-Hall 1996;416.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then female directors such as [[Sally Potter]], [[Catherine Breillat]], [[Claire Denis]] and [[Jane Campion]] have made art movies, and directors like [[Kathryn Bigelow]] and [[Patty Jenkins]] have had mainstream success.

Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the twentieth century.

=== Socialism ===
{{main|Left-wing politics#Social progressivism and counterculture|l1=Social Progressivism and Counterculture}}
Since the late nineteenth century some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. [[August Bebel]], an early activist of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), published his work ''Die Frau und der Sozialismus'', juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Stuttgart 1907|International Conference of Socialist Women]] in [[Stuttgart]] where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. [[Clara Zetkin]] of the SPD called for women's suffrage to build a "''socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Badia, Gilbert |title=Zetkin.

In Britain, the women's movement was allied with the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]]. In the U.S., [[Betty Friedan]] emerged from a radical background to take leadership. [[Radical Women]] is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Radical Women Manifesto: Socialist Feminist Theory, Program and Organizational Structure |year=2001 |publisher=Red Letter Press |location=Seattle, WA |isbn=978-0-932323-11-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Dolores Ibárruri]] (''La Pasionaria'') led the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]]. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the [[Anarcha-Feminism|anarcha-feminist]] [[Mujeres Libres]].&lt;ref name="Ib"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ibárruri, Dolores |title=Speeches &amp; Articles, 1936–1938 |year=1938 |publisher=University of Michigan |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists in Ireland in the early 20th century included the [[revolutionary]] [[Irish Republicanism|Irish Republican]], [[suffragette]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Constance Markievicz]] who in 1918 was the first woman elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]]. However, in line with Sinn Féin [[abstentionism|abstentionist]] policy, she would not take her seat in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/internment/intern6.htm|title=Internment – Women Internees 1916–1973|author=John McGuffin|year=1973

=== Fascism ===
{{further|Fascism and ideology|Women in Nazi Germany}}
[[File:Feministas en lucha anti Pinochet (de Kena Lorenzini).jpg|thumb|Chilean feminists protest against the regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]]]]
Fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the [[Fascist manifesto]] in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the ''fasci femminilli'' and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s more conservative coalition partners.&lt;ref name="hagg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hägg |first=Göran |year=2008 |title=Mussolini: En studie i makt |trans-title=A study in power |language=sv |publisher=Norstedt |location=Stockholm |isbn=978-91-1-301949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="passmore"&gt;{{cite book |last=Passmore |first=Kevin |authorlink=Definitions_of_fascism#Kevin_Passmore |year=2003 |title=Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–45 |publisher=Rutgers Univ.

Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], feminism has a complicated relationship with the [[Nazi]] movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment.&lt;ref name=Blamires&gt;{{cite book |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |last=Blamires |first=Cyprian |volume=1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-940-9 |pages=232–33|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism,&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt; and after the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=hww5/&gt; Georges Duby et al. note that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position.&lt;ref name=hww5&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duby |first1=Georges |last2=Perrot |first2=Michelle |last3=Schmitt Pantel |first3=Pauline |title=A history of women in the West |year=1994 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-40369-7 |page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blamires also notes that Neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept "their traditional roles".&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt;

=== Civil rights movement and anti-racism ===
The [[civil rights movement]] has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Peter |year=1998 |title=The Civil Rights Movement |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-29854-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Code |first=Lorraine |title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories |chapter=Civil rights |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-13274-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns.&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt; These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, [[classism]], and [[sexism]], and new feminisms, such as [[black feminism]] and [[Chicana feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roth |first=Benita |title=Separate Roads to Feminism: Black, Chicana, and White feminist movements in America's second wave |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-52972-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winddance Twine |first1=France |first2=Kathleen M. |last2=Blee |title=Feminism and Antiracism: International struggles for justice |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8147-9855-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoliberalism===
[[Neoliberalism]] has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe, especially in the global south.  Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=V. Spike |year=2014 |chapter=International/Global Political Economy |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |edition=2 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134752591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177}} Women's experiences in non-industrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|175}}

Proponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women's participation in the workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have noted that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations.&lt;ref name="elias"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elias |first1=Juanita |last2=Ferguson |first2=Lucy |year=2014 |chapter=Production, Employment, and Consumption |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134752591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|186–98}} Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination in the family and the workplace.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|176}} The "feminization of employment" refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|179}}  Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|180}}  Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as 'secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.&lt;ref name="elias"/&gt;{{rp|189}}

== Societal impact ==
{{Main|Feminist effects on society}}
The feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; greater access to education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"/&gt;

From the 1960s on, the campaign for women's rights&lt;ref name="quarterly"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Lockwood, Bert B. |title=Women's Rights: A Human Rights Quarterly Reader |year=2006 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; was met with mixed results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=FROM SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN'S LIBERATION: FEMINISM IN TWENTIETH CENTURY AMERICA by Jo Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.

Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to [[child sexual abuse]]. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rush |first=Florence |authorlink=Florence Rush |year=1988 |title=The Best Kept Secret: Sexual Abuse of Children |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs |isbn=978-0070542235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://now.org/about/history/statement-of-purpose/|title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not pass, although [[Equal Rights Amendment#State constitutions|some states enacted their own]]. [[Reproductive rights]] in the U.S. centred on the court decision in [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' v. ''Wade'']] enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable [[birth control]], allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under [[Margaret Sanger]] and elsewhere under [[Marie Stopes]]. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through [[birth control]], which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1676.html|title=Margaret Sanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[division of labor|division of labour]] within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework,&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |author2=Machung, Anne |title=The Second Shift |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-14-200292-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild2"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |title=The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-8050-6643-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Cathy Young]] responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/|title=The Mama Lion at the Gate |accessdate=17 December 2015 |publisher=Salon.com |author=Young, Cathy |authorlink=Cathy Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith K. Brown writes, "Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics: the participant is not obliged to be far from home; the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration; and the work is not dangerous, can be performed in spite of interruptions, and is easily resumed once interrupted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Judith K. | last = Brown | title = A Note on the Division of Labor by Sex | date = October 1970 | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 1073–78 | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | doi=10.1525/aa.1970.72.5.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international law, the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]'' (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CEDAW.aspx|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women New York, 18 December 1979 |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisprudence ===
{{Main|Feminist legal theory}}

Feminist jurisprudence is a branch of [[jurisprudence]] that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.&lt;ref name="blacks"&gt;{{cite book |year=2014 |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Bryan |editor-link=Bryan A.

Feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the [[Philosophy of law|philosophical approach]] of modern [[Law#Legal theory|legal scholars]], who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.&lt;ref name="minda"&gt;{{cite book |last=Minda |first=Gary |year=1995 |title=Postmodern Legal Movements: Law and Jurisprudence at Century's End |publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]] |location=N.Y.C. |isbn=978-0814755105 |pages=129–30 |quote=Feminist legal scholars, despite their differences, appear united in claiming that 'masculine' jurisprudence ... fails to acknowledge, let alone respond to, the interests, values, fears, and harms experienced by women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.&lt;ref name=Bundesen&gt;{{cite book |author=Bundesen, Lynne |title=The Feminine Spirit: Recapturing the Heart of Scripture |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-8495-3|date=2007-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian feminism]] is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the [[Christian egalitarianism|equality]] of [[Women in Christianity|women]] and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the [[ordination of women]], male dominance and the balance of parenting in [[Christian views on marriage|Christian marriage]], claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church.&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haddad, Mimi |title=Egalitarian Pioneers: Betty Friedan or Catherine Booth? |journal=Priscilla Papers |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=2006 |url=http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713193304/http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=andeson&gt;{{cite book |author=Anderson, Pamela Sue |author2=Clack, Beverley |title=Feminist philosophy of religion: critical readings |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-25749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian [[Women in the Bible|Bible refers to women]] in positions of authority in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 4:4 and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 22:14.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|4:4|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|22:14|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=April 2016}}

[[Buddhist feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and [[social status]] of [[Women in Buddhism|women within Buddhism]]. It is an aspect of [[feminist theology]] which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective.

[[Jewish feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of [[Women in Judaism|women]] within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women.

Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege, and is dependent on female subordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of sex and gender |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |location=Detroit, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women. [[Carole Pateman]] argues that the patriarchal distinction "between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection."&lt;ref&gt;Pateman, Carole (1988). ''The Sexual Contract'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[feminist theory]] the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tickner, Ann J.|chapter=Patriarchy|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries PZ|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-24352-0|pages=1197–98|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, [[Separatist feminism|separatism]] is the only viable solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hoagland, Lesbian Ethics: toward new value&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminists have criticized these views as being anti-men.&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty.

=== Men and masculinity ===

Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality.

=== Pro-feminism ===
{{main|Pro-feminism}}
Pro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, [[men's studies]], and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.&lt;ref name=Lingard&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Lingard |first1=Bob |last2=Douglas |first2=Peter |title=Men Engaging Feminisms: Pro-Feminism, Backlashes and Schooling |year=1999 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham, England |isbn=978-0-335-19818-4 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimmel-Tide"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Kimmel |first1=Michael S. |authorlink1=Michael Kimmel |last2=Mosmiller |first2=Thomas E. |title=Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990: A Documentary History |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-6767-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Simpson | first1 = John A. | last2 = Weiner | first2 = Edmund S.C. | author-link1 = John Simpson (lexicographer) | author-link2 = Edmund Weiner | contribution = Anti-feminist | editor-last1 = Simpson | editor-first1 = John A. | editor-last2 = Weiner | editor-first2 = Edmund S.

In the nineteenth century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWj5OBvTh1IC&amp;pg=PA35 |chapter=Antifeminism |first=Michael |last=Kimmel |authorlink=Michael Kimmel | editor-last1 = Kimmel | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Aronson | editor-first2 = Amy | editor-link1 = Michael Kimmel | editor-link2 = Amy Aronson | title = Men and masculinities a social, cultural, and historical encyclopedia | pages = 35–37 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781576077740 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. These anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lukas | first = Carrie | author-link = Carrie Lukas | contribution = Marriage: happier ever after | editor-last = Lukas | editor-first = Carrie | editor-link = Carrie Lukas | title = The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism | page = 75 | publisher = Regency Publishing | location = Washington, DC Lanham, Maryland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781596980037 | quote = Feminists' assault on marriage also has played a role in devaluing marriage.

This goal must be achieved at any at all costs – to the woman herself, to the baby, to the family, and to society. Women must be made equal to men in their ability ''not'' to become pregnant and ''not'' to be expected to care for babies they may bring into the world. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gottfried |first=Paul | author-link = Paul Gottfried |title=The trouble with feminism  |url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/ | work = [[LewRockwell.com]] (web magazine) |publisher= [[Lew Rockwell]] |date= 21 April 2001 |accessdate=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = al-Qaradawi | first = Yusuf | author-link = Yusuf al-Qaradawi | contribution = Women and family in Islamist discourses: 'When Islam prohibits something, it closes all the avenues of approach to it'| editor-last = Calvert | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Calvert (scholar) | title = Islamism: a documentary and reference guide | page = 62 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780313338564 | quote = Islamists are aggrieved at the support of ostensibly Muslim governments for the 'alleged' legal emancipation of women, including granting women the right to vote and hold public office, in addition to limited rights to initiate divorce.

}}The [[Fula language]] ({{lang-ff|Fulfulde}}, ''Pulaar'', or ''Pular'') is written primarily in the [[Latin script]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Andrew | last = Dalby | authorlink = Andrew Dalby | title = Dictionary of Languages | publisher = Columbia University Press | date = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in some areas is still written in an older [[Arabic script]] called the [[Ajami script]] or with its own script called Adlam.

==Latin-based alphabets==

===Background===

The [[Latin script]] was introduced to Fula-speaking regions of West and Central Africa by Europeans during, and in some cases immediately before, invasion. Various people — missionaries, colonial administrators, and scholarly researchers — devised various ways of writing . One issue similar to other efforts by Europeans to use their alphabet and home orthographic conventions was how to write African languages with unfamiliar sounds. In the case of Fula, these included how to represent sounds such as the implosive b and d, the ejective y, the [[velar n]] (the latter being present in European languages, but never in initial position), prenasalised consonants, and [[long vowel]]s, all of which are can change meaning.

Major influences on the current forms used for writing Fula were decisions made by colonial administrators in [[Northern Nigeria]] &lt;!-- need to ref. John Philips' book here --&gt; and the [[Africa Alphabet]]. Post independence African governments decided to retain the Latin alphabet as the basis for transcribing their languages. Various writers in Fula, such as [[Amadou Hampate Ba]] and [[Alfa Ibrahim Sow]], wrote and published in this script.

Major UNESCO-sponsored conferences on harmonising Latin-based African language orthographies in Bamako in 1966 and Niamey in 1978 confirmed standards for writing Fula. Nevertheless, orthographies for the language and its variants are determined at the country level. So while Fula writing uses basically the same character sets and rules across the region, there are some minor variations.

===Orthography===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Some general rules:
*Vowels
**Long vowels are doubled
**Two different vowels are never used together
*Consonants
**To accentuate a consonant, double the consonant (or write ⟨'⟩ before the consonant; e.g., "temmeere" = "te'meere".{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}})

===Alphabets by country===
&lt;!-- this section is very rough &amp; needs verification --&gt;

====Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania====
* '''[[a]], [[Aa (digraph)|aa]], [[b]], [[Mb (digraph)|mb]], [[ɓ]], [[c]], [[d]], [[Nd (digraph)|nd]], [[ɗ]], [[e]], ee, [[f]], [[g]], [[Ng (digraph)|ng]], [[h]], [[i]], [[Ii (digraph)|ii]], [[j]], [[Nj (digraph)|nj]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[ŋ]], [[ñ]], [[o]], [[Oo (digraph)|oo]], [[p]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[Letter combination of uu|uu]], [[w]], [[x]], [[y]], [[ƴ]]'''

==== Guinea ====
* '''[[a]], [[b]], [[ɓ]], nb, [[c]], [[d]], [[ɗ]], [[e]], [[f]], [[g]], [[ɠ]], [[Ng (digraph)|ng]], [[h]], [[i]], [[j]], [[Nj (digraph)|nj]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[ɲ]], [[ŋ]], [[o]], [[p]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[w]], [[y]], [[ƴ]]'''
Prior to adoption of this system in 1989, the [[Guinean languages alphabet]] was used. This was based on the simple Latin alphabet with [[Typographical ligature|digraphs]] for the sounds particular to Pular, and is still used by some Pular speakers (in part because it can be typed using commercial keyboards). The character equivalents include: bh = ɓ ; dh = ɗ ; q = ɠ ; ny = ɲ (the French digraph [[Gn (digraph)|gn]] is also used); nh = ŋ ; yh = ƴ. The old system also included: ty = c ; dy = j.

==== Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Liberia ====
* '''[[a]], [[b]], [[ɓ]], [[c]], [[d]], [[ɗ]], [[e]], [[f]], [[g]], [[h]], [[i]], [[j]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[Mb (digraph)|mb]], [[n]], [[Nd (digraph)|nd]], [[Ng (digraph)|ng]], [[Nj (digraph)|nj]], [[ŋ]], [[ñ]], [[o]], [[p]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[w]], [[y]], [[ƴ]], [[']]'''

====Mali, Burkina Faso====

==Arabic (Ajami) alphabet==
The [[Arabic script]] was introduced into the [[West Africa]]n [[Sahel]] with [[Islam]] several centuries before European colonization. As was the case with other languages such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]], Muslim Fulas who went through Koranic education adapted the script to writing their language. This practice, while never formally standardized, followed some patterns of customary use in various regions. These usages differ on some details, mainly on how to represent certain consonants and vowels not present in the [[Arabic language]].

==Unicode==
{{See also|Adlam (Unicode block)}}
The extended Latin characters used in the Latin transcription of Fula were incorporated since an early version of the [[Unicode]] Standard. At least some of the extended Arabic characters used in [[Ajami script|Ajami]] are also in the Unicode standard.

The Adlam alphabet was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 2016 with the release of version 9.0; the proposal was authored by [[Michael Everson]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; In October 2017, Google released a [[Noto font]] that supports the block, Noto Sans Adlam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/get/noto/updates/|title=Updates|website=Google Noto Fonts}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 3, 2018, Microsoft released an updated Ebrima font to support Adlam alphabet to [[Windows Insiders]] as part of the upcoming [[Windows 10]] version 1903 feature update, starting from build 18252.&lt;ref name="Win10"/&gt;

The Unicode block for Adlam is U+1E900–U+1E95F:

In [[Germanic languages]], '''weak verbs''' are by far the largest group of verbs, which are therefore often regarded as the norm ([[regular and irregular verbs|the regular verbs]]), but they are not historically the oldest or most original group.

==General description==
In Germanic languages, weak verbs are those verbs that form their [[preterite]]s and [[past participle]]s by means of a [[Dental consonant|dental]] [[Affix|suffix]], an inflection that contains a {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} sound or similar. (For comparative purposes, they will be referred to as a dental, but in some of the languages, including most varieties of English, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] instead.) In all Germanic languages, the preterite and past participle forms of weak verbs are formed from the same stem.:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! Infinitive
! Preterite-Past participle
|-
| rowspan=2 | English (regular)
| ''to love''
| ''loved''
|-
| ''to laugh''
| ''laughed''
|-
| rowspan=4 | [[English irregular verbs|English (irregular)]]
| ''to say''
| ''said''
|-
| ''to send''
| ''sent''
|-
| ''to buy''
| ''bought''
|-
| ''to set''
| ''set''
|-
| rowspan=2 | German
| ''lieben'' (love)
| ''liebte''
|-
| ''bringen'' (bring)
| ''brachte''
|-
|}

Historically, the pronunciation of the suffix in the vast majority of weak verbs (all four classes) was {{IPA|[ð]}}, but in most sources discussing Proto-Germanic, it is spelled {{angbr|d}} by convention. In the West Germanic languages, the suffix hardened to {{IPA|[d]}}, but it remained a fricative in the other early Germanic languages (Gothic and often in Old Norse).

In English, the dental is a {{IPA|/d/}} after a [[voiced consonant]] (''loved'') or [[vowel]] (''laid''), and a {{IPA|/t/}} after a [[voiceless consonant]] (''laughed''), but English uses the spelling in {{angbr|d}} regardless of pronunciation, with the exception of a few verbs with irregular spellings.

In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are distributed as in English provided there is a following vowel, but when there is no following vowel, [[final devoicing|terminal devoicing]] causes the pronunciation /t/ in all cases. Nevertheless, Dutch still distinguishes the spellings in {{angbr|d}} and {{angbr|t}} even in final position: see the [['t kofschip]] rule.

In [[Afrikaans]], which descends from Dutch, the past tense has fallen out of use altogether, and the past participle is marked only with the prefix ''ge-''. Therefore, the suffix has disappeared along with the forms that originally contained it.

In [[German language|German]] the dental is always {{IPA|/t/}} and always spelled {{angbr|t}} because of the third phase of the [[High German consonant shift]] (d→t).

In [[Low German]], the dental ending of the preterite tense was originally in {{IPA|/d/}} or {{IPA|/t/}}, according to the stem of the verb. However the ending has fallen out in pronunciation, starting in the 17th century when the preterite was written with an ending ''-er'' representing the sound {{IPA|[ɐ]}} which was already the last remain of the former ''-de'' and ''-te'' endings of Middle Low German. Now, the only Low German verb that still shows a remnant of dental ending is ''leggen'', which has the preterite ''leed'', and the verb ''hebben'', which has ''harr'' with old ''r''-ending from the Middle Low German dental.

In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], the dental was originally a voiced dental fricative {{IPA|/ð/}}. It is preserved as such after vowels, voiced fricatives and {{IPA|/r/}} but has been hardened to a stop {{IPA|/d/}} after nasals and {{IPA|/l/}}, and has been devoiced to {{IPA|/t/}} after voiceless consonants and in some other cases (in most Old Norse texts, the alternation is already found in heavy roots, but the light ones preserve {{IPA|/ð/}}). Furthermore, the voicing contrast between {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} has been replaced in Modern Icelandic by an aspiration contrast, which may not be realized phonetically in all the relevant positions.

The situation of early [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] was similar to Icelandic, but intervocalic {{IPA|/ð/}} eventually disappeared. In the verbs in which it remains, the dental is {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, depending on conjugation class and [[Norwegian dialects|dialect]]. It is spelled accordingly. In [[Nynorsk]], it can be different in the preterite and the past participle.

[[Swedish language|Swedish]] has a similar situation to that of Norwegian, but the dental is retained in the spelling, even between vowels. Some informal spellings indicate a lost dental, such as in ''sa'' ("said") from the standard spelling ''sade''.

==Classes of verbs==
In [[Proto-Germanic]], there were seven types of weak verbs, five of which were significant.  However, they are normally grouped into four classes, based on the conjugational system of Gothic.

===Class I Verbs===
Class I verbs actually consist of three classes in [[Proto-Germanic]]:

====Class I, subclass (i)====
A small class of verbs had no suffix in the present, and no suffix in the past (other than the '''-d-''' or '''-t-''' of all weak verbs).  This class had only three members:

#'''*bringaną''' "to bring", past tense '''*branht-'''.  This verb was continued as such in all the descendants, although an alternate stem '''*brangij-''' occasionally appeared in some of the [[West Germanic languages]] (e.g. [[Old English]] '''brenġan''').
#'''*brūkaną''' "to use", past tense '''*brūht-'''.  This verb tended to move into other classes.  For example, in Gothic this verb moved into subclass (ii) of Class I ('''brūkjan''', past '''brūhta'''), whereas in [[Old English]] it became a Class II strong verb ('''brūcan''', past tense '''brēac''' ← '''*brauk''').
#'''*būaną''' "to dwell", past tense '''*būd-'''.  This verb continued as such in most descendants but became a Class III weak verb '''bauan''' in Gothic.

====Class I, subclass (ii)====
A small class of verbs had the suffix '''-j-''' in the present and no suffix in the past.  This class had only five members in [[Proto-Germanic]]:

#'''*bugjaną''' "to buy", past tense '''*buht-'''
#'''*sōkijaną''' "to seek", past tense '''*sōht-''' (given a regularized subclass (iii) past '''sōkida''' in [[Gothic language|Gothic]])
#'''*þankijaną''' "to think", past tense '''*þanht-'''
#'''*þunkijaną''' "to seem", past tense '''*þunht-'''
#'''*wurkijaną''' "to work", past tense '''*wurht-'''

Verbs of this class were said to undergo [[rückumlaut]] ("reverse umlaut") in the past, since the [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] occurring in the present (triggered by the '''-j-''') is undone or "reversed" in the past (due to the lack of the umlaut-triggering stem '''-i-''' of subclass (iii)), leading to a non-umlauted vowel in the past.

These verbs also have consonant and vowel alternations between present and past that are due to regular sound changes but result in strikingly different forms in the historical Germanic languages (e.g. '''think''', past tense '''thought''').  Specifically:
*There is an alternation between '''-k-''' or '''-g-''' in the present and '''-h-''' in the past, caused by the '''-t-''' of the past-tense suffix.  Prior to the operation of [[Grimm's Law]], the stem consonant was '''-g-''' or '''-gʰ-'''.  Before '''-t-''' the consonant was devoiced to '''-k-''' by [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], and then became '''-h-''' by [[Grimm's Law]].  This alternation is sometimes called [[Primärberührung]].
*'''-n-''' before '''-h-''' disappeared after nasalizing the previous vowel.  When the '''-n-''' disappeared, the vowel was lengthened by the process of [[compensatory lengthening]].
*'''-u-''' was lowered to '''-o-''' in the past tense due to [[a-mutation]], since the following vowel was always non-high.

The class remained small in [[Gothic language|Gothic]], but expanded significantly in the other languages:

*In [[Old Norse]], all short-stem verbs (those with a short vowel followed by at most one consonant or a long vowel followed by no consonant) appeared to move into this class, as indicated by the fact that no [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] occurs in the past, as would be caused by a suffix '''-i-'''.  However, this may have been due to a regular sound change that eliminated unstressed nonfinal short vowels coming after a short stem before the operation of umlaut.
*In [[Old High German]], short-stem verbs ending in '''-zz (-tz), -pf, -ck''' ([[Proto-Germanic]] root ending in '''*-t, -p, -k'''), and optionally those in '''-ll''', join this class.  For example, '''zellen''' "to tell" &lt; '''*taljan''', past tense '''zalta, zelita'''.  A number of long-stem verbs also join this class, e.g. '''brennen''' "to burn", past tense '''branta'''; '''wenten''' "to turn", past tense '''wanta'''.
*In [[Old English]] and the other northern [[West Germanic languages]], a number of verbs ending in '''-(c)c-''' and '''-ll-''' joined the class, e.g. in [[Old English]]:
*'''cweccan''' "to shake" &lt; '''*kwakjan''', past tense '''cweahte''' &lt; '''*kwaht-'''
*'''dreccan''' "to afflict", past tense '''dreahte'''
*'''læccan''' "to seize" (based on earlier '''*lǣcan'''?), past tense '''lǣhte'''
*'''leccan''' "to moisten", past tense '''leahte'''
*'''rǣcan''' "to reach" &lt; '''*raikjan''', past tense '''rǣhte, rāhte''' &lt; '''*raiht-'''
*'''reccan''' "to narrate", past tense '''reahte'''
*'''reccan''' "to care for" (based on earlier '''*rēcan'''?), past tense '''rōhte'''
*'''tǣcan''' "to teach", past tense '''tǣhte, tāhte'''
*'''streccan''' "to stretch", past tense '''streahte'''
*'''þeccan''' "to cover", past tense '''þeahte'''
*'''weccan''' "to awake", past tense '''weahte'''
*'''cwellan''' "to kill" &lt; '''*kwaljan''', past tense '''cwealde''' &lt; '''*kwald-'''
*'''dwellan''' "to dwell", past tense '''dwealde'''
*'''sellan''' "to give, sell", past tense '''sealde'''
*'''stellan''' "to place", past tense '''stealde'''
*'''tellan''' "to tell", past tense '''tealde'''

In Late Old English, further verbs in '''-can''' were drawn into this class by analogy, but with umlaut maintained, e.g. '''bepǣcan''' "to deceive", past tense '''bepǣhte''', earlier '''bepǣcte''', or '''wleccan''' "to warm", past tense '''wlehte''', earlier '''wlecede'''.  At the same time, verbs in '''-ccan''' were modified to follow the same pattern, e.g. new past tense '''cwehte''' alongside earlier '''cweahte'''.

====Class I, subclass (iii)====
A large class of verbs had the suffix '''-j-''' in the present and '''-i-''' in the past: e.g. [[Gothic language|Gothic]] '''satjan''' "to set" ([[Old English]] '''settan'''), '''sandjan''' "to send" ([[Old English]] '''sendan''').  As shown in the [[Old English]] cognates:
*The '''-j-''' produced [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] of the stem vowel in languages other than [[Gothic language|Gothic]].
*The '''-j-''' caused [[West Germanic gemination]] in the West Germanic languages in short-stem verbs ending in a consonant other than '''-r'''.
*The '''-j-''' resulted in [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of preceding [[velar consonant]]s in [[Old English]].
*The '''-j-''' remained in [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and [[Old Saxon]], but disappeared in the other languages: In long-stem verbs in [[Old Norse]], and in all verbs except those in '''-r''' in the remaining West Germanic languages. (In [[Old High German]], it deflected '''*-jan''' into '''*-jen''' before disappearing, leaving a suffix '''-en'''. This phenomenon, which resembles the usual umlaut of '''a''' in syllables ''preceding'' '''j''', is nevertheless distinct and must have happened later, as the disappeared '''j''' also caused umlaut.)

This class was split into two subclasses in all the Old Germanic languages, one consisting of short-stem verbs and one of long-stem verbs.  The distinction between the two was originally due to [[Sievers' Law]], and was extended due to changes such as [[West Germanic gemination]], which affected short-stem but not long-stem verbs.  The West Germanic languages had a third subclass consisting of short-stem verbs ending in '''-r''' (e.g. [[Old English]] '''erian''' "to plow", '''nerian''' "to save", '''styrian''' "to stir"), due to [[West Germanic gemination]] and subsequent loss of '''-j-''' not taking place.

The following is a cross-language paradigm of a short-stem Class I verb '''*gramjaną''' "to anger" ([[Gothic language|Gothic]] '''gramjan''', [[Old Norse]] '''gremja''', [[Old High German]] '''gremmen''', [[Old Saxon]] '''*gremmian''', [[Old English]] '''gremman''', [[Old Frisian]] '''*gremma''').  Note that the [[Old Saxon]] and [[Old Frisian]] verbs given here are unattested, almost certainly due to the small nature of the respective corpora.

===Class II Verbs===
Class II verbs were formed with a suffix '''-ō-'''.  In the northern West Germanic languages, an alternative extended suffix '''-ōja-''' sometimes appears in the non-past forms, e.g. the [[Old English]] infinitive '''-ian''' &lt; '''*-ōjan'''.

The following is a cross-language paradigm of '''*laþōną''' "to invite" ([[Gothic language|Gothic]] '''laþōn''', [[Old Norse]] '''laða''', [[Old High German]] '''ladōn, lathōn''', [[Old Saxon]] '''lathian (-ōjan), ladian (-ōjan)''', [[Old English]] '''laþian''', [[Old Frisian]] '''lathia''').

===Class III Verbs===
What is known as "Class III" was actually two separate classes in [[Proto-Germanic]]:
*A class of verbs with [[stative verb|stative]] semantics (i.e. denoting a state rather than an action), formed with a present suffix that was either '''*-ai-''' or '''*-ja-''', and no suffix in the past.
*A class of verbs with [[factitive]] semantics (i.e. with the meaning "make X" where X is an adjective or noun, e.g. "renew, enslave"), formed with a suffix that was either '''*-ai-''' or '''*-ā-''', and a suffix '''*-a-''' in the past.

The histories of this class in the various Germanic languages are quite varied:
*[[Old High German]] combined both into a single class and generalized '''*-ai-''' (appearing as '''-ē-''' through regular sound change) to all forms of the present and past.
*[[Gothic language|Gothic]] combined both into a single class, keeping the '''*-ai-/-ā-''' alternation of the factitives in the present, generalizing the alternation to the statives as well, and borrowing '''*-ai-''' as the past suffix.
*[[Old Norse]] for the most part combined both into a single class in the same fashion as Gothic; however, two relic stative verbs ('''segja''' "to say" and '''þegja''' "to be silent") preserve the stative suffixes in both present and past, and a third verb ('''hafa''' "to have") is a mixture of the two, with factitive suffixes in the present indicative plural and imperative and stative suffixes in the present indicative singular and past participle (elsewhere, the two types have fallen together).
*The other (i.e. northern) West Germanic languages have only small numbers of Class III verbs—but they consistently follow the stative paradigm, unlike the three languages above.

An example is the stative verb reconstructed as [[Proto-Germanic]] '''*habjaną''' "to have", past indicative third-person singular '''habdē''':
*[[Old English]] '''hebban''' &lt; '''*habjan''', past 3sg. '''hæfde''' — derived entirely through regular sound changes.
*[[Old High German]] '''habēn''', past 3sg. '''habēta''' — derived through analogical spread of suffix '''-ē-'''.
*[[Gothic language|Gothic]] '''haban''', past 3sg. '''habáida''' — derived through various analogical changes.
*[[Old Norse]] '''hafa''', past 3sg. '''hafði''' — partly regular, partly analogical.

Only four stative verbs survive as Class III verbs in the northern West Germanic languages (i.e. [[Old English]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old Frisian]] and [[Old Low Franconian]]):
*'''*sagjaną''' "to say"
*'''*libjaną''' "to live"
*'''*habjaną''' "to hold, have"
*'''*hugjaną''' "to think"

However, there are five more verbs that appear as Class III verbs in [[Old High German]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and/or [[Old Norse]] that also have remnants of the stative conjugation in one or more northern West Germanic languages:
*'''*þagjaną''' "to be silent"
*'''*siljaną''' "to be silent"
*'''*þuljaną''' "to endure" (normally Class II '''þolian''' in [[Old English]], but cf. archaic umlauted infinitive '''-þoelġe'''; Class III in [[Old Norse]] '''þola''')
*'''*fijaną''' "to hate"
*'''*hatjaną''' "to hate" (normally Class II '''hatian''' in [[Old English]], but cf. umlauted nominalized present participle '''hettend''' "enemy"; Class III in [[Gothic language|Gothic]] '''hatan''')

===Class IV Verbs===
Class IV verbs were formed with a suffix '''-nan''', e.g. [[Gothic language|Gothic]] '''fullnan''' "to become full".  The present tense was conjugated as a strong verb, e.g. Gothic '''fullna, fullnis, fullniþ''', etc.  The past tense was conjugated with suffix '''-nō-''', e.g. Gothic '''fullnōda, fullnōdēs''', etc.  This class vanished in other Germanic languages; however, a significant number of cognate verbs appear as Class II verbs in [[Old Norse]] and as Class III verbs in [[Old High German]].  This class has [[fientive]] semantics, i.e. "[[Inchoative verb|become X]]" where X is an adjective or a past participle of a verb.  Examples of deadjectival Class IV verbs in Gothic are '''ga-blindnan''' "to become blind" ('''blinds''' "blind"), '''ga-háilnan''' "to become whole" ('''háils''' "whole").  Examples of deverbal Class IV verbs in Gothic are '''fra-lusnan''' "to perish" ('''fra-liusan''' "to destroy"), '''ga-þaúrsnan''' "to dry up, wither away" ('''ga-þaírsan''' "to wither"), '''mikilnan''' "to be magnified" ('''mikiljan''' "to magnify"), '''us-háuhnan''' "to be exalted" ('''us-háuhjan''' "to exalt").  Note that the last two are deverbal even though the underlying root is adjectival, since they are formed to other verbs (which are in turn formed off of adjectives).  The vast majority of Class IV verbs appear to be deverbal.  Class IV verbs derived from weak verbs keep the same stem form as the underlying weak verb.  However, class IV verbs derived from strong verbs adopt the ablaut of the past participle, e.g. '''dis-skritnan''' "to be torn to pieces" (Class I '''dis-skreitan''' "to tear to pieces"), '''us-gutnan''' "to be poured out" (Class II '''giutan''' "to pour"), '''and-bundnan''' "to become unbound" (Class III '''and-bindan''' "to unbind"), '''dis-taúrnan''' "to be torn asunder, burst asunder" (Class IV '''dis-taíran''' "to tear asunder, burst"), '''ufar-hafnan''' "to be exalted" (Class VI '''ufar-hafjan''' "to exalt"), '''bi-auknan''' "to abound, become larger" (Class VII '''bi-aukan''' "to increase, add to").

==Modern languages==

In the modern languages, the various classes have mostly been leveled into a single productive class.  Icelandic, Norwegian and Frisian have retained two productive classes of weak verbs. (In Frisian, in addition to the class with -de, there is a class of je-verbs, where the dental suffix has dropped, i.e. '''-je''' &lt; '''-iad'''.) [[Swiss German]] also has two types of weak verbs, descended from Class I and Classes II and III respectively of [[Old High German]] weak verbs and marked with '''-t''' and '''-et''', respectively, in the [[past participle]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Ernst Keller (1961). ''German dialects: phonology and morphology, with selected texts''. Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of English, the following changes happened:

#Most Class III verbs were moved into Class II prior to the historical period of Old English.
#The remaining four Class III verbs moved into Class I or Class II late in Old English.
#Throughout the Middle English period, Class I verbs gradually moved into Class II.

In Modern English, only one productive weak paradigm remains, derived from Class II.  A number of Class I verbs still persist, e.g.:

*From [[Old English]] subclass (i): '''bring (brought)'''
*From [[Old English]] subclass (ii) or analogously: '''buy (bought)'''; '''catch (caught)'''; '''seek (sought)'''; '''sell (sold)'''; '''teach (taught)'''; '''tell (told)'''; '''think (thought)'''; '''work (wrought)''' [''obsolescent'']
*From [[Old English]] subclass (iii) or analogously: '''bend (bent)'''; '''bet (bet)'''; '''breed (bred)'''; '''build (built)'''; '''cast (cast)'''; '''cost (cost)'''; '''creep (crept)'''; '''cut (cut)'''; '''deal (dealt)'''; '''dream (dreamt)'''; '''feed (fed)'''; '''flee (fled)'''; '''hear (heard)'''; '''hit (hit)'''; '''hurt (hurt)'''; '''keep (kept)'''; '''kneel (knelt)'''; '''knit (knit)'''; '''lay (laid)'''; '''lead (led)'''; '''leap (leapt)'''; '''leave (left)'''; '''lend (lent)'''; '''light (lit)'''; '''lose (lost)'''; '''mean (meant)'''; '''meet (met)'''; '''put (put)'''; '''read (read)'''; '''rend (rent)''' [''obsolescent'']; '''send (sent)'''; '''set (set)'''; '''shed (shed)'''; '''shoot (shot)'''; '''shut (shut)'''; '''sleep (slept)'''; '''speed (sped)'''; '''spend (spent)'''; '''spill (spilt)'''; '''split (split)'''; '''spread (spread)'''; '''sweep (swept)'''; '''thrust (thrust)'''; '''upset (upset)'''; '''wed (wed)'''; '''weep (wept)'''; as well as a few others
*From [[Old English]] Class III verbs: '''have (had)'''; '''say (said)'''

As the previous list shows, although there is only one productive class of weak verbs, there are plenty of "irregular" weak verbs that don't follow the paradigm of this class.  Furthermore, the regular paradigm in English is not unitary, but in fact is divided into subclasses in both the written and spoken language, although in different ways:
*In the written language, before the past-tense suffix '''-ed''', short-stem verbs double the final consonant (e.g. '''dip (dipped)'''), while a '''-y''' following a consonant becomes '''-i''' (e.g. '''carry (carried)''').
*In the spoken language, the past-tense suffix '''-ed''' is variously pronounced {{IPA|/t/, /d/}}, or {{IPA|/ɪd, əd/}} depending on the preceding consonant.

Both of these characteristics occur in a similar fashion in most or all the modern Germanic languages.  In modern German, for example, descendants of the original subclass (ii) of Class I are still irregular (e.g. '''denken (dachte)''' "to think", '''brennen (brannte)''' "to burn"), and subclasses of the productive verb paradigm are formed by verbs ending in '''-eln''' or '''-ern''' and in '''-ten''' or '''-den''', among others.

===Modern paradigms===

One of the regular weak verb conjugations is as follows.

==Weak and strong verbs==

Weak verbs should be contrasted with [[Germanic strong verb|strong verbs]], which form their past tenses by means of  ''[[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]'' (vowel gradation: ''sing - sang - sung''). Most verbs in the early stages of the Germanic languages were strong. However, as the ablaut system is no longer productive except in rare cases of analogy, almost all new verbs in Germanic languages are weak, and the majority of the original strong verbs have become weak by analogy.

===Strong to weak transformations===
As an example of the rather common process of originally strong verbs becoming weak, we may consider the development from the Old English strong verb ''scūfan'' to modern English ''shove'':
* ''scūfan scēaf scofen'' (strong class 2)
* ''shove shoved shoved''
Many hundreds of weak verbs in contemporary English go back to Old English strong verbs.

In some cases, a verb has become weak in the preterite but not in the participle and may be thought of as "semi-strong" (not a technical term). Dutch has a number of examples:
*''wassen waste gewassen'' ("to wash")
*''lachen lachte gelachen'' ("to laugh")

An example in English is:
*''sow sowed sown'' (strong class 7 with weak preterite)

Often, the old strong participle may survive as an adjective long after it has been replaced with a weak form in verbal constructions. The English adjective ''molten'' is an old strong participle of ''melt'', which is now a purely weak verb with the participle ''melted''. The participle ''gebacken'' of the German verb ''backen'' (to bake), is gradually being replaced by ''gebackt'', but the adjective is always ''gebacken'' (baked).

===Weak to strong transformations===
The reverse process is very rare and can also be partial, producing "semi-strong" verbs:
*''show showed shown'' (originally weak verb with participle modelled on ''sown'')

Weak verbs which develop strong forms are often unstable. A typical example is German ''fragen'' (to ask), which is historically weak and still weak in Standard German, but for a time in the 18th century, the forms ''fragen frug gefragen'' by analogy with for example ''tragen'' (to carry) were also considered acceptable in the standard. They survive today (along with a present tense ''frägt'') in the [[Rhinelandic regiolect]] and underlying dialects. In Dutch, the new strong past ''vroeg'' of the cognate ''vragen'' is standard today, but its past participle is weak ''gevraagd'' (though some dialects do have ''gevrogen'').

==Origins==
The weak conjugation of verbs is an innovation of [[Proto-Germanic]] (unlike the older strong verbs, the basis of which goes back to [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]). While primary verbs (those inherited from PIE) already had an ablaut-based perfect form that was the basis of the Germanic strong preterite, secondary verbs (those derived from other forms after the break-up of PIE) had to form a preterite otherwise, which necessitated the creation of the weak conjugation.

===Denominative derivation===
The vast majority of weak verbs are secondary, or derived. The two main types of derived verbs were denominative and deverbative. A denominative verb is one which has been created out of a noun. The denominative in Indo-European and early Germanic was formed by adding an ablauting [[Vowel stems|thematic]] *-y{{frac|é|ó}}- suffix to a noun or adjective.  This created verbs such as [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''namnjan'' 'to name'.

===Causative verbs===
A significant subclass of Class I weak verbs are (deverbal) [[causative verb]]s. They are formed in a way that reflects a direct inheritance from the PIE causative class of verbs. PIE causatives were formed by adding an accented affix ''-éy-'' to the ''o''-grade of a non-derived verb.  In Proto-Germanic,  causatives are formed by adding a suffix ''-j/ij-'' (the reflex of PIE ''-éy-'') to the past-tense ablaut (mostly with the reflex of PIE ''o''-grade) of a strong verb (the reflex of PIE non-derived verbs), with [[Verner's Law]] voicing applied (the reflex of the PIE accent on the ''-éy-'' suffix):

*''*bītaną'' (I) "to bite" → ''*baitijaną'' "to bridle, yoke, restrain", i.e. "to make bite down"
*''*rīsaną'' (I) "to rise" → ''*raizijaną'' "to raise", i.e. "to cause to rise"
*''*beuganą'' (II) "to bend" → ''*baugijaną'' "to bend (transitive)"
*''*brinnaną'' (III) "to burn" → ''*brannijaną'' "to burn (transitive)"
*''*frawerþaną'' (III) "to perish" → ''*frawardijaną'' "to destroy", i.e. "to cause to perish"
*''*nesaną'' (V) "to survive" → ''*nazjaną'' "to save", i.e. "to cause to survive"
*''*ligjaną'' (V) "to lie down" → ''*lagjaną'' "to lay", i.e. "to cause to lie down"
*''*sitjaną'' (V) "to sit" → ''*satjaną'' "to set, seat", i.e. "to cause to sit"
*''*faraną'' (VI) "to travel, go"  → ''*fōrijaną'' "to lead, bring", i.e. "to cause to go"
*''*faraną'' (VI) "to travel, go"  → ''*farjaną'' "to carry across", i.e. "to cause to travel" (an archaic instance of the ''o''-grade ablaut used despite the differing past-tense ablaut)
*''*grētaną'' (VII) "to weep" → ''*grōtijaną'' "to cause to weep"
*''*lais'' (I, preterite-present) "(s)he knows"  → ''*laizijaną'' "to teach", i.e. "to cause to know"

Essentially, all verbs formed this way were conjugated as Class I weak verbs.

That method of forming causative verbs is no longer productive in the modern Germanic languages, but many relics remain. For example, the original strong verb ''fall fell fallen'' has a related weak verb ''fell felled felled'', which means "to cause (a tree) to fall"; strong ''sit sat sat'' and ''lie lay lain'' are matched with weak ''set set set'' and ''lay laid laid'', meaning "to cause something to sit" or "lie" respectively. In some cases, phonological or semantic developments make the pairs difficult to recognise. For example, ''rear'' is the regular phonological development of Proto-Gemanic ''*raizijaną'' given in the above list, but the connection between ''rise'' and ''rear'' is no longer obvious. (One might guess that the counterpart of ''rise'' would be ''raise'', but ''raise'' is a borrowing from Old Norse, ''*raizijaną'' continues regularly.) As another example, ''drench'' was originally the causative of ''drink'', but the modern meaning of "drench" ("to cause to get wet") is no longer similar to "cause to drink". Similarly, German strong ''leiden litt gelitten'' ("to suffer") has the derived weak verb ''leiten'' ("to lead"), which makes sense when one realises that ''leiden'' originally meant "walk, go" and came to its present meaning through the idea of "undergoing" suffering.

===Other types===
There are primary verbs that date to Indo-European that took a weak conjugation because they were unable to take a perfect, including verbs that had zero grade of the root in the present and so were unable to show the ablaut distinction necessary for a strong preterite. That was the case with the verbs ''waurkjan'' 'to work, create', ''bugjan'' 'to buy', and ''sokjan'' 'to seek' (Gothic forms).

Preterite-present verbs are primary verbs in which the PIE present was lost, and the perfect was given a present meaning. They needed a new past tense, which followed the weak pattern.

All borrowings from other languages into Germanic were weak.

===Origin of dental suffix===
The origin of the dental suffix is uncertain. Perhaps the most commonly held theory is that it evolved out of a [[circumlocution|periphrastic]] construction with the verb ''to do'': Germanic *''lubō-dēdē'' ("love-did") &gt; *''lubōdē'' &gt; Old English ''lufode'' &gt; ''loved'' or *''salbō-dē-'' ("salve-did", i.e., "put salve") &gt; *''salbōdē-'' &gt; Old English ''sealfode'' &gt; ''salved''. That would be analogous to the way that in Modern English one can form an emphatic past tense with "did": ''I did love'', ''I did salve''.

The common PIE root *''dʰeh₁-'' meaning 'do' was a root [[aorist]] and so did not take a perfect. However, it took a reduplicating present. The imperfect of the root is probably the origin of the dental suffix.

That view is not without objections:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Germanic has long -ē- in the plural, which cannot directly reflect the Proto-Indo-European situation.
* Reduplication is only in the Gothic plural, not in the singular.

The objections are sometimes answered as follows:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* There might have been a refashioning according to cases like ''gēbun'', ''viz''. *''gegbun'' &gt; ''gēbun'' : *''dedun'' → ''dēdun''.
* Reduplication only in the plural can easily be explained by [[haplology]] in Proto-Germanic (*''dede''- being reduced to *''de-'') for the singular, with a later development of haplology for the plural in non-[[East Germanic languages]].

Another theory is that it came from a past participle ending, a final *''-daz'' from PIE *''-tos'' (cf Latin ''amatus''), with personal endings added to it at a later stage. That theory, however, is also disputed because of its inability to explain all the facts.

According to Hill (2010), the endings, which in the singular do not show reduplication in any Germanic language, continue the PIE subjunctive of the root aorist.

==Other meanings==
The term "weak verb" was originally coined by [[Jacob Grimm]], who only applied it to Germanic philology. However, the term is sometimes applied to other language groups to designate phenomena that are not really analogous. For example, [[Hebrew]] ''irregular'' verbs are sometimes called weak verbs because one of their radicals is weak. See [[weak inflection]].

The '''International Numismata Orientalia ''' was an important series of publications relating to [[numismatics]] of the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]], with articles contributed by specialist numismatists, published by Messrs [[Nicholas Trübner|Trübner]] &amp; Co., London, in the late nineteenth century.

== The inspiration for this series  ==
The inspiration for the series was the ''Numismata Orientalia'' produced by [[William Marsden (orientalist)|William Marsden]], and published earlier in the nineteenth century, which opened up numismatic research in the Middle East and throughout Asia.

== The title ==
The entire series was intended to be a new edition of Marsden's ''Numismata Orientalia'', but it reached beyond the scope of Marsden's work, and from Part 2 onwards was known as ''International Numismata Orientalia''.&lt;ref&gt;Nature 13, 302-303 (17 February 1876) | doi:10.1038/013302a0&lt;/ref&gt;

== The plan for the series ==
Details of the plan for the entire series were outlined by Edward Thomas in his preface to Vol. 1, part 1:&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Indian Coin Weights, by Edward Thomas (Trubner, London, 1874): preface, pp.iii-iv.https://books.google.lk/books?id=pTo6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=international+numismata+orientalia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp99yH_7vOAhWGyRoKHXpFCcUQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=international%20numismata%20orientalia&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jakin''''' is a [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] cultural group, [[magazine]], and publishing house. Founded in 1956, it is one of the oldest in [[Basque language]].&lt;ref&gt;Olaziregi, Mari Jose 2012, ''Basque Literary History'', Reno: Center for Basque Studies/University of Nevada {{ISBN|978-1-935709-19-0}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt; "Jakin" means "knowledge" in Basque and the magazine specializes on social and cultural issues. One of the leading members of ''Jakin'' is the [[philosopher]] [[Joxe Azurmendi]]. Currently, the [[editor-in-chief]] of ''Jakin'' is [[Lorea Agirre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jakingunea.com/albisteak/jakin-hamalau-laguneko-talde-berri-batek-hartu-du-bere-gain-lorea-agirre-zuzendari-dela-/33 ''Jakingunea'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
Before the establishment of the magazine in 1956 ''Jakin'' was a cultural group.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]] 1984: "Mitxelenaren bere lekuratzeko", in ''Salbatore Mitxelena: Idazlan Guztiak II'', Oñati: EFA.&lt;/ref&gt; The first name of the magazine was ''Teologiaren Yardunak'', and [[Nikolas Ormaetxea]] and [[Txillardegi]], among others, wrote there.

The publication was prohibited by [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|Franco's regime]] in 1969; publication resumed in 1977. During that period, Jakin began publishing books. ''Jakin'' was instrumental in the "cultivation" of Basque, increasing its ability to "express difficult topics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Koldo Mitxelena|Mitxelena, Koldo]], ''Asaba zaharren baratza'', in Patxi Altuna (ed.) ''Mitxelenaren Idazlan Hautatuak'', Bilbo, Mensajero. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the magazine won the Argizaiola award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gara.naiz.info/idatzia/20061123/art190253.php ''Gara'' newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JohnMandeville.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Full-page portrait of Sir John Mandeville. Created 1459.]]
'''Sir John Mandeville''' is the supposed author of ''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', a travel memoir which first circulated between 1357 and 1371. The earliest surviving text is in French.

By aid of translations into many other languages, the work acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the extremely unreliable and often fantastical nature of the travels it describes, it was used as a work of reference—[[Christopher Columbus]], for example, was heavily influenced by both this work and [[Marco Polo]]'s earlier ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]''.{{sfn|Adams|1988|p=53}}

==Identity==
In his preface, the compiler calls himself a knight, and states that he was born and bred in England, in the town of [[St Albans]].{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=560}}{{sfn|Hartig|1910}} Although the book is real, it is widely believed that "Sir John Mandeville" himself was not. Common theories point to a Frenchman by the name of Jehan a la Barbe (or other possibilities discussed below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Mandeville|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/john-mandeville|website=Answers.com|accessdate=25 August 2014}}{{Unreliable source?|sure=y|reason=http://www.answers.com/page/about_us|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent scholars have suggested that ''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'' was most likely written by "Jan de Langhe, a Fleming who wrote in Latin under the name Johannes Longus and in French as [[:fr:Jean le Long|Jean le Long]]".{{sfn|Larner|2008|p=133–141}} Jan de Langhe was born in [[Ypres]] early in the 1300s and by 1334 had become a Benedictine monk at the abbey of Saint-Bertin in [[Saint-Omer]] which was about 20 miles from [[Calais]]. After studying law at the University of Paris, Langhe returned to the abbey and was elected abbot in 1365. He was a prolific writer and avid collector of travelogues, right up to his death in 1383.{{sfn|Larner|2008|p=133–141}}

=== Travel ===
[[File:Mandeville Sainte Lance.jpg|thumb|right|The emperor of Constantinople holding the [[Holy Lance]], from a [[British Library]] manuscript.]]
John de Mandeville crossed the sea in 1322; had traversed by way of [[Turkey]] ([[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and [[Cilicia]]), [[Tartary]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[Syria]], [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[Egypt]] upper and lower, [[Libya]], the great part of [[Ethiopia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Amazons|Amazonia]], [[India]] the Less, the Greater and the Middle, and many countries about India; had often been to Jerusalem, and had written in [[Romance languages]] as more generally understood than [[Latin]].{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=560}}

===Contemporary corroboration===
At least part of the personal history of Mandeville is mere invention. No contemporary corroboration of the existence of such a Jehan de Mandeville is known. Some French manuscripts, not contemporary, give a Latin letter of presentation from him to [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], but so vague that it might have been penned by any writer on any subject. It is in fact beyond reasonable doubt that the travels were in large part compiled by a Liége physician, known as Johains à le Barbe or Jehan à la Barbe, otherwise Jehan de Bourgogne.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}}

The evidence of this is in a modernized extract quoted by the Liège herald, Louis Abry (1643–1720),{{efn|Quoted from him by the contemporary Liége herald, Lefort, and from Lefort in 1866 by Dr S. Bormans. Dr J. Vogels communicated it in 1884 to Mr E. W. B. Nicholson, who wrote on it in the ''Academy'' of April 12, 1884 {{harv|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}}.}} from the lost fourth book of the ''[[Myreur des Hystors]]'' of [[Jean d'Outremeuse|Johans des Preis]], styled d'Oultremouse. In this "Jean de Bourgogne, dit a la Barbe", is said to have revealed himself on his deathbed to d'Oultremouse, whom he made his executor, and to have described himself in his will as "messire Jean de Mandeville, chevalier, comte de Montfort en Angleterre et seigneur de l'isle de Campdi et du château Pérouse (Lord Jean de Mandeville, knight, Count de Montfort in England and lord of the Isle of Campdi and the castle Pérouse)".{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}}

It is added that, having had the misfortune to kill an unnamed count in his own country, he engaged himself to travel through the three parts of the world, arrived at Liège in 1343, was a great naturalist, profound [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[astrologer]], and had a remarkable knowledge of physics. The identification is confirmed by the fact that in the now destroyed church of the Guillemins was a tombstone of Mandeville, with a [[Latin]] inscription stating that he was otherwise named "ad Barbam", was a professor of medicine, and died at Liège on November 17, 1372: this inscription is quoted as far back as 1462.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}}

Even before his death, the Liège physician seems to have confessed to a share in the circulation of, and additions to, the work. In the common Latin abridged version of it, at the end of c. vii., the author says that when stopping in the sultan's court at Cairo he met a venerable and expert physician of "our" parts, but that they rarely came into conversation because their duties were of a different kind, but that long afterwards at Liège he composed this treatise at the exhortation and with the help (''Jiortatu et adiutorio'') of the same venerable man, as he will narrate at the end of it.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}}

And in the last chapter, he says that in 1355, on returning home, he came to Liège, and being laid up with old age and arthritic [[gout]] in the street called Bassesavenyr, i.e. Basse-Sauvenière, consulted the physicians. That one came in who was more venerable than the others by reason of his age and white hairs, was evidently expert in his art, and was commonly called Magister Iohannes ad Barbam. That a chance remark of the latter caused the renewal of their old Cairo acquaintance, and that Ad Barbam, after showing his medical skill on Mandeville, urgently begged him to write his travels; "and so at length, by his advice and help, ''monitu et adiutorio'', was composed this treatise, of which I had certainly proposed to write nothing until at least I had reached my own parts in England". He goes on to speak of himself as being now lodged in Liège, "which is only two days distant from the sea of England"; and it is stated in the [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] (and in the manuscripts) that the book was first published in French by Mandeville, its author, in 1355, at Liège, and soon after in the same city translated into "said" Latin form. Moreover, a manuscript of the French text extant at Liège about 1860 contained a similar statement, and added that the author lodged at a hostel called "al hoste Henkin Levo": this manuscript gave the physician's name as "Johains de Bourgogne dit ale barbe", which doubtless conveys its local form.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}}

===Contemporary mention===
There is no contemporary English mention of any English knight named Jehan de Mandeville, nor are the arms said to have been on the Liège tomb like any known Mandeville arms. However George F. Warner{{efn|name="Warner"|[[s:Author:George Frederic Warner|Sir George F. Warner]] (1845–1936) author of the [[Dictionary of National Biography|DNB]] article on John Mandeville {{harv|Warner|1893}}.}} has suggested that de Bourgogne may be a certain Johan de Bourgoyne, who was pardoned by parliament on 20 August 1321 for having taken part in the attack on the Despensers ([[Hugh the younger Despenser|Hugh the younger]] and [[Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester|Hugh the elder]]), but whose pardon was revoked in May 1322, the year in which "Mandeville" professes to have left England. Among the persons similarly pardoned on the recommendation of the same nobleman was a Johan Mangevilayn, whose name appears related to that of "de Mandeville",{{efn|The de Mandevilles, earls of Essex, were originally styled de Magneville, and Leland, in his ''Comm. de Script. Britt.'' (CDV), calls our Mandeville himself "Joannes Magnovillanus, alias Mandeville" {{harv|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}}.}} which is a later form of "de Magneville".{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}}

The name Mangevilain occurs in Yorkshire as early as the 16th year of the reign of [[Henry I (England)]],{{efn|{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}} cite 16 Hen. I. ''[[Pipe Rolls|Pipe Roll Society]]'', vol. xv, p. 40. 16th year of the reign of Henry I is the year starting on 5 August 1115 (see [[Regnal years of English monarchs]]).}} but is very rare, and (failing evidence of any place named Mangeville) seems to be merely a variant spelling of Magnevillain. The meaning may be simply "of [[Magneville]]", de Magneville; but the family of a 14th-century [[bishop of Nevers]] were called both "Mandevilain" and "de Mandevilain", where Mandevilain seems a derivative place-name, meaning the Magneville or Mandeville district. The name "de Mandeville "might be suggested to de Bourgogne by that of his fellow-culprit Mangevilayn, and it is even possible that the two fled to England together, were in Egypt together, met again at Liège, and shared in the compilation of the ''Travels''.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}}

Whether after the appearance of the ''Travels'' either de Bourgogne or "Mangevilayn" visited England is very doubtful. [[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans Abbey]] had a sapphire ring, and [[Canterbury]] a crystal orb, said to have been given by Mandeville; but these might have been sent from Liège, and it will appear later that the Liège physician possessed and wrote about precious stones. St Albans also had a legend, recorded in [[John Norden]]'s ''[[Speculum Britanniae]]'' (1596) that a ruined marble tomb of Mandeville (represented cross-legged and in armour, with sword and shield) once stood in the abbey; this may be true of "Mangevilayn" or it may be apocryphal.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}} There is also an inscription near the entrance of St Albans Abbey, which reads as follows:{{quote|text=''Siste gradum properans, requiescit Mandevil urna, Hic humili; norunt et monumental mori''&lt;br&gt;Lo, in this Inn of travellers doth lie, One rich in nothing but in memory; His name was Sir John Mandeville; content, Having seen much, with a small continent, Toward which he travelled ever since his birth, And at last pawned his body for ye earth Which by a statute must in mortgage be, Till a Redeemer come to set it free.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}}}

==Analyzing the work==
[[File:Mandeville cotton.jpg|thumb|[[Cotton]] plant as imagined and drawn by John Mandeville; "There grew there [India] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches. These branches were so pliable that they bent down to allow the lambs to feed when they are hungrie.".]]
[[File:Mandeville Journeys (defloration rite).png|thumb|Illustration of a [[defloration]] rite (1484 edition).]]
The book may contain facts and knowledge acquired by actual travels and residence in the East, at least in the section which treats of the Holy Land and the ways of getting thither, of Egypt, and in general of [[the Levant]]. The prologue points almost exclusively to the Holy Land as the subject of the work. The mention of more distant regions comes in only towards the end of this prologue, and (in a manner) as an afterthought.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}} However, this is commensurate with Mandeville's emphasis on 'curiositas'—wandering—rather than Christian 'scientia' (knowledge).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Odoric of Pordenone===
{{Main|Odoric of Pordenone}}
{{further information|Europeans in Medieval China}}
The greater part of these more distant travels, extending from [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] to [[Ormus|Hormuz]], [[India]], the [[Malay Archipelago]], and [[China]], and back to western Asia, has been appropriated from the narrative of Friar Odoric (1330). These passages are almost always swollen with interpolated particulars, usually of an extravagant kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Page indications like "Halliwell p. 209" refer to passages in the 1866 reissue of Halliwell's edition, (being probably the most ready of accessible to the authors of the article on ""Mandeville, Jehan de" in  the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] (EB1911). However all these passages cited by the EB1911 were also been verified by the EB1911 authors as substantially occurring in Barrois's French ''MS. Nouv. Acq. Franç.'' 4515 in the ''Bibliothèque Nationale'', Paris, (of 1371), cited B, and in that numbered xxxix. of the Grenville collection (British Museum), which dates probably from the early part of the 15th century, cited G. {{harv|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}}.}} However, in a number of cases the writer has failed to understand those passages which he adopts from Odoric and professes to give as his own experiences. Thus, where Odoric has given a most curious and veracious account of the Chinese custom of employing tame [[cormorant]]s [[cormorant fishing|to catch fish]], the cormorants are converted by Mandeville into "little beasts called loyres&lt;ref&gt;''layre'' {{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=561}} citing {{harvnb|Barrois|1371}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which are taught to go into the water" (the word ''loyre'' being apparently used here for "[[otter]]", ''lutra'', for which the [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] is ''luria'' or ''loiria'').{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}}

At a very early date the coincidence of Mandeville's stories with those of Odoric was recognized,{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} insomuch that a manuscript of Odoric which is or was in the chapter library at [[Mainz]] begins with the words: "''Incipit Itinerarius fidelis fratris Odorici socii Militis Mendavil per Indian; licet hic ille prius et alter posterius peregrinationem suam descripsit''".{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}}{{clarify|date=April 2012}} At a later day [[Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Herbert]] calls Odoric "travelling companion of our Sir John"; and [[Samuel Purchas]], most unfairly, whilst calling Mandeville, next to Polo, "if next ... the greatest Asian traveller that ever the world had", insinuates that Odoric's story was stolen from Mandeville's. Mandeville himself is crafty enough, at least in one passage, to anticipate criticism by suggesting the probability of his having travelled with Odoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hetoum===
Much of Mandeville's matter, particularly in Asiatic geography and history, is taken from the ''La Flor des Estoires d'Orient'' of [[Hayton of Corycus|Hetoum]], an Armenian of princely family, who became a monk of the [[Praemonstrant]] or [[Premonstratensian]] order, and in 1307 dictated this work on the East, in the French tongue at [[Poitiers]], out of his own extraordinary acquaintance with Asia and its history in his own time. A story of the fortress at Corycus, or the Castle Sparrowhawk, appears in Mandeville's Book.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}}

===Marco Polo===
No passage in Mandeville can be plausibly traced to [[Marco Polo]], with one exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is where he states that at Hormuz the people during the great heat lie in water – a circumstance mentioned by Polo, though not by Odoric. It is most likely that this fact had been interpolated in the copy of Odoric used by Mandeville, for if he had borrowed it directly from Polo he could have borrowed more.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}}

===Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and Vincent de Beauvais===
A good deal about the manners and customs of the [[Tatars]] is demonstrably derived from the work of the Franciscan [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], who went as the pope's ambassador to the Tatars in 1245–1247; but Dr. Warner considers that the immediate source for Mandeville was the ''Speculum historiale'' of [[Vincent de Beauvais]]. Though the passages in question are all to be found in Carpine more or less exactly, the expression is condensed and the order changed. For examples compare Mandeville, p.&amp;nbsp;250, on the tasks done by Tatar women, with Carpine, p.&amp;nbsp;643; Mandeville. p.&amp;nbsp;250, on Tatar habits of eating, with Carpine, pp.&amp;nbsp;639–640; Mandeville, p.&amp;nbsp;231, on the titles borne on the seals of the [[Khagan|Great Khan]], with Carpine, p.&amp;nbsp;715, etc.&lt;ref&gt;For Carpine {{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|D'Avezac|1839|pp=643, 639–640, 715}}; for Mandeville {{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|pp=231, 250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of [[Prester John]] is taken from the famous ''Epistle'' of that imaginary potentate, which was widely diffused in the 13th century. Many fabulous stories, again, of monsters, such as [[Cyclops|cyclopes]], [[Monopod (creature)|sciapodes]], [[hippopodes]], [[anthropophagi]], monoscelides, and men whose heads did grow beneath their shoulders; of the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and the [[Crocodile tears|weeping crocodile]], such as [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] has collected, are introduced here and there, derived no doubt from him, [[Solinus]], the bestiaries, or the ''Speculum naturale'' of Vincent de Beauvais. And interspersed, especially in the chapters about the [[Levant]], are the stories and legends that were retailed to every pilgrim, such as the legend of [[Seth]] and the grains of paradise from which grew the wood of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross]], that of the shooting of old [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] by [[Lamech (descendant of Cain)|Lamech]], that of the castle of the sparrow-hawk (which appears in the tale of [[Melusine]]), those of the origin of the balsam plants at Masariya, of the [[dragon]] of Cos, of the river [[Sambation]], etc.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}}

===Representation of some genuine experience===
Even in that part of the book which might be supposed to represent some genuine experience, there are the plainest traces that another work has been made use of, more or less—we might almost say as a framework to fill up. This is the itinerary of the German knight [[Wilhelm von Boldensele]], written in 1336 at the desire of Cardinal [[Hélie de Talleyrand-Périgord, Bishop of Auxerre|Hélie de Talleyrand-Périgord]]. A cursory comparison of this with Mandeville leaves no doubt that the latter has followed its thread, though digressing on every side, and too often eliminating the singular good sense of the German traveler. We may indicate as examples Boidensele's account of [[Cyprus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|pp=10, 28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and the coast of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|pp=29–30, 33–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  of the journey from [[Gaza City|Gaza]] to [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; passages about [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon of Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Mecca]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the general account of Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Giza pyramid complex|pyramids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; some of the wonders of [[Cairo]], such as the slave-market, the [[chicken]]-hatching stoves, and the apples of paradise, i.e. [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Red Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the convent on [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|pp=58, 60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the account of the [[church of the Holy Sepulchre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|pp=74–76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

As an example, when discussing the pyramids, Boldensele wrote that "the people of the country call them [[Pharaoh's Granaries]].  But this cannot be true at all, for no place for putting in the wheat can be found there".{{sfn|Higgins|2011|p=231}} Mandeville then completely reverses it in favor of the received medieval opinion: "Some say that they are tombs of the great lords of antiquity, but that is not true, for the common word through the whole country near and far is that they are [[Joseph's Granaries]] ... [for] if they were tombs, they would not be empty inside".{{sfn|Higgins|2011|pp=32}}{{sfn|Higgins|1997|pp=97, 100}}

There is, indeed, only a small residuum of the book to which genuine character, as containing the experiences of the author, can possibly be attributed. Yet, as has been intimated, the borrowed stories are frequently claimed as such experiences. In addition to those already mentioned, he alleges that he had witnessed the curious exhibition of the garden of [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigrated souls]] (described by Odoric) at Cansay, i.e. [[Hangzhou|Hangchow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=211}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his fellows with their valets had remained fifteen months in service with [[Kublai Khan|the emperor]] of [[Cathay]] in his wars against the king of [[Names of China#Mangi|Manzi]] – Manzi, or Southern China, [[History of the Song dynasty|having ceased to be a separate kingdom]] some seventy years before the time referred to. But the most notable of these false statements occurs in his adoption from Odoric of the story of the ''Valley Perilous''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is, in its original form, apparently founded on real experiences of Odoric viewed through a haze of excitement and superstition. Mandeville, whilst swelling the wonders of the tale with a variety of extravagant touches, appears to safeguard himself from the reader's possible discovery that it was stolen by the interpolation: "And some of our fellows accorded to enter, and some not. So there were with us two worthy men, Friars Minor, that were of [[Lombardy]], who said that if any man would enter they would go in with us. And when they had said so, upon the gracious trust of God and of them, we caused mass to be sung, and made every man to be shriven and [[housel]]led; and then we entered fourteen persons; but at our going out we were but nine",{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} etc.

In referring to this passage, it is only fair to recognize that the description (though the suggestion of the greatest part exists in Odoric) displays a good deal of imaginative power; and there is much in the account of Christian's passage through the [[Psalm 23|Valley of the Shadow of Death]], in [[John Bunyan]]'s famous allegory, which indicates a possibility that Bunyan may have read and remembered this episode either in Mandeville or in [[Richard Hakluyt|Hakluyt]]'s ''Odoric''.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}}

Nor does it follow that the whole work is borrowed or fictitious. Even the great [[Moors|Moorish]] traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], accurate and veracious in the main, seems—in one part at least of his narrative—to invent experiences; and, in such works as those of Jan van Hees and [[Arnold von Harff]], we have examples of pilgrims to the Holy Land whose narratives begin apparently in sober truth, and gradually pass into flourishes of fiction and extravagance. So in Mandeville also we find particulars not yet traced to other writers, and which may therefore be provisionally assigned either to the writer's own experience or to knowledge acquired by colloquial intercourse in the East.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}}

Whether Mandeville actually traveled or not, he would not necessarily be intentionally making the story up.  All travel narratives from this time used the same sources, taken from each other or from the earlier traditions of the Greeks.  This tradition was an integral part of such narratives to make them believable (or at least acceptable) to the readers. Columbus was to make use of some of the same monsters in "India" that Mandeville did with the intention of winning the support of the king.{{sfn|Wittkower|1942|p=159–187}}

===On Egypt===
It is difficult to decide on the character of his statements as to recent [[History of Egypt|Egyptian history]]. In his account of that country, though the series of the [[Cumans|Comanian]] (of the [[Bahri dynasty]]) sultans is borrowed from Hetoum down to the accession of Mel echnasser ([[Al-Nasir Muhammad]]), who came first to the throne in 1293, Mandeville appears to speak from his own knowledge when he adds that this "Melechnasser reigned long and governed wisely".{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=562}} In fact, though twice displaced in the early part of his life, Al-Nasir Muhammad reigned till 1341, a duration unparalleled in [[History of Arab Egypt|Muslim Egypt]], whilst we are told that during the last thirty years of his reign, Egypt rose to a high pitch of wealth and prosperity.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|pp=562–563}}

Mandeville, however, then goes on to say that his eldest son, Melechemader, was chosen to succeed; but this prince was caused privily to be slain by his brother, who took the kingdom under the name of Meleclimadabron. "And he was Soldan when I departed from those countries".{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}  Now Al-Nasir Muhammad was followed in succession by no less than eight of his sons in thirteen years, the first three of whom reigned in aggregate only a few months. The names mentioned by Mandeville appear to represent those of the fourth and sixth of the eight, viz. al-Salih Ismail, and al-Muzzafar Hajji]; and these the statements of Mandeville do not fit.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

===Words===
On several occasions, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] words are given, but are not always recognizable, owing perhaps to the carelessness of copyists in such matters. Thus, we find the names (not satisfactorily identified) of the wood,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; fruit and sap of the [[Himalayan Balsam]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  of bitumen, "alkatran" (''al-Kāṭrān'');&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of the three different kinds of pepper ([[long pepper]], [[black pepper]] and [[white pepper]]) as ''sorbotin, fulful'' and ''bano'' or ''bauo'' (''fulful'' is the common Arabic word for pepper; the others have not been satisfactorily explained). But these, and the particulars of his narrative for which no literary sources have yet been found, are too few to constitute a proof of personal experience.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

===Geographic===
Mandeville, again, in some passages shows a correct idea of the [[Celestial spheres|form of the earth]], and of position in latitude ascertained by observation of the pole star; he knows that there are [[antipodes]], and that if ships were sent on voyages of discovery they might [[circumnavigation|sail round the world]]. And he tells a curious story, which he had heard in his youth, how a worthy man did travel ever eastward until he came to his own country again.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But he repeatedly asserts the old belief that [[Jerusalem]] was in the centre of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}} cites {{harvnb|Halliwell|1866|pp=79, 163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains in proof of this that at the [[equinox]] a spear planted erect in Jerusalem casts no shadow at noon, which, if true, would equally consist with the sphericity of the earth, provided that the city were on the equator.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

===Manuscripts===
The sources of the book, which include various authors besides those included in this article specified, have been laboriously investigated by Albert Bovenschen{{efn|''Die Quellen für die Reisebeschreibung des Johann von Mandeville, Inaugural-Dissertation . . . Leipzig'' (Berlin, 1888). This was revised and enlarged as "''Untersuchungen über Johann von Mandeville und die Quellen seiner Reisebeschreibung''", in the ''Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin'', Bd. 23, Heft 3 u. 4 (No. 135, 136).}} and George F. Warner.{{sfn|Warner|''Roxburghe Club''}} The oldest known manuscript of the original—once Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Barrois's, afterwards [[Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham]]'s, now ''Nouv. Acq. Franc. 1515'' in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]—is dated 1371, but is nevertheless very inaccurate in proper names. An early printed Latin translation made from the French has been already quoted, but four others, unprinted, have been discovered by Dr Johann Vogels.{{efn|''Die ungedruckten lateinischen Versionen Mandeville's'' (Crefeld, 1886).}} They exist in eight manuscripts, of which seven are in Great Britain, while the eighth was copied by a monk of [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]]; probably, therefore, all these unprinted translations were executed in Great Britain. {{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

From one of them, according to Dr Vogels, an English version was made which has never been printed and is now extant only in free abbreviations, contained in two 15th-century manuscripts in the [[Bodleian Library]]—manuscript ''e Museo 116'', and manuscript ''[[Richard Rawlinson|Rawlinson]] D.99'': the former, which is the better, is in [[East Midlands English]], and may possibly have belonged to the [[St. Osyth's Abbey|Augustinian priory of St Osyth]] in [[Essex]], while the latter is in Southern Middle English.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}{{Clarify|date=November 2015}}

The first English translation direct from the French was made (at least as early as the beginning of the 15th century) from a manuscript of which many pages were lost.{{efn|Nicholson &amp; Yule (1911) state: Dr Vogels controverts these positions, arguing that the first English version from the French was the complete Cotton text, and that the defective English copies were made from a defective English MS. His supposed evidences of the priority of the Cotton text equally consist with its being a later revision, and for ''Roys Ils'' in the defective English MSS. he has only offered a laboured and improbable explanation.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}&lt;!----&gt;}} Writing of the name 'Califfes', the author says&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}} cites {{harvnb|Warner|''Roxburghe Club|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that it is ''taut a dire come rol (s). II y soleit auoir V. soudans'' "as much as to say king. There used to be 5 sultans".{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}} In the defective French manuscript a page ended with ''Il y so''; then came a gap, and the next page went on with part of the description of [[Mount Sinai]], ''Et est celle vallee mult froide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}} cites {{harvnb|Warner|''Roxburghe Club|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the corresponding English version has "That ys to say amonge hem ''Roys Ils'' and this vale ys ful colde"! All English printed texts before 1725, and Ashton's 1887 edition, follow these defective copies, and in only two known manuscripts has the [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]] been detected and filled up.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

One of them is the British Museum manuscript ''Egerton 1982'' ([[Northern England English|Northern dialect]], about 1410–1420 ?), in which, according to Vogels, the corresponding portion has been borrowed from that English version which had already been made from the Latin. The other is in the, [[British Museum]] manuscript ''[[Cotton Titus]] {{harvnb|''Grenville Colection''|c. 1410}} xvi.'' (Midland dialect, about 1410–1420?), representing a text completed, and revised throughout, from the French, though not by a competent hand. The ''Egerton text'', edited by George Warner, has been printed by the Roxburghe Club, while the Cotton text, first printed in 1725-27, is in modern reprints the current English version.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

That none of the forms of the English version can be from the same hand which wrote the original is made patent by their glaring errors of translation,{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}} but the Cotton text asserts in the preface that it was made by Mandeville himself, and this assertion was till lately taken on trust by almost all modern historians of English literature. The words of the original "je eusse cest livret mis en latin ... mais ... je l'ay mis en rōmant" were mistranslated as if "je eusse" meant "I had" instead of "I should have", and then (whether of fraudulent intent or by the error of a copyist thinking to supply an accidental omission) the words were added "and translated it aȝen out of Frensche into Englyssche." Mätzner seems to have been the first to show that the current English text cannot possibly have been made by Mandeville himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}  Mätzner ''Altenglische  Sprachproben'', I., ii., 154-155&lt;/ref&gt; Of the original French there is no satisfactory edition, but Vogels has undertaken a critical text, and Warner has added to his Egerton English text the French of a British Museum MS. with variants from three others.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

An illuminated Middle English copy c. 1440, possibly from [[Bersted]], [[Kent]], fetched £289,250 at a London auction in June 2011.{{sfn|Christie's|2010}}

==Further information==
It remains to mention certain other works bearing the name of Mandeville or de Bourgogne.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

MS. Add. C. 280 in the Bodleian appends to the ''Travels'' a short French life of St Alban of Germany, the author of which calls himself Johan Mandivill[e], knight, formerly of the town of St Alban, and says he writes to correct an impression prevalent among his countrymen that there was no other saint of the name: this life is followed by part of a French herbal.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

To Mandeville (by whom de Bourgogne is clearly meant) [[Jean d'Outremeuse]]{{efn|
Stanislas Bormans, Introduction to d'Oultremouse's Chronicle, pp. lxxxix., xc.; see also Warner's edition of the Travels, p. xxxv. The ascription is on ff. 5 and 6 of ''Le Tresorier de philosophie naturele des pierres precieuses'', an unprinted work by d'Oultremouse in ''MS. Fonds français'' 12326 of the ''Bibliothèque Nationale'', Paris. The passage about Alexandria is on f. 81.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}}} ascribes a Latin "lappidaire selon l'oppinion des Indois", from which he quotes twelve passages, stating that the author (whom he calls knight, lord of Montfort, of Castelperouse, and of the isle of Campdi) had been "baillez en Alexandrie" seven years, and had been presented by a [[Saracen]] friend with some fine jewels which had passed into d'Outremeuse's own possession: of this Lapidaire, a French version, which seems to have been completed after 1479, has been several times printed.&lt;ref&gt;

#The travels
#''De là forme de la terre et comment et par quelle manière elle fut faite''
#''De la forme del ciel''
#''Des herbes selon les yndois et les phulosophes par de là''
#''Ly lapidaire''
while the cataloguer supposed Mandeville to have been the author of a concluding piece entitled ''La Venianche de nostre Signeur Jhesu-Crist fayle par [[Vespasian]] fit del empereur de Romme et commeet lozeph daramathye fu deliures de la prizon''. From the treatise on herbs a passage is quoted asserting it to have been composed in 1357 in honour of the author's natural lord, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], king of England. This date is corroborated by the title of king of Scotland given to Edward, who had received from [[Baliol]] the surrender of the crown and kingly dignity on 20 January 1356, but on 3 October 1357 released [[David II of Scotland|King David]] and made peace with Scotland: unfortunately it is not recorded whether the treatise contains the author's name, and, if so, what name.{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

Tanner (''Bibliotheca'') alleges that Mandeville wrote several books on medicine, and among the ''Ashmolean manuscripts'' in the [[Bodleian Library]] are a medical receipt by John de Magna Villa (No. 2479), an aichemical receipt by him (No. 1407), and another alchemical receipt by johannes de Villa Magna (No. 1441).{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=563}}

Finally, de Bourgogne wrote under his own name a treatise on the [[Bubonic plague|plague]], extant in Latin, French and English texts, and in Latin and English abridgments. Herein he describes himself as Johannes de Burgundia, otherwise called cum Barba, citizen of [[Liège]] and professor of the art of medicine; says that he had practised forty years and had been in Liège in the plague of 1365; and adds that he had previously written a treatise on the cause of the plague, according to the indications of astrology (beginning ''Deus deorum''), and another on distinguishing pestilential diseases (beginning ''Cum nimium propter instans tempus epidimiate'').{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=564}} "Burgundia" is sometimes corrupted into "Burdegalia", and in English translations of the abridgment almost always appears as "Burdews" ([[Bordeaux]], France) or the like manuscript ''Rawlinson D. 251'' (15th century) in the Bodleian Library also contains a large number of English medical receipts, headed "Practica phisicalia Magistri Johannis de Burgundia".{{sfn|Nicholson|Yule|1911|p=564}}

The '''''Journal of Geophysical Research''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]]. It is the flagship journal of the [[American Geophysical Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/journals/ |title=Journal of Geophysical Research homepage|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains original research on the physical, chemical, and biological processes that contribute to the understanding of the [[Earth]], [[Sun]], and [[solar system]]. It has seven sections: A (Space Physics), B (Solid Earth), C (Oceans), D (Atmospheres), E (Planets), F (Earth Surface), and G (Biogeosciences). All current and back issues are available online for subscribers.

== History ==
The journal was originally founded under the name ''Terrestrial Magnetism'' by the American Geophysical Union's president [[Louis Agricola Bauer]] in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/journals/tm/1890.shtml|title=Terrestrial Magnetism Volumes 1(1896)&amp;ndash;3(1898)|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=Gregory A.|title=The Assembly of Geophysics: Scientific Disciplines as Frameworks of Consensus|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|date=September 2000|volume=31|issue=3|pages=259–292|doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(00)00018-6|bibcode=2000SHPMP..31..259G}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was entitled ''Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity'' from 1899–1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/journals/te/1900.shtml|title=Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity Volumes 4 (1899)&amp;ndash;14 (1909)|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, three specialized sections were established: ''A: Space Physics'', ''B: Solid Earth'', and ''C: Oceans''.&lt;ref name=jgr1980&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/journals/jgr/1980.shtml|title=Journal of Geophysical Research Volumes 85 (1980)&amp;ndash;94 (1989)|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, further sections have been added: ''D: Atmospheres'' in 1984,&lt;ref name=jgr1980/&gt; ''E: Planets'' in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/journals/jgr/1990.shtml|title=Journal of Geophysical Research Volumes 95 (1990)&amp;ndash;104 (1999)|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''F: Earth Surface'' in 2003,&lt;ref name=jgr2000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/journals/jgr/2000.shtml|title=Journal of Geophysical Research Volumes 105 (2000)&amp;ndash;114 (2009)|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''G: Biogeosciences'' in 2005.&lt;ref name=jgr2000/&gt;

== Sections ==
The scopes of the current seven sections, published as separate issues, are:
* ''A: Space Physics'' covers [[aeronomy]] and [[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]] physics, planetary atmospheres and magnetospheres, interplanetary and external solar physics, [[cosmic ray]]s, and [[heliosphere|heliospheric]] physics.
* ''B: Solid Earth'' focuses on the physics and chemistry of the [[solid Earth]] and the liquid [[Outer core|core]] of the Earth, [[geomagnetism]], [[paleomagnetism]], marine geology/geophysics, chemistry and physics of [[mineral]]s, [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[volcanology]], [[seismology]], [[geodesy]], [[gravity]], and [[tectonophysics]].
* ''C: Oceans'' covers physical, biological, and chemical [[oceanography]].
* ''D: Atmospheres'' covers atmospheric properties and processes, including the interaction of the atmosphere with other components of the Earth system.
* ''E: Planets'' covers the geology, geophysics, geochemistry, atmospheres, biology, and dynamics of the [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|satellites]], [[asteroids]], [[planetary rings|rings]], [[comet]]s, and [[meteorite]]s; planetary origins; and planetary detection. Studies of the Earth are included when they concern exogenic effects or the comparison of the Earth to other planets.
* ''F: Earth Surface'' focuses on the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the form and function of the surface of the solid Earth over all temporal and spatial scales, including [[fluvial]], [[Aeolian processes|eolian]], and [[coast]]al [[sediment transport]]; [[hill]]slope mass movements; [[glacial]] and [[periglacial]] activity; [[weathering]] and [[pedogenesis]]; and surface manifestations of [[volcanism]] and [[tectonics|tectonism]].
* ''G: Biogeosciences'' focuses on the interface between [[biology]] and the [[geoscience]]s and attempts to understand the functions of the Earth system across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

Each of the sections has one or more editors who are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the President of the American Geophysical Union for terms of three to four years. Each editor can in turn appoint associate editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/journals/editors/|title=About AGU Journal Editors|work=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Editor-in-Chief of ''JGR-Space Physics'', "With the switch to Wiley, the separate sections of JGR were given distinct ISSN numbers. This means that in a couple of years, each section of JGR will have its own Impact Factor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://liemohnjgrspace.wordpress.com/2014/07/ | title=July &amp;#124; 2014 &amp;#124; Notes from the JGR-Space Physics Editor-in-Chief}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">'''Kinechromatic art''' is a form of art in which the image, particularly in reference to the colour perceived by the viewer, changes due to some form of movement.

The term "kinechromatic" was coined in 1951 by [[Mario Pedrosa]] in an article in ''[[Tribuna da Imprensa]]'' to refer to the work of Brazilian artist, [[Abraham Palatnik]]. Palatnik initially created [[electro-mechanical]] devices, based on the [[kaleidoscope|kaleidoscopic]] principle, which projected a constantly changing pattern of coloured light on a screen. Later devices exposed coloured moving parts of the machinery. In all cases, the shape and colour observed were changed by the devices for a stationary observer. [[Frank Popper]], the eminent art historian, among others, commented on Palatnik's "luminous mobiles" and their aesthetic of motion.

More recently, the term has been applied to the work of [[Ian Nunn]], a Canadian computer scientist and artist who has done extensive work in the application of [[interference pigments]] and films to 2-dimensional painting surfaces. These special effect pigments, such as [[ChromaFlair]], exhibit strong directional [[spectral reflectance]] and colour shifting with the angle of view. In Nunn's work, the viewer moves while the painting remains stationary. Elements in the picture change colour, appear and disappear as both the angle of viewing and the angle of illumination change.

The '''Lak language''' (лакку маз, ''lakːu maz'') is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]] forming its own branch within this family. It is the language of the [[Lak people (Dagestan)|Lak people]] from the [[Russia]]n autonomous republic of [[Dagestan]], where it is one of six standardized languages. It is spoken by about 157,000 people.

==History==
[[File:Uslar-Lak grammar cover.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cover page of the textbook on Lak grammar named "Лакскiй языкъ" or ''The Lak language'' compiled by P. K. Uslar in 1890]]
[[File:Uslar-Lak alphabet.jpg|thumb|300px|right|"Лакская азбука" or ''The Lak alphabet'' from Peter Uslar's Lak Grammar]]
In 1864 Russian ethnographer and linguist [[Peter von Uslar|P. K. Uslar]] wrote: "Kazikumukh grammar or as I called it for short in the native language, the Lak grammar, Lakku maz, the Lak language, is ready".&lt;ref name="uslar"&gt;Услар П. К. Этнография Кавказа. Языкознание. 4. Лакский язык. Тифлис, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890 a textbook was published on Lak grammar compiled by P.K. Uslar named as ''The Lak Language''. It stated under the title "Lak alphabet": "The proposed alphabet is written for  people who name themselves collectively Lak, genitive Lakral. From among these people each one is named separately Lakkuchu 'Lakian man,' the woman — Lakkusharssa 'Lakian woman.' Their homeland they name Lakral kIanu — 'Lak place.'"&lt;ref name="uslar" /&gt;

Lak has throughout the centuries adopted a number of [[loanword]]s from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;Словарь арабских и персидских лексических заимствований в лакском языке. Н. Б. Курбайтаева, И. И. Эфендиев. Махачкала, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since [[Dagestan]] was part of the [[USSR]] and later [[Russia]], the largest portion of loanwords have come from [[Russian language|Russian]], especially political and technical vocabulary. There is a newspaper and broadcasting station in Lak language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilchi.etnosmi.ru Илчи – Lak newspaper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818090711/http://ilchi.etnosmi.ru/ |date=2011-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of Dagestan of 1994, Lak language was named as the state language along with Russian and some other major languages spoken in Dagestan (about 20 local languages are unwritten and have no official status). Lak language is used as a teaching tool in elementary school and taught as a subject in secondary schools, vocational schools and universities. There is a Lak newspaper, "Ilchi".

The standard Lak language is based on the dialect of the city of [[Kumukh]]. This city should not be confused with the [[Kumyks|Kumyk]] ethnic group, a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]] also present in the [[Caucasus]]. To sum up, the Lak language has the following dialects: ''Kumukh, Vitskhi, Arakul, Balkhar, Shadni, Shalib, Vikhli, Kuli, and Kaya''.

Initially Lak language by lexicon was found to be close to Dargin language and the two were often combined in one Lak-Dargin subgroup of Dagestani languages. However, further research has led the scientists to conclude that this association was weak.

*The consonants in &lt;span style="color:#DE7B1A;"&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt; are given by Schulze, but not by TITUS. The consonant /ʡ/ (&lt;span style="color:grey;"&gt;grey&lt;/span&gt;) is given by TITUS, but not by Schulze.
*The sound transcribed here as a [[glottal stop]] is named rather ambiguously a "glottalic [[laryngeal consonant|laryngeal]]" by both sources.

=== Vowels ===
Five vowels are presented as [a, e, i, o, u].

==Grammar==
Lak is one of the few North East Caucasian languages with verbal [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] for person. It generally only distinguishes only between speech-act participants and non-speech-act participants. In other words, the first- and second-person agreement markers are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Helmbrecht, J. (1996). "The Syntax of Personal Agreement in East Caucasian Languages". ''Sprachtypol. Univ. Frsch. (STUF)'' 49:127–48. Cited in Bhat, D.N.S. 2004. ''Pronouns''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing systems==
The Lak language was written using the [[Arabic script]] until 1928. Afterwards it was written with a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] for ten years, and since 1938 it has been written in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].

The Lak alphabet in Cyrillic initially included 48 letters and later 54 letters with double letters as "тт", "пп", "чч", "хьхь", etc.:

[[South Asia]] is home to several hundred languages.

==India==
Most languages spoken in [[India]] belong either to the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ([[circa|c.]] 74%), the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (c. 24%), the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] ([[Munda languages|Munda]]) (c. 1.2%), or the  [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] (c. 0.6%) families, with some languages of the [[Himalayas]] still unclassified.
The [[SIL International|SIL]] Ethnologue lists 461 living languages for India.

[[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] is the most widespread language of India. The Indian census takes the widest possible definition of "Hindi" as the broad variety of the [[Hindi languages]]. The native speakers of Hindi so defined account for 39% of Indians.

[[Indian English]] is recorded as the native language of 226,449 Indians in the 2001 census. English is the second "language of the Union" besides Hindi.

Thirteen languages account for more than 1% of Indian population each, and between themselves for over 95%; all of them are "[[Official languages of India#The languages of the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution|scheduled languages of the constitution]]."

Scheduled languages spoken by less than 1% of Indians are [[Santali language|Santali]] (0.64%),   [[Meitei language|Manipuri]] (0.14%),  [[Bodo language|Bodo]] (0.13%), [[Dogri language|Dogri]] (0.01%, spoken in [[Jammu and Kashmir]]). The largest language that is not "scheduled" is  [[Bhili language|Bhili]] (0.95%), followed by [[Gondi language|Gondi]] (0.27%), [[Tulu language|Tulu]] (0.17%) and [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]] (0.099%)

The following is a chronological list of artistic movements or periods in France indicating artists who are sometimes associated or grouped with those movements.  See also [[European art history]], [[Art history]] and [[History of Painting]] and [[Art movement]].

==[[School of Fontainebleau]]==
The ''École de Fontainebleau'' was two periods of artistic production during the Renaissance  centered on the [[Château Fontainebleau|Château of Fontainebleau]].

*[[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] (c.1509–1571)

Second School (from 1590s)
*[[Ambroise Dubois]] (c.1542–1614) (Flemish born)
*[[Toussaint Dubreuil]] (c.1561–1602)
*[[Martin Fréminet]] (1567–1619)

==[[French Baroque and Classicism|Classicism]]==
See as well [[Louis XIV of France]], [[Palace of Versailles]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Gobelin]]s, [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Baroque]]
*[[Pierre Mignard]] (1612–1695)
*[[André Le Nôtre]] (1613–1700) Landscape architect
*[[Charles Le Brun]] (1619–1690)

==[[Rococo]]==
The expression "Rococo" is used for much European art throughout the 18th century, including works by the Italians [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], [[Canaletto]] and [[Francesco Guardi]] and the English [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Joshua Reynolds]] and the furnituremaker [[Thomas Chippendale]].  Compared with the 17th century [[Baroque]], Rococo implies a lighter and more playful decorative art; the nude female is frequently featured; [[chinoiserie]] is also fashionable. Some of the artists that are most often grouped as "Rococo" are listed below.  See as well [[Régence]], [[Louis XV of France]], [[Palace of Versailles]].
*[[Antoine Watteau]] (1684–1721) painter

*[[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] (1780–1867) painter

==[[Romanticism]]==
Most of the early 19th-century artists given in the chronological list above have been at some time grouped together under the rubric of "romanticism", including the "realists" (as the Barbizon school) and the "naturalists".  Some of the most important are listed here.  See also [[French Revolution]], [[Napoleon I of France]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[orientalism]]. 
*[[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]] (1767–1824)

This is a list of fictional stories that, when written, were set in the future, but the future they predicted has now passed. The list excludes works that were [[alternate histories]], which were composed after the dates they depict. The list also excludes contemporary or near-future works (e.g. set within a year or two), unless it deals with some notable futuristic event as with the [[2012 phenomenon]]. It also excludes works where the future is passively mentioned and not really depicting anything notable about the society as with an [[epilogue]] that just focuses on the fate of the main characters. Entries referencing the current year may be added if their month and day were not specified or have already occurred.

&lt;!-- Entries should either be referenced by the corresponding Wikipedia article or to a reliable source --&gt;

The Modern Warfare trilogy proved so popular because it, despite being a little outlandish at times, was rooted in the real world. The games took players to real locations, from the streets of New York City to the favelas of Brazil, to the war-torn Middle East and the ruins of Chernobyl. Those places all have real history behind them, a history that game developers can play with to craft new tales of sacrifice and daring.--&gt;

A prequel, ''[[Macross Zero]]'', set in 2008, was released between 2002 and 2004, but since many events in the series timeline had already occurred by that point, it could arguably be viewed as alternate history, rather than future.

'''Malandragem''' ({{IPA-pt|malɐ̃ˈdɾaʒẽȷ̃|br}}) is  a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term for a lifestyle of idleness, fast living and petty crime – traditionally celebrated in [[samba]] lyrics, especially those of [[Noel Rosa]] and [[Bezerra da Silva]]. The exponent of this lifestyle, the ''malandro'' (masculine adjective), or "[[bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]]" (rogue, hustler, rascal, scoundrel), has become significant to Brazilian national identity as a [[folk hero]] or, rather, an [[anti-hero]]. It is common in [[Brazilian literature]],  [[Brazilian cinema]] and [[Brazilian music]].&lt;ref&gt;"Popular cinema in Brazil, 1930–2001", by Stephanie Dennison, Lisa Shaw, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7190-6499-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mQsHp5Re3IoC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=malandragem&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rCb6TezzNofniAK4vtDoBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=malandragem&amp;f=false section "Malandragem and jeitinho"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
A "malandro" could be defined as someone who:
* Never works and lives off [[scam]]s; a [[confidence trick|con man]]
* Has shallow, uncommitted romantic relationships;
* Leads a [[bohemian]] life of [[Hedonism|only fun and pleasure]]; 
* Is lazy, sluggish; 
* Cheats and deceives in order to prevail; a [[trickster]].

==Definition==
'''Malandragem''' is defined as an aggregation of strategies utilized in order to gain advantage in a determined situation, these advantages often being illicit. It is characterized by [[List of French words and phrases used by English speakers#S|savoir faire]] and subtlety. Its execution demands aptitude, [[charisma]], cunning and whatever other characteristics (knacks) which help in the manipulation of people or institutions to obtain the best outcome in the easiest possible way. 

Disconsidering logical argumentation, labor and honesty, the malandro presupposes that such methods are incapable of getting him a good outcome. Those who practice malandragem act in the manner of the popular Brazilian adage, immortalized in a catch phrase of former [[Football in Brazil|Brazilian soccer]] player [[Gérson]] de Oliveira Nunes in a cigarette TV commercial (hence the name it was given: Lei de Gérson, or [[Gérson's law]]):  “I like to get an advantage in everything.”

Together with the concept of [[jeitinho]], malandragem can be considered another typical — but not exclusive — Brazilian mode of social navigation;  unlike jeitinho, however, with malandragem the integrity of institutions and individuals is effectively attacked, legally speaking, as malicious. Successful malandragem is gaining advantage under the condition of not being caught. Basically, the malandro dupes the target without them knowing they have been tricked.

Malandragem is characterized in the Brazilian popular imagination as a tool for individual justice. Facing the forces of oppressive institutions, the individualist malandro survives by manipulating people, fooling authorities and sidestepping laws in a way which guarantees his well-being. In this way, the malandro is a typical Brazilian hero. Literary examples include Pedro Malasarte and João Grilo.

Like jeitinho, malandragem is an intellectual resource utilized by individuals of little social influence or by the socially disadvantaged. This does not stop the equal use of malandragem by those of better social positions. Through malandragem, one gains illicit advantages in [[gambling]], business, and in the totality of their [[Interpersonal relationship|social life]].  One can consider a malandro the adulterer who convinces a woman of his false fidelity; the employer who finds a way to pay his employees less than what he owes; the player who manipulates his cards and wins the round.

But, despite this apparent [[Egocentrism|egocentrical]], lying and malicious nature, the person who makes use of ''malandragem'' is not necessarily selfish. He could possibly be lazy, but the malandro is not careless with the people around him. He generally doesn't make use of ''malandragem'' to take advantage of another person intending to harm others, but rather only to find a way out of an unfair situation even if this means resorting to illegal methods. In fictional contexts, ''malandragem'' is often a device used to introduce [[wit]], a typical plot device/characteristic of an [[antihero]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15412">'''Morris Birkbeck''' (January 23, 1764 – June 4, 1825) was an English agricultural innovator, author/publicist, [[anti-slavery]] campaigner and early 19th-century pioneer in [[southern Illinois]], in the [[United States]]. With George Flower he founded the [[English Settlement (Illinois)|English Settlement]] and the town of [[Albion, Illinois]], and served briefly as the [[Secretary of State of Illinois]].

==Early years==
Birkbeck was born at [[Settle, England]], the son of an influential [[Quaker]] also named Morris Birkbeck, and his wife Hannah Bradford. He is of the same  Birkbeck family as [[George Birkbeck]] (1776-1841),&lt;ref&gt;S.B. Foster, The pedigree of Birkbeck of Mallerstang and Settle, Braithwaite of Kendal, Benson of Stang End, (London: Collingridge, 1890), pp. 81-85.&lt;/ref&gt; doctor, educationalist, philanthropist, reformer, and founder of [[Birkbeck College]], London, and the [[Mechanics' Institutes]]; and of [[John Birkbeck]] (1817-1890),&lt;ref&gt;[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24185970M/The_pedigree_of_Birkbeck_of_Mallerstang_and_Settle_Braithwaite_of_Kendal_Benson_of_Stang_End Foster 1890, Birkbeck Pedigree p.95]&lt;/ref&gt; a Yorkshire banker, alpinist, and pioneer [[Caving|potholer]].

By 1794, as [[leaseholder]], Birkbeck was farming an estate of {{Convert|1500|acre|km2}} at [[Wanborough, Surrey]], where he joined others in England and France who were experimenting with crossbreeding [[Merino]] sheep. On April 24, 1794, Birkbeck married Prudence Bush, daughter of Richard and Prudence Bush of [[Wandsworth, Surrey]]. After ten years of marriage, Prudence died from the complications of childbirth on October 25, 1804, leaving her husband with seven children. Birkbeck remained a widower for the rest of his life.

In 1814, accompanied by his friend and fellow Merino sheep breeder George Flower (1788-1862), son of [[Richard Flower (settler)|Richard Flower]], Birkbeck traveled in [[Napoleonic Wars|recently defeated France]].&lt;ref&gt;http://library.knox.edu/archives/MSS/MSS-Birkbeck-Flower.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Notes on a Journey through France'' (1814) revealed a good-tempered, fair-minded observer, well grounded in science and the [[humanities]]. A radical in both politics and religion, Birkbeck was increasingly annoyed at being taxed by a government that denied him a vote because of his religion and that also required him to be [[tithe]]d by a church he did not believe in and held in contempt. In London, Birkbeck met [[Edward Coles]], President [[James Madison]]'s secretary who had been sent on a diplomatic mission to Europe. Coles had recently travelled into what was then the newly formed [[Illinois Territory]], and extolled its virtues as well as proclaimed his intent to move there.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt E. Leichtle and Bruce G. Carveth, Crusader Against Slavery: Edward Coles, Pioneer of Freedom (Southern Illinois University Press, 2011) p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1817, with a party consisting chiefly of his children and [[ward (law)|wards]], Birkbeck emigrated to the United States. George Flower had emigrated first, leaving his wife and two young sons in England in 1816, and had spent most of the previous winter with former President [[Thomas Jefferson]] at [[Monticello]], as well as with Coles' family in [[Virginia]]. Flower, Birkbeck and their fellow English idealists jointly headed west in search of land on which to settle and try to establish a [[utopian]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-1976aug/ishs-1976aug-213.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104215410/http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-1976aug/ishs-1976aug-213.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }} at pp.2-6, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Illinois==
During 1817&amp;ndash;18 Birkbeck began preparing for their scheme by buying about {{Convert|26400|acre|km2}} of public land in the far south of [[Edwards County, Illinois|Edwards County]], in the [[Illinois Territory]]. Flower returned to England to organize emigrants, raise money for the venture, and arrange for his father's family to emigrate. Birkbeck and Flower hoped to establish a new community in the sparsely-settled [[Wabash River|Wabash River Valley]] where English men and women would be able to escape the economic and political tyranny they believed England had become. Both men had close family ties to Britain's radical political and religious establishment.

Birkbeck published ''Notes on a Journey in America from the Coast of Virginia to the Territory of Illinois'' (1817), first in [[Philadelphia]], then in London, Dublin, and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. An account of the party's emigration travel experiences, with vague references to their plans for establishing a wilderness sanctuary, it became immensely popular, with its promise of improving the lives of downtrodden working and middle-class Europeans. It ran through eleven editions in English in two years, and was published in German at [[Jena]] (1818), and translated into Swedish by [[Per Georg Scheutz|Georg Scheutz]] (1818)&lt;ref&gt;http://libris.kb.se/bib/2406110&lt;/ref&gt; Birkbeck's follow-up, ''Letters from Illinois'' (1818), published in Boston, Philadelphia, and London, went through seven editions in English, besides being translated in 1819 into French and German.

The radical nature of the [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] and anti-aristocratic vision presented in Birkbeck's writings frightened Britain's conservative establishment, even as it excited thousands to dream of following him to the Illinois [[prairie]]s. A [[Pamphlet wars|pamphlet war]] ensued, where pundits, editors and ordinary folk debated the merits of Birkbeck and Flower's radical political statement and reform efforts, thrusting the two men before the Anglo-American reading public, while English emigrants and their investigating agents headed for "[[English Settlement (Illinois)|The English Prairie]]" to ascertain the truth of the settlement's prospects.

But soon Birkbeck and Flower became estranged, ostensibly over George Flower's [[bigamous]] marriage to Eliza Julia Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-1976aug/ishs-1976aug-213.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104215410/http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-1976aug/ishs-1976aug-213.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }} at pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the orphaned niece of [[John Towill Rutt]] (an English political activist, social reformer, [[nonconformist]] man of letters, and [[Joseph Priestley]]'s biographer). Eliza had accompanied the Birkbeck family from England to Illinois, possibly because Flowers' father, who emigrated with him and two brothers and two sisters, knew that their romance had broken up Flower's adolescent marriage to his first cousin Jane Dawson. Divorce was also difficult to obtain in England, and while an [[Indiana]] [[Justice of the Peace]] married Eliza and George in 1817, George didn't receive an Illinois marriage license for his union with Eliza until after receiving a special Illinois legislative divorce from Jane in 1836, long after their first child (a daughter) was born in [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], but before their son became a [[minister (Christianity)|minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-1976aug/ishs-1976aug-213.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104215410/http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-1976aug/ishs-1976aug-213.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-04 |df= }} at p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Birkbeck never approved of George and Eliza's romance, whether on moral grounds, or because he had hoped to marry his [[ward (law)|ward]] himself. Soon, the disaffection between the male leaders affected the English Settlement as a whole.

In 1818 Birkbeck laid out the town of [[Wanborough, Illinois|Wanborough]], and Flower, whose 1500 acres adjoined Birkbeck's, laid out the town of [[Albion, Illinois|Albion]] nearby. The men never reconciled, nor ever again directly spoke to one another. Initial hopes both had for the venture were extinguished as factions formed and conflict abounded.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Christopher D. "Dreams of a Prairie Republic: Morris Birkbeck and Settlement on the Indiana-Illinois Frontier, 1764-1860," Ph.D. dissertation, University of Delaware, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc14.html&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the English Prairie Settlement was soon overwhelmed by immigrants answering Birkbeck's clarion call. The settlement reported 400 English and 700 American residents by 1819, but only 800 were indicated in an informal survey in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoisarchaeology.com/Wildlife%20Prairie.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927165311/http://www.illinoisarchaeology.com/Wildlife%20Prairie.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }} at p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Birkbeck became president of Illinois' first agricultural society. He promoted scientific farming techniques, especially concerning livestock, although his Illinois neighbors initially ridiculed him for sowing only a half acre of potatoes and breaking his plow the first year, particularly since Birkbeck had predicted that he could cultivate 100 acres of maize from the hard-packed prairie.&lt;ref&gt;Leichtle and Carveth, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long involved in [[abolitionism]] in England, Birkbeck assisted his London acquaintance [[Edward Coles]] - who had become the [[List of Governors of Illinois|second governor of Illinois]] - in working against slavery in Illinois, particularly during an attempt to legalize the 'peculiar institution' in the new state.&lt;ref&gt;Leichtle and Carveth, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, Birkbeck, through newspaper articles under the pen name "Jonathan Freeman," helped to consolidate the [[Abolitionism in the United States|antislavery]] forces in Illinois and ensure that it remained a [[Slave and free states|free state]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, "Dreams of a Prairie Republic."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824, Coles appointed Birkbeck as [[Secretary of State of Illinois]]. Birkbeck served for three months, but was turned out when the [[proslavery]] majority in the state Senate refused to confirm his appointment. Albion also became the Edwards [[county seat]], although residents of [[Mount Carmel, Illinois|Mount Carmel]] across the river attempted to retrieve some court records by force, and ultimately succeeded in splitting off their area as [[Wabash County, Illinois]]. The outcome made Edwards County the fourth smallest county in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Thomas J., "Blood in the moon" The War for the Seat of Edwards County, 1821-1824. Illinois Historical Journal, 85 (Autumn 1992): 143-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
On June 4, 1825, while returning on horseback from a visit to Welsh industrialist and social reformer [[Robert Owen]] at [[New Harmony, Indiana]], Birkbeck drowned trying to cross the rain-swollen [[Fox River (Wabash tributary)|Fox River]], a tributary of the  [[Wabash River]]. He was sixty one years old. He had been travelling with his twenty-three-year-old son Bradford Birkbeck, as well as Judge James O. Wattles and other 'English Prairie' residents, who were interested in Owen's newly proposed utopian community at New Harmony.

Morris Birkbeck's death devastated the settlement, and his sons and daughters were left at loose ends. They soon formed an [[Owenism|Owenite]] society at Wanborough, but it was short-lived because they could not maintain its economic viability.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, "Dreams of a Prairie Republic."&lt;/ref&gt;  All that remains of Morris Birkbeck's settlement at [[Wanborough, Illinois]] is the cemetery, with an Illinois historical marker.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMJ758_Wanborough_Illinois&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyillinois.com/files/Markers/marker.php?marker_id=73 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102163019/http://www.historyillinois.com/files/Markers/marker.php?marker_id=73 |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Albion prospered through the years, and remains the county seat of one of the smallest counties in the state of Illinois. Also, an unincorporated community in [[DeWitt County, Illinois|central Illinois]] takes the name of the pioneer reformer: [[Birkbeck, Illinois]].

Pioneering American journalist and early women's rights advocate [[Margaret Fuller]] lauded Birkbeck in her book ''[[Summer on the Lakes]]'' (1844), praising him for his generous communal vision, and recounting the sad circumstances of his death. Ironically, she herself also drowned tragically, in a shipwreck off [[Fire Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1850.

Birkbeck's eldest son Richard eventually moved to New Harmony, where he died a broken man in 1839. Sons Bradford and Charles, and the families of daughters Eliza and Prudence, emigrated to [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas, Mexico]], where Bradford and Charles managed English silver mines. Prudence, who left her husband Frances Hanks at the Prairie settlement, died of cholera in 1833, and Bradford took in her three orphaned daughters Clara, Lucy, and Caroline.

Birkbeck's daughter Eliza (1797-1880) married Gilbert Titus Pell (1796-1860), who came from a prominent family of New York politicians. Gilbert Pell served as representative in the Illinois legislature and was appointed United States envoy to Mexico in the 1850s. He was descended from [[Sir John Pell]] (1643-1702), Lord of [[Pelham Manor]], New York, {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} who was the son of English mathematician Dr. [[John Pell]], and nephew and heir of early American settler and pioneer [[Thomas Pell]].
Eliza became estranged from her husband, and returned to England with their son [[Morris Birkbeck Pell]]. Morris Pell studied mathematics at [[Cambridge University]], where he graduated as [[Senior Wrangler]] (top [[mathematics]] [[undergraduate]]), in 1849. In 1852 he emigrated with his family to the British colony of [[New South Wales]] (Australia), to become the inaugural Professor of Mathematics and [[Natural Philosophy]] at the newly opened [[Sydney University]].

After several years of mining management in Mexico, Bradford and Charles Birkbeck also emigrated to  Australia, to raise sheep at their pioneer settlement at [[Rockhampton]], in [[Queensland]]. Glenmore Homestead (originally about one hundred and twenty five square miles), is today still worked by the descendants of Samuel Bradford ("SB") Birkbeck.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glenmorehomestead.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New York School for the Deaf''' is a private school for the deaf in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]], just north of New York City, United States.

==History==
[[File:New York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, 1918 (bottom cropped).jpg|thumb|
New York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, 1918]]
The New York School for the Deaf was chartered in 1817 as the '''New York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb''', and opened its first classes in [[New York City]] in 1818 just after the [[American School for the Deaf]], and thus is recognized as the second oldest deaf school in the United States.  It moved twice in the 19th century to other [[Manhattan]] locations, and finally to White Plains, New York in 1938, where it remains.&lt;ref name="fanwood"&gt;
{{Cite web|title=New York School for the Deaf - Fanwood |publisher=NYSD |url=http://www.nysd.net |accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school had its origins in 1808, when the [[John Stanford (teacher)|Rev. John Stanford]] gathered a small group of deaf children to teach them the alphabet and basic language skills in New York City.  In 1892 the school was the first U.S. school of any kind to introduce a military curriculum.  For half a century, [[Military parade|tight formation drill]] was an everyday occurrence on the parade grounds.&lt;ref name="gannon"&gt;
{{Cite book|last=Gannon |first=Jack |year=1981 |title=Deaf Heritage |publisher=National Association for the Deaf |publication-place= |page=19|isbn=1563685140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curric6"&gt;
{{Cite web|url=http://my.gallaudet.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/ASLCurr/ASL-L1-curriculum/6th-Grade/Deaf-School-History-6th-grade.pdf|title=Deaf School History|publisher=gallaudet.edu|page=16|accessdate=2013-06-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020232348/https://my.gallaudet.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/ASLCurr/ASL-L1-curriculum/6th-Grade/Deaf-School-History-6th-grade.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the school dropped the military curriculum and [[Coeducation|welcomed girls]] again, and since then has expanded its programs to benefit both deaf and hard-of-hearing school children, and more recently, pre-school classes as well.

== Education ==

Since 1977, Fanwood uses the [[total communication]] method of deaf education, which employs multiple means of communication including [[sign language]] and other modes, as necessary for each child.

=== Technology ===

[[Telecommunications device for the deaf|TTY phones]] and [[Closed captioning|closed caption TVs]] were used in the 1970s. More recently the school has introduced video phones, [[interactive whiteboard]]s and [[computer assisted learning]].

== Organization ==

NYSD is a private, tax-exempt non-profit organization under article [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]] of U.S. law.

== Distinguished alumni, faculty, and visitors ==
* [[Bernard Bragg]] - deaf performer, writer, director, poet, and artist
* [[De Witt Clinton]] - first President of the Board of Trustees
* [[Helen Keller]] - visited the school as a teenager in 1893, chaperoned by her friend [[Alexander Graham Bell]]

'''Norn''' is an extinct [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] that was spoken in the [[Northern Isles]] ([[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]]) off the north coast of mainland Scotland and in [[Caithness]] in the far north of the Scottish mainland. After Orkney and Shetland were [[pledge (law)|pledged]] to Scotland by Norway in 1468–69, it was gradually replaced by [[Scots language|Scots]]. Norn became extinct in 1850, after the death of [[Walter Sutherland (Norn)|Walter Sutherland]], the language's last known speaker.

==History==
[[Image:Languages of Scotland 1400 AD.svg|thumb|Languages of Scotland around the early 15th century, based on placename evidence.

{{Legend|#ff0|[[English language|English]]/[[Scots language|Scots]]}}
]]

[[North Germanic peoples|Norse]] settlement in the islands probably began in the early 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stenroos, Merja-Riitta et al. (2012). ''Language Contact and Development around the North Sea''. John Benjamins Publishing Company. p. 218. {{ISBN|978-90-272-4839-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These settlers are believed to have arrived in very substantial numbers and like those who migrated to [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]] it is probable that most came from the [[Western Norway|west coast]] of [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter (1984). ''Language in the British Isles''. Cambridge University Press. p. 358. {{ISBN|978-0-521-28409-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shetland [[toponymy]] bears some resemblance to that of northwest Norway, while Norn [[vocabulary]] implies links with more southerly Norwegian regions.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter (1984). ''Language in the British Isles''. Cambridge University Press. p. 361. {{ISBN|978-0-521-28409-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orkney and Shetland were pledged to [[James III of Scotland|James III]] in 1468 and 1469 respectively, and it is with these pledges that the replacement of Norn with Scots is most associated. However, the decline of Norse speech in Orkney probably began in 1379 when the earldom passed into the hands of the [[Clan Sinclair|Sinclairs]], and Scots had superseded Norse as the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|language of prestige]] on the island by the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter (1984). ''Language in the British Isles''. Cambridge University Press. p. 352. {{ISBN|978-0-521-28409-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Shetland the transition began later, but by the end of the 15th century both island groups were [[bilingual]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Charles (1997). ''The Edinburgh History of the Scots Language
''. Edinburgh University Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-0-7486-0754-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the process by which Scots overtook Norn as the primary spoken language on the islands was not a swift one,&lt;ref name="Scots Language p. 394"&gt;Jones, Charles (1997). ''The Edinburgh History of the Scots Language''. Edinburgh University Press. p. 394. {{ISBN|978-0-7486-0754-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most natives of Orkney and Shetland likely spoke Norn as a [[first language]] until the late 16th and early-to-mid 17th centuries respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter (1984). ''Language in the British Isles''. Cambridge University Press. p. 354. {{ISBN|978-0-521-28409-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinction===
It is not known exactly when Norn became extinct. Sources from the 17th and 18th centuries speak of Norn (sometimes identified as "Norse", "Norwegian" or "Danish") as being in a state of decline and generally indicate that the language remained stronger in Shetland than in Orkney. A source from 1670 states that there are "only three or four parishes" in Orkney where people speak "Noords or rude Danish" and that they do so "chiefly when they are at their own houses".&lt;ref name="Northern"&gt;Millar, Robert McColl (2007). ''Northern and Insular Scots''. Edinburgh University Press. p. 126. {{ISBN|978-0-7486-2317-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another from 1701 indicates that there were still a few [[Monolingualism|monoglot]] "Norse" speakers who were capable of speaking "no other thing," and notes that there were more speakers of the language in Shetland than in Orkney.&lt;ref name="Northern"/&gt; It was said in 1703 that the people of Shetland generally spoke Scots, but that "many among them retain the ancient Danish Language";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/INTRO/intro2.php?num=1 ]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1750 Orkney-born James Mackenzie wrote that Norn was not yet entirely extinct, being "retained by old people," who still spoke it among each other.&lt;ref&gt;Hoops, Johannes (2003). ''Reallexikon Der Germanischen Altertumskunde: Band 21''. Walter De Gruyter Inc. p. 385. {{ISBN|978-3-11-017272-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last reports of Norn speakers are claimed to be from the 19th century, but it is more likely that the language was dying out in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Price, ''The Languages of Britain'' (London: Edward Arnold 1984, {{ISBN|978-0-7131-6452-7}}), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; The isolated islands of [[Foula]] and [[Unst]] are variously claimed as the last refuges of the language in Shetland, where there were people "[[Rememberer|who could repeat sentences]] in Norn, probably passages from folk songs or poems, as late as 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Price (1984), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Sutherland (Norn)|Walter Sutherland]] from Skaw in Unst, who died about 1850, has been cited as the last native speaker of the Norn language. However, fragments of vocabulary survived the death of the main language and remain to this day, mainly in place-names and terms referring to plants, animals, weather, mood, and fishing vocabulary.

Norn had also been a spoken language in [[Caithness]] but had probably become extinct there by the 15th century, replaced by Scots.&lt;ref name="Scots Language p. 394"/&gt; Hence, some scholars also speak about "Caithness Norn", but others avoid this. Even less is known about "Caithness Norn" than about Orkney and Shetland Norn. Almost no written Norn has survived, but what little remains includes a version of the [[Lord's Prayer]] and a [[ballad]], "[[Hildina]]". Michael P Barnes, professor of Scandinavian Studies at University College London, has published a study, ''The Norn Language of Orkney and Shetland''.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Michael P. ''The Norn Language of Orkney &amp; Shetland''. Lerwick: Shetland Times 1998. {{ISBN|1-898852-29-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Norn is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] belonging to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] branch of the [[Germanic languages]]. Together with [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], it belongs to the West Scandinavian group, separating it from the East Scandinavian group consisting of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Gutnish]]. While this classification is based on the differences between the North Germanic languages at the time they split, their present-day characteristics justify another classification, dividing them into Insular Scandinavian and Mainland Scandinavian language groups based on mutual intelligibility. Under this system, Norwegian is grouped together with Danish and Swedish, because the last millennium has seen all three undergo important changes, especially in grammar and lexis, which have set them apart from Faroese and Icelandic. Norn is generally considered to have been fairly similar to Faroese, sharing many phonological and grammatical traits, and might even have been mutually intelligible with it; thus, it can be considered an Insular Scandinavian language.

Few written texts remain. It is distinct from the present day dialect of Shetland, [[Shetland Scots]], which evolved from [[Middle English]].

==Phonology==
The [[phonology]] of Norn can never be determined with much precision due to the lack of source material, but the general aspects can be extrapolated from the few written sources that do exist. Norn shared many traits with the dialects of southwest [[Norway]]. This includes a voicing of {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} to {{IPA|[b, d, ɡ]}} before or between vowels and (in the Shetland dialect, but only partially in the Orkney dialect) a conversion of {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} ("'''th'''ing" and "'''th'''at" respectively) to {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} respectively.

==Grammar==
The features of Norn grammar were very similar to the other Scandinavian languages. There were two [[number (grammar)|numbers]], three [[gender (grammar)|genders]] and four [[case (grammar)|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]] and [[dative]]). The two main conjugations of [[verb]]s in [[present tense|present]] and [[past tense]] were also present and like all other North Germanic languages, it used a [[suffix]] instead of a prepositioned [[article (linguistics)|article]] to indicate definiteness as in modern Scandinavian: ''{{lang|nrn|man(n)}}'' ("man"); ''{{lang|nrn|mannen}}'' ("the man"). Though it is difficult to be certain of many of the aspects of Norn grammar, documents indicate that it may have featured subjectless clauses, which were common in the West Scandinavian languages.

{{anchor|guddick|riddle}}A Shetland "guddick" ([[riddle]]) in Norn, which [[Jakob Jakobsen]] heard told on [[Unst]], the northernmost island in [[Shetland]], in the 1890s. The same riddle is also known from the [[Faroe Islands]], Norway, Iceland, and a variation also occurs in England.

The answer is a cow: four [[nipple]]s hang, four legs walk, two [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] and two ears stand skyward, two eyes show the way to the field and one tail comes shaking (dangling) behind.

[[File:Yellferries.jpg|right|thumb|200px|left|''Daggri'' and ''Dagalien'' at [[Ulsta]], [[Isle of Yell|Yell]], [[Shetland]].]]

Most of the use of Norn/Norse in modern-day Shetland and Orkney is purely ceremonial, and mostly in Old Norse, for example the Shetland motto, which is ''{{lang|nrn|[[wikt:með lögum skal land byggja|Með lögum skal land byggja]]}}'' ("with law shall land be built") which is the same motto used by the Icelandic police force and inspired by the old Norwegian [[Frostathing Law]].

Another example of the use of Norse/Norn in the [[Northern Isles]] can be found in the names of ferries:
* [[NorthLink Ferries]] has ships named [[MV Hamnavoe|MV ''Hamnavoe'']] (after the old name for [[Stromness]]), and [[MV Hjaltland|MV ''Hjaltland'']] ([[Shetland]]) and [[MV Hrossey|MV ''Hrossey'']] ("Horse Island", an old name for [[Mainland, Orkney]]).
* The Yell Sound [[Ferry]] sails from [[Ulsta]] on the [[island]] to [[Toft, Shetland|Toft]] on the [[Shetland Mainland]]. The service is operated by two ferries—''Daggri'' (Norse for "dawn"), launched in 2003 and ''Dagalien'' (Norse for "dusk"), launched in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shetland.gov.uk/ferries/fleet/newyellsound.asp#Dagalien |title=The Fleet&amp;nbsp;– New Yell Sound Ferries |publisher=[[Shetland Islands Council]] |accessdate=2008-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norn words are still used to describe many of the colour and pattern variations in the native sheep of Shetland and Orkney, which survive as the [[Shetland (sheep)|Shetland]] and [[North Ronaldsay (sheep)|North Ronaldsay]] breeds.  Icelandic uses similar words for many of the same colour variations in [[Icelandic sheep]].&lt;ref name="Adalsteinsson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheep-isle.dk/Shetland/shetland1000.htm#_ftnref9 |title=1000 Years of Sheep in Shetland |website=Sheep-isle.dk |date= |accessdate=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some enthusiasts who are engaged in developing and disseminating a modern form called Nynorn ("New Norn"), based upon linguistic analysis of the known records and Norse linguistics in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nornlanguage.x10.mx/index.php?intro |title=Norn |accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}
{{nihongo|'''''One Piece'''''|ワンピース|Wan Pīsu|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Eiichiro Oda]]. It has been serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' magazine since July 22, 1997, and has been collected into 90 ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes. The story follows the adventures of [[Monkey D. Luffy]], a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew of pirates, named the [[Straw Hat Pirates]], Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as "One Piece" in order to become the next Pirate King.

The manga has been adapted into an [[original video animation]] (OVA) produced by [[Production I.G]] in 1998, and an [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]], which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed thirteen animated feature films, one OVA and eleven television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising such as a trading card game and [[List of One Piece video games|numerous video games]]. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by [[Viz Media]] and in Australia by [[Madman Entertainment]]. The anime series was licensed by [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] for an English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by [[Funimation]] in 2007.

''One Piece'' has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. The official website for Eiichiro Oda's ''One Piece'' manga announced that the manga has set a ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]]'' for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". As of May 2018, the manga has sold over 440 million copies worldwide, making it the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history. It became the best-selling manga for the tenth consecutive year in 2017.

==Synopsis==
===Premise===
{{see also|List of One Piece characters}}
&lt;!-- This is a general overview of the series; please don't add additional information that's not relevant to the series POV. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Note, as the manga is the PRIMARY work, this plot summary should be written for the manga, not the anime. --&gt;
The series focuses on [[Monkey D. Luffy]], a young man who, inspired by his childhood idol and powerful pirate [["Red Haired" Shanks]], sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the famed treasure One Piece and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the {{nihongo|[[Straw Hat Pirates]]|麦わら海賊団篇|Mugiwara Kaizoku-danhen}}, Luffy rescues and befriends a swordsman named [[Roronoa Zoro]], and they head off in search of the One Piece. They are joined in their journey by [[Nami (One Piece)|Nami]], a navigator and thief; [[Usopp]], a sniper and a liar; and [[Vinsmoke Sanji|Sanji]], a womanizing chef. They acquire a ship named the ''Going Merry'' and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including [[Tony Tony Chopper]], a doctor and anthropomorphized reindeer; [[Nico Robin]], an archaeologist and former assassin; [[Franky (One Piece)|Franky]], a cyborg shipwright; [[Brook (One Piece)|Brook]], a skeletal musician; and [[Jimbei (One Piece)|Jimbei]], a fishman helmsman; and they also acquire a new ship named the ''Thousand Sunny''.

The world of ''One Piece'' is populated by humans and many other races such as "[[List of piscine and amphibian humanoids|fishmen]]" (a race of fish/human hybrids, similar to [[Merman|mermen]] and [[mermaid]]s), dwarves, Minkmen (a race of humanoid animals), and [[Giant (mythology)|giants]]. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the {{nihongo|Red Line|{{ruby|赤い土の大陸|レッドライン}}|Reddo Rain}}, which is also the only continent in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|first=Eiichiro|last=Oda|chapter=ヤルキマン·マングローブ|series=One Piece|volume=51|script-title=ja:[[11人の超新星]]|isbn=978-4-08-874563-3|date=September 2008|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{nihongo4|Grand Line|{{ruby|偉大なる航路|グランドライン}}|Gurando Rain}}, a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: {{nihongo4|North Blue|{{ruby|北の海|ノースブルー}}|Nōsu Burū}}, {{nihongo4|East Blue|{{ruby|東の海|イーストブルー}}|Īsuto Burū}}, {{nihongo4|West Blue|{{ruby|西の海|ウェストブルー}}|Uesuto Burū}} and {{nihongo4|South Blue|{{ruby|南の海|サウスブルー}}|Sausu Burū}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|first=Eiichiro|last=Oda|chapter=リヴァースマウンテン|page=36|series=One Piece|volume=12|script-title=ja:[[伝説は始まった]]|isbn=4-08-872822-X|date=February 2000|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called {{nihongo4|Calm Belts|{{ruby|凪の帯|カームベルト}}|kāmu beruto}}, similar to [[horse latitudes]], which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called {{nihongo4|sea kings|海王類|kaiōrui|lit.

* {{nihongo4|Paramecia|{{ruby|超人系|パラミシア}}|Paramishia|"superhuman type"}} is a category of fruits that give the user superhuman abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Shueisha|first=Eiichiro|last=Oda|page=146|series=One Piece|volume=35|title=[[「水の都」ウォーターセブン]]|isbn=4-08-873638-9|date=August 2004|language=french }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{nihongo4|Zoan|{{ruby|動物系|ゾオン}}|Zoon|"animal type"}} fruits allow the user to fully or partially transform into a specific animal. As well as real-life animals, some Zoan fruits allow the user to transform into mythical creatures. Through an unknown technique developed by Dr. Vegapunk, certain items can "eat" a Devil Fruit like Mr. 4's Bazooka Lassoo, Spandam's sword Funkfreed, Caesar Clown's pet slime Slimy, and non-canon items like Shuzo's bazooka Alpacacino and Patrick Redfield's pen Pato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Shueisha|first=Eiichiro|last=Oda|chapter=Rumble!!|pages=71–72|series=One Piece|volume=17|script-title=ja:[[ヒルルクの桜]]|isbn=4-08-873073-9|date=February 2001|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When even partially submerged in sea water, they lose all their strength and coordination, although some abilities remain. For example, Luffy is still  able to stretch after being totally submerged. Moving water, such as rain or waves, does not have this effect. When a Devil Fruit user dies, the powers reincarnate into a new Devil Fruit. For unknown reasons, Devil Fruit users cannot eat a second Devil Fruit because it would cause their bodies to burst, although Blackbeard managed to get a second Devil Fruit power through an unknown method. Devil Fruit powers can be in a stage called "Awakened", where the user can turn anything around them, besides their own bodies, into what their Devil Fruit power is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Shueisha|first=Eiichiro|last=Oda|chapter=解放|page=177|series=One Piece|volume=19|script-title=ja:[[反乱]]|isbn=4-08-873133-6|date=July 2001|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haki====
{{nihongo|Haki|覇気||lit. "Ambition"}} is a latent ability that every living being in the world of ''One Piece'' possesses; very few manage to awaken it, and even fewer master it. There are three varieties of Haki: {{nihongo4|Color of Observation or Mantra|見聞色の覇気|Kenbunshoku no Haki}} allows one to sense the presence of other beings and to have a form of limited precognition. (This is a great advantage in combat because the user can foresee his opponent's attacks). {{nihongo4|Color of Arms|武装色の覇気|Busōshoku no Haki}} allows one to envelop body parts and even inanimate forms with a force akin to an [[Iron shirt|invisible armor]] that possesses defensive and offensive properties. It also allows one to inflict harm upon Devil Fruit users. The rare {{nihongo4|Color of the Conquering King|覇王色の覇気|Haōshoku no Haki}} is an ability that, unlike the other two Haki, only a few gifted people have. (If a person is not gifted, then no matter how much they train they will never be able to use it). The Color of the Conquering King enables one to overpower the will of the weak-willed. It can be used to mind-control or even render the victim unconscious. Note that strong willed people can withstand, or even completely ignore, the effects of this Haki, even if they do not possess this ability themselves. This Haki can also have physical impacts, such as causing tremors and destruction to the user's surrounding area. It is shown that when it is used too much Haki will stop working for certain periods of time, so it can't be in use constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=3D2Y|publisher=Shueisha|first=Eiichiro|last=Oda|chapter=597|pages=12–15|series=One Piece|volume=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
While working as an assistant to [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]], Oda began writing ''One Piece'' in 1996.&lt;ref name="wanted"&gt;{{cite book|language=Japanese |publisher=Shueisha|last=Oda|first=Eiichiro|title=Wanted!|page=202|isbn=978-4-08-872631-1|date=November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started as two [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] stories entitled ''Romance Dawn''&lt;ref name="wanted" /&gt;—which would later be used as the title for ''One Piece''{{'}}s first chapter and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy, and included elements that would appear later in the main series. The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in ''[[Akamaru Jump]]'' and later in ''One Piece Red''. The second was published in the 41st issue of ''Weekly Shōnen Jump'' in 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda's short story collection, ''Wanted!''.&lt;ref name="RomanceDawn Animated"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-07-10/one-piece-prototype-romance-dawn-to-be-animated |title=One Piece's 'Prototype' Romance Dawn to be Animated |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oda revealed that he originally planned ''One Piece'' to last five years, and that he had already planned the ending. However, he found it would take longer than he had expected.&lt;ref name="SBS1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Oda |first=Eiichiro |title=[[海賊 VS CP9]] |series=One Piece |date=July 2006 |publisher=Shueisha |language=Japanese |isbn=4-08-874127-7 |page=126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.&lt;ref name="Yomiuri-Oda"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/book/news/20070725bk07.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080621032029/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/book/news/20070725bk07.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 21, 2008 |title=「ONE PIECE」尾田栄一郎さんに聞く |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |first=Kanta |last=Ishida |date=July 25, 2007 |work=Yomiuri Shimbun |location=Japan |language=Japanese }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When creating a Devil Fruit, Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire; he added that he does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit's appearance would entice one to eat it.&lt;ref name="FansChat32"&gt;"Fans Chat with Oda Sensei!" Shonen Jump #84. Volume 7, Issue 12. December 2009. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in ''[[kanji]]'' are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of Luffy, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, and Franky's techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are designed as jokes; some of them look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature move is ''Onigiri'', which is written as ''demon cut'' but is pronounced the same as [[onigiri|''rice ball'']] in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these ''kanji'' readings in the anime since they "might have cut down the laughs by about half".&lt;ref name="KonosukeUdaEisakuInoueInterview"/&gt; Nevertheless, [[Konosuke Uda]], the director, said that he believes that the creators "made the anime pretty close to the manga".&lt;ref name="KonosukeUdaEisakuInoueInterview"&gt;{{cite magazine|date=December 2007|magazine=[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]|volume=5|issue=12|page=198|publisher=Viz Media|title=2 Anime directors' Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oda was "sensitive" about how his work would be translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistswriters/a/JasonThompson.htm|title=Interview: Jason Thompson: Manga Editor and Author of Manga: The Complete Guide|first=Deb|last=Aoki|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=October 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602191730/http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistswriters/a/JasonThompson.htm|archivedate=June 2, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, the English version of the ''One Piece'' manga uses one [[onomatopoeia]] for multiple onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For instance, "''saaa''" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and "''zaaa''" (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as "fshhhhhhh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=September 2009|magazine=[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]|volume=7|issue=9|page=228|publisher=Viz Media|title=Sensitiveness of Translation for Onomatopoeia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|first=Eiichiro|last=Oda|page=108|series=One Piece|volume=52|script-title=ja:[[ロジャーとレイリー]]|isbn=978-4-08-874602-9|date=December 2008|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a reader asked Oda who Nami is in love with, he answered that there will not likely be any references to romance, since he believes the series' intended demographic is not interested.&lt;ref name="FansChat33"&gt;"Fans Chat with Oda Sensei!"

===Festival films and original video animation===
''One Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack!'' was produced by [[Production I.G]] for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by [[Gorō Taniguchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Oda, Eiichiro | year=2007 | title=One Piece 10th Treasures | publisher=Shueisha | language=Japanese | page=30 | authorlink=Eiichiro Oda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are forced to fight Ganzack once more to prevent him from destroying the island.

A second film, ''One Piece: Romance Dawn Story'', was produced by [[Toei Animation]] in July 2008 for the Jump Super Anime Tour. It is 34 minutes in length and based on the first version of ''Romance Dawn''.&lt;ref name="Jumpfesta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jumpfesta.com/anime/anime-info/anime_op.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822023326/http://www.jumpfesta.com/anime/anime-info/anime_op.html|archivedate=August 22, 2008|title=Jump Super Anime Tour&amp;nbsp;— Great Gathering of Jump-Heroes |accessdate=July 28, 2008|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RomanceDawn Animated" /&gt; It includes the Straw Hat Pirates up to Brook and their second ship, the ''Thousand Sunny''. In search for food for his crew, Luffy arrives at a port after defeating a pirate named Crescent Moon Gally on the way. There he meets a girl named Silk, who was abandoned by attacking pirates as a baby and raised by the mayor. Her upbringing causes her to value the town as her "treasure". The villagers mistake Luffy for Gally and capture him just as the real Gally returns. Gally throws Luffy in the water and plans to destroy the town, but Silk saves him and Luffy pursues Gally. His crew arrives to help him, and with their help he recovers the treasure for the town, acquires food, and destroys Gally's ship.

The film was later released as a triple feature DVD with ''[[Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!]]'' and ''[[Tegami Bachi#Anime|Tegami Bachi: Light and Blue Night]]'', that was available only though a mail-in offer exclusively to Japanese residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-12-22/new-db-tegami-bachi-romance-dawn-anime-dvd-offered |title=New DB, Tegami Bachi, Romance Dawn Anime DVD Offered |accessdate=December 12, 2012 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''One Piece Film Strong World: Episode 0'' [[original video animation]] adapts the manga's special "Chapter 0", which shows how things were before and after the death of Roger. It received a limited release of three thousand DVDs as a collaboration with the [[House Foods]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-11-02/eichiro-oda-one-piece-episode-0-to-be-animated|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201133305/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-11-02/eichiro-oda-one-piece-episode-0-to-be-animated|archivedate=February 1, 2017|title=Eiichiro Oda's One Piece Episode 0 Manga to be Animated|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 2, 2009|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2004, [[4Licensing Corporation|4Kids Entertainment]] acquired the license for distribution of ''One Piece'' in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2004-06-08/4kids-announces-one-piece|title=4Kids Announces One Piece|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=June 8, 2004|accessdate=June 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4Kids contracted Viz Media to handle home video distribution. 4Kids' in-house musicians wrote a new background score and theme song nicknamed "Pirate Rap". 4Kids' dub mandated edits for [[Editing of anime in American distribution|content and length]], which reduced the first 143 episodes into 104.&lt;ref&gt;''One Piece'' [[4Kids Entertainment|4Kids]] dub, episodes 1-104 (1-143 uncut)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, 4Kids originally created an English version of the first opening theme, "We Are!"&lt;ref name="Anime News Network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2005-04-24/alfred-r-kahn|title=Alfred R.

On July 22, 2010, an interview with [[Anime News Network]] and Mark Kirk, senior vice-president of digital media for 4Kids Entertainment, revealed that 4Kids acquired ''One Piece'' as part of a package deal with other anime, and that the company did not screen the series before licensing it. However, once 4Kids realized ''One Piece'' was not appropriate for their intended demographic, the company decided to edit it into a more child-oriented series until they had an opportunity to legally drop the license. Kirk said the experience of producing ''One Piece'' "ruined the company's reputation". Since then, 4Kids established a stricter set of guidelines, checks, and balances to determine which anime the company acquires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anncast/2010-07-22|title=Kirk Up Your Ears|publisher=Anime News Network|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatrical films===
{{main article|List of One Piece films}}
Thirteen animated theatrical films based on the ''One Piece'' series have been released in Japan. The films are typically released in March in accordance with the spring vacation of Japanese schools.&lt;ref name="10th Movie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-12-31/2009-one-piece-movie-to-mark-anime-10th-anniversary|title=One Piece Movie 10 tentative information|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-07-28/funi-adds-seikishi-yamato/r-one-piece/strong-world-fairy-tail-film-akira|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127233726/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-07-28/funi-adds-seikishi-yamato/r-one-piece/strong-world-fairy-tail-film-akira|archivedate=November 27, 2016|title=Funi Adds Seikishi, Yamato: R, One Piece: Strong World, Fairy Tail Film, Akira (Updated)|publisher=Anime News Network|date=July 28, 2012|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-04-07/funimation-to-release-one-piece-film/z-on-home-video|title=Funimation to Release One Piece Film: Z on Home Video|publisher=Anime News Network|date=April 7, 2014|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen Divers of Anime News Network comments in 2003 that the art style ''One Piece'' employs "initially seems very cartoonish with much of the character designs showing more North American influence than that from its Japanese origins". Adding that the "artwork and settings come across as timeless in their presentation". He also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama (''Dragon Ball'') shines through in Oda's style of writing with its "huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor" and that, in ''One Piece'', he "manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down by overly complicated plots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 24, 2009|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/one-piece/manga|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303034730/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/one-piece/manga|archivedate=March 3, 2017|date=February 10, 2003|first=Allen|last=Divers|title=One Piece manga review|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Silverman of the same site stated that one of the series' strengths is to "blend action, humor, and heavy fare together" and praised the art, but stated that the panels could get too crowded for easy reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/one-piece/gn-63|title=One Piece GN 63–35 – Review|publisher=Anime News Network|date=November 18, 2012|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website ''activeAnime'' describes the artwork in ''One Piece'' as "wonderfully quirky and full of expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Veira |first=Margaret |url=http://activeanime.com/html/2009/01/13/one-piece-vol-20-showdown-at-alubarna-advance-review/ &lt;!-- http://www.activeanime.com/html/content/view/4429/36/ --&gt; |title=One Piece Vol. 20: Showdown at Alubarna (Advance Review) |work=Active Anime |publisher=&lt;!-- If different from 'work'. --&gt; |date=January 13, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Splashcomics'' comments that Oda's "pleasantly bright and dynamic" ({{lang-de|link=no|"angenehm hell und dynamisch"}}) art style suits the story's "funny and exciting" (German: "witzigen und ... spannenden") atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splashcomics.de/php/rezensionen/rezension/67|first=Mario|last=Vuk|language=German|publisher=Splashpages|title=Comic-Besprechung – One Piece 14|date=May 20, 2002|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the second DVD release of 4Kids Entertainment's dub, Todd Douglass, Jr. of [[DVD Talk]] called its adaptation a "shabby treatment" resulting in an "arguably less enjoyable rendition".

'''The Oriental Institute in Sarajevo''' ({{lang-bs|Orijentalni institut u Sarajevu / Оријентални институт у Сарајеву}}) is an academic institute in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was founded in 1950 by the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is part of the [[University of Sarajevo]]. but it suffered significant destruction in 1992 during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]].

==1992 shelling==
Its premises, research library and complete manuscript collection (more than 2,000 codices and 15,000 other archival material) were deliberately destroyed in shelling on May 18, 1992 by Serb forces around the [[Siege of Sarajevo|besieged city of Sarajevo]]. According to interviews with eyewitnesses, the building had been hit with a barrage of incendiary munitions, fired from positions on the hills overlooking the town center. No other buildings in the densely built neighborhood were hit. The Institute, which occupied the top floors of a large, four-storey office block on the corner of Veljka Cubrilovica Street and Marshal Tito Boulevard ([[Centar Municipality, Sarajevo|Sarajevo Centar]] municipality), was completely burned out, its collections destroyed. 

The manuscript collection of the Oriental institute was one of the richest collections of Oriental manuscripts worldwide. These manuscripts over centuries were written in the wide areas of the East to serve worldwide as life manuals for the people. 

Losses also included 5,263 bound manuscripts in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Hebrew and local ''[[arebica]]'' - ''(Bosnian in Arabic script)'', as well as tens of thousands of Ottoman-era documents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11233">A '''public viewing area''' is a space set aside for members of the public to safely view sites of interest, such as [[airport]]s, [[railroad]]s, [[construction site]]s or other facilities.  Sometimes they are known as [[visitor center]]s or '''interpretive sites'''.

In locations that have inherent dangers and would not normally be accessible to the public, viewing areas provide a way to satiate the public curiosity without exposing inordinate risk.  Many sites contain descriptive signs, viewing pavilions, picnic facilities, toilets, radio receivers and brochures.

== Examples ==

*[[Homewood, Illinois]] has built a public viewing platform at the south end of the [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] (former [[Illinois Central]]) [[Markham, Illinois|Markham]] Yard.  This location is on the east side of the tracks and is connected by a tunnel under the tracks to the Homewood [[Metra]] / [[Amtrak]] station.  Near the station is a static display of an [[Illinois Central|IC]] [[GP10]] and [[caboose]].  There is a [[Starbucks]] coffee shop on the other side of Harwood Avenue from the viewing platform and there are several restaurants within an easy walk in downtown Homewood.

=== Locks and dams ===
Many [[lock (water transport)|lock]] and [[dam]] facilities along the various rivers in the US have public viewing areas, including:

* [[Lock and Dam No. 15]] in [[Rock Island, Illinois]] on the [[Mississippi River]]
* [[Olmsted Locks and Dam]] in [[Olmsted, Illinois]] on the [[Ohio River]]
* [[Lock and Dam No. 12]]  in [[Bellevue, Iowa]] on the [[Mississippi River]]
* [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] near [[Lewiston, New York]], on the [[Niagara River]], has an extensive interpretive center known as the [http://niagarafallsupclose.com/american-attractions/niagara-power-vista/ Niagara Power Vista].
* [[Hoover Dam]] near [[Boulder City, Nevada]], on the [[Colorado River]], has an extremely large interpretive center and tour facility.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/service/DamTour.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Parker Dam]] near [[Parker, Arizona]], on the [[Colorado River]], has a basic viewing area with views of the dam and interpretive signs.

=== Construction sites ===
These are, by necessity, often temporary in nature.  Harkening back to the "[[knothole]]s" in fences used by passersby to view the progress of a site, some large projects provide a glimpse into the construction by intentionally placing viewing ports in fences, often geared toward selling space in the final project.

=== Sports venues ===
Some stadiums provide locations where the public can view games in progress without entering the stadium or paying for an admission. [[AT&amp;T Park]] in [[San Francisco, California]], home of the [[San Francisco Giants]] has such an area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4161">A '''shoulder strap''' is a [[strap]] over a shoulder. They are often affixed to women's dresses to support its weight or as part of its style. The term is also applied to carrying bags.

==Dress shoulder strap==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Dress shoulder straps are a length of fabric, usually in pairs, used to support [[clothing]], especially women's clothing, such as a [[dress]], [[camisole]], [[apron]] or [[brassiere]]. Shoulder straps such as these are usually made of the same material as the garment, and may be quite flimsy, as they are normally not expected to support much weight.

The shoulder straps on some dresses may be very thin, in which case they may be called a [[spaghetti strap]] (also called "noodle strap").&lt;!-- Please do not re-add "mens and womens" - see talk --&gt; These are common in clothing such as [[camisole]]s, [[cocktail dress]]es, and [[evening gown]]s.

Some institutions ban spaghetti strap dresses and bare-shoulder [[strapless dress]]es on grounds of [[modesty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fellowshipbaptistyouth.org/service/dress.htm Fellowship Baptist Church - Dress Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210192918/http://www.fellowshipbaptistyouth.org/service/dress.htm |date=2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beavton.k12.or.us/whitford/Dress%20Code.html Whitford Dress Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206211959/http://www.beavton.k12.or.us/whitford/Dress%20Code.html |date=2009-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military shoulder strap ==
[[File:Serbian Scout Uniform 2007.jpg|thumb|(Not military but similar) shoulder straps on a scout uniform.]]
Many [[military uniform]] shirts, jackets, tunics, or greatcoats feature shoulder straps. They were originally designed to keep [[back pack]]s, ammunition pouches or bayonets from slipping off the shoulder. They often display badges of rank, [[shoulder mark]]s, regimental insignia or [[epaulette]]s.

==Carrier shoulder strap==
[[Image:Berghaus Vulcan.jpg|thumb|left|A carrier shoulder strap on a [[backpack]]]]
A carrier shoulder strap is a length of fabric or other flexible material (such as leather, vinyl, rubber), used to suspend an item, often of some weight, from the shoulder(s). The strap may be worn slung over one shoulder or across the body. In the interest of comfort, they often have some manner of padding near the middle, where the strap rests directly against the shoulder or neck. Such items include [[Handbag|purses]], [[guitar]]s, [[rifle]]s, etc. In the case of rifles and other such weaponry, the shoulder strap is usually referred to as a ''[[Sling (firearms)|sling]]''. Shoulder straps may also be used in pairs on such items as a [[backpack]] or a [[baby carrier]]; the straps are worn one over each shoulder, and the item so carried is centred on the back or chest. Some camera strap manufacturers, such as [[BlackRapid]], design their straps to fit over both shoulders allowing two cameras to rest at hip level.&lt;ref name=GM&gt;{{Citation |author=Mark Wilson |date=May 20, 2009 |url=https://gizmodo.com/5262704/rs-dr%201-double-strap-allows-you-to-dual-wield-slrs |title=RS DR-1 Double Strap Allows You to Dual Wield SLRs |publisher=GIZMODO |accessdate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of such straps frees the hands for other use.

[[File:Dumb bargain.jpg|thumb|Chinese and Mongolian mode of dumb bargain]]
'''Silent trade''', also called '''silent barter''', '''dumb barter''' ("dumb" here used in its old meaning of "mute"), or '''depot trade''', is a method by which [[Merchant|traders]] who cannot speak each other's [[language]] can trade without talking. ''Group A'' would leave trade goods in a prominent position and signal, by [[gong]], fire, or drum for example, that they had left goods. ''Group B'' would then arrive at the spot, examine the goods and deposit their trade goods or money that they wanted to exchange and withdraw. ''Group A'' would then return and either accept the trade by taking the goods from ''Group B'' or withdraw again leaving ''Group B'' to add to or change out items to create an equal value. The trade ends when ''Group A'' accepts ''Group B's'' offer and removes the offered goods leaving ''Group B'' to remove the original goods.

This system was used in many parts of ancient [[Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Silent trading was mainly used during the period 500 to 1500. The practice was also well established between tribes in Africa in their trade with [[India]]. [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] describes this practiced in [[Azania]], where officials from [[Axum]] traded for [[gold]] with [[beef]].&lt;ref&gt;Cited in J. Innes Miller, ''The Spice Trade of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford: University Press, 1969), pp.&amp;nbsp;167f. Although Miller offers an extensive passage in translation, he does not provide the source for his quotation.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] of [[Portugal]] recorded this practice when he occupied [[Ceuta]] in 1415.

In [[West Africa]] gold mined south of the [[Sahel]] was traded for salt mined in the desert. The salt from the desert was needed by the people of Sahel to flavor and preserve their food and the gold had obvious value, especially in trading with the European people. Because of this trade, cities grew and flourished and parts of West Africa became commercial centers. West Africa produced large amounts of gold until about 1500 AD. The communication in this gold-for-salt was carried out using drums.&lt;ref&gt;''Holt World History: The Human Journey''. p.&amp;nbsp;193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Silent trade might be used because of an inability to speak the other traders' language, or to protect the secrets of where the [[Value (economics)|valuable]] gold and salt came from.

Silent [[barter]]ing has been used since ancient times, such as the ancient [[Ghana Empire]]. The Ghanaian salt traders would leave pounds of salt by the [[Niger River|Niger river]] and the gold traders would leave a fair amount of gold in turn.

==Procedure==
To perform a silent trade, one group of traders would go to a specific location, leave their trading goods and then withdraw to a distance. Then play a drum to signal the other traders that a silent trade was taking place. The other group of traders would then approach and inspect the goods (most commonly [[salt]] or [[gold]]). If the goods met with approval, the second group would then take the goods, leave their own goods in return, and depart. This system of trading was used in particular in ancient [[Ghana]]. It was also used among the [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushites]] and the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumites]].

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] wrote about the gold trade with Ghana and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]]: "The Carthaginians also tell us that they trade with a race of men who live in a part of [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] beyond the [[Pillars of Hercules]]. On reaching this country, they unload their goods, arrange them tidily along the beach, and then, returning to their boats, raise a smoke. Seeing the smoke, the natives come down to the beach, place on the ground a certain quantity of gold in exchange for the goods, and go off again to a distance. The Carthaginians then come ashore and take a look at the gold; and if they think it represents a fair price for their wares, they collect it and go away; if, on the other hand, it seems too little, they go back aboard and wait, and the natives come and add to the gold until they are satisfied. There is perfect honesty on both sides; the Carthaginians never touch the gold until it equals in value what they have offered for sale, and the natives never touch the goods until the gold has been taken away."

==Banyan merchants==
W.S.W. Ruschenberger, M.D., in [[Stone Town|Zanzibar]] in 1835, describes [[Banyan merchants]], then cites "Establecimientos ultramarinos. Tomo III. Madrid 1786"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Raynal |first= abbé Guillaume-Thomas-François |authorlink= Guillaume Thomas François Raynal |title= Historia política de los establecimientos ultramarinos de las naciones europeas, Volume 3 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9LQGAAAAQAAJ |year= 1785 |publisher= Antonio de Sancha |location= Madrid |language= Spanish |oclc= 14135206}}&lt;/ref&gt; in writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;....A very short time sufficed them to transact the most important business. They usually dealt in [[bazaar]]s; the vender told the price of his goods in a subdued voice and in few words; the purchaser replied by taking his hand, and by a certain manner of doubling and extending the fingers, explained what abatement he wished in the price. The bargain was often concluded without speaking a word; and, to ratify it, the hand was again taken in token of its inviolability....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Such were the Banyans three centuries gone by, and we have reason to think, they have not been entirely changed.&lt;ref name="Rusch"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ruschenberger |first= William Samuel Waithman |authorlink= William Ruschenberger |title= A Voyage Round the World: Including an Embassy to Muscat and Siam in 1835, 1836 and 1837. |url= https://archive.org/stream/avoyageroundwor00ruscgoog#page/n37/mode/2up |year= 1837 |publisher= Harper &amp; brothers |oclc= 12492287 |pages= 34&amp;ndash;5 |chapter= Chapter IV.

"'''The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas'''" is a 1973 work of [[short story|short]] [[philosophical fiction]] by American writer [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]. With deliberately both vague and vivid descriptions, the narrator depicts a [[midsummer festival|summer festival]] in the [[utopian]] city of Omelas, whose prosperity depends on the perpetual misery of a single child.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack, Charlotte, ''Ursula K. Le Guin'', (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984), page 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Le Guin's piece was originally published in ''[[New Dimensions 3]]'', a hard-cover science fiction anthology edited by [[Robert Silverberg]], in October 1973. It was reprinted in Le Guin's ''[[The Wind's Twelve Quarters]]'' in 1975, and has been frequently anthologized elsewhere.&lt;ref name="ISFDB"&gt;Internet Speculative Fiction Database. [http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?58836 Bibliography: The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas].&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also appeared as an independently published, 31-page hardcover book for young adults in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Le Guin, Ursula K. 1993, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas/oclc/25282554/editions?referer=di&amp;editionsView=true ''The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas''], Creative Education, {{ISBN |978-0-88682501-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was republished in the second volume of the short-story anthology ''[[The Unreal and the Real]]'' in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Le Guin, Ursula K. 2014, ''The Unreal and The Real'' '''2''', Gollancz, {{ISBN |978-1-47320285-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The only chronological element of the work is that it begins by describing the first day of summer in Omelas, a shimmering city of unbelievable [[happiness]] and delight. In Omelas, the summer solstice is celebrated with a glorious festival and a race featuring young people on horseback. The vibrant festival atmosphere, however, seems to be an everyday characteristic of the blissful community, whose citizens, though limited in their advanced technology to communal (rather than private) resources, are still intelligent, sophisticated, and cultured. Omelas has no kings, soldiers, priests, or slaves. The specific socio-politico-economic setup of the community is not mentioned, but the narrator merely explains that the reader cannot be sure of every particular.

Self-admittedly, the [[unreliable narrator|uncertain narrator]] reflects that "Omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time. Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion, for certainly I cannot suit you all." 

Everything about Omelas is so abundantly pleasing that the narrator decides the reader is not yet truly convinced of its existence and so elaborates upon one final element of the city: its one atrocity. The city's constant state of serenity and splendor requires that a single unfortunate child be kept in perpetual filth, darkness, and misery.

Once citizens are old enough to know the truth, most, though initially shocked and disgusted, ultimately acquiesce to this one injustice that secures the happiness of the rest of the city. However, a few citizens, young and old, silently walk away from the city, and no one knows where they go. The writing ends with "The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas."

==Background and themes==
Le Guin stated that the city's name is pronounced ''"OH-meh-lahss"''.&lt;ref name="real-unreal-introduction"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le Guinn|first1=Ursula K.|title=The Unreal and the Real: Selected Stories of Ursula K. Le Guin. Volume Two: Outer Space, Inner Lands|date=2012|publisher=Small Beer Press|location=Easthampton, MA|isbn=9781618730350|page=iv|ref=real-unreal-introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Guin hit upon the name of the town on seeing a road sign for [[Salem, Oregon]], in a car mirror. "[… People ask me] 'Where ''do'' you get your ideas from, Ms. Le Guin?' From forgetting Dostoyevsky and reading road signs backwards, naturally.  Where else?"&lt;ref name="Kennedy"/&gt;

"The central idea of this psychomyth, the [[scapegoat]]", writes Le Guin, "turns up in [[Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov|Brothers Karamazov]]'', and several people have asked me, rather suspiciously, why I gave the credit to [[William James]]. The fact is, I haven't been able to re-read Dostoyevsky, much as I loved him, since I was twenty-five, and I'd simply forgotten he used the idea. But when I met it in James' '[[The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life]],' it was with a shock of recognition."

The quote from William James is:

{{Quote|Or if the hypothesis were offered us of a world in which Messrs. [[Charles Fourier|Fourier]]'s and [[Edward Bellamy|Bellamy]]'s and [[William Morris|Morris]]'s [[utopia]]s should all be outdone, and millions kept permanently happy on the one simple condition that a certain lost soul on the far-off edge of things should lead a life of lonely torture, what except a sceptical and independent sort of emotion can it be which would make us immediately feel, even though an impulse arose within us to clutch at the happiness so offered, how hideous a thing would be its enjoyment when deliberately accepted as the fruit of such a bargain?&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;Kennedy, X.J., and Dana Gioia (ed.): ''An Introduction to Fiction'', 8th ed., page 274. Longman, 2004. {{ISBN|0-321-08531-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William James|James, William]]. "[http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/American/mp&amp;ml.htm The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life]". April 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Introducing the short work in her 2012 collection ''The Unreal and the Real, Volume Two'', Le Guin noted that ''The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas'' "has a long and happy career of being used by teachers to upset students and make them argue fiercely about morality."&lt;ref name="real-unreal-introduction"/&gt;

It has been at times analyzed as a [[postmodernist]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agosta|first1=Vincent|title=Returning to Omelas: A formal Analysis of Ursula K.

'''''The Social Seminar''''' is a series of educational films for adults produced by the Extension Media Center of the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] in the early 1970s.  The series was executive produced by [[Gary Schlosser]], an Oscar-nominated producer of short-subject documentaries.  The films were distributed nationally, for example to state educational film offices.  The series was produced for the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] as a "multi-media training series."

Five episodes of ''The Social Seminar'' are known to have been produced: "Bunny," "Guy," "Teddy," "Tom," and "Changing."  Each depicted, in a [[cinema-verite]] style without voiceover or introduction, aspects of the lives of a selected person or family as they dealt with personal, interpersonal and societal change.  The episode "Changing," for example, showed how one man's reevaluation of his life and social standing led to his becoming a "hippie" in the eyes of his family and coworkers; though his home life was enhanced, he found himself increasingly socially isolated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/SocialSe1971 "Social Seminar: Changing (1971)"] Prelinger Archives, archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

The films are now part of the [[Prelinger Archive]] and are available freely online. In June 2011, "Changing" was featured on the [[Turner Classic Movies]] series ''[[TCM Underground]]''.

==In popular culture==
* Electronic music duo [[Boards of Canada]] sampled dialogue from the "Tom" episode of ''The Social Seminar'' in their song "Chromakey Dreamcoat", from the album ''[[The Campfire Headphase]]''.
* British rock band [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]] sampled dialogue from the "Changing" episode of ''The Social Seminar'' in their song "Fake It", from the album ''[[Wild World (album)|Wild World]]''.

'''''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers''''' is a popular screenwriting textbook by writer [[Christopher Vogler]], focusing on the theory that most stories can be boiled down to a series of narrative structures and character archetypes, described through mythological allegory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BBC Writers Room staff |title=Christopher Vogler's screenwriting workshop |work=[[BBC]] Writers Room|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/insight/insight_vogler.shtml |accessdate=2007-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818162749/http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/insight/insight_vogler.shtml |archivedate=August 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Vogler based this work upon the writings of mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], particularly ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', and holds that all successful films innately adhere to its principles.
The book was very well received upon its release, and is often featured in recommended reading lists for student screenwriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Exposure staff| title = Recommended Reading

==History==
The book stems from a seven-page studio memo, "A Practical Guide to The Hero with a Thousand Faces",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/atheist2/hero.htm | title=A Practical Guide to The Hero with a Thousand Faces | author=Vogler, Christopher}} An online copy of the memo.&lt;/ref&gt; based on Campbell's work, which Vogler wrote while working for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]].
An earlier edition, ''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Storytellers and Screenwriters'', was published in 1992. Vogler revised the book for a second release in 1998 and changed the title to ''The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers''. The third edition, published in 2007, included a new introduction, new artwork and analysis of recent, popular motion pictures.

==Title==
The title of the book was influenced by a number of sources. The first came from Campbell's text, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''.  Later, in the 1980s, two documentaries would introduce the phrase, ''The Hero's Journey'' into popular discourse.  The first, released in 1987, ''[[The Hero's Journey|The Hero's Journey: The World of Joseph Campbell]]'' was accompanied by a 1990 companion book, ''[[The Hero's Journey|The Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work]]''.  The second was  [[Bill Moyers]]' series of seminal interviews with Campbell, released in 1988 as the documentary (and companion book) ''[[The Power of Myth]]''.

==Summary of Content==

===The Archetypes===
The first part of the book describes eight major character archetypes in detail.&lt;ref name="Writer’s"&gt;The Writer’s Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers, Third Edition, Volger, Christopher, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Those are:
#'''Hero''': someone who is willing to sacrifice his own needs on behalf of others
#'''Mentor''': all the characters who teach and protect heroes and give them gifts
#'''Threshold Guardian''': a menacing face to the hero, but if understood, they can be overcome
#'''Herald''': a force that brings a new challenge to the hero
#'''Shapeshifter''': characters who change constantly from the hero's point of view
#'''Shadow''': character who represents the energy of the dark side
#'''Ally''': someone who travels with the hero through the journey, serving  variety of functions
#'''Trickster''': embodies the energies of mischief and desire for change

===Stages of the Journey===
The second part describes the twelve stages of the Hero's journey.&lt;ref name="Writer’s" /&gt; The stages are:
#'''The Ordinary World''': the hero is seen in his/her everyday life
#'''The Call to Adventure''': the initiating incident of the story
#'''Refusal of the Call''': the hero experiences some hesitation to answer the call
#'''Meeting with the Mentor''': the hero gains the supplies, knowledge, and confidence needed to commence the adventure
#'''Crossing the First Threshold''': the hero commits wholeheartedly to the adventure
#'''Tests, Allies and Enemies''': the hero explores the special world, faces trial, and makes friends and enemies
#'''Approach to the Innermost Cave''': the hero nears the center of the story and the special world
#'''The Ordeal''': the hero faces the greatest challenge yet and experiences death and rebirth
#'''Reward''': the hero experiences the consequences of surviving death
#'''The Road Back''': the hero returns to the ordinary world or continues to an ultimate destination
#'''The Resurrection''': the hero experiences a final moment of death and rebirth so he (or she) is pure when he reenters the ordinary world
#'''Return with the Elixir''': the hero returns with something to improve the ordinary world

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1940">'''Trabea''' (plural ''trabeae'') is the name of various pieces of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] clothing. A distinct feature of all trabeae was their color - usually in red or [[Tyrian purple|purple]]. They were formed like a [[toga]] and possibly in some cases like a [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle piece]] and worn by more distinguished members of Roman society.

Such clothing, known as the ''[[Roman triumph|trabea triumphalis]]'' was worn commonly by [[Roman consul|consuls]] in [[Late Antiquity]]. When Emperor [[Justinian II]] formally abolished the title of ''consul'' as a separate entity from the Emperor himself, the ''trabea triumphalis'' was developed into the ''[[loros]]'', which was the worn by the imperial family and senior administrative officials only. When emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] formally abolished the ancient title of consul altogether, the loros persisted until the [[Fall of Constantinople|end of the empire]] as formal, ceremonial [[Byzantine dress|dress]] of the emperors

'''''Twilight''''' is a series of four [[vampire literature|vampire-themed]] [[fantasy]] [[romance novel]]s by American author [[Stephenie Meyer]].

==Plot overview==

===''Twilight''===
{{Main |Twilight (Meyer novel)}}
[[Bella Swan]] moves from [[Phoenix, Arizona]] to live with her father in [[Forks, Washington]] to allow her mother to travel with her new husband, a minor league [[baseball]] player.  After moving to Forks, Bella finds herself involuntarily drawn to a mysterious, handsome boy, [[Edward Cullen]] and eventually learns that he is a member of a vampire family which drinks animal blood rather than human blood.  Edward and Bella fall in love, while James, a sadistic vampire from another coven, is drawn to hunt down Bella. Edward and the other Cullens defend Bella. She escapes to Phoenix, where she is tricked into confronting James, who tries to kill her. She is seriously wounded, but Edward rescues her and they return to Forks.

===''New Moon''===
{{Main|New Moon (novel)}}
Edward and his family leave Forks because he believes he is endangering Bella's life. Bella goes into a depression until she develops a strong friendship with [[Jacob Black]], who she discovers can shape-shift into a wolf. Jacob and the other wolves in his tribe must protect her from Victoria, a vampire seeking to avenge the death of her mate James. Due to a misunderstanding, Edward believes Bella is dead. Edward decides to commit suicide in [[Volterra]], [[Italy]], but is stopped by Bella, who is accompanied by Edward's sister, Alice. They meet with the [[Volturi]], a powerful vampire coven, and are released only on the condition that Bella be turned into a vampire in the near future. Bella and Edward are reunited, and she and the Cullens return to Forks.

===''Eclipse''===
{{Main|Eclipse (Meyer novel)}}
Victoria has created an army of "newborn" vampires to battle the Cullen family and murder Bella for revenge. Meanwhile, Bella is compelled to choose between her relationship with Edward and her friendship with Jacob. Edward's vampire family and Jacob's werewolf pack join forces to successfully destroy Victoria and her vampire army. In the end, Bella chooses Edward's love over Jacob's friendship and agrees to marry Edward.

===''Breaking Dawn''===
{{Main|Breaking Dawn}}

Bella and Edward are married, but their [[honeymoon]] is cut short when Bella discovers that she is pregnant. Her pregnancy progresses rapidly, severely weakening her. She nearly dies giving birth to her and Edward's half-vampire-half-human daughter, [[Renesmee Cullen|Renesmee]]. Edward injects Bella with his venom to save her life and turns her into a vampire. A vampire from another coven sees Renesmee and mistakes her for an "immortal child". She informs the [[Volturi]], as the existence of such beings violates vampire law. The Cullens gather vampire witnesses who can verify that Renesmee is not an immortal child. After an intense confrontation, the Cullens and their witnesses convince the Volturi that the child poses no danger to vampires or their secret, and they are left in peace by the Volturi.

==Main characters==
{{See also|List of Twilight characters}}

* '''[[Bella Swan]]''': The protagonist of the series, teenager Bella is a perpetually clumsy "danger magnet" with dark brown hair and brown eyes. She is often portrayed as having low self-esteem and unable to comprehend Edward's love for her. She has an immunity to supernatural abilities involving the mind, such as Edward's mind-reading ability. After her transformation into a vampire in the saga's fourth installment, Bella acquires the ability to shield both herself and others from "mental harm" from other vampires.
* '''[[Edward Cullen]]''': Edward is a vampire who lives with a coven of like-minded vampires known as the Cullen family, who feed on animals rather than humans. Over the course of the ''Twilight'' series, Edward falls in love with, marries, and then has a child with Bella. At first, Edward feels a mutual hatred toward Jacob Black because of his love for Bella, but in ''Breaking Dawn,'' he comes to see Jacob as a brother and friend. Like some vampires, Edward has a supernatural ability: mind reading. It allows him to read anyone's thoughts within a few miles' radius. Bella is immune to his power as a human, but learns how to lower this "shield" after her transformation to a vampire.
* '''[[Jacob Black]]''': A minor character in the first novel, Jacob is introduced as a member of the [[Quileute people|Quileute]] tribe. He resurfaces in ''[[New Moon (novel)|New Moon]]'' with a larger role as Bella's best friend as she struggles through her depression over losing Edward. Although he is in love with Bella, she initially sees him as just her best friend. He and other tribe members can shape-shift into wolves. In ''[[Eclipse (Meyer novel)|Eclipse]]'' Bella realizes that while she does love Jacob, her feelings for Edward Cullen are stronger. In ''Breaking Dawn'', Jacob finds a [[soul mate]] in Bella and Edward's baby daughter, Renesmee, ridding him of his heartache for Bella.

==Setting==
[[File:Forks WA.jpg|alt=Photo of a three-lane main street in a small town. Visible is a traffic light, sparse traffic, and businesses such as a car lot and gas station.|right|thumb|225px|Forks, Washington]]
The story is set primarily in the town of [[Forks, Washington]], where Bella and her father, [[Charlie Swan (Twilight)|Charlie Swan]], live. Other cities in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] briefly appear in the series or are mentioned, such as [[Port Angeles]], [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], [[Seattle]] and [[La Push]]. Some events in ''[[Twilight (novel)|Twilight]]'' take place in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], where Bella was raised. [[Volterra]], [[Italy]], is featured in ''[[New Moon (novel)|New Moon]]'', when Edward travels there to commit suicide and Bella rushes to save him. [[Jacksonville, Florida]], is mentioned first in ''[[Twilight (novel)|Twilight]]'' and second in ''[[Eclipse (Meyer novel)|Eclipse]]'', when Edward and Bella visit Bella's mother, who has moved there with her new husband. [[Seattle, Washington]], is featured in ''[[Breaking Dawn]]'' when Jacob tries to escape his love for Bella, and when Bella tries to locate a man named J. Jenks. It is also the location of a series of murders committed by newborn vampires in ''[[Eclipse (Meyer novel)|Eclipse]]''. In ''Breaking Dawn'', Bella and Edward spend their honeymoon on a fictional "Isle Esme", purportedly off the coast of Brazil.

==Structure and genre==

The ''Twilight'' series falls under the genre of [[young adult fiction|young adult]], [[fantasy]], and [[Romance novel|romance]], though Meyer categorized her first book, ''Twilight'', as "suspense romance horror comedy".&lt;ref name="Zone"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kirschling |first=Gregory |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20049578,00.html |title=Stephenie Meyer's 'Twilight' Zone |date=August 2, 2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2008 |work=EW.com |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she states that she considers her books as "romance more than anything else".&lt;ref name="Zone"/&gt; The series explores the unorthodox romance between human Bella and vampire Edward, as well as the [[love triangle]] between Bella, Edward, and Jacob, a werewolf.&lt;ref name="Triangle"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meadows |first=Bob |author2=Kari Lydersen  |journal=[[People (magazine)|People]] |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20230708,00.html |volume=70 |issue=10 |title=Stephenie Meyer: Written in Blood |date=September 8, 2008 |accessdate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The books avoid delving into provocative sex, drugs, and harsh swearing because, according to Meyer, "I don't think teens need to read about gratuitous sex."&lt;ref name="Tales"&gt;{{cite news |last=Trachtenberg |first=Jeffrey A.  |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118670290131693667 |title=Booksellers Find Life After Harry In a Vampire Novel |date=August 10, 2007 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The books are written in [[first-person narrative]], primarily through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book and a part of the fourth book being from Jacob's [[Narrative mode|point of view]]. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: &lt;blockquote&gt;I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so ''not'' like the other vampire books out there–[[Anne Rice]]'s and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.&lt;ref name="Bite"&gt;{{cite web |last=Margolis |first=Rick |url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6260602.html |title=Love at First Bite |date=October 1, 2005 |accessdate=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The books are based on the vampire myth, but ''Twilight'' vampires differ in a number of particulars from the general vampire lore. For instance, ''Twilight'' vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;It wasn't until I knew that ''Twilight'' would be published that I began to think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too much different from the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.&lt;ref name="chbookstore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chbookstore.qwestoffice.net/fa2006-08.html |title=BookStories Interview with Stephenie Meyer |date=August 2006 |accessdate=December 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902202116/http://chbookstore.qwestoffice.net/fa2006-08.html |archivedate=September 2, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Inspiration and themes==
According to the author, her books are "about life, not death" and "love, not lust".&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite news |last=Horng |first=Eric |date=August 19, 2007 |url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/WN/story?id=3499052 |title=Will New Bestseller 'Eclipse' Harry Potter? |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each book in the series was inspired by and loosely based on a different literary classic: ''Twilight'' on [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', ''New Moon'' on [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''Eclipse'' on [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', and ''Breaking Dawn'' on a second Shakespeare play, ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.&lt;ref name="meridian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Proctor |first=Maurine |url=http://www.meridianmagazine.com/books/080806vampire.html |title=Stephenie Meyer's Twilight |accessdate=December 11, 2008 |work=Meridian |date=August 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201143401/http://meridianmagazine.com/books/080806vampire.html |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer also states that [[Orson Scott Card]] and [[L. M. Montgomery]]'s ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'' series are a big influence on her writing.&lt;ref name="Bite"/&gt; The Cullens were inspired by Meyer's own family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10872445 Why Stephenie Meyer is scared of fame]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as characters from the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' cartoon.&lt;ref name=eyre&gt;{{cite news |author=Karen Valby |title=Stephenie Meyer: 12 of My 'Twilight' Inspirations|url=http://ew.com/gallery/stephenie-meyer-12-my-twilight-inspirations/jane-eyre |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=November 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences on the series which Meyer has acknowledged include ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' by [[Charlotte Brontë]], [[HGTV]], and the films ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]'', ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'', and ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]''.&lt;ref name=eyre/&gt;

Other major themes of the series include choice and free will.&lt;ref name="Bite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time-april2008"&gt;{{cite news |last=Grossman |first=Lev |title=Stephenie Meyer: A New J.K. Rowling? |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=April 24, 2008 |accessdate=December 12, 2008 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1734838,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer says that the books are centered around Bella's choice to choose her life on her own, and the Cullens' choices to abstain from killing rather than follow their temptations: "I really think that's the underlying metaphor of my vampires. It doesn't matter where you're stuck in life or what you think you have to do; you can always choose something else. There's always a different path."&lt;ref name="time-april2008"/&gt;

Meyer, a [[Mormon]], acknowledges that her faith has influenced her work. In particular, she says that her characters "tend to think more about where they came from, and where they are going, than might be typical."&lt;ref name="Tales"/&gt; Meyer also steers her work from subjects such as sex, despite the romantic nature of the novels. Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be Mormon-influenced, or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, "I don't think my books are going to be really graphic or dark, because of who I am. There's always going to be a lot of light in my stories."&lt;ref name="times-online"&gt;{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Tony-Allen |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4492238.ece |title=News Review interview: Stephenie Meyer |work=[[The Times]] |date=August 10, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and publishing history==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Twilight books.jpg|200px|left|thumb|British paperback editions of the four ''Twilight'' books]] --&gt;
Stephenie Meyer says that the idea for ''[[Twilight (novel)|Twilight]]'' came to her in a dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the transcript of what is now chapter 13 of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view&amp;a=1972 |title=A Teenage Tale With Bite |journal=[[Brigham Young University|BYU]] Magazine |last=Walker |first=Michael R. |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had transformed that dream into a completed novel.&lt;ref name="time-april2008"/&gt; After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with [[Little, Brown and Company]] for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Cecelia Goodnow | title=Harry Potter and the Last Flight | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/books/324158_harry19.html | publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] | date=2007-07-19 | accessdate=2009-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer's literary agent, Jodi Reamer of Writers House, discovered her only because the inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books are supposed to be 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words.&lt;ref name="Rosman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rosman|first1=Kathleen|title=The Death of the Slush Pile|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703414504575001271351446274|accessdate=27 January 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown editor who signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the ''Twilight'' manuscript, she realized that she had a future bestseller in her hands.&lt;ref name="Charmed"&gt;{{cite news |last=Irwin |first=Megan |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2007-07-12/news/charmed |title=Charmed |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was released in 2005.

Following the success of ''[[Twilight (novel)|Twilight]]'', Meyer expanded the story into a series with three more books: ''[[New Moon (novel)|New Moon]]'' (2006), ''[[Eclipse (Meyer novel)|Eclipse]]'' (2007), and ''[[Breaking Dawn]]'' (2008). In its first week after publication, the first sequel, ''[[New Moon (novel)|New Moon]]'', debuted at #5 on the ''[[New York Times]]'' Best Seller List for Children's Chapter Books, and in its second week rose to the #1 position, where it remained for the next eleven weeks. In total, it spent over 50 weeks on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Best Sellers: Children's Books |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/books/bestseller/0812bestchildren.html?partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of ''Eclipse'', the first three "Twilight" books spent a combined 143 weeks on the ''New York Times'' Best Seller List.&lt;ref name="time-april2008"/&gt; The fourth installment of the ''Twilight'' series, ''[[Breaking Dawn]]'', was released with an initial print run of 3.7 million copies.&lt;ref name="BDsales"&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Jacks |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/08/04/breaking-dawn-sells-13-million-copies-in-one-day |title='Breaking Dawn' Sells 1.3 Million Copies in One Day |publisher=MTV.com |date=August 4, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1.3 million copies were sold on the first day alone, setting a record in first-day sales performance for the [[Hachette Book Group USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Memmott |first=Carol |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-08-03-breaking-dawn-sales_N.htm |title=Record-breaking sales for 'Breaking Dawn' |date=August 4, 2008 |publisher=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the completion of the fourth entry in the series, Meyer indicated that ''Breaking Dawn'' would be the final novel to be told from [[Bella Swan]]'s perspective.&lt;ref name="breakingdawn"&gt;{{cite web |last=Meyer |first=Stephenie |url=http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/breakingdawn.html |title=Breaking Dawn |date=July 7, 2008 |accessdate=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 and 2009, the four books of the series claimed the top four spots on ''[[USA Today]]'''s year-end bestseller list, making Meyer the first author to ever achieve this feat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | authors=Bob Minzesheimer and Anthony DeBarros | title=Sellers basked in Stephenie Meyer's 'Twilight' in 2008 | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2009-01-14-top-sellers-main_N.htm | publisher=[[USA Today]] | date=2009-01-15 | accessdate=2009-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2010-01-05-top-books-2009_N.htm|title=Best-Selling Books: The top 100 for 2009|publisher=USA TODAY|date=January 6, 2010|accessdate=May 27, 2011|first1=Anthony|last1=Debarros|first2=Mary|last2=Cadden|first3=Kristin|last3=DeRamus|first4=Christopher|last4=Schnaars}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series then won the [[2009 Kids' Choice Awards|2009 Kids' Choice Award]] for Favorite Book, where it competed against the [[Harry Potter|''Harry Potter'' series]].&lt;ref name="Kids' Choice Awards 2009: Twilight"/&gt;

==Other books==
===Midnight Sun===
Meyer originally planned to write a companion book to ''[[Twilight (novel)|Twilight]]'' called ''[[Midnight Sun (Meyer novel)|Midnight Sun]]'', which would be the story of ''Twilight'' told from [[Edward Cullen]]'s point-of-view. She stated that ''Twilight'' was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Meyer |first=Stephenie |interviewer=Nicole Sperlin |title=Twilight (part 3) |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/video/festivals?bcpid=1378342280&amp;bclid=1683773559&amp;bctid=1688297816 |type=Interview: Video |work=[[Entertainment Weekly|EW.com]] |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a rough draft of ''Midnight Sun's'' first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stepheniemeyer.com/pdf/midnightsun_partial_draft4.pdf |publisher=StephenieMeyer.com |title= Twilight series &amp;#124; Midnight Sun partial draft |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;If I tried to write ''Midnight Sun'' now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on ''Midnight Sun'', and so it is on hold indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Meyer |first=Stephenie |title=Midnight Sun |url=http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsun.html |date=August 28, 2008 |accessdate=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either [[Leah Clearwater]] or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Weiss |first=Sabrina Rojas |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1592582/story.jhtml |title='Twilight' Tuesday: Stephenie Meyer Answers Your Burning 'Breaking Dawn' Questions |publisher=MTV |date=August 12, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The response to ''Twilight'' has been mixed. While the books have become immensely popular, they have also generated much controversy.

===Positive reception===
''Twilight'' has gathered acclaim for its popularity with its target readers. ''[[The Times]]'' lauded it for capturing "perfectly the teenage feeling of sexual tension and alienation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Amanda | last = Craig  | title= New-Age vampires stake their claim | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/children/article1081930.ece | publisher=The Times | date=2006-01-14 | accessdate=2009-04-14 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other reviews described ''Twilight'' as an "exquisite fantasy",&lt;ref name = "Amazon"&gt;{{cite web | title= Editorial Reviews | url= https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0316015849/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books | publisher=Amazon | accessdate=2009-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "gripping blend of romance and horror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =Norah | last = Piehl | type= review | title = Twilight | url=http://www.teenreads.com/reviews/0316160172.asp | publisher = Teen reads | accessdate=2009-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Grossman]] of ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' wrote that the books have a "pillowy quality distinctly reminiscent of Internet [[fan fiction]]", but still praised the series, comparing it to ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''Harry Potter'':

===Negative reception===
The series has garnered some notoriety both over its literary substance and over the type of relationship portrayed in the books.

Many have derided the series as poor writing. While comparing [[Stephenie Meyer]] to [[J. K. Rowling]], [[Stephen King]] said, "the real difference [between Rowling and Meyer] is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer, and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Brain | last = Tuitt | title = It's great to be the King | page = 7 | newspaper = [[USA Weekend]] | date = March 6–8, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "msnbc"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29001524 | title = MSNBR | contribution = Stephen King says 'Twilight' author 'can't write' | publisher = MSN | date = February 3, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, King understood the appeal of the series, adding, "People are attracted by the stories, by the pace and in the case of Stephenie Meyer, it's very clear that she's writing to a whole generation of girls and opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books. It's exciting and it's thrilling and it's not particularly threatening because it's not overtly sexual."&lt;ref name="msnbc"/&gt;

A quote from Robin Browne (though frequently misattributed to King or Andrew Futral)&lt;ref name=CKL&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Vs. Twilight|url=http://hotsheet.snout.org/2011/08/for-record-harry-potter-vs-twilight.html|work=CKL Hotsheet|publisher=Snout.org|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  negatively compares the ''Twilight'' and ''Harry Potter'' book series: "''Harry Potter'' is about confronting fears, finding inner strength and doing what is right in the face of adversity… ''Twilight'' is about how important it is to have a boyfriend".&lt;ref name=Futral&gt;{{cite web|last=Futral|first=Andrew|title=Andrew Futral, A Wonderful Man|url=http://andrewfutral.tumblr.com/post/1719177901/harry-potter-is-about-confronting-fears-finding-inner|work=Tumbler|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laura Miller of [[Salon.com]] wrote that "the characters, such as they are, are stripped down to a minimum, lacking the texture and idiosyncrasies of actual people", and said that "''Twilight'' would be a lot more persuasive as an argument that an 'amazing heart' counts for more than appearances if it didn't harp so incessantly on Edward's superficial splendors."&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web | last = Miller |first=Laura |url=http://www.salon.com/books/review/2008/07/30/Twilight/ |title=Touched by a vampire |work=[[Salon.com|Salon]] |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Hand of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, "Meyer's prose seldom rises above the serviceable, and the plotting is leaden."&lt;ref name="Hand"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/07/AR2008080702528.html | work = The Washington Post | title= Love Bites | first= Elizabeth | last= Hand | date= 2008-08-10 | accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article, featured on the [[Yahoo!]] website Shine, also criticized the books and the author's final word on the series was, "Good books deal with themes of longing and loneliness, sexual passion and human frailty, alienation and fear just as the ''Twilight'' books do. But they do so by engaging us with complexities of feeling and subtleties of character, expressed in language that rises above banal mediocrity. Their reward is something more than just an escape into banal mediocrity. We deserve something better to get hooked on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mommytracked.com/not-twi-moms |title=Oh No. Not Twi-Moms |publisher=Mommy Tracked |accessdate=2011-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714111657/http://www.mommytracked.com/not-twi-moms |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://astrology.yahoo.com/channel/parenting/oh-no-not-twi-moms-355795/ |title=Astrology |publisher=Yahoo! |contribution=Oh, no, not Twi‐Moms |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129085544/http://astrology.yahoo.com/channel/parenting/oh-no-not-twi-moms-355795/ |archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====
The books have also been widely critiqued as promoting, normalizing, and idealizing an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. Sci-fi website [[io9]] noted that Bella and Edward's relationship meets all fifteen criteria set by the [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]] for being in an abusive relationship.&lt;ref name= "i09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/5413428/official-twilights-bella--edward-are-in-an-abusive-relationship |title= Official: Twilight’s Bella &amp; Edward Are In An Abusive Relationship | first = Graeme | last = McMillan |date=2009-11-28 |publisher=i09 |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; L. Lee Butler of [[Young Adult Library Services Association]] commented how he was unusually hesitant to stock the ''Twilight'' books in his library because he felt the books were "robbing [teen girls] of agency and normalizing stalking and abusive behavior."&lt;ref name="Young Adult Library Services Association"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://yalsa.ala.org/blog/2009/11/24/twilight-and-abusive-relationships/ |title=Twilight and Abusive Relationships | first =L Lee | last = Butler |date=2009-11-24 |publisher= ALA |accessdate= 21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many female-oriented and feminist media outlets, like [[Jezebel]],&lt;ref name="Jezebel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jezebel.com/5415325/twilights-hero-is-abusive-which-makes-him-all-the-more-romantic |title=Twilight’s Hero Is Abusive, Which Makes Him All The More Romantic |author=Dodai Stewart |date=2009-11-30 |publisher= Jezebel |accessdate= November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Frisky,&lt;ref name= "The Frisky"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thefrisky.com/2009-11-30/twilight-love-story-has-all-the-components-of-an-abusive-relationship/ |title= "Twilight" Love Story Has All The Components of An Abusive Relationship | first = Amelia | last = McDonell-Parry |date= 2009-11-30 |publisher= The Frisky |accessdate= 21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Salon.com]] have decried ''Twilight'' as promoting an anti-woman message.&lt;ref name="Salon Magazine"&gt;{{cite web| first =Laura | last = Miller |date=2008-07-30 |url = http://www.salon.com/books/review/2008/07/30/Twilight/ |title=Touched by a vampire |publisher= Salon |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bitch (magazine)|''Bitch'' magazine]] stated the novels "had created a new, popular genre of "abstinence porn", concluding that, "In reality, the abstinence message—wrapped in the genre of abstinence porn—objectifies Bella in the same ways that 'real' porn might. The ''Twilight'' books conflate Bella losing her virginity with the loss of other things, including her sense of self and her very life. Such a high-stakes treatment of abstinence reinforces the idea that Bella is powerless, an object, a fact that is highlighted when we get to the sex scenes in ''Breaking Dawn''."&lt;ref name="Bitch Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|author=Christine Seifert |url=http://bitchmagazine.org/article/bite-me-or-dont |title=Bite Me! (Or Don't) |publisher=bitchmagazine.org |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' declared that ''Twilight'' promotes a physically abusive relationship and an [[anti-abortion]] message.&lt;ref name="Ms."&gt;{{cite web |url= http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2011/11/17/breaking-dawn-part-1an-anti-abortion-message-in-a-bruised-apple-package/ |title=Breaking Dawn: Part 1—An Anti-Abortion Message in a Bruised-Apple Package | first =Natalie | last = Wilson |date=2011-11-17 |publisher= MS magazine |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, writer Angela Aleiss of ''[[Religion News Service]]'' said that contrary to popular opinion, Mormons do permit abortion when the mother's life is in danger.  Bella's refusal to abort her fetus, along with her quick marriage and pregnancy, instead underscore the Mormon emphasis on family.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Aleiss, "Mormon Influence, Imagery Runs Deep through ''Twilight''", ''[[Religion News Service]]'', June 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various psychology experts have come out in agreement with the assessment of the relationship as abusive.&lt;ref name="Psychology Today"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-psychology-movies/201111/relationship-violence-in-twilight |title=Relationship Violence in "Twilight" | first =Wind | last = Goodfriend |date=2011-11-09 |publisher= Psychology today |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melissa Henson, Director of communication and public education for the [[Parents Television Council]], stated:

Meyer has dismissed such criticisms, arguing both that the books center around Bella's choice, which she perceives as the foundation of modern [[feminism]], and that Bella's [[damsel in distress]] persona is due only to her humanity.&lt;ref name = "Stephenie Meyer.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/nm_thestory.html |title=New Moon: The Story |publisher=StephenieMeyer.com |accessdate=November 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer also added, "Just because [Bella] doesn't do kung fu and she cooks for her father doesn't make her worthy of that criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Karen Valby |title='Breaking Dawn': 13 Notes for Newcomers |url = http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20308569_20308452_2,00.html |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon Simcox of ''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]'' has similarly dismissed the criticism surrounding Bella, commenting, "While Bella plays the perfect damsel in distress that gets herself into sticky situations, she is also very in control of herself. She chose to move to Forks and be in a new place; she constantly faces a bunch of people who want to suck the life right out of her, and she is constantly pleading to become a vampire, too, so she can take care of herself and Edward."&lt;ref name="collegian"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = PSU | date = 2010-07-06 | first = Shannon | last = Simcox | title = Twilight hatred too over the top | url = http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2010/07/06/twilight_hatred_too_over_the_t.aspx | work = The Daily Collegian | accessdate = 2010-07-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100709173159/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2010/07/06/twilight_hatred_too_over_the_t.aspx | archivedate = 2010-07-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conventions==
While the ''Twilight'' series has been a visible presence in many conventions such as [[San Diego Comic-Con International|ComicCon]], there have also been many conventions whose main focus has been on the ''Twilight'' series (books and films). Some notable conventions have been [[Twicon]] and a series of "Official Twilight Conventions" that are being held by [[Creation Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.creationent.com/cal/twilight_az.htm |title=Creation ent |contribution=Twilight AZ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619022648/http://www.creationent.com/cal/twilight_az.htm |archivedate=June 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Uspanteko''' (Uspanteco, Uspanteko, Uspantec) is a [[Mayan language]]  of [[Guatemala]], closely related to [[K'iche' language|K'iche']]. It is spoken in the [[Uspantán]] and [[Playa Grande Ixcán]][http://www.inforpressca.com/playagrandeixcan/] ''municipios'', in the Department [[Quiché (department)|El Quiché]].&lt;ref name="SIL"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Gordon, Raymond G. |year=2005 |title=[[Ethnologue|Ethnologue: Languages of the World]] |edition=15|format=on line version |others=Barbara F.

It distinguishes between vowels with high tone and vowels with low tone.

==Phonology==
===Tone===
Uspantek has two phonemic tones: high and falling (Can Pixabaj 2007:39). In writing, the high tone is represented by an acute accent mark on the vowel (''ráqan'' 'my foot'), and the falling tone is represented by an acute accent mark on the first vowel followed by an unmarked vowel (''júun'' 'one').

The high tone occurs in penultimate syllables when the final syllable contains a short vowel. Additionally, it occurs the following contexts (Can Pixabaj 2007).
*Most possessive forms of inalienable nouns
*Bisyllabic single morphemes, especially those with short /a/ or /i/ in the final syllable
*Intransitive verbs with the suffix -''ik''
*Most words with three syllables
*Loanwords

The following types of words do not have tone.
*Words with CV'C structure do not add tone to penultimate syllables when affixes are added.
*Monosyllabic words with long vowels that have no tone do not add tone to penultimate syllables when affixes are added.

The falling tone occurs in long vowels, and in the following contexts (Can Pixabaj 2007).
*Monosyllabic words
*Final syllable of a polysyllabic word

===Phonotactics===
The main types of syllable structures in Uspantek are CVC, CV, and CCVC (Can Pixabaj 2007:50).

==Organization==

WNGD was founded and is organized by [[Mark Storey]], consulting editor for [[Nude &amp; Natural]] magazine and [[permaculture|permaculturalist]] Jacob Gabriel, as a project of Body Freedom Collaborative (BFC). In its early days, Mark Storey had a vision of BFC engaging in "guerrilla pranksterism"&lt;ref&gt;[[Nude &amp; Natural]] (N), ''Guerilla Nudity/Wave Makers: Introducing the Body Freedom Collaborative'' by Mark Storey. Issue 23.1, Autumn 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; such as hopping out of a van or showing up spontaneously in an urban environment and engaging in [[guerilla gardening]].

Storey is the current project lead and he introduced the concept to readers of [[Nude &amp; Natural]] magazine in 2005 and follow-up stories in later years in the same magazine. Corky Stanton, of Clothes Free International, who was also providing web hosting for [[World Naked Bike Ride]] at that time, supported the effort with web site hosting and promotion from the beginning of the project.

In the [[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]], Mark Storey notes that WNGD is not owned by any one organization. "No particular organization owns World Naked Gardening Day," Storey said, and it's not actually one large gathering of horticulturists in [[Seattle]] who strip down and shear some shrubs together."&lt;ref name="NYdailynews"&gt;
{{cite news |title= World Naked Gardening Day encourages no-pants planting|author= Victoria Taylor|url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/world-naked-gardening-day-digging-article-1.1335126|newspaper= [[NY Daily News]]|date= 4 May 2013|accessdate=17 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phenomenon quickly spread internationally, little investment has been made by its founders. "Storey said he and Johnson&lt;ref name="Gabriel" group="Note"&gt;Daniel Johnson changed his name to Jacob Gabriel in 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; haven't spent any money or gone to any great lengths to promote World Naked Gardening Day since they initiated it. They helped create a website early on, and then receded into the background. They intended that the idea of an introduction to clothes freedom through gardening was valuable and would grow organically on its own."&lt;ref name = "NBC Today News"/&gt;

==Fixing the date of the event==

WNGD was inspired by a combination of Gabriel's and Storey's involvement in and inspiration by the success of [[World Naked Bike Ride]], the first of which was held internationally in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/life/lifestyle/world-naked-gardening-day-it-all-started-in-seattle|title=World Naked Gardening Day: It all started in Seattle|last=Lacitis|first=Erik|date=2017-05-07|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2017-05-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the enjoyment and simplicity of Storey's experience with his wife, gardening naked in the backyard as well as his experience [[naked hiking]] and kayaking. The first annual World Naked Gardening Day event took place on September 10, 2005.&lt;ref name="msnbc naked"/&gt; In 2007, the event date was moved to the first Saturday in May where it still takes place to this day.&lt;ref name="dates" group="Note"&gt;Previously, WNGD has taken place on September 10, 2005, 1st Annual; Saturday, September 9, 2006, 2nd Annual; Saturday, May 5, 2007, 3rd Annual (date switched to May for first time, first Saturday); Saturday, May 3, 2008, 4th Annual; Saturday, May 2, 2009, 5th Annual; Saturday, May 8, 2010, 6th Annual; Saturday, May 14, 2011, 7th Annual (accidentally set to 2nd Sat instead of first); Saturday, May 5, 2012, 8th Annual; Saturday, May 4, 2013, 9th Annual.&lt;/ref&gt; The event takes place the day before International Permaculture Day, which takes place on the first Sunday of May.

Summer dates have been suggested due to colder [[temperate climate]] temperatures in May, to coincide with a joint [[World Naked Bike Ride]] event and for other reasons.&lt;ref name="summer" group="Note"&gt;In November of 2010, Gabriel suggested the idea of changing the date of WNGD to coincide with the All-Earth Holiday, Dachnik Day or Gardener's Day on July 23 as he was currently interested in the Anastasia movement of the Ringing Cedars book series, written by Siberian entrepreneur [[Vladimir Megre]]. This was a popular book within [[raw veganism]] and [[permaculture]] circles Gabriel was involved in at the time. Gabriel was also hoping to gain a warmer date for the event since May is often much cooler in [[temperate climates]]. Despite his interest, Gabriel was often not directly participating in events due to the cool Seattle May weather. He was also thinking that there could be a combination of both WNGD and the [[World Naked Gardening Day#Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade|Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade]] to fill a strategic warm-weather date slot in the [[World Naked Bike Ride Seattle]] and [[social nudity in Seattle|Seattle social nudity]] event schedule. The idea for the date change and Dachnik Day affiliation never had much momentum and Gabriel later soundly rejected interest in the Ringing Cedars book and its overt [[new age]] ideas when he became a [[Born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]] in the years soon after.&lt;/ref&gt; But WNGD is about gardening, and gardeners know that spring is a key time to nurture plants. Also, WNGD may be enjoyed both indoors and outside.

In 2018, the New Zealand Naturist Federation adopted the last weekend in October, that was better suited to the southern hemisphere climate.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Naturist Federation June 2018"&gt;{{closed access}} {{cite |title=Gardening au naturel |journal=Gonatural |publisher=New Zealand Naturist Federation |date=June 2018 |issue=245 |issn=1177-1887 |oclc=173322430 |url=https://gonatural.co.nz/gonatural-magazine/past-issues/ |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Horticulture supplier Yates supported the event and supplied Swan Plant seedlings.

==Motivation==

According to the organizers, "besides being liberating, nude gardening is second only to swimming as an activity that people are most ready to consider doing nude," an assertion described as "true" by ''[[The Hamilton Spectator]]''.&lt;ref name=spec&gt;{{cite news |title= World naked gardening day|author= |url= http://www.thespec.com/news/article/531601--world-naked-gardening-day|newspaper= [[The Hamilton Spectator]]|date= 13 May 2011|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's website claims people throughout the world are "invited to tend their portion of the world's garden clothed as nature intended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Gardening naked as the end approaches|author= |url= http://www.mailtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110515/NEWS/105150332|newspaper= [[Mail Tribune]]|date= 15 May 2011|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WNGD is endorsed by [[The Naturist Society]], Clothes Free International and [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR),&lt;ref name="cleveland naked"&gt;
{{cite news |title= World Naked Gardening Day: Ready the soil, plant seeds and take off your clothes|author= |url= http://www.cleveland.com/insideout/index.ssf/2011/05/post_55.html|newspaper= [[The Plain Dealer|Cleveland.com]]|date= 11 May 2011|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Storey is the co-founder and current project lead of WNGD and moderates the WNGD Yahoo! Discussion group. Although the event is associated with the socio-cultural [[Naturism|naturist movement]], its founders assert the day is intended to be "lighthearted,"  and void of politics.&lt;ref name="msnbc naked"/&gt;

An AANR press release, published during the sixth annual World Naked Gardening Day, described naked gardening to be a healthy practice. AANR public relations representative Tom Mulhall claims naked gardening may help boost a positive [[self-image]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Have trowel, drop trou?&amp;nbsp;– A nationwide day devoted to gardening in the nude doesn't seem to have gathered much traction in the Midwest.|author= |url= https://www.webcitation.org/66HnIdZa0|newspaper= [[Star Tribune]]|date= 12 May 2011 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond [[body image]], "Stanton cited fringe benefits of bare, unabashed recreation: the satisfaction of exercising in the great outdoors; the attractiveness of an all-over [[sunbathing|tan]]; more [[vitamin D]] on your whole body; the unbeatable experience of [[skinny-dipping]] if the naturist event involves a beach or a lake."&lt;ref name = "NBC Today News"/&gt;

==Private vs. public observance==

While the event is most often done in secluded areas, such as at home, BFC first kicked off the event with its trademark "guerrilla pranksterism" and did a photo shoot for the project's web site in a public park. In another year Storey and Gabriel enlisted the help of local free beach users at an unofficial clothing-optional beach park on [[Lake Washington]], in [[Seattle]]. Storey has also suggested that some remote hiking location would be quiet enough to host a trail cleanup.&lt;ref name = "NBC Today News"/&gt;

Many people chose not to venture beyond the relative safety of non-public areas. "It's not about exposing your body to other people," said Corky Stanton, of Clothes Free International, an organization that promotes nude recreation. "It's about body acceptance and being one with nature on your own. ... We actually do these events in secluded areas,"&lt;ref name = "NBC Today News"/&gt;

During the fifth annual World Naked Gardening Day in the United Kingdom, celebrated in 2010, organizers encouraged people to go naked either in their private gardens or in [[Urban park|public park]]s. According to the [[Sky News Online]], organizers of the event thought an "''au naturel joie de vivre''" will bind all communities and people regardless of their background and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Phwoar-ticultural: It's Naked Gardening Day|author= |url= http://news.sky.com/home/strange-news/article/15627988|newspaper= [[Sky News Online]]|date= 8 May 2010|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade==
In 2009, inspired by the success of both [[World Naked Bike Ride Seattle]] and WNGD, along with being inspired by his [[permaculture]] schooling at the time, Gabriel founded the Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade (GEBP), with co-organizer Kelda [[Lorax]], a local permaculture designer, advocate, and instructor.&lt;ref name="Kelda" group="Note"&gt;At the time, Kelda Lorax went by the name Kelda Miller and she was one of Gabriel's Permaculture Design Course instructors. She is believed to have changed her name sometime around 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Kelda who came up with the GEBP name for the event. The ride in part was to take the simplicity and theme of gardening in WNGD and take it more public and deeper into principles of permaculture. The [[clothing-optional bike ride]] showcased local [[permaculture]] projects as well as general permaculture principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mygreenlake.com/2009/08/gardens-everywhere-naked-bike-parade/|title=mygreenlake.com|publisher=|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same year Gabriel was involved in co-founding the [[Beacon Food Forest]], the first known [[food forest]] on public lands.

The Ride launched from Om Culture in Wallingford, went East on the [[Burke-Gilman Trail]]. Local artist Franz and others had staged a body painting and art bike decorating party at that location. The ride then headed North on [[The Ave]] and toured the [[University District, Seattle|University District]], stopped at the University District Farmer's Market and University Heights [[P-Patch]] at the University Heights Center. A tour was given by Kelda and the [[rainwater harvesting]] system was highlighted.

It continued up the Ave to a Shiga's Community Garden, which is also a Seattle Department of Neighborhoods Community Garden. At this time the garden was being cleared of invasive weeds left over from a vacant lot into future planting in 2010. By coincidence volunteers were clearing that lot and GEBP helped the group for a few minutes carry out invasive weeds. The [[Seattle Police]] responded at Shiga's Garden from a complaint from the stop at the University Farmer's Market and left when the officers where reassured that riders were not going back to the market.

The ride then left traveled North to [[Thrive Cafe|Thrive]] restaurant and enjoyed gourmet [[raw veganism|raw vegan food]] prepared by the restaurant staff for the riders. The ride continued to Roosevelt P-Patch and dropped in on a friends garden in the area. The ride continued through the Roosevelt district to Permaculturist Jenny Pell's house, then to [[Mighty-O Donuts]] in the [[Meridian, Seattle|Tangletown]] neighborhood, where the group serenaded, unsuccessfully the workers for donuts. The ride continued to a tour of [[Seattle Tilth]] at the [[Home of the Good Shepherd]], took a tour of the grounds and surprised a wedding party taking place in the area bordering Meridian Playground and the Good Shephard Center.

After leaving Meridian Playground, the ride went to an intersection repair&lt;ref group="Note" name="intersection repair"&gt;Intersection repair is a term coined by the [[City Repair Project]], based in Portland, Oregon,  and is essentially an artistic, whimsical, painted mural on the street aimed at slowing traffic and building interest in local neighborhood community building.&lt;/ref&gt; done with a mural of a giant [[ladybug]]. The Wallingford Ladybug, known as Wallybug, is located at the intersection of N 49th Street and Burke Ave N in Wallingford. It was created in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.travelmarx.com/2012/05/wallingford-ladybug-intersection.html|title=TravelMarx|publisher=|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group then stopped in front of a residence where the homeowners were gardening in their front parking strip and the group sang for them. Another stop was made at a residence offering refreshments to riders, another stop at a neighbor selling [[Organic food|organic]] [[Heirloom plant|heirloom]] produce from her yard and the ride ended at a private residence for a clothing-optional party in a backyard gardening featuring a handmade cobb [[masonry oven]].

A fundraising film party was held at [[Thrive Cafe|Thrive]] Cafe on September 9, 2009, which showed footage of the event collected by the riders and photographers.

==Cultural references==
In 2013, Ritchie Duncan, contributor to [[TruTV|TruTv's]] Dumb as a Blog, suggested a hybrid event, "World Naked '[[Star Wars]]' Gardening Day", encouraging readers to tweet their pictures to @DumbasaBlog with the hashtag #nakedstarwarsgardening. He joked that participants could say "May the fourth be with you,", in a nod to the date of the hybrid World Naked 'Star Wars' Gardening Day, which would occur that year (May 4, 2013), the same as the date of [[Star Wars Day]] (May Fourth) and the popular Star Wars expression "[[May the Force be with you]]."

One suggested idea was "Get naked and paint your face red and black like [[Darth Maul]]. Attach another rake to the handle of your existing rake for "nude double lightsaber raking action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.trutv.com/dumb-as-a-blog/2013/05/03/naked-star-wars-gardening-tomorrow-whos-in/index.html|title = Naked Star Wars gardening Saturday?

==Notable and historical naked gardening==
[[Adam and Eve]] were noted to garden naked, before [[the fall of man]], in the [[Book of Genesis]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Hesiod]] exhorts farmers: "When the Atlas-born Pleiades rise, start the harvest—the plowing, when they set . . . This is the rule for the plains, and for those who dwell near the sea and those far from the swelling sea in the valleys and glens, fertile land: sow naked, and plow naked, and harvest naked, if you want to bring in all of Demeter's works in due season, so that each crop may grow for you in its season. " The Pleiades rise in early May and set in November.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. Works and Days. Lines 383-394. Edited and translated by Glenn W. Most. Loeb Classical Library 57. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] was known to garden nude at the Steepletop estate in New York as part of her [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

[[Walt Whitman]] is also known to have written about his naked experiences in nature. In Specimen Day he wrote: "Sweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature! --ah if poor, sick, prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness then indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your sophistication, your fear, your respectability that is indecent. There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear, but are themselves indecent. Perhaps indeed he or she to whom the free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature has never been eligible (and how many thousands there are!) has not really known what purity is--nor what faith or art or health really is."

Actress and [[PETA]] spokesperson, [[Alicia Silverstone]], in an interview with [[Health (magazine)|Health magazine]] said "It probably started when I was doing my garden the first time. I'd be out there, and it would be scorching hot, so I would take off all of my clothes and garden. And then I would jump in the pool and swim - and I always get in the pool naked, because why would you want to put on a bathing suit?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.health.com/health/article/0,,20411948_2,00.html|title = Alicia Silverstone: How a Vegan Diet Makes You Sparkle: Alicia Silverstone dishes on vegan diets, having children, and gardening naked.|date = August 19, 2009|accessdate = February 17, 2014|publisher = Health magazine|first = Amy|last = Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One month prior to the first WNGD event on September 10, 2005, Ian and Barbara Pollard, resident gardening experts on ITV's '' [[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'', held its first "clothes optional day" at [[Abbey House Gardens]] in [[Malmesbury, Wiltshire|Malmesbury]], [[Wiltshire]], [[England]].

''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article about naked gardening neighbors next-door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/garden/the-nakeds-next-door.html|title=The Nakeds Next Door|date=21 November 2013|publisher=|accessdate=10 February 2016|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
