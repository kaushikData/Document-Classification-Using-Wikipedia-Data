}}&lt;/ref&gt; imposed by an heraldic authority (such as the [[Court of Chivalry]] in England) or by royal decree for misconduct.  The practice of inverting the entire [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] of an [[armiger]] found guilty of high [[treason]] has been attested since the [[Middle Ages]] and is generally accepted as reliable, and medieval heraldic sources cite at least one instance of removing an honourable charge from a coat of arms by royal decree as an abatement of honour.  Other abatements of honour implied by the addition of dishonourable [[Stain (heraldry)|stains]] and [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]], appearing in late 16th-century texts, have never been reliably attested in actual practice.  Additionally, as many heraldic writers note, the use of arms is not compulsory, so armigers are more likely to relinquish a dishonored coat of arms than to advertise their dishonor.

==Inverted arms==
The earliest mention in heraldic writing of a dishonorable display of arms (and, according to Fox-Davies, the only one reliably attested in actual use; see historical examples below)&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies /&gt; was inverting the entire shield, first documented by [[Johannes de Bado Aureo]] in his heraldic treatise ''Tractatus de armis'' (c. 1394).&lt;ref name=laurel&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://heraldry.sca.org/laurel/abate.html |last=Levin |first=Craig |title=Abatements and Augmentations of Honor |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary accounts of executions for treason describe the traitor being marched to his execution in a paper tabard displaying his inverted arms,&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies /&gt; and other accounts tell of displaying the inverted arms of prisoners, released on parole, who refuse to pay their ransom.&lt;ref name=laurel /&gt;

==Theoretical abatements==
Eight other abatements were introduced in the late 16th century, each prescribing a specific charge in a specific [[Stain (heraldry)|stain]] for a specific offense; though the charges themselves were uncommon but no less honourable than any other charge (if colored in any standard tincture or fur), it was only when displayed in the prescribed position and stain that these charges were supposed to be considered dishonourable.

Leigh (1562) enumerated the nine abatements thus:&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt;

#Point dexter parted [[tenné]], for false claims of valor
#Point champaine tenné, for killing a prisoner who has demanded quarter
#Plain point [[sanguine (heraldry)|sanguine]], for one who lies to his sovereign
#Point in point sanguine, for cowardice
#Gusset sanguine borne to dexter, for adultery, or to sinister for a drunkard
#Gore sinister tenné, for cowardice in the face of the enemy
#Delf tenné, for revoking a challenge
#Inescutcheon reversed sanguine, for any man who "discourteously entreateth eyther maid or widow against her will, or flieth from his Soveraignes banner"&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, G. ''The Accedence of Armory,'' 1st ed. (London:1562). Quoted in Woodcock (1988), p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The entire escutcheon inverted, for treason

Scottish herald [[Thomas Innes of Learney]] mentioned abatements in marital situations: "The law of arms provides for abating the arms of an adulterer by two gussets sanguine, and where the bearing of arms is necessary this, and one gusset (they will be close-gussets) for non-adulterous divorcees, are, at least in Patents, applied in the case of divorcees."&lt;ref name=IH&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.internationalheraldry.com/ |title=Abatements |publisher=InternationalHeraldry.com |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several notable modern heraldists have asserted that the execution of this system of abatements has never been attested in fact, and that the whole system was in all likelihood a theoretical exercise created by heralds for the purpose of discouraging armigers from committing dishonourable acts.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fox-Davies |first=Arthur Charles |authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |year=1909 |title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry |location=London |publisher=T.C. &amp; E.C. Jack |pages=72–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Woodcock |first1=Thomas |authorlink1=Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms) |last2=Robinson |first2=John Martin |authorlink2=John Martin Robinson |year=1988 |title=The Oxford Guide to Heraldry |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192116584 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breaking or erasing charges==
[[File:Lion Coward.svg|thumb|right|150px|A lion ''couard'' is said to denote dishonor or cowardice.]]
As another form of abatement, some coats of arms were reportedly modified through breaking or cutting, reversing, or altogether erasing some existing charges, at least as they occur in patents, though the armiger's actual display of these defaced arms has not been documented and is unlikely.

In [[French heraldry]] the term ''diffamé'' is used to denote a lion or other animal whose tail is cut off, or may refer more broadly to arms which have been altered to signify loss of honor.  A lion with its tail between its hind legs is termed "couard" (coward), and has also been cited as a mark of infamy.&lt;ref name=IH /&gt;

Though lions are traditionally depicted with male genitals, a recent trend toward omitting the genitals has been controversial, prodding claims that emasculated lions have also been an historical form of abatement.  Commenting on the newly castrated lion in the arms of the [[Nordic Battle Group]] in 2007, Vladimir Sagerlund, heraldic artist at the [[Swedish National Archives]] since 1994, was critical of the politically motivated decision, stating, "once upon a time coats of arms containing lions without genitalia were given to those who betrayed the Crown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Reported historical examples==
A few examples of historical abatements of arms have been recorded, though none of these reflect the addition of stained ordinaries as detailed above.  Rather, these include broken chevrons, disarmed lions, and reversed or erased charges.

One of these rare historical examples was [[Amery of Pavy]], who was appointed governor of [[Calais]] by King [[Edward III of England]] in 1347, and whose arms were abated by royal decree in 1349 after the failed French [[Siege of Calais (1348)|siege of Calais]] on the last day of December 1348, which resulted from Sir Amery's attempt to sell Calais to [[Geoffroi de Charny|Sir Geffrey Charney]], the French governor of nearby [[Saint-Omer]], for 20,000 [[Crown (English coin)|crowns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bicknell |first=W.

Lowndes and W. Locke |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As stated by Sir George Mackenzie: "And [[Edward III of England|Edward the Third of England]] ordained two of six [[star (heraldry)|stars]] which a gentleman had in his arms to be effaced, because he had sold a seaport of which he was made governor."&lt;ref name=IH /&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://karlwilcox.com/parker/?page_id=203 |last=Parker |first=James |title=Abatements |work=Parker's Heraldry |publisher=Karl B. Wilcox |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pursuivant|Pursuivant of arms]] [[John Guillim]], writing circa 1610, gave the story in considerable detail, adding that Sir Amery's arms were also inverted for his treachery.  Guillim further explained that this humiliation is not inherited by the traitor's heirs, up to and including [[capital crime]]s, except in cases of [[high treason]].&lt;ref name=Guillim&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillim |first=John |date=1611 |title=A Display of Heraldrie |chapter=Section I Chapter VIII |url=http://www.btinternet.com/~paul.j.grant/guillim/s1/gu_s1c8.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015165207/http://www.btinternet.com/~paul.j.grant/guillim/s1/gu_s1c8.htm |archivedate=2008-10-15 |location=London |publisher=Printed by William Hall for Raphe Mab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a lion ''diffamée'' is that of [[John I, Count of Hainaut|Jean d'Avesnes]] who insulted his mother, [[Margaret II, Countess of Flanders]], in the presence of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]]. He is supposed to have seen the lion in his arms ''diffamée'' (i.e. the tail removed) and ''morné'' (i.e. the teeth and claws removed).&lt;ref name=IH /&gt;

'''Arthur's Day''' was an annual series of music events worldwide, originally organised by [[Diageo]] in 2009 to promote the 250th anniversary of its [[Guinness]] brewing company.

The 2009 events took place, internationally, in the cities of [[Dublin]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Lagos]], New York and [[Yaoundé]] on 23 September 2009. The event was broadcast internationally on [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky TV]],

==Marketing==
The event was criticised as a marketing ploy to increase sales of Guinness with Arthur's day, without understanding or appreciation for the sense of nostalgia and meaning behind the "Black Stuff" that the event promoted according to Diageo. Diageo also claimed that Arthur's Day was held on a Thursday, rather than an accurate yearly basis on the original date. Thursday was chosen according to Diageo as Thursdays were the traditional "student night" in Dublin and many towns in Ireland.&lt;ref name="We're buying into cheap marketing ploys"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Clifford|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0828/1224253402209.html|title=We're buying into cheap marketing ploys|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=24 September 2011|work=The Irish Times |quote=In reality, it is a cynical marketing ploy by the international drinks firm, Diageo, which owns Guinness. [...] "In reality, it is a cynical marketing ploy by the international drinks firm, Diageo, which owns Guinness."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Times]]'' has described Arthur's Day as "a masterclass in how to fabricate a national holiday" with its "''[[à la carte]]'' attitude to traditional holidays"&amp;nbsp;– noting its countdown to one minute before six (recalling New Year's Eve), "the faux-patriotism that comes with a celebration of a "national" drink" and the "[[hagiography|hagiographic]] treatment" of Arthur Guinness as some kind of [[saint]]. The paper warned, "If St Patrick's Day, Christmas, and Hallowe'en are festivals that offer an excuse for a drink, Diageo has flipped the concept on its head and made the drink an excuse for a festival".&lt;ref name=fabrication_and_libation&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Griffin|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0927/breaking50.html|title=Arthur's Day: fabrication and libation|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Since its cancellation, there have been many reported celebrations of Arthur's Day.

In September 2015, MSN News reported that a bar in Jundaí, Brazil was hosting an event for Arthur's Day despite it being abandoned.

Later that same September, MSN News reported that Spells Bar in Ballaghaderreen, Co. Roscommon in Ireland was celebrating "The Day Formerly Known As Arthur's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msn.com/en-ie/news/national/one-irish-pub-still-celebrated-arthur%e2%80%99s-day-yesterday/ar-AAeMtjb?ocid=spartandhp|title= MSN News - One Irish pub still celebrated Arthur’s Day yesterday|date=24 September 2015|work=MSN News|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bannerstones''' are [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s usually found in the Eastern [[United States]] that are characterized by a centered hole in a symmetrically shaped carved or ground stone. The holes are typically ¼" to ¾" in diameter and extend through a raised portion centered in the stone. They usually are bored all the way through but some have been found with holes that extend only part of the way through. Many are made from banded slate or other colored hard stone. They often have a geometric "wing nut" or "butterfly" shape but are not limited to these. More than just functional artifacts, bannerstones are a form of art that appear in varying shapes, designs, and colors, symbolizing their ceremonial and spiritual importance.

==Debates over function==
[[Archaeologists]] have debated over the use of banner stones. Some have suggested  that they are [[atlatl]] weights or ceremonial pieces. Others have suggested that they are for drilling, cordage making, or fire making. [[Robert S. Berg]]'s theory proposed that they are part of a kit of tools used to make and repair atlatl darts. Berg's theory has met with a lot of skepticism and resistance because of the previous works of William S. Webb, who proposed that the bannerstone was actually part of an atlatl. Webb cited "in situ" evidence which consisted mainly of bannerstones found in line with atlatl handles and hooks in graves that archaeologists dug up during the construction of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s massive water control system in the southeast during the early part of the 20th century. It seems that "their primary value lay in their symbolic and aesthetic worth rather than in their tool-like efficiency" &lt;ref&gt;(Berg, 1998:75)&lt;/ref&gt; because of the manner in which they were created and later found in archaeological sites.

The ceremonial importance of bannerstones is related to "the psychological uncertainties and physical dangers of daily life among early hunters and gatherers".&lt;ref&gt;(Hero, 2004: 22)&lt;/ref&gt; These peoples appealed to the powers of the stone, their creator(s)/deities, and the natural entities around them for protection and survival in the harsh life of the Archaic Period. Being killed in the hunt is one danger that they would be trying to protect themselves from, while giving thanks and recognizing the powers guiding their spears thrown from the atlatls would ensure their success in the hunt. As stated in ''Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand: American Indian Art of the Ancient Midwest and South'', "[bannerstones'] craftsmanship and materials suggest that they also served as emblems of prestige and status conferred upon hunters coming of age, and as supernatural talismans for increasing the spear-throwers efficacy. They may also have served as emblems of clans or other social units".&lt;ref&gt;(2004:26)&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because it shows the bannerstone going beyond simple function in the hunt to complex symbolic function in various aspects of society.

==History and context==
Bannerstones, as part of a larger picture, indicate that the societies in which they were a part had greater social organization than those in the past. They also indicate a greater interdependence among tribes of various regions. Brian M. Fagan states that, "the production of elaborate and labor-intensive bannerstones (atlatl weights) and stone vessels makes little sense at a local level, but when produced as objects used in broad exchange networks tied to cooperative alliances, such artifacts have considerable value." This is because, as he further states, "many of the important technological innovations of the Archaic resulted from just such successful alliances which made life more secure in an unpredictable environment of patchy food resources".&lt;ref&gt;(2005:379)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, bannerstones can be seen as indicators of ties between societies in the form of trade, whether it is for the stone that the bannerstone is made out of, the region where the finished bannerstone is found, or the way that it is designed. "Innovations" speak of new ideas entering already existing societies and merging with pre-existing beliefs, resulting in artifacts and art forms such as bannerstones.

Fagan also states, that "from the Mid Archaic onward, people invested more labor in fashioning socially valued artifacts and ornaments like finely ground 'bannerstones'"&lt;ref&gt;(2005:416)&lt;/ref&gt; to be used in the networks of trade and formation of "alliances." Bannerstones were created for more than just strict physical survival; they were created for spiritual survival and wellbeing as a part of a cosmological system of belief that both varied between groups of archaic peoples and connected them in the Eastern Woodlands.

The Laurentian is a period of time in the Late Archaic (c. 3200 to c. 1000 BC) that describes the region from New England to Quebec, down into Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Archaic peoples of this region and time period are one example of a group that produced "polished bannerstones".&lt;ref&gt;(Fagan, 2005:406)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bannerstones eventually went out of use as new technologies were invented and spread by trade routes. This includes the bow and arrow which appeared around or before 500 AD.&lt;ref&gt;(Fagan, 2005: 133)&lt;/ref&gt; While the bannerstones themselves went out of use, the ceremonial and spiritual importance of these objects did not, being transferred to the new objects that replaced them.

==Notable finds==

An important archaic site containing numerous graves containing bannerstones is at Indian Knoll, Kentucky. At this site, "few of the bannerstones show signs of use. [. . .] They are carved of exotic imported stones with an exceptional artistry that exploits the natural colours, patterns, and striations of the stones to afford maximum visual satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;(Berlo et al., 1998:75)&lt;/ref&gt; This shows both the importance of long distance trade in connecting various archaic societies as well as the importance they placed on the visual appeal of the pieces. This visual appeal would be created in part to please the spirits that the individuals were attempting to persuade for assistance and protection in the hunt, society, and the world as a whole.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

{{Culture of Bolivia}}
The constant political turmoil that [[Bolivia]] has experienced throughout its history has slowed the development of '''Bolivian literature'''. Many talents have had to emigrate or were silenced by the internal conflict. In recent years the literature of Bolivia has been in a process of growth, with the appearance of new writers. Older writers such as [[Adela Zamudio]], [[Oscar Alfaro]], and [[Franz Tamayo]] continue to be important.

Nearly half of Bolivia's population speaks indigenous languages such as [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] or [[Guarani language|Guarani]]. The indigenous peoples of Bolivia have a rich oral tradition, as expressed in myths, legends, and stories; these stories generally have not been transcribed in writing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10424">The '''British War Memorials Committee''' was a British Government body that throughout 1918 was responsible for the commissioning of artworks to create a memorial to the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="BEEBtolson"&gt;{{cite web |author=Roger Tolson|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/galleries/collections/imperial-war-museum-690/foreword|title=More about IWM |date=|accessdate=7 October 2014|work=BBC/Your Paintings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee was formed in February 1918 when the Department of Information, which had been responsible for war-time propaganda and also operated a war artists scheme, became the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] with [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] as its Minister. Beaverbrook had been running, from London, the Canadian Government's scheme to commission contemporary art during the First World War and believed Britain would benefit from a similar project. Beaverbrook wanted the British War Memorials Committee to change the direction of Government-sponsored art away from propaganda of short-term value only during the conflict to a collection with a much longer lasting national value. [[Arnold Bennett]], alongside Beaverbrook, was the driving force behind the BWMC and was instrumental in ensuring young artists, including those seen as [[Modernism|modernist]] or [[avant-garde]], were commissioned by the Committee over older British artists, many of whom were associated with the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gough|publisher=Sansom and Company|year=2010|title=A Terrible Beauty: British Artists in the First World War |ISBN=978-1-906593-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The original members of the Committee were,
:::* [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Rothermere]], Chair of the BWMC,
:::* Alfred Yockney, former editor of [[The Art Journal]] and Secretary of the BWMC,
:::* [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]],
:::* [[Arnold Bennett]],
:::* Paul G Konody, art critic,
:::* [[Charles Masterman]], 
:::* [[Muirhead Bone]], artist member,
:::* [[Robbie Ross]], art advisor,
:::* [[Campbell Dodgson]], art advisor,
:::* [[Thomas Derrick (artist)|Thomas Derrick]], art advisor,

Also [[William Orpen]] and [[Henry Tonks]] also acted as advisors to the Committee.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

==Operations==
[[Robbie Ross|Robert Ross]] suggested that by ensuring the artists worked to a set of standard size canvases they would produce pictures with a unified identity that would be appropriate for a national memorial. Ross suggested two sizes, 120 by 144 inches based on [[The Surrender of Breda]] by [[Velasquez]] and 72 by 125 inches, the size of [[The Battle of San Romano]] by [[Paolo Uccello]]. Smaller pictures would also be commissioned and an alternative large size, of 72 by 86 inches would be acceptable. In addition, four 'super-pictures' of 20 feet long by 7 feet high were to be commissioned on the theme of cooperation between Britain and its allies.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt; The paintings were to be housed in a national [[Hall of Remembrance]] which would be built in London.&lt;ref name="USmalley"&gt;{{cite web |author=Ulrike Smalley|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-the-british-government-sponsored-the-arts-in-the-first-world-war |title=How The British Government Sponsored The Arts In The First World War |date=|accessdate=5 April 2017|work=Imperial War Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect [[Charles Holden]] was recalled from France, where he was working for the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|Imperial War Graves Commission]], to design the building. Muirhead Bone described the structure, which was never built, as a "kind of Pavilion", surrounded by a garden, with a main gallery leading to an oratory with a dedication to the "coming Brotherhood of Man for which we all pray."&lt;ref name="BTruth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Cork|publisher=Yale University Press &amp; The Barbican Art Gallery|year=1994|title=A Bitter Truth - Avant Garde Art and the Great War|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BWMC operated three separate schemes, with different terms and conditions, for artists depending on the scale and quantity of work they were expected to produce.

*Scheme One, or the Memorial scheme, was for the production of a single large piece for the central gallery of the Hall of Remembrance for which the artist would be paid £600 for a 20 foot by 7 foot 'super-picture' or £300 for a 72 by 125 or 72 by 86 inch canvas. Smaller works would be bought for £150. Artists on Scheme One contracts included [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Augustus John]], [[Charles Holmes]], [[Walter Bayes]], [[Philip Wilson Steer]], [[George Clausen]] and [[Henry Tonks]].&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt; 
*Scheme Two was designed for younger artists who would be paid £300 per annum, plus any military pay they were receiving, in return for which they would turn over their entire output for six months. During this time they would be allowed no outside work at all, including teaching, but were expected to include one piece in the 'memorial' sizes. Artists on Scheme Two included [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Colin Gill]], [[Bernard Meninsky]], [[William Roberts (painter)|William Roberts]] and [[Henry Rushbury]]. The artists who had previously been working for the Department of Information war artist scheme, such as [[James McBey]], [[Muirhead Bone]] and [[William Orpen]], were also accommodated under this arrangement. The most prolific of the Scheme Two artists was [[John Laviers Wheatley]] who produced some 40 images of Naval subjects. [[Christopher Nevinson]], was offered a Scheme Two contract but refused and eventually agreed to terms closer to that of Scheme One.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;
*Scheme Three gave the BWMC the first option to purchase work in return for facilities and access and was used by [[JD Fergusson]], [[Frank Dobson (sculptor)|Frank Dobson]] and [[William Rothenstein]].

In March 1918 the BWMC submitted a request to the [[War Office]] seeking the release from front-line service of 16 artists. The War Office refused permission for [[Eric Gill]] and [[Jacob Epstein]] to be released, and by the time the Army had processed the requests for [[Stanley Spencer]] and [[Darsie Japp]] the war was almost over. Although Muirhead Bone suggested nineteen well-known, modern women artists, including [[Dora Carrington]] and [[Orovida Pissarro]] for commissions, the BWMC ignored his advice and only recruited three women artists, [[Anna Airy]], [[Dorothy Coke]] and [[Flora Lion]] but did not acquire any paintings from them.&lt;ref name="Beyond"&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Speck|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2014|title=Beyond the Battlefield, Women Artists of Two World Wars|ISBN=978 178023 374 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of pacifists and [[conscientious objector]]s were approached. Both [[Duncan Grant]] and [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]] agreed to work for the Committee but the latter was refused permission by the body supervising conscientious objectors. [[Harold Knight]] refused to do any work that could be used as propaganda.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

==Demise==
The BWMC was not without its opponents; many in the Treasury believed that the Government should not be acting as a patron of the arts and the newly formed [[Imperial War Museum]] considered much of what the Committee was doing as part of their remitt. As a peer and a newspaper owner, Beaverbrook himself attracted controversy. Beaverbrook's rival newspapers attacked the workings of the Committee and [[Robbie Ross]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Gough"/&gt; Towards the end of the war the British government gave permission for the proceeds from any BWMC exhibitions to be donated to war charities. Beaverbrook had already, without informing the Government, registered the title "British War Memorials Fund" as just such a private charity. The Acting Secretary of the Ministry of Information, R W Needham, objected that Beaverbrook had no right to generate income for a private charity by exhibiting Government funded artworks and that the artists involved had all worked for reduced fees in the national interest. If Beaverbrook wanted the BWMC to continue beyond the war as a private charity then it would have to become independent of the Ministry and then appeal directly to the public for funds.&lt;ref name="Harries"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merion Harries &amp; Susie Harries|publisher=Michael Joseph, The Imperial War Museum &amp; the Tate Gallery|year=1983|title=The War Artists, British Official War Art of the Twentieth Century |ISBN=0 7181 2314 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaverbrook abandoned the scheme and the war art collection was brought under the direct control of a new "Pictorial Propaganda Committee" within the Ministry. The Pictorial Propaganda Committee first met on the 24 July 1918 and quickly decided to abandon both the sculpture commissions and the Hall of Remembrance but to maintain the existing painting commissions and to designate the Imperial War Museum, IWM,  as the future, permanent, home of the collection. In January 1919, the Secretary of the BWMC, Alfred Yockney joined the IWM to oversee the transition.&lt;ref name="Harries"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The BWMC left an artistic legacy that included some of the best art to be produced during World War I. This included the seventeen large paintings intended for the Hall of Remembrance, which included [[Gassed (painting)|''Gassed'']] by [[John Singer Sargent]] and ''[[The Menin Road (painting)|The Menin Road]]'' by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], plus two large sculpture reliefs by [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]] and [[Gilbert Ledward]] and smaller canvases produced by a total of thirty-one artists.&lt;ref name="Gough"/&gt; The structure and methods used by the BWMC provided the model on which [[Kenneth Clark]] based the, much larger, [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Gough"/&gt;

'''Deb Margolin''' is an American [[performance artist]] and [[playwright]].  She came to prominence in the 1980s in the [[Feminism|feminist]] [[political theatre]] troupe [[Split Britches]], which she co-founded with [[Lois Weaver]] and [[Peggy Shaw]].&lt;ref name="Case2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sue-Ellen Case|title=Split Britches: Lesbian Practice/Feminist Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbD7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-16559-7|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margolin has since created a string of one-woman shows.  A compilation of her texts, ''Of All The Nerve: Deb Margolin SOLO'', was published in 1999 by Cassell/Continuum Press. Literary theorist [[Lynda Hart]] edited and wrote a commentary on each piece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/theaterstudies/people/margolin.html Yale University lecturer description.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin was the recipient of a 1999-2000 [[Obie Award]] for Sustained Excellence in Performance. In 2005, Margolin won the [[Kesselring Prize]] for her play, ''Three Seconds in the Key,'' a multi-character play which reflected her own experiences with [[Hodgkin's Disease]].

She currently teaches playwrighting and performance as an associate professor at [[Yale University]]. Her  work includes ''O Yes I Will'', a detailed account of her experiences and insights on being under [[general anaesthesia]].

Margolin was forced to revise her 2010 play ''[[Imagining Madoff]]'' after legal threats from [[Elie Wiesel]], who is one of [[Bernard Madoff]]'s victims and had called Madoff a "scoundrel" but had refused to allow a character representing him and using his name to be used in the play.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Patrick.

The '''Deutsches Filminstitut - DIF''' ("German Film Institute") is an institute for the study of film, based in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]].

==History==
The Deutsches Filminstitut was founded on 13 April 1949 as the Deutsches Institut für Filmkunde (DIF). In 1952, the [[Deutsches Filmarchiv]] ("German Film Archive"; founded in [[Marburg]] in 1947 by Hanns Wilhelm Lavies as the Archiv für Filmwissenschaft) was set up as an autonomous department of the DIF, from which it separated again after a reorganisation in 1956.&lt;ref name=Kirchner&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirchner|first=Daniela|title=Film and Television Collections in Europe: The MAP-TV Guide|year=1995|publisher=Blueprint|location=London|isbn= 1857130154 |pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1959, Lavies left the DIF and was succeeded as director by [[Max Lippmann]]. Dr Theo Fürstenau became director in 1966, and in 1981 Dr. Gerd Albrecht. The director from 1 February 1997 until September 2017 was Claudia Dillmann.

On 30 October 1999, the name was officially changed to Deutsches Filminstitut - DIF. In January 2006 the organisation merged with the [[Deutsches Filmmuseum]] ("German Film Museum"), also based in Frankfurt am Main.

==Functions==
The Deutsches Filminstitut has one of the largest film archives in Germany and one of the most comprehensive collections of material on all aspects of [[cinematography]] and [[Film|cinema]].

Current projects include:
* The edition and publication of the censorship decisions of the Berliner Film-Oberprüfstelle ("Berlin Film Inspection Point") from 1920 to 1938
* COLLATE - a collaborative system for the annotation and indexing of archive material
* [[filmportal.de]] - an internet portal for German film
* [[Filmarchives online|filmarchives-online.eu]] - union catalogue of European film archives
* EFG - The [[European Film Gateway]] - a single access point to digital collections held in European film archives and cinémathèques

The DIF is a founding member of the Deutscher Kinemathekenverbund ("German Union of Cinematheques").

The '''Diana and Actaeon basin''' or '''Basin with Scenes from the Myth of Diana and Actaeon''' is a 1613 silver bowl produced by the Dutch silversmith [[Paul van Vianen]]. It shows scenes from the myth of [[Diana and Actaeon]], with a border in the [[Auricular style]]. It is in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, which acquired it in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/BK-16089-A Rijsmuseum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Diesel founder [[Renzo Rosso]] began stitching jeans on a sewing machine at the age of fifteen. He used his mother’s sewing machine to produce low-riding, bell bottomed jeans, which he would wear himself and sell to his friends for 3500 lira a piece. He later attended an industrial textile manufacturing college in [[Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23630820.html |accessdate=March 24, 2015 |title=Fueller of fashion From making his first pair of Diesel jeans on his mother's sewing machine, Renzo Rosso has gone on to create a superbrand |publisher=The Herald |date=June 3, 2006 |author=Nicola McCormack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 Rosso began working for a clothing manufacturer called Moltex, which was owned by [[Adriano Goldschmied]]. After working with the company for two years, he used a loan from his father to buy a 40% holding in the company, which changed its name to Diesel, and marketed [[jeans]] under the Diesel brand and many others.&lt;ref name="OConnor"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/03/06/blue-jean-billionaire-inside-diesel-renzo-rossos-3-billion-denim-empire/ |publisher=Forbes Magazine |title=Blue Jean Billionaire: Inside Diesel, Renzo Rosso’s $3 Billion Fashion Empire |date=March 6, 2013 |accessdate=March 23, 2015 |author=Clare O’Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosso bought out Goldschmied's interest in the Diesel brand name in 1985 for US$500,000, becoming the sole owner of the company.&lt;ref name="OConnor" /&gt; Rosso has said that he learned marketing from the US, creativity from Italy, and systems from Germany.&lt;ref name=india&gt;T Surendar, Saumya Roy (June 30, 2010).

As a result of Russ Togs collapse, the creation of made in the USA Diesel products never came to fruition, and Diesel instead placed its made-in-Italy jeans and clothing in US stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-11684089.html |accessdate=March 24, 2015 |title=Diesel Sportswear Inc.

In 1996, Diesel opened large flagship stores in [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Rome]], and [[London]], and began to open other mono-brand stores for Diesel in order to augment its points of sale in department and other multi-brand retails stores.

==Etymology==
The English usage of the phrase "diwan poetry" comes from the [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] word ''diwan'' (دیوان), which is loaned from [[Persian Language|Persian]], and designated a list or register.&lt;ref name="Rey"&gt;Alain Rey et al., ''Dictionnaire historique de la langue française'', new ed. (Robert, 1995), vol. 1, p. 617.&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian word derived from the Persian ''dibir'' meaning ''writer'' or ''scribe''. ''Diwan'' was also [[Loanword|borrowed]] into [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Arabic]], [[Urdu]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]].&lt;ref name="iranica-divan" /&gt; In Persian, Turkish and other languages the term ''diwan'' came to mean a collection of poems by a single author, as in ''selected works'', or the whole body of work of a poet. Thus ''Diwan-e Mir'' would be the ''Collected works of [[Mir Taqi Mir]]'' and so on. The first use of the term in this sense is attributed to [[Rudaki]].

The term ''divan'' was used in titles of poetic works in French, beginning in 1697,&lt;ref name="Rey" /&gt; but was a rare and didactic usage, though one that was revived by its famous appearance in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[West–östlicher Divan]]'' (Poems of West and East), a work published in 1819 that reflected the poet's abiding interest in Middle Eastern and specifically Persian literature.

This word has also been applied in a similar way to collections of [[Jewish literature#Poetry|Hebrew poetry]] and to poetry of [[al-Andalus]].

==Symbolism==
[[File:Divan-of-Hafiz-Binding-Gul-u-Bulbul.jpg|thumb|Rose and nightingale on the binding of a Divan of Hafiz (Iran, 1842)]]
Ottoman Divan poetry was a highly [[ritual]]ized and [[symbol]]ic art form. From the Persian poetry that largely inspired it, it inherited a wealth of [[symbol]]s whose meanings and interrelationships—both of similitude (مراعات نظير ''mura'ât-i nazîr'' / تناسب
''tenâsüb'') and opposition (تضاد ''tezâd'')—were more or less prescribed. Examples of prevalent symbols that, to some extent, oppose one another include, among others:

* the [[nightingale]] (بلبل ''bülbül'') – the [[rose]] (ﮔل ''gül'')
* the world (جهان ''cihan''; عالم ''‘âlem'') – the rosegarden (ﮔﻠﺴﺘﺎن ''gülistan''; ﮔﻠﺸﻦ ''gülşen'')
* the ascetic (زاهد ''zâhid'') – the [[dervish]] (درويش ''derviş'')

As the opposition of "the ascetic" and "the dervish" suggests, Divan poetry—much like Turkish folk poetry—was heavily influenced by [[Sufism#Basic beliefs|Sufi thought]]. One of the primary characteristics of Divan poetry, however—as of the Persian poetry before it—was its mingling of the mystical Sufi element with a profane and even erotic element. Thus, the pairing of "the nightingale" and "the rose" simultaneously suggests two different relationships:

* the relationship between the fervent lover ("the nightingale") and the inconstant beloved ("the rose")
* the relationship between the individual Sufi practitioner (who is often characterized in Sufism as a lover) and [[Allah|God]] (who is considered the ultimate source and object of love)

Similarly, "the world" refers simultaneously to the physical world and to this physical world considered as the abode of sorrow and impermanence, while "the rosegarden" refers simultaneously to a literal garden and to [[Heaven#In Islam|the garden of Paradise]]. "The nightingale", or suffering lover, is often seen as situated—both literally and figuratively—in "the world", while "the rose", or beloved, is seen as being in "the rosegarden".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Walter G.|last2=Kalpaklı|first2=Mehmet|title=The age of beloveds : love and the beloved in early-modern Ottoman and European culture and society|date=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=0-8223-3424-0|edition=2. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divan poetry was composed through the constant juxtaposition of many such images within a strict metrical framework, thus allowing numerous potential meanings to emerge. A brief example is the following line of verse, or ''mısra'' (مصراع), by the 18th-century [[Qadi|judge]] and poet Hayatî Efendi:

:بر گل مى وار بو گلشن ﻋالمدﻪ خارسز
:''Bir gül mü var bu gülşen-i ‘âlemde hârsız''&lt;ref&gt;Pala, İskender (1995) ''Divân Şiiri Antolojisi: Dîvânü'd-Devâvîn'' Akçağ Yayınları, Kızılay, Ankara, p. 425, {{ISBN|975-338-081-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:("Does any rose, in this rosegarden world, lack thorns?")

Here, the nightingale is only implied (as being the poet/lover), while the rose, or beloved, is shown to be capable of inflicting pain with its thorns (خار ''hâr''). The world, as a result, is seen as having both positive aspects (it is a rosegarden, and thus analogous to the garden of Paradise) and negative aspects (it is a rosegarden full of thorns, and thus different from the garden of Paradise).

==Development==
[[File:Ottoman Garden.jpg|thumb|upright|Ottoman garden party, with poet, guest, and winebearer; from the 16th-century ''Dîvân-ı Bâkî'']]
As for the development of Divan poetry over the more than 500 years of its existence, that is—as the Ottomanist Walter G. Andrews points out—a study still in its infancy;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, ''Ottoman Lyric Poetry: An Anthology'', 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; clearly defined movements and periods have not yet been decided upon. Early in the history of the tradition, the Persian influence was very strong, but this was mitigated somewhat through the influence of poets such as the [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] [[Nesîmî]] (?–1417?) and the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] [[Alisher Navoi|Ali Şîr Nevâî]] (1441–1501), both of whom offered strong arguments for the poetic status of the Turkic languages as against the much-venerated Persian. Partly as a result of such arguments, Divan poetry in its strongest period—from the 16th to the 18th centuries—came to display a unique balance of Persian and Turkish elements, until the Persian influence began to predominate again in the early 19th century.

Despite the lack of certainty regarding the stylistic movements and periods of Divan poetry, however, certain highly different styles are clear enough, and can perhaps be seen as exemplified by certain poets:
[[File:Fuzuli.jpg|thumb|100px|Fuzûlî (1483?–1556), Divan poet of [[Azerbaijanis|Azeri]] origin]]
* [[Fuzûlî]] (1483?–1556); a unique poet who wrote with equal skill in Azeri Turkish,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rollberg. The modern encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet literature (including Non-Russian and Emigre literatures) / Edited by Harry B. Weber. — Academic International Press, 1987. — Volume 8. — Page 76. &lt;blockquote&gt;In Mesopotamia Fuzuli was in intimate contact with three cultures — Turkic, Arabic, and Persian. '''Besides his native Azeri''', he learned Arabic and Persian at an early age and acquired a through command of the literatures in all three languages, an accomplishment in which the cosmopolitan literary and scholarly circles of Hilla played an important role.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Persian, and Arabic, and who came to be as influential in Persian as in Divan poetry
* [[Bâkî]] (1526–1600); a poet of great rhetorical power and linguistic subtlety whose skill in using the pre-established [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] of the Divan tradition is quite representative of the poetry in the time of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Süleyman the Magnificent]]
* Nef‘î (1570?–1635); a poet considered the master of the ''kasîde'' (a kind of [[panegyric]]), as well as being known for his harshly satirical poems, which led to his [[Capital punishment|execution]]
* [[Yusuf Nabi|Nâbî]] (1642–1712); a poet who wrote a number of socially oriented poems critical of the [[Stagnation of the Ottoman Empire|stagnation period]] of Ottoman history
* [[Nedîm]] (1681?–1730); a revolutionary poet of the [[Tulip period|Tulip Era]] of Ottoman history, who infused the rather élite and abstruse language of Divan poetry with numerous simpler, populist elements
* Şeyh Gâlib (1757–1799); a poet of the [[Mevlevi|Mevlevî]] [[Tariqah|Sufi order]] whose work is considered the culmination of the highly complex so-called "Indian style" (سبك هندى ''sebk-i hindî'')

The vast majority of Divan poetry was [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] in nature: either ''gazel''s (which make up the greatest part of the repertoire of the tradition), or ''kasîde''s. There were, however, other common genres, most particularly the ''mesnevî'', a kind of [[Courtly romance|verse romance]] and thus a variety of [[narrative poetry]]; the two most notable examples of this form are the ''[[Leyli and Majnun|Leylî vü Mecnun]]'' (ليلى و مجنون) of Fuzûlî and the ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (حسن و عشق; "Beauty and Love") of Şeyh Gâlib.

==Urdu variation==
In [[Urdu poetry]] diwan are also a collection of poems, but here they are mainly [[ghazal]]s.&lt;ref name="introduction"&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urduhindilinks/bailey/000introduction.pdf ''A History of Urdu literature''] by T. Grahame Bailey; ''Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12158">The following is a '''list of unproduced Don Bluth projects''' in roughly chronological order. During a career that has spanned over 40 years, [[Don Bluth]] has worked on projects which never progressed beyond the [[pre-production]] stage under his direction.

==1970s==

===''Piper''===
* An animated short film based on the famous ''[[Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' story was in the works in the early 1970s. Not much is known about this short but bits and pieces can be found online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WHDRFl0rSs|title=Sections of Piper Short|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/DonBluth/status/940981302722887680&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s==

===''East of the Sun and West of the Moon''===
* In the early 1980s, Bluth Productions began work on an animated feature film entitled ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon#Film adaptations|East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant, p 35, ''Masters of Animation'',  Special Effects Are Revolutionizing Film"&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the film was never made due to a loss of financial backing,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Bluth animation film goes bankrupt," ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #98 (May 1985), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; even though the film was heavily into production at the time of its cancellation. They decided to make ''[[An American Tail]]'' as its 2nd animated film, starting production in December 1984 and released in November 1986.

===''The Velveteen Rabbit''===
* One of the animated films that Don Bluth was going to work with [[Steven Spielberg]] on, where it is an animation adaptation of the story ''[[The Velveteen Rabbit]]'', which is about a toy rabbit trying to become a real rabbit after his beloved human child owner is forced to abandon him.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.imgur.com/gallery/2wjY1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Laserdisc arcade games''===
Plans for other arcade games similar to ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'' and ''[[Space Ace]]'' such as:
*'''The Sea Beast''', where a 1940s sailor named Barnacle Bill tries to rescue a mermaid princess from a nasty sea beast.
*'''Jason and the Golden Fleece''', based on the famous Greek legend [[Jason (Greek mythology)|Jason]].
*'''Devil's Island''', where you play a shipwreck passenger trying to find treasure, rescue a jungle princess and take down a corrupt civilization.
*'''Haywire''', where you play a [[Charlie Chaplin]] like character trying to survive and escape a huge factory run by an evil business man.
*'''Drac''', where [[Van Helsing]] has to save his girlfriend from [[Dracula]] and his monster minions of evil before she becomes one of his brides.
*'''Cro Magnon''', where you play a [[Cro-Magnon|Cro Magnon]] caveman as he battles vicious dinosaurs, scary creatures and an evil warlord.
*'''Sorceress''', where you control a sorceress to protect her island from temple robbers and poachers.
Due to the [[Video game crash of 1983|1983 video game crash]], leading to the bankruptcy of both Bluth and [[Cinematronics]], these ideas were scrapped, with the only laserdisc game released by Bluth was ''[[Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp]]'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/donbluth/status/664179126303985664&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Star Baby''===
* An animated film that Don Bluth was going to work with Steven Spielberg. No info on this unmade film has been found yet, but was hinted to be an outer space adventure like movie.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.imgur.com/gallery/2wjY1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Strawberry Fields Forever''===
* After acquiring the rights to [[The Beatles]]{{'}} songs in the mid-1980's, [[Michael Jackson]] approached Bluth with a movie idea called ''Strawberry Fields Forever''. The film would have had animated ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''-style vignettes featuring Beatles songs, similar to ''[[Yellow Submarine (album)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Not only did Don Bluth agree to it, he also planned on making it entirely in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. Had the movie been made, it would have predated the ground-breaking ''[[Toy Story]]'' by about eight years. Further along in the project, the premise became revamped so that characters from Beatles songs (like [[Mean Mr. Mustard|Mr. Mustard]] and [[I Am the Walrus|the Walrus]]) would act as New York City gangsters. Among other reasons, the main reason why the project fell through was because the surviving Beatles members denied permission to use their images in an animated film. The only part of the film that managed to be made was test footage of the "Beatles gangsters."&lt;ref&gt;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WhatCouldHaveBeen/UnsortedAnimatedFilm&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Satyrday''===
* An animated film that Don Bluth was going to make with Steven Spielberg and [[George Lucas]]. The project is based on a story by [[Steven Bauer]] where a young boy in a fantasy world goes on a quest to get the moon back and save the sun from evil forces. Some of the film's concepts latter went into the French animated film ''[[Mune: Guardian of the Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.imgur.com/gallery/2wjY1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Little Blue Whale''===
* An animated film about a little girl and her animal friends try to protect a little whale from evil whalers. The project was canceled by its co-production studio [[Carolco Pictures]] after the commercial and critically failure of its first animated film ''[[Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.imgur.com/gallery/2wjY1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Beauty and the Beast''===
* An animated feature film adaptation of the classic fairy tale directed by Don Bluth. While some concept arts were made in 1984, the film's production was canceled when Don Bluth and the film's distributor [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] heard the news of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] making an animated film with the [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;https://m.imgur.com/gallery/2wjY1&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s==

===''Kandu: Song of the Ice Whale''===
* An animated feature film that involves whales but more of a discovery experience through a whale's eye with a beautiful score and narration. While storyboards, where made in 1991, the film's production, was canceled due to problems with studios and Don Bluth was working on other productions in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.imgur.com/gallery/2wjY1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jawbreaker''===
* A TV mini-series of a boy finds a magical tooth, while a video showed a clip of what the show is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dragonslairthemovie.com/jawbreaker-story/ “Jawbreaker” Story]&lt;/ref&gt; The mini-series' production was shut down when Don Bluth started [[Fox Animation Studios]].

===''The Magic Pencils''===
* A canceled animated short film that was centered around a magical talking pencils starring [[Dom DeLuise]], until Don Bluth started Fox Animation Studios.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.imgur.com/gallery/2wjY1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Deep Wizardry''===
* A rumor was said that after Don Bluth and Fox Animation Studios would release ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' one of their next films was going to be an animated film based on the book ''[[Deep Wizardry]]'' by [[Diane Duane]]. However nothing came through and the project was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WhatCouldHaveBeen/UnsortedAnimatedFilm&lt;/ref&gt;   

===''Quintaglio Ascension''===
* One of Don Bluth and Fox Animation Studios' next films after ''Anastasia'' was going to be a animated film based on the ''[[Quintaglio Ascension]]'' trilogy by [[Robert J. Sawyer]]. But nothing new came and it's production was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WhatCouldHaveBeen/UnsortedAnimatedFilm&lt;/ref&gt; 

===''Ice Age''===
* The film was planned to be a comedy-less drama similar to ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', but due to the closure of Fox Animation Studios and the box office disaster of ''[[Titan A.E.]]'' the film was lent over to [[Blue Sky Studios]] who turned it into a dramedy.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.imgur.com/gallery/2wjY1&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Belgariad''===
* Another animated film that was going to be planed by Don Bluth and Fox Animation Studios was a animated film based on ''[[The Belgariad]]'' series by [[David Eddings]]. However the production for that film was canceled after nothing came through.&lt;ref&gt;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WhatCouldHaveBeen/UnsortedAnimatedFilm&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
===''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''===
* When [[20th Century Fox]] got the rights to ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series by [[Douglas Adams]], they wanted Don Bluth and Fox Animation Studios to make an animated film of it. But production was canceled when problems happened at Fox Animation Studios and [[Touchstone Pictures]] got the rights to make movie from Fox which became [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the live-action film of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WhatCouldHaveBeen/UnsortedAnimatedFilm&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==

===''I-Ninja 2''===
* A sequel to the 2003 game ''[[I-Ninja]]'' was planned, which had input from Bluth. Work on the sequel started soon after the first game's release, but its studio [[Argonaut Games]] had some economic problems and eventually closed down in October 2004. The few aspects remaining from ''I-Ninja 2''{{'s}} development are some concept drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2009/12/03/i-ninja-2-ps2-xbox-gamecube-cancelled/|title=I-Ninja 2 Cancelled|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pac-Man Adventures''===
* Originally planned to have worked on in partnership with [[Namco]] around 2003. The project was scrapped due to financial problems on Namco's part leading to their merger with [[Bandai]] in 2007 and whatever development assets were left over was made into ''[[Pac Man World 3]]'' with no involvement from Bluth.&lt;ref&gt;http://ecollections.scad.edu/iii/cpro/DigitalItemViewPage.external?lang=eng&amp;sp=1000278&amp;sp=T&amp;sp=Pall%2CRu1000001%40%2CQdon+bluth&amp;suite=def&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/donbluth/status/677270407037059072&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010s==

===''Dragon's Lair'' film===
* In the 1980s a film version of ''Dragon's Lair'' was planned, with [[Alan Dean Foster]] involved in shaping the story. The project fell apart due to low interest from other studios.&lt;ref&gt;Cawley, John. ''[http://www.cataroo.com/DBtvfeat.html Games on TV and The Big Screen]''&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 2015, Bluth and Goldman started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to create a teaser for an animated feature-length ''Dragon's Lair'' prequel film, their first feature film since ''Titan A.E.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/donbluth/dragons-lair-the-movie?ref=video |title=Dragon’s Lair: The Movie (Canceled) by Don Bluth &amp; Gary Goldman — Kickstarter |website=Kickstarter.com |date= |accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kickstarter funding was canceled when not enough funds were made close to the deadline, but an [[Indiegogo]] page for the project was created in its place.&lt;ref name= "indiegogo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/dragon-s-lair-returns/x/12369452 |title=Dragons Lair Returns |website=Indiegogo.com |date= |accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, 2015, the Indiegogo campaign reached its goal of $250,000 to produce a teaser, 14 days after the campaign launched, and got more than twice the budget on January 16, 2016.&lt;ref name = indiegogo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/10/26/9617632/dragons-lair-movie-kickstarter-don-bluth |title=Dragon's Lair creators turn to Kickstarter to raise money for Dragon's Lair: The Movie - Polygon |accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bluth and Goldman have announced that the film will provide more backstory for Dirk and Daphne and that Daphne will show that she is not a "blonde airhead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragons-lair-movie-wont-depict-sexualized-version-/1100-6433325/ |title=Dragon's Lair Movie Won't Depict "Sexualized" Version of Princess Daphne - GameSpot |accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there have been no further production news.

The purpose of dorkbot meetings is to nurture a local electronic arts community and to encourage emerging, and established, artists to present new works for informal peer review.  While many of the dorkbot groups hold their meetings at universities and students are encouraged to attend, dorkbot meetings are not restricted in any way to the academic community.  Dorkbot groups encourage the free exchange of ideas on the electronic arts, and regular attendees of one dorkbot will often visit another when they are travelling, serving as informal ambassadors between groups.

'''Ecclesiastical heraldry''' refers to the use of [[heraldry]] within the [[Christian Church]] for dioceses and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[clergy]]. Initially used to mark documents, [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] heraldry evolved as a system for identifying people and [[diocese]]s. It is most formalized within the [[Catholic Church]], where most [[bishop]]s, including the [[Pope]], have a personal [[coat of arms]]. Clergy in [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches follow similar customs, as do institutions such as schools and dioceses.

Ecclesiastical heraldry differs notably from other heraldry in the use of special insignia around the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] to indicate rank in a church or [[religious denomination|denomination]]. The most prominent of these insignia is the low crowned, wide brimmed ecclesiastical hat, commonly the Roman [[galero]]. The color and ornamentation of this hat indicate rank. [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] are famous for the "red hat", but other offices and other churches have distinctive hat colors, such as black for ordinary clergy and green for bishops, customarily with a number of [[tassel]]s increasing with rank.

Other insignia include the processional [[Christian cross|cross]], the [[mitre]] and the [[crosier]]. Eastern traditions favor the use of their own style of head gear and crosier, and the use of the [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]] or cloak rather than the ecclesiastical hat. The [[motto]] and certain shapes of shields are more common in ecclesiastical heraldry, while [[supporters]] and [[crest (heraldry)|crests]] are less common. The [[papal coats of arms]] have their own heraldic customs, primarily the [[Papal Tiara]] (or mitre), the keys of [[Saint Peter]], and the [[ombrellino]] (umbrella). Pope Benedict XVI replaced the use of the Papal Tiara in his coat of arms with a mitre. He was the first pope to do so, despite the fact that [[Pope Paul VI]] was the last pope to be [[Papal coronation|crowned with the tiara]].  The arms of institutions have slightly different traditions, using the mitre and crozier more often than is found in personal arms, though there is a wide variation in uses by different churches.  The arms used by organizations are called impersonal or corporate arms.

==History==
[[File:Archbishop Stefan Insignia.png|thumb|right|120px|12th-century [[seal (device)|seal]] of [[Stefan (archbishop of Uppsala)|Stefan]] of [[Archbishop of Uppsala|Uppsala]]]]
[[File:Siegel Tempelritter (Cropped).png|thumb|right|120px|Reproduction of a medieval [[Knights Templar Seal]]]]
[[File:LutherRose.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Luther rose|personal seal]] of [[Martin Luther]] from 1530, now a symbol of Lutheranism]]
[[Heraldry]] developed in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] from the late 11th century, originally as a system of personal badges of the warrior classes, which served, among other purposes, as identification on the battlefield. The same insignia were used on [[seal (device)|seals]] to identify documents. The earliest seals bore a likeness of the owner of the seal, with the shield and heraldic insignia included.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''Debrett's Guide'', p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the seals were reduced to just the shield.

The Church likewise identified the origin and ownership of documents and buildings with seals, which were typically a pointed oval called a vesica to distinguish from round seals in non-religious use.&lt;ref name="CathEncyEcclesiasticalHeraldry"&gt;{{CathEncy | wstitle=Ecclesiastical Heraldry | short=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward I of England]] decreed in 1307 that all legal documents required a seal.{{sfn|Rogers|1956|p=134}} These seals initially depicted a person, but as secular seals began to depict only a shield, clergy likewise used seals with heraldic insignia.{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|pp=223–224}} Personal seals of bishops and [[abbot]]s continued to be used after their deaths, gradually becoming an impersonal seal.{{sfn|Rogers|1956|p=134}} Clergy tended to replace military devices with clerical devices. The shield was retained, but ecclesiastical hats often replaced helmets and [[coronet]]s. In some religious arms a [[Human skull|skull]] replaces the helmet.&lt;ref&gt;Neubecker, ''Heraldry'', p.237.&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of Church heraldry developed significantly in the 17th century when a system for ecclesiastical hats attributed to Pierre Palliot came into use.&lt;ref&gt;Selvester, [http://www.guyselvester.50megs.com/custom4.html Aspects of Heraldry] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060827045955/http://www.guyselvester.50megs.com/custom4.html |date=2006-08-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The full system of emblems around the shield was regulated in the Catholic Church by the letter of [[Pope Pius X]] ''Inter multiplices curas'' of February 21, 1905, while the composition of the shield itself was regulated through the Heraldry Commission of the [[Roman Curia]] until this office was abolished by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Noonan, ''The Church Visible'', p.188.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' ceased publishing the arms of Cardinals and previous Popes after 1969. International custom and national law govern limited aspects of Church heraldry, but shield composition is now largely guided by expert advice. Archbishop [[Bruno Heim]], a noted ecclesiastical [[armory (heraldry)|armorist]] (designer of arms), said

{{quote|Ecclesiastical heraldry is not determined by heraldic considerations alone, but also by [[doctrine|doctrinal]], [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[canon law|canonical]] factors. It not only produces arms denoting members of the ecclesiastical state but shows the rank of the bearer.... In the eyes of the Church it is sufficient to determine who has a right to bear an ecclesiastical coat of arms and under what conditions the different insignia are acquired or lost... The design of [[prelate|prelatial]] arms is often a disastrous defiance of the rules of heraldry, if only as a breach of good taste.{{sfn|Heim|1978|pp=43–45}}}}

A similar system for the [[Church of England]] was approved in 1976.{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|pp=225–226}} The traditions of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] heraldry have less developed regulation. Eastern secular coats of arms often display a shield before a mantle topped with a crown. Eastern clergy often display coats of arms according to this style, replacing the crown with an appropriate hat drawn from liturgical use.

Marking documents is the most common use of arms in the Church today. A Roman Catholic bishop's coat of arms was formerly painted on miniature wine barrels and presented during the ordination ceremony.{{sfn|Rogers|1956|p=133}}{{sfn|Heim|1978|p=115}} Cardinals may place their coat of arms outside the church of their title in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm "Instruction"], 1969, n.28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Impersonal arms are often used as the banner of a school or religious community.

==Shield==
[[File:COAabbess.png|thumb|right|100px|Arms of an abbess displayed on a [[lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]] with [[crosier]] turned left]]
The [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] is the normal device for displaying a coat of arms. Clergy have used less-military shapes such as the oval [[cartouche]], but the shield has always been a clerical option. Clergy in [[Italy]] often use a shield shaped like a horse's face-armor. Clergy in [[South Africa]] sometimes follow the national style using a [[Nguni shield]].&lt;ref&gt;von Volborth, ''Heraldry of the World'', p.176.; See the [[coat of arms of Botswana]], of [http://www.civicheraldry.com/page/11666 Guateng], or the [http://www.kwazulunatal.gov.za/ KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222231212/http://www.kwazulunatal.gov.za/ |date=2007-12-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Women traditionally display their coats of arms on a diamond-shaped [[lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]]; [[abbess]]es follow this tradition or use the cartouche.

===Personal design===
In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], unless a new bishop has a family coat of arms, he typically adopts within his shield symbols that indicate his interests or past service. Devotion to a particular [[saint]] is represented by symbols established in [[iconography]] and heraldic tradition. In the Church of England, new bishops typically choose a coat that looks entirely non-clerical, not least because their descendants may seek reassignment of the arms, and few of them are likely to be clerics.

The first rule of heraldry is the [[rule of tincture]]: "Colour must not appear upon colour, nor metal upon metal."{{sfn|Heim|1978|p=9}} The heraldic metals are [[or (heraldry)|gold]] and [[argent|silver]], usually represented as yellow and white, while red, green, blue, purple and black normally comprise the colors. Heraldic bearings are intended for recognition at a distance (in battle), and a contrast of light metal against dark color is desirable. The same principle can be seen in the choice of colors for most [[vehicle registration plate|license plates]].

This rule of tincture is often broken in clerical arms: the flag and arms of [[Vatican City]] notably have yellow (gold) and white (silver) placed together. In [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] tradition, colors have a mystical interpretation. Because gold and silver express sublimity and solemnity, combinations of the two are often used regardless of the rule of tincture.{{sfn|Heim|1978|p=102}}

===Marshalling===
[[File:COAanglicanmarried.gif|thumb|left|120px|Arms of an Anglican bishop marshalled with those of the diocese (left shield) and spouse (right shield)]]
If a bishop is a diocesan bishop, it is customary for him to combine his arms with the arms of the diocese following normal heraldic rules.{{sfn|Rogers|1956|p=134}} This combining is termed [[Heraldry#Marshalling|marshalling]], and is normally accomplished by [[impalement (heraldry)|impalement]], placing the arms of the diocese to the viewer's left (''dexter'' in heraldry) and the personal arms to the viewer's right. The arms of [[Thomas Arundel]] are found impaled with those of the [[See of Canterbury]] in a document from 1411.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', p.119.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]], [[quartering (heraldry)|quartering]] is the norm rather than impalement. [[Guy Selvester]], an American ecclesiastical heraldist, says if arms are not designed with care, marshalling can lead to "busy", crowded shields. Crowding can be reduced by placing a smaller shield overlapping the larger shield, known as an [[inescutcheon]] or an escutcheon surtout. In the arms of [[Heinrich Mussinghoff]], [[Bishop of Aachen]], the personal arms are placed in front of the diocesan arms, but the opposite arrangement is found in front on the arms of [[Paul Gregory Bootkoski]], Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Metuchen|Metuchen]].&lt;ref&gt;See arms of [[:File:Heinrich Mussinghoff Aachen CoA.svg|Heinrich Mussinghoff]] and [http://www.diometuchen.org/mainweb/coat.htm Paul Bootkoski] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928154405/http://www.diometuchen.org/mainweb/coat.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Heim|1978|pp=56–57}} [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]] sometimes combine their personal arms with the arms of the Pope who named them a cardinal. As [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household|Prefect of the Pontifical Household]], Jacques Martin impaled his personal arms with those of three successive pontiffs.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Heraldry in the Vatican'', p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; A married Church of England bishop combines his arms with those of his wife and the diocese on two separate shields placed ''accollé'', or side-by-side.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, ''Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', p.119.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholicism in Great Britain|Roman Catholic bishops in England]] historically used only their personal arms, as dioceses established by the [[Holy See|See of Rome]] are not part of the official state [[Church of England]] and cannot be recognized in law,&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p.465&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rogers|1956|p=133}} though in Scotland the legal situation has been different and many Roman Catholic dioceses have arms. If a [[suffragan bishop|suffragan]] or [[auxiliary bishop]] has a personal coat of arms, he does not combine it with the arms of the diocese he serves.&lt;ref name="CathEncyEcclesiasticalHeraldry"/&gt;

==Around the shield==

[[File:Coat of arms of Anselm van der Linde.svg|thumb|Arms of an Territorial Abbot]]
The shield is the core of heraldry, but other elements are placed above, below, and around the shield, and are usually collectively called external ornaments.&lt;ref name="CathEncyEcclesiasticalHeraldry"/&gt; The entire composition is called the achievement of arms or the armorial bearings. Some of these accessories are unique to Church armory or differ notably from those which normally accompany a shield.

===Ecclesiastical hat===
The ecclesiastical hat is a distinctive part of the achievement of arms of a Roman Catholic cleric. This hat, called a [[galero]], was originally a pilgrim's hat like a sombrero. It was granted in red to cardinals by [[Pope Innocent IV]] at the [[First Council of Lyon]] in the 13th century, and was adopted by heraldry almost immediately. The galero in various colors and forms was used in heraldic achievements starting with its adoption in the arms of bishops in the 16th century. In the 19th century the galero was viewed heraldically as specifically "Catholic",&lt;ref&gt;Selvester, [http://www.guyselvester.50megs.com/custom4.html Aspects of Heraldry] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060827045955/http://www.guyselvester.50megs.com/custom4.html |date=2006-08-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Public Register of Arms in Scotland show Roman Catholic, presbyterian Church of Scotland and Anglican Episcopalian clergy all using the wide brimmed, low crowned hat. The galero is ornamented with tassels (also called ''houppes'' or ''fiocchi'') indicating the cleric's current place in the hierarchy; the number became significant beginning in the 16th century, and the meaning was fixed, for Catholic clergy, in 1832.{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|pp=226–227}} A bishop's galero is green with six tassels on each side; the color originated in [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Spain]] where formerly a green hat was actually worn by bishops.{{sfn|Heim|1978|p=69}} A [[territorial abbot]] was equivalent to a bishop and used a green galero. An [[archbishop]]'s galero is green but has ten tassels. [[Roman Catholicism in Switzerland|Bishops in Switzerland]] formerly used ten tassels like an archbishop because they were under the immediate jurisdiction of the Holy See and not part of an archiepiscopal [[ecclesiastical province|province]].{{sfn|Heim|1978|p=95}} Both [[patriarch]]s and cardinals have hats with fifteen tassels. A cardinal's hat is red or scarlet while a patriarch who is not also a cardinal uses a green hat; the patriarch's tassels are interwoven with gold.&lt;ref name="CathEncyEcclesiasticalHeraldry"/&gt; [[primate (bishop)|Primates]] may use the same external ornaments as patriarchs.{{sfn|Heim|1978|p=107}}&lt;ref&gt;Lartigue, ''Dictionnaire &amp; Armorial'', contains examples of 19th-century archiepiscopal arms with 30 tassels, e.g. Lyonnet (p.236b), De Breil (p.134b), Forcade (p.150b), Fruchaud (p.172a).&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of the galero in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist's style. The top of the hat may be shown flat or round. Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a domed top it can look like a [[cappello romano]] with tassels, but in heraldry it is still called a galero. The tassels may be represented as knotted cords.
[[File:Zen motto.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Arms of Bishop [[Joseph Cardinal Zen|Joseph Zen]] of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] with the simple [[Christian cross#Forms of the Cross|Latin cross]], and a violet galero (prior to his elevation to cardinal priest)]]
An exception is made for [[Roman Catholicism in China|Chinese bishops]], who avoid using a green hat in their arms since "to wear a green hat" is a Chinese idiom for [[cuckold]]ry.&lt;ref&gt;The title of the film ''The Green Hat'' comes from this idiom, according to reviews by the [http://2005.adelaidefilmfestival.org/films/greenhat.html Adelaide]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218033811/http://2005.adelaidefilmfestival.org/films/greenhat.html |date=2007-12-18 }} and [http://www.tribecafilmfestival.org/tixSYS/archive/eventnote.php?EventNumber=20042866 Tribeca]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} film festivals. Accessed 2007-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than green, these bishops use a variety of colors from violet and black to blue, or scarlet if a cardinal. A cross behind the shield denotes a bishop.

Lesser Roman Catholic prelates use a variety of colors. Violet hats were once actually worn by certain [[monsignor]]s,{{sfn|Heim|1978|pp=69–70, 118–119}} and so in heraldry they have used a violet hat with red or violet tassels in varying numbers, currently fixed at six on each side. The lowest grade of monsignor, a [[Chaplain of His Holiness]], uses a black hat with violet tassels.{{sfn|Heim|1978|pp=119–121}} The [[superior general]] of an order displays a black galero with six tassels on each side, while provincial superiors and abbots use a black galero with six or three tassels on each side, although [[Premonstratensian|Norbertines]] (White Canons) use a white galero. Although a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] would rarely assume arms unless he had an ancestral right to arms independent of his clerical state, a priest would use a simple black ecclesiastical hat with a single tassel on each side. Priests who hold an office such as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] would have two tassels on each side.{{sfn|Heim|1978|pp=124–125}}

Clergy of the [[Church of England]] who were not bishops historically bore arms identical to a [[laity|layman]], with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 a system for [[dean (religion)|deans]], [[archdeacon]]s and [[canon (priest)|canons]] was authorized by the [[College of Arms]], allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red tassels on each side.{{sfn|Heim|1978|pp=135,139–142}}&lt;ref&gt;von Volborth, ''The Art of Heraldry'', p.71.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|pp=225–226}} A priest uses a black and white cord with a single tassel on each side, and a [[deacon]] a hat without tassels. A [[Doctor of Divinity]] may have cords interwoven with red and a hat appropriate to the degree, and members of the [[Ecclesiastical Household]] add a [[Tudor rose]] on the front of the hat. According to ''Boutell's Heraldry'', this system represents the practice of the Church in England in the 16th century.{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|p=226}}

Within [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Church heraldry, a minister's hat is represented as black with a single tassel on each side, sometimes blue, though a doctoral bonnet or Geneva cap may replace the brimmed hat.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p.470; See [http://heraldry-scotland.com/HSSforum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=83&amp;sid=7a7ba8957d9a4b28e0b855aceb887f9f arms of Rev. Denis Towner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928180026/http://heraldry-scotland.com/HSSforum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=83&amp;sid=7a7ba8957d9a4b28e0b855aceb887f9f |date=2007-09-28 }}. As can be seen in the Scots Public Register the term 'ecclesiastical hat' can be shown as a Geneva bonnet but this is done only rarely.&lt;/ref&gt; Clergy of the [[Chapel Royal]] display red tassels. The office of [[presbyterian polity|moderator]] does not have corporate arms,&lt;ref&gt;Innes of Learney, ''Scots Heraldry'', p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; but for official occasions, a moderator may add tassels to his personal arms to indicate parity with offices of other churches: three for a moderator of a presbytery, and six for a moderator of a regional synod.&lt;ref&gt;Innes of Learney, ''Scots Heraldry'', p.35–37; [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9031885 "Ecclesiastical Heraldry"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[moderator of the General Assembly]] of the Church of Scotland now uses a differenced version of the General Assembly's arms, with a hat having a blue cord and ten tassels on each side, and may also show the moderator's staff, a gold Celtic crosier, behind the shield as can be seen in vol 41, p 152 of the Scots Public Register.

===Cross===
[[File:Brasão de Dom Antônio de Castro Mayer.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Coat of arms of the Bishop [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]], carved in a wooden door in a Church.]]

In the Catholic Church, display of a cross behind the shield is restricted to bishops as a mark of their dignity.{{sfn|Rogers|1956|p=139}} The cross of an ordinary bishop has a single horizontal bar or traverse, also known as a [[Christian cross#Forms of the Cross|Latin cross]]. A [[patriarch]] uses the [[patriarchal cross]] with two traverses, also called the [[cross of Lorraine]]. The papal cross has three traverses, but this is never displayed behind the papal arms.

Beginning in the 15th century, the cross with a double traverse is seen on the arms of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes.{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|p=227}}&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy | wstitle=Processional Cross | short=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for cardinals of the [[Roman Curia]], most cardinals head an archdiocese and use an [[archiepiscopal cross]] on their arms. Other cardinals use a simple Latin cross,&lt;ref&gt;Noonan, ''The Church Visible'', p.191–192,194.&lt;/ref&gt; as is found in the arms of Cardinal [[Joseph Zen]], [[Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong|bishop emeritus of Hong Kong]], because Hong Kong is not an archdiocese.

Today all cardinals are required to be bishops, but priests named cardinal at an advanced age often petition the Pope for an exception to this rule. [[Bruno Heim]] says that since the cross is one heraldic emblem that only bishops have the right to bear, cardinals who are not bishops do not use it.{{sfn|Heim|1978|p=74}}&lt;ref&gt;Selvester, [http://www.guyselvester.50megs.com/custom4.html Aspects of Heraldry] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060827045955/http://www.guyselvester.50megs.com/custom4.html |date=2006-08-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples are Cardinals [[Albert Vanhoye]] and [[Avery Dulles]]; the latter's arms do display a cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/dulles Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J.] at [[Fordham University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COADUCATRAD.svg|thumbnail|left|What a Bishop's Coat of Arms would have looked like before the rules were changed in 1969. This is not an official version.]]
In the western churches, the [[mitre]] was placed above the shield of all persons who were entitled to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the [[helmet]] of military arms, but also appeared as a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry.&lt;ref name="CathEncyEcclesiasticalHeraldry"/&gt; In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops and not an ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, the use of the mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm "Instruction"], 1969, n.28.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat,&lt;ref&gt;Lartigue, ''Dictionnaire''.&lt;/ref&gt; and even in the arms of a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.&lt;ref&gt;von Volborth, ''Heraldry of the World'', p.171, shows the arms of Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]] with mitre in 1967, just two years before the 1969 [http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm ''Instruction''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The mitre may be shown in all sorts of colours. It may be represented either gold or jewelled, the former more common in English heraldry.{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|p=224}} A form of mitre with [[coronet]] is proper to the [[Bishop of Durham]] because of his role as [[Prince-Bishop]] of the [[County palatine|palatinate]] of Durham.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p.467,469. The use of coronet by all archbishops is "mistaken" and "inaccurate".&lt;/ref&gt; For similar reasons the Bishop of Durham and some other bishops display a [[sword]] behind the shield, pointed downward to signify a former civil jurisdiction.{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|p=225}}{{sfn|Rogers|1956|pp=142–143}}

The [[pallium]] is a distinctive vestment of [[metropolitan archbishop]]s, and may be found in their bearings as well as the corporate arms of archdioceses, displayed either above or below the shield. The pallium is sometimes seen within the shield itself. With the exception of [[Archbishop of York|York]], the archiepiscopal dioceses in England and [[Ireland]] include the pallium within the shield.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p.466–467. The arms of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster]] and older versions of the arms of York also have the pallium.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crosier===
[[File:Franz Christoph von Hutten Wappen.jpg|thumb|right|[[:de:Franz Christoph von Hutten|Franz Christoph von Hutten's]] coat of arms from the 18th century with mitre, staff, and sword]]
The [[crosier]] was displayed as a symbol of pastoral jurisdiction by bishops, abbots, abbesses, and cardinals even if they were not bishops. The crosier of a bishop is turned outward or to the right. Frequently the crosier of an abbot or abbess is turned inward, either toward the mitre or to the left, but this distinction is disputed and is not an absolute rule.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p.466&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Heim|1978|p=67}} [[Pope Alexander VII]] decreed in 1659 that the crosiers of abbots include a [[sudarium]] or veil, but this is not customary in English heraldry.{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|p=228}} The veil may have arisen because abbots, unlike bishops, did not wear gloves when carrying an actual crosier.&lt;ref&gt;Selvester, [http://www.guyselvester.50megs.com/custom4.html Aspects of Heraldry] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060827045955/http://www.guyselvester.50megs.com/custom4.html |date=2006-08-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the cross has similar symbolism,{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|p=226}} the crosier was suppressed for cardinals and bishops by the Catholic Church in 1969, and is now used only on some corporate arms, and the personal arms of abbots and some abbesses.&lt;ref&gt;Noonan, ''The Church Visible'', p.191.&lt;/ref&gt; In English custom and in the Anglican Churches, two crosiers are often found crossed ''in saltire'' behind the shield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9031885 "Ecclesiastical Heraldry"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''; Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p.468.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|p=224}} In the Lutheran [[Church of Sweden]], the crosier is displayed in the arms of bishops in office but is removed when a bishop retires.
[[File:Coat of arms of the Diocese of Cubao - Based on 10th Anniversary.svg|thumbnail|A rendition of the coat of arms of the [[Diocese of Cubao]], showing the [[mitre]], [[crozier]], and [[cross]].]]
A ''bourdon'' or knobbed staff is shown behind the arms of some priors and prioresses as a symbol of office analogous to the crosier.{{sfn|Heim|1978|pp=74–75}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ncd03889.htm "Ecclesiastical Heraldry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017012143/http://catholic-forum.com/saints/ncd03889.htm |date=2007-10-17 }} ''New Catholic Dictionary'' (1910).&lt;/ref&gt; Arms of [[prior]]s from the 15th century had a banner surrounding the shield,&lt;ref&gt;von Volborth, ''Heraldry of the World'', p.169.&lt;/ref&gt; but today this is often a [[rosary]].&lt;ref&gt;von Volborth, ''Heraldry of the World'', p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mantle===
[[File:Slipyj herb.jpg|thumb|left|Arms of Cardinal [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[major archbishop]] of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], with [[mantling]]]]
[[Mantling]] was originally a piece of material attached to a helmet and covering the shoulders, possibly to protect from the sun. In secular heraldry the mantling was depicted shredded, as if from battle. In the 17th and 18th centuries, another form of mantling called a "robe of estate" became prominent.&lt;ref&gt;von Volborth, ''The Art of Heraldry'', p.64; von Volborth, ''Heraldry of the World'', p.21,174.&lt;/ref&gt; This form is used especially in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Churches]], where bishops display a mantle tied with cords and tassels above the shield. The heraldic mantle is similar to the [[Mantle (vesture)|mantiya]], and represents the bishop's authority. It can also be found in the arms of the Grand Master of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ''Debrett's Guide'', p.49; Noonan, ''The Church Visible'', p.195.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outside of the mantle may be any color, typically red, while the inside is white or sometimes yellow to distinguish it from a secular mantle.{{sfn|Heim|1978|p=133}} David Johnson suggested that the mantle of all bishops should be white inside, excepting only patriarchs who use [[ermine (heraldry)|ermine]], to indicate that all bishops are equally bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, [http://www.americancollegeofheraldry.org/ORTHODOX.htm Orthodox Ecclesiastical Heraldry].&lt;/ref&gt; Above the mantle is a mitre (of the Eastern style) between a processional cross and a crosier. The earliest examples of the arms of Orthodox hierarchs have the cross to the dexter of the mitre and the bishop's staff to sinister, but opposite examples exist. An abbot ([[archimandrite]] or [[hegumen]]) should display a veiled abbot's staff to distinguish it from the bishop's staff.

[[File:Biskup Ljavinec Ivan CoA.jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of an [[Eastern Catholic]] prelate, combining elements of both Eastern and Western ecclesiastical heraldry]]
[[Archpriest]]s and priests would use a less ornate mantle in their arms, and an ecclesiastical hat of the style they wear liturgically. Although an [[Monk#Eastern Christianity|Orthodox monk]] (not an abbot) displaying personal arms is rare, a [[hieromonk]] (monk who has been [[ordained]] a priest) would appropriately display a monastic hat (''[[klobuk]]'') and a black cloak or veil suggestive of his [[monastic habit|attire]], and a [[hierodeacon]] (monastic deacon) would display an [[orarion]] behind the shield.

A shield in front of a mantle or cloak may be found among bishops of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.archeparchy.org/page/metropolitan/metropolitan.htm Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221093519/http://www.archeparchy.org/page/metropolitan/metropolitan.htm |date=2007-12-21 }} and [http://eparchy-of-van-nuys.org Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Van Nuys].&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Eastern ecclesiastical variations omit the mantle but retain the mitre, cross and staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrarcheparchy.us/index.php?categoryid=9&amp;s=&amp; Ukrainian Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maronite Church|Maronite]] bishops traditionally display a pastoral staff behind the shield, topped with a globe and cross or a cross within a globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmaron.org/coat_arms.html Arms of the bishop of the Eparchy of St. Maron of Brooklyn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219174506/http://www.stmaron.org/coat_arms.html |date=2007-12-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Catholic bishops may follow the Roman style with a low crowned, wide brimmed ecclesiastical hat, although the shield itself is often rendered in a Byzantine artistic style, and a mitre if present would be in the appropriate liturgical style.&lt;ref&gt;See examples from the [http://www.ucet.ca/ Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Toronto and East Canada], [http://procyk.tripod.com/ Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Stamford], and [http://members.aol.com/DioceseofChicago/index.html Syro-Malabar Catholic Diocese of Chicago]; the [[Syro-Malabar Church]] uses the western-style mitre in the liturgy.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motto===
A [[motto]] is a short phrase usually appearing below the shield as a statement of belief. Catholic bishops and Presbyterian churches use a motto in their arms,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=346 St. James] and [http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=546 St. Matthew's] Presbyterian Churches.&lt;/ref&gt; though it is rare among Anglican bishops.{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|p=224}}&lt;ref name="CathEncyEcclesiasticalHeraldry"/&gt; A notable exception is the motto on the coat of arms of [[Rowan Williams]], former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

[[Gustavo Testa]], created cardinal in December 1959, quickly selected as his arms a shield with the words ''sola gratia tua'' and the motto ''et patria et cor'' in order to meet a publishing deadline. Literally these phrases mean "only by your favor" and "both fatherland and heart". Testa explained to [[Pope John XXIII]] that the shield meant "I am a cardinal because of you alone", and the motto meant "because I am from Bergamo and a friend".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Heraldry in the Vatican'', p.242.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Papal insignia==
{{Main article|Papal regalia and insignia}}
[[File:Medici Leo XI.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pope Leo XI]]'s coat of arms, the family arms of the [[Medici]]]]
[[Saint Peter]] was represented holding keys as early as the fifth century. As the Roman Catholic Church considers him the first pope and bishop of Rome, the keys were adopted as a papal emblem; they first appear with papal arms in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Noonan, ''The Church Visible'', p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; Two keys perpendicular were often used on coins, but beginning in the 15th century were used to represent [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Perpendicular keys last appeared in the shield of the papacy in 1555, after which the crossed keys are used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;Galbreath, ''Papal Heraldry'', p.6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The keys are gold and silver, with the gold key placed to dexter (viewer's left) on the personal arms of the Pope, although two silver keys or two gold keys were used late into the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Galbreath, ''Papal Heraldry'', p.12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The keys as a symbol of Saint Peter may be found within many coats of arms; the coat of arms of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen]] displayed two [[Argent|argent (silver)]] crossed keys as Saint Peter is the patron saint of the [[Bremen Cathedral|Bremian archiepiscopal cathedral]].

The [[Papal Tiara]] or ''triregnum'' is the three-tiered crown used by the Pope as a sovereign power. It is first found as an independent emblem in the 13th century, though at that time with only one coronet.&lt;ref&gt;Galbreath, ''Papal Heraldry'', p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, the tiara was combined with the keys above the papal shield. The tiara and keys together within a shield form the arms of Vatican City. In heraldry, the white tiara is depicted with a bulbous shape and with two attached red strips called [[lappet]]s or infulae.&lt;ref&gt;Noonan, ''The Church Visible'', p.195.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI]] sparked controversy by displaying a mitre and pallium instead of the customary tiara.

Besides the Holy See, another Catholic see has the right to bear the triple tiara in its coat of arms: the [[Patriarchate of Lisbon]].{{sfn|Heim|1978|pp=52, 94}} The title of Patriarch of Lisbon was created in 1716 and is held by the [[archbishop of Lisbon]] since 1740. While the coat of arms of the Holy See combines the tiara with the crossed keys of St. Peter, that of the Lisbon Patriarchate combines it with a processional cross and a pastoral staff.

[[File:COAppiusix.png|thumb|150px|left|Rendition of [[Pope Pius IX]]'s coat of arms with tiara, keys and supporters]]
The red and gold striped [[ombrellino]] or pavilion was originally a processional canopy or sunshade and can be found so depicted as early as the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Galbreath, ''Papal Heraldry'', p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest use of the ombrellino in heraldry is in the 1420s when it was placed above the shield of [[Pope Martin V]]. It is more commonly used together with the keys, a combination first found under [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;Galbreath, ''Papal Heraldry'', p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; This combined badge represents the temporal power of Vatican City between Papal reigns, when the acting head of state is the cardinal [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]]. The badge first appeared with a cardinal's personal arms on coins minted by order of the Camerlengo, Cardinal Armellini, during the inter-regnum of 1521. During the 17th and 18th centuries, it appeared on coins minted ''[[sede vacante]]'' by papal legates, and on coins minted in 1746 and 1771 while a pope reigned.&lt;ref&gt;Galbreath, ''Papal Heraldry'', p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; The ombrellino appears in the arms of [[basilica]]s since the 16th century, with ornamentation for major basilicas. If found in a family's coat of arms, it indicates that a relative had been pope.&lt;ref&gt;von Volborth, ''Heraldry of the World'', p.172.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wappen Hagen im Bremischen.png|thumb|130px|right|Emblem of Bremen's archbishop (red shield) within the emblem of ''Hagen i.B.'']]
The [[papal coats of arms]] are often depicted with [[angel]]s as [[supporters]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:Commons:Category:Dizionario araldico ufficiale italiano|''Vocabolario Araldico Ufficiale della Consulta Araldica'']] (1907), images [[:File:Araldiz Manno 384.png|384]] and [[:File:Araldiz Manno 420.png|420]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other Catholic or Anglican clergy do not use supporters unless they were awarded as a personal honor, or were inherited with family arms.{{sfn|Boutell|Brooke-Little|1978|p=224}}&lt;ref name="CathEncyEcclesiasticalHeraldry"/&gt; Some cathedral arms use a single chair ([[cathedra]]) as a supporter.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090908173201/http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=582&amp;ProjectElementID=2051 St. Paul's Cathedral].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chivalric insignia==
Roman Catholic clergy may not display insignia of [[knight]]hood in their arms, except awards received in the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]] or the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]. If entitled, Roman Catholic clergy may display the red [[Cross#In heraldry|Jerusalem Cross]] for the former or the [[Maltese cross]] for the latter behind the shield, or may display the ribbon of their rank in the order.&lt;ref&gt;Noonan, ''The Church Visible'', p.195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction does not apply to laymen who have been knighted in any royal or [[Papal Orders|Papal order]], who may display the insignia of their rank, either a ribbon at the base of the shield or a chain surrounding the shield.

Church of England clergy may display chivalric insignia. The [[List of Deans of Westminster Abbey|Dean of Westminster]] is also the Dean of the Most Honourable [[Order of the Bath]], and displays the civil badge of that order.{{sfn|Heim|1978|p=136}}

On November 17, 2010, Longoria filed for divorce from Parker in Los Angeles, citing "irreconcilable differences".&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;Marikar, Sheila.[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/eva-longoria-files-divorce-tony-parker/story?id=12172329 "Eva Longoria Files for Divorce From Tony Parker"], ABCNews.com, November 17, 2010.

===Ancestry===
[[File:Eva Longoria Cannes 2.jpg|thumb|Longoria at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]]]]

According to research done in 2010 by [[Harvard]] professor and  ''[[Faces of America (PBS series)|Faces of America]]'' host [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], Longoria's oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Longoria (b. [[Oviedo]], 1592), who immigrated to the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called Llongoria, [[Belmonte de Miranda|Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias]], Spain. [[Longoria]] is the Castellanized form of this Asturian-language surname.

In 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of land along the [[Rio Grande]] in a land grant from King [[Charles III of Spain]]. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of the [[Mexican–American War]], the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the [[Mexican–American War]] and the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/eva-longoria/8/ "Faces of America: Eva Longoria"], PBS, ''[[Faces of America]]'' series, with Professor [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[DNA test]]ing, Longoria's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27% Asian and [[Indigenous American|Indigenous]], and 3% [[Black people|African]].&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/celebrity/faces-america-reveals-eva-longoria-parkers-surprising-roots|title="Faces of America" Reveals Eva Longoria Parker's Surprising Roots |last=Miller|first=Gerri|date=February 2, 2010|work=[[Latina (magazine)|Latina magazine]] |publisher= Latina Media Ventures LLC|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a computer compared the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests, tests showed that she is genetically related to cellist [[Yo-Yo Ma]], who is of Chinese heritage.&lt;ref name="LM"/&gt; Since women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father's [[Y-DNA]], but she did inherit her mother's [[mitochondrial DNA]] (genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria's mtDNA belongs to the [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|Haplogroup A2]], making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, a [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] from the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Mayans on both sides of her family.&lt;ref name="Gate's book"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meYbj1E6Ki8C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;dq=eva+longoria+is+mtdna+A2#v=onepage&amp;q=eva%20longoria%20is%20mtdna%20A2 |title=Faces of America: How 12 Extraordinary People Discovered their Pasts|pages=241–247 |last=Gates|first=Henry Louis Jr.|publisher=NYU Press|date= July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?ID=ENTEN20100137069&amp;keyword=hollywood&amp;subcatg=MOVIESWORLD |title=Eva Longoria shocked by DNA test |date=April 4, 2010 |work=NDTV Movies |publisher=NDTV Convergence Limited |accessdate=March 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407224943/http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?ID=ENTEN20100137069&amp;keyword=hollywood&amp;subcatg=MOVIESWORLD |archivedate=April 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longoria identifies as a "Texican"—a Mexican-American Texan.&lt;ref name="Gate's book"/&gt;

'''Fay Pomerance''' née '''Levy''' (12 July 1912 - 2001) was a British artist known for her paintings in pastel, tempera and in watercolours which were often on religious and spirtual subjects.&lt;ref name="GMWaters"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grant M.

Created in 1946, the '''International Council of Museums''' ('''ICOM''') is a [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisation]] maintaining formal relations with UNESCO&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/movable-heritage-and-museums/museums/unescoicom-museum-studies-training-package/|title=UNESCO/ICOM Museum Studies Training Programme|publisher=''unesco.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/movable-heritage-and-museums/illicit-traffic-of-cultural-property/partnerships/|title=ICOM among UNESCO’s Partners |publisher=''unesco.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and having a consultative status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]]. 
ICOM also partners with entities such as the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/center/specific-sectors/art/icom/rules/|title=Partnership between ICOM and WIPO|publisher=''wipo.int''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[INTERPOL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/fr/Criminalit%C3%A9/%C5%92uvres-d'art/ICOM-Red-Lists|title=Partnership between ICOM and INTERPOL|publisher=''interpol.int''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Customs Organization]] in order to carry out its international public service missions, which include fighting illicit traffic in cultural goods and promoting risk management and emergency preparedness to protect world cultural heritage in the event of natural or man-made disasters. Members of the ICOM get the ICOM membership card, which provides free entry, or entry at a reduced rate, to many museums all over the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://network.icom.museum/cimuset/members/benefits/|title=Benefits|website=network.icom.museum|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Code of ethics for museums==
ICOM adopted its ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://icom.museum/professional-standards/code-of-ethics/ |title=ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums|publisher=''icom.museum''}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986, a reference tool that sets standards of excellence to which all members of the organisation must adhere. The ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums, translated into 39 languages and revised in 2006, establishes values and principles shared by ICOM and the international museum community. These standards of self-regulation by museums include basic principles for museum governance, the acquisition and disposal of collections, and rules for professional conduct.

==Fighting illicit traffic==
[[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|Illicit traffic in cultural goods]] causes significant damage to heritage, particularly in regions of the world where cultural objects are most susceptible to theft and looting. Supporting the fight against illicit traffic in cultural goods is among ICOM’s highest priorities. In this context, ICOM publishes its Red List series&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://icom.museum/programmes/fighting-illicit-traffic/|title=ICOM’s actions in Fighting Illicit Traffic|publisher=''icom.museum''}}&lt;/ref&gt; to raise awareness on smuggling and illicit trade in cultural objects. The ICOM Red Lists are tools designed to help police and customs officials, heritage professionals, and art and antiquities dealers to identify the types of objects that are most susceptible to illicit trafficking.

ICOM has already published Red Lists for many different countries and regions:
{{hidden begin

* [[Antiquities]] in [[Peru]]
* Antiquities in [[Cambodia]]
* [[Central America]] and [[Mexico]]
* [[Haiti]]
* [[China]]
* [[Colombia]]
* [[Egypt]]
{{hidden end}}

==Museums emergency programme==
ICOM is committed to providing cultural institutions with the necessary support and risk prevention tools when faced with conflict situations or [[natural disasters]]. Through its Disaster Relief for Museums Task Force (DRTF), its Museums Emergency Programme (MEP) and its active role in the [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]] (ICBS),&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_5vqfWYRCM|title=Julien Anfruns, ICOM Director General, at the International Conference of ICBS, December 2011|publisher=''youtube.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICOM assists museums worldwide by mobilising its resources quickly and efficiently to provide support in both the prevention and the aftermath of disaster situations.

'''Jacqueline "Jackie" Beulah Burkhart''' is a [[fictional character]] portrayed by [[Mila Kunis]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] [[sitcom]] ''[[That '70s Show]]''. Jackie is one of the two female leads throughout the show's life, and a love interest of [[Michael Kelso]].

==Personality==
Jackie is a self-centered, spoiled member of a wealthy family who can be rather insensitive to the needs and feelings of others, though is regarded by many as attractive and fashionable, about which she can be quite vain. She is one of the program's most conceited characters, and can behave quite selfishly. She looks down upon those of lower status in her school and has been said to treat them unfairly, and on the occasions she has treated them with respect she has not continued to do so for very long or only did it knowing that she could be rewarded for behaving in such a manner, such as when she ran for the title of "Snow Queen" but was utterly disappointed when she loses the election. For the most part, Jackie only cares about herself, and fashion is among one of the few other things that she is concerned about. She believes herself to be very beautiful and appealing and has been involved in romantic relationships with [[Michael Kelso]], [[Steven Hyde]], and [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] at different points in the series. She starts to change when she starts dating Hyde and by doing so, becomes cemented as a member of the group. Even after her break up with Hyde, they remained good friends and she continued hanging around. She also becomes less shallow and cares about others. In the season 8 episode "[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 8)#ep185|Fun It]]", it is revealed she has had [[coulrophobia]] (an irrational fear of clowns) ever since her seventh birthday party.

==Friendships==
Jackie's friendships tend to be complicated. While people might be endeared to her good heart and her triumphs over major life upheavals, her habit of being condescending to others keeps them at a distance.

Although she frequently criticizes [[Donna Pinciotti|Donna]]'s dress, physique and feminism, she repeatedly calls herself Donna's best friend. Even though she thinks Donna is boring and unattractive when compared to herself, she believes Donna could do much better than [[Eric Forman|Eric]]. Despite their extremely different personalities, Donna serves as Jackie's [[de facto]] big sister and often tries to look out for her when she feels Jackie is making a mistake, more often than not due to lack of common sense. After her father is sent to prison in the middle of season five, Jackie moves in with the Pinciottis after the Formans learn that she has secretly been living with [[Steven Hyde|Hyde]] in his basement room. Jackie is also defensive of Donna; she displays this often by insulting or kicking Eric for doing something stupid, for example Eric makes a sexist comment so Jackie kicks him in the shin in the episode "Won't Get Fooled Again". Although both girls often tease one another they show genuine friendship. In the episode "Squeeze Box" Donna shows how much she trusts Jackie when she runs in to talk about Eric. Jackie also demonstrates her level of care for Donna when she helps pay for Donna's wedding ring in the episode "No Quarter".

Of the group, Jackie and Eric seemed to dislike each other the most in the beginning, though as the series progresses, they develop a friendship. Throughout the series, the two have a clear "frenemy" relationship. They demonstrate their annoyance with each other, but show compassion for each other many times, and through it all, are close. In the beginning of the series, Jackie admits to trusting and liking Eric, confiding in him that she might be pregnant. In "The Pill", for example, she says to Eric's surprise, "Look, I've always been able to trust you—and, God, you are such a nice guy." Later in the episode, once Kelso threatens to break up with Jackie, Eric yells at him, having developed protective feelings towards her. This proves that their burning of each other throughout the show is only for laughs and friendly bickering, as none of their hostility is ever serious. Eric is consistent in ignoring Jackie as an object of sexual desire, but this changes in "What Is and What Should Never Be" where Hyde helps Eric realize that Jackie is "hot". After this, Eric has shown to have a sexual attraction to her, as shown in many episodes. Jackie is sometimes demeaning towards Eric due to his effeminate qualities, dorkiness and physical weakness. They have been known to occasionally help each other out. In the episode "Jackie's Cheese Squeeze", Eric admits that they are "friends", as long as they don't refer to each other as such in public, and in the season seven finale, Jackie calls Eric from Chicago and admits that she's always cared for him and that he was always very special to her.

Early on, [[Red Forman|Red]] remarks she was the favorite of Eric's friends for her ability to hold a flashlight on a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Career Day| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 1999-02-28| season = 1| number = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackie has run crying into Red's arms no fewer than three times, all of which left him baffled and uncomfortable. Red finds Jackie as annoying as everyone else, but she still loves him because he's the closest thing she has to a father.

==Relationships==
When the show premieres, Jackie is dating [[Michael Kelso]], a good-looking, brainless goofball. She decides to finally lose her virginity to him when he is released from jail after being mistakenly arrested for driving a stolen car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Stolen Car| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = January 24, 1999| season = 1| number = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackie gets on Kelso's friends' nerves on a daily basis and Kelso repeatedly says that he is going to break up with her. However, in the first season it is Jackie who ends the relationship – twice. First, after Kelso is caught kissing Pam Macy (they get back together in the very same episode) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Ski Trip| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 1999-01-17| season = 1| number = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again after a pregnancy scare. However, admitting that they miss each other, they get back together at the Junior Prom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Prom Night| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 1999-03-07| season = 1| number = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season 2, Kelso is seduced by Eric's promiscuous and manipulative sister, Laurie, who later on begins a physical affair with him. Later in the season, Jackie eventually discovers his repeated infidelities and breaks up with him without realizing that Kelso has told Laurie that he is done with her since he only loves Jackie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Kiss of Death| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 2000-03-20| season = 2| number = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this breakup she is openly hostile to Kelso and many things clearly remain unfinished between them. She often insults him in front of his friends to get his attention and just for the sake of bringing him up. By season 3, she does eventually warm up to him. Following Kelso's breakup with Laurie, Kelso apologizes to Jackie for cheating on her because now he knows how it feels to be cheated on as Laurie cheated on him, except he states that what happened to him and Jackie was different because they were actually really in love. After this, Jackie begins to notice that Kelso has matured somehow, so Jackie devises a series of "tests" for Kelso to see if they should reconcile. He passes her tests and they get back together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Trials of Michael Kelso| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 2001-03-13| season = 3| number = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelso remains loyal to Jackie after that and stays with her throughout season four, and they enjoy a happier, more loving relationship. However, towards the end of season 4, Jackie's father tells her that if she stays with Kelso, he will cut her off financially. She ends up choosing Kelso, and gets a job. Later, Kelso begins to spend less time with Jackie as a result of his joining a modeling agency and she is caught kissing her boss by Eric. This event spurs a period of discovery for Jackie and Kelso. After reading [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]], Kelso realizes that the reason he cheated on Jackie with Laurie was because Jackie has always bossed him around and made him feel bad about himself. Following this revelation, he breaks up with her (true to form, the breakup doesn't stick and they reunite one episode later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Everybody Loves Casey| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 2002-05-14| season = 4| number = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the season four finale, Jackie and Kelso both agree that they don't want to stay broken up. So, Jackie has Kelso choose to kiss any girl at The Hub to make things even between them and they can move on and be together again. Kelso surprises Jackie when he pretends to look around the room, but ends up choosing to kiss her. Jackie decides that it's time for Kelso to really choose her. Without warning, she brings up marriage to Kelso and decides that they're getting married. Kelso, feeling overwhelmed, flees to California. When he returns in the beginning of season five, he (along with the others) is horrified to learn that she has begun dating [[Steven Hyde|Hyde]]. Jackie continues to date Hyde for most of the season, but when Kelso introduces Annette to the gang, Jackie finds herself clearly jealous and tells Donna that Michael is still supposed to pine over her. Later in the episode, she claims to not be jealous anymore, but the moment she sees Annette kissing Kelso, she screams, "Get off my boyfriend!" For the rest of the season, Kelso is clearly not over Jackie and doesn't realize that he's indirectly trying to win her back. Towards the end of season five, as Jackie comforts Kelso, he states that no one understands him like she does. In the finale, Kelso and Hyde make Jackie choose between the two of them and she chooses herself. By the beginning of season six, Kelso claims that he is happy and genuinely enjoying their new friendship. He spends the rest of the season trying to move on with his life, joins the police academy and impregnates a girl named Brooke and spends the rest of season 6 and 7 taking care of the baby.

Towards the end season seven, however, Kelso drives Jackie to Chicago after her break-up with Hyde, and Jackie asks him to spend some time with her before he leaves. He is later seen entering Jackie's hotel room in only a towel, implying that he and Jackie were about to sleep together, but runs off nude into the night when he sees that Hyde has come to the hotel to get Jackie back.&lt;ref name="Till the Next Goodbye"&gt;{{cite episode| title = Till the Next Goodbye| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 2005-05-18| season = 7| number = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of season eight, with Hyde married to a stripper, Jackie figures out her own life. Kelso considers marrying Jackie and states that the happiest time of his life was with Jackie and claims he still loves her. When [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] tells Jackie what Kelso intends, she considers the proposal and decides that if he asks, she will accept. However, he gets offered a job out of town and realizes he can move on with his life, but Fez reveals to him that he has already told Jackie of the proposal. Kelso grows angry, and states that he loves Jackie and that he knows in the future, they will be together, but now is not the right time, but since Fez has implied that Kelso will lose all of his chances with Jackie if he doesn't propose now, Kelso ends up proposing at Red and [[Kitty Forman|Kitty]]'s anniversary party, though, she turns him down giving practically the same reasons as Kelso, which is that she loves him, but he has a lot of maturing to do and she has her own life to figure out so now is not the right time for them yet. They both feel an unexpected relief, and end on good terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Misfire| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 2005-11-16| season = 8| number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:jackieandhyde.jpg|thumb|Jackie and Hyde as a couple|{{deletable image-caption|1=Monday, 6 July 2009}}]] --&gt;
Jackie and [[Steven Hyde]] are, from the beginning of the show, polar opposites and even enemies. She is disgusted by his poverty and crass behavior, he scorns her superficiality and materialism. They strongly dislike each other during the first season, but begin to form a bond when Hyde helps Jackie cope with her breakup with Kelso in season two. This leads to a brief period in which Jackie is infatuated with Hyde, but her feelings gradually fade. It isn't until season five, when Kelso is in California, that their romance begins. After watching ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' together all summer, the two begin making out every time they have a moment alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = I Can't Quit You, Baby| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 2002-09-24| season = 5| number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When their friends discover the relationship, they each insist that they are not dating and that it is purely physical, but finally give in and admit that what they have goes deeper than just sex. They date for most of season five until Jackie sees Kelso kissing Annette and yells "Get off my boyfriend!" Hyde reacts angrily to this and grows suspicious of Jackie. When he sees Jackie holding Kelso in her arms, knowing Jackie and Kelso's long history and on-off relationship, Hyde assumes that something must be going on between her and Kelso again. Despite her pleas that she was only comforting him and that nothing untoward happened, he doesn't believe her and he takes revenge by spending the night with another woman. When he realizes that Jackie has been telling the truth, he confesses his infidelity. A heartbroken Jackie ends the relationship immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Nobody's Fault But Mine| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 2003-04-23| season = 5| number = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of season six, Kelso and Hyde are in competition to get Jackie back because they both still love her. She decides she needs time to think about it, leaving them to wait and agonize, but chooses Hyde in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Join Together| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 2003-11-05| season = 6| number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship goes on until Jackie is offered a job in Chicago. She is torn between her relationship and her professional ambition, but tells Hyde that she will stay if he can gives her the merest hope that they will eventually get married. Hyde has no immediate answer, and when he finally decides, he is upset to realize that she has already gone (or so he thinks). Jackie has no way out of Point Place, and in a final attempt to get an answer out of Hyde, she goes to the basement. Hiding his hurt and anger that she "left" him, Hyde tells her to have a good trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Short and Curlies| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 2005-05-18| season = 7| number = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde decides he still wants her, and goes to her Chicago hotel to persuade her to take him back. During his conversation with Jackie, Kelso walks into the hotel room with a towel around his waist and a bucket of ice in his hands and implying that he and Jackie were about to have sex.&lt;ref name="Till the Next Goodbye"/&gt; Hyde goes to Las Vegas. When he comes back to Point Place, he has impulsively married a stripper named Samantha and she follows him back to Wisconsin.  This effectively ends his and Jackie's relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = Bohemian Rhapsody| series = That '70s Show| serieslink = That '70s Show| airdate = 2005-11-02| season = 8| number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout season eight, Jackie remains single. She and Hyde, no longer together, have since remained good friends. However, their behavior regresses to how it was in the earlier seasons. Fez tells Jackie that Kelso intends to propose to her, and she decides that she will accept, but after considering it, she turns him down claiming that though she loves Kelso, he still has a lot of maturing to do, and now is not the time for them to be together. Feeling that she is in a low point in her life, Jackie decides to find someone that would be perfect for her and writes out a list of what she wants in a man. She is surprised to find out that Fez matches everything on the list. She denies this at first, but quickly comes around to the idea and decides to wait for Fez to come to her. Fez, however, is clueless of her attraction to him and is instead seeing other women at the time, which makes it hard for her. Jackie then chooses to go to him. She kisses him and asks if they can be together because he is the one good thing in her life right now, but Fez turns her down, feeling that she is treating him as a last resort, citing how she has already dated both Kelso and Hyde. Jackie then goes to the bathroom and cries, but immediately after vows revenge on Fez. She flushes his toothbrush, microwaves his lotion, and ruins his car with graffiti. To get back at Jackie, Fez dyes her hair green, and says that now she is ugly on the outside like she is on the inside. Hurt by Fez's words, Jackie decides to move out. However, she later learns through one of his friends that he loves her and wishes that he had never said those things. They eventually reconcile and in the final episode, Fez and Jackie finally get together and kiss atop the water tower.

'''''Keum-boo''''' (also '''''Kum-Boo''''' or '''''Kum-bu'''''—[[Korean language|Korean]] "attached gold") is an ancient [[Korea]]n [[gilding]] technique used to apply thin sheets of [[gold]] to [[silver]], to make [[silver-gilt]]. Traditionally, this technique is accomplished by first [[depletion gilding#Variations|depleting]] a surface of [[sterling silver]] to bring up a thin layer of [[Millesimal fineness#Silver|fine silver]]. Then [[Millesimal fineness#Gold|24 carat]] [[Metal leaf|gold foil]] is applied with heat and pressure—[[Gilding#Mechanical gilding|mechanical gilding]]—to produce a permanent [[diffusion]] bond. 

Pure precious metals such as gold and silver have a very similar [[atomic structure]] and therefore have a good potential for bonding. Heating these metals to a temperature between 500–700°F increases the movement of the atoms. When pressure is added, this causes an electron exchange at the surface between the two metals, creating a permanent diffusion bond. This diffusion bond occurs far below the [[brazing|soldering]] temperature for either metal (Dhein, 2004).

Examples of this technique have probably been observed, but not positively identified on pieces from the second half of the first millennium B.C. and from the early first millennium A.D. (Oddy, 1981).

This technique is used in many cultures, including Chinese, Japanese and in the West to bond gold to other metals, including [[iron]], [[copper]], [[aluminum]], gold alloys, white gold, [[palladium]] and [[platinum]]. Foil made from gold alloys can be applied to silver and other metals by first [[depletion gilding]] the surface of the foil (Lewton-Brain, 1987–1993).

Male collaboration with the newspaper was welcome and among the male contributors was French poet, [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Members of the ''Voix des Femmes'' did not question that a woman's role was inherently maternal or domestic.  Instead, they tried to use the importance of this role as justification for increased financial security, job security, education, property rights, and women's [[suffrage]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} The ''Voix des Femmes'' closed in 1852.

[[Philippe de Rothschild|Baron Philippe de Rothschild]] came up with the idea of having each year's [[Château Mouton Rothschild]] label designed by a famous artist of the day. In 1946, this became a permanent and significant aspect of the Mouton image with labels created by some of the world's great painters and sculptors. The popularity of the label images results in auction prices for older and more collectible years being far out of sync with the other first growths, whose labels do not change year to year.

Wolińska-Riedi has a degree in Italian studies from the University of Warsaw and a degree in church history from the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=wm /&gt; She also studied at the Diplomatic Academy in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wywiady-populada.pl/news-magdalena-wolinska-riedi-modlilam-sie-by-miec-dzieci,nId,1825066 |title=Magdalena Wolińska- Riedi.

'''''Melody at Hand''''' is a 2007 [[mixed media]] [[collage]] by artist [[India Cruse-Griffin]] located on the [[Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital|Eskenazi Health]] campus, near downtown [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], and is part of the [[Eskenazi Health Art Collection]].

== Description ==
''Melody at Hand'' is a 2007 [[mixed media]] [[collage]] by artist India Cruse-Griffin, which depicts a woman in a yellow dress playing a guitar, an open book lying nearby.  Behind her, a fence separates her from rich green landscape and white houses. The work, which measures 37.25" x 49.25", framed, is made from collaged paper gathered from magazines, upon which Cruse-Griffin then paints, often allowing the underlying magazine paper to show through.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/melody-hand|title=Melody at Hand {{!}} Public Art Archive|last=|first=|date=|website=www.publicartarchive.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiacg.wix.com/artist#!artist-spotlight|title=INDIA CRUSE-GRIFFIN MIXED MEDIA ARTIST {{!}} Wix.com|work=INDIA CRUSE-GRIFFIN MIXED MEDIA ARTIST|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her subjects are often clear and straightforward, this collage technique serves as a reminder of the accumulation of lived experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The house hosted notable artists including [[Otis Skinner]], [[Walker Whiteside]] and [[John Philip Sousa]] and his band. Between 1930–54, the house presented films and served as a venue for concerts and drama and dance productions of [[Ellsworth College]] and Iowa Falls High School. The theatre was purchased by John P. Whitesell of Iowa Falls in June 2013 and reopened after an upgrade to digital projectors.

[[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated actor [[Hugh Jackman]] appeared at The Met's grand re-opening with his family on September 20, 2013. He introduced two of his films — ''[[Prisoners (2013 film)|Prisoners]]'' and ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/news/hugh-jackman-visit-renovated-iowa-opera-house-150928322.html Hugh Jackman visit]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:POL Warszawa Muzeum Karykatury.jpg|thumb|230px|Museum of Caricature]]

'''Museum of Caricature''' ({{lang-pl|Muzeum Karykatury}}) is a museum in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. The museum was established in 1978.  It has a collection of over 20,000 pieces by Polish and foreign artists.  

The museums premises are an old [[orangery]] which was once part of the [[18th century]] Prymas Castle.  As the museum only has limited space it does not have a permanent collection on display but instead shows temporary exhibitions based on its holdings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muzeumkarykatury.pl/joomla/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74&amp;Itemid=78&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Nelson Goodman''' (7 August 1906 – 25 November 1998) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]], known for his work on [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]], [[mereology]], the [[problem of induction]], [[Irrealism (philosophy)|irrealism]], and [[aesthetics]].

==Life and career==
Goodman was born in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Massachusetts]], the son of Sarah Elizabeth (née Woodbury) and Henry Lewis Goodman.&lt;ref&gt;John K. Roth, Christina J. Moose, Rowena Wildin (eds.), ''World Philosophers and Their Works: Freud, Sigmund – Oakeshott, Michael'', Salem Press, 2000, p. 735.&lt;/ref&gt; He was of [[Jewish]] origins.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Cohnitz &amp; Marcus Rossberg, ''Nelson Goodman'', Routledge (2014), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Harvard University]], [[A.B.]], [[magna cum laude]] (1928). During the 1930s, he ran an art gallery in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, while studying for a Harvard Ph.D. in [[philosophy]], which he completed in 1941.&lt;ref name="Harvard Obituary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/12.03/goodman.html | title=Goodman Dies | work=Harvard University Gazette | accessdate=18 January 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614040257/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/12.03/goodman.html | archivedate=14 June 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His experience as an art dealer helps explain his later turn towards [[aesthetics]], where he became better known than in [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]]. During [[World War II]], he served as a psychologist in the [[United States Army|US Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Howard. 2000. ''Project Zero: Nelson Goodman's Legacy in Arts Education''. The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (58)3, pp. 245–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1946–1964, where his students included [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Sydney Morgenbesser]], [[Stephen Stich]], and [[Hilary Putnam]]. He was a research fellow at the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies from 1962 to 1963 and was a professor at several universities from 1964 to 1967, before being appointed Professor of Philosophy at Harvard in 1968.

In 1967, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, he was the founding director of Harvard Project Zero, a basic research project in artistic cognition and artistic education. He remained the director for four years and served as an informal adviser for many years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H., and Perkins, D. "The Mark of Zero: Project Zero’s Identity Revealed." ''HGSE Alumni Bulletin'', December 1994, '''39'''(1), 2–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman died in [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], Massachusetts.

==Philosophical work==
===Induction and "grue"===
In his book ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'', Goodman introduced the "[[new riddle of induction]]", so-called by analogy with [[David Hume|Hume]]'s classical [[problem of induction]]. He accepted Hume's observation that [[inductive reasoning]] (i.e. inferring from past experience about events in the future) was based solely on human habit and regularities to which our day-to-day existence has accustomed us. Goodman argued, however, that Hume overlooked the fact that some regularities establish habits (a given piece of copper conducting electricity increases the credibility of statements asserting that other pieces of copper conduct electricity) while some do not (the fact that a given man in a room is a third son does not increase the credibility of statements asserting that other men in this room are third sons). How then can we differentiate between regularities or [[hypotheses]] that construe law-like statements from those that are [[contingent]] or based upon accidental generality?

[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[confirmation theory]] argued that the solution is to differentiate between hypotheses, which apply to all things of a certain class, and [[evidence]] statements, which apply to only one thing.  Goodman's famous counterargument was to introduce the predicate [[Grue and bleen|grue]], which applies to all things examined before a certain time ''t'' just in case they are green, but also to other things just in case they are blue and not examined before time ''t''. If we examine emeralds before time ''t'' and find that emerald ''a'' is green, emerald ''b'' is green, and so forth, each will confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are green. However, emeralds ''a, b, c,''..etc. also confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are [[Grue and bleen|grue]].  Thus, before time ''t'', the apparently law-like statements "All emeralds are green" and "All emeralds are grue" are equally well confirmed by observation, but obviously "All emeralds are grue" is not a law-like statement.

Goodman's example showed that the difficulty in determining what constitutes law-like statements is far greater than previously thought, and that once again we find ourselves facing the initial [[dilemma]] that "anything can confirm anything".

===Nominalism and mereology===
Goodman, along with [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]], is the founder of the contemporary variant of [[nominalism]], which argues that philosophy, logic, and mathematics should dispense with [[set theory]]. Goodman's nominalism was driven purely by [[ontology|ontological]] considerations. After a long and difficult 1947 paper coauthored with  [[W. V. O. Quine]], Goodman ceased to trouble himself with finding a way to reconstruct mathematics while dispensing with [[set theory]] – discredited as sole [[foundations of mathematics]] as of 1913 ([[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'').

The program of [[David Hilbert]] to reconstruct it from logical axioms was proven futile in 1936 by [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]].  Because of this and other failures of seemingly fruitful lines of research, 
Quine soon came to believe that such a reconstruction was impossible, but Goodman's Penn colleague [[Richard Milton Martin]] argued otherwise, writing a number of papers suggesting ways forward.

According to [[Thomas Tymoczko]]'s ''afterword'' in ''New directions in the philosophy of mathematics'', Quine had "urged that we abandon ad hoc devices distinguishing mathematics from science and just accept the resulting assimilation", putting the "key burden on the theories (networks of sentences) that we accept, not on the individual sentences whose significance can change dramatically depending on their theoretical context."  In so doing, Tymoczko claimed, [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science]] were merged into [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empiricism]]:  the emphasis of [[mathematical practice]] as effectively part of the [[scientific method]], an emphasis on method over result.

The Goodman–Leonard (1940) calculus of individuals is the starting point for the American variant of [[mereology]]. While the exposition in Goodman and Leonard invoked a bit of naive set theory, the variant of the calculus of individuals that grounds Goodman's 1951 ''The Structure of Appearance'', a revision and extension of his Ph.D. thesis, makes no mention of the notion of set (while his Ph.D. thesis still did).&lt;ref&gt;Cohnitz and Rossberg (2003), ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Simons (1987) and Casati and Varzi (1999) show that the calculus of individuals can be grounded in either a bit of set theory, or monadic predicates, schematically employed.  Mereology is accordingly "ontologically neutral" and retains some of Quine's pragmatism (which Tymoczko in 1998 carefully qualified as [[American Pragmatism]]).

'''Non-Referential Architecture''' is the architecture of the 21st century. It is distinct of the [[architecture]] of [[postmodernity]] in as much as Non-Referential Architecture is a response to a non-referential world. Non-Referential Architecture is liberated of a vocabulary of fixed semantic images, symbols, and historical connotations. Buildings of Non-Referential Architecture are based upon themselves – they are based on architecture-inherent qualities such as architectural space and form and the experience of space they cause in the inhabitants and visitors. Buildings of Non-Referential Architecture are distinctly different from their precursors of modernism and postmodernism because they are not the outcome of extra-architectural concepts and ideas, such as importations and thematizations, for example, taken from the realms of the economic, the ecological, or the political. 

In the book Non-Referential Architecture, Swiss [[architect]] [[Valerio Olgiati]] and USA-based Swiss [[architectural theoretician]] [[Markus Breitschmid]] write: "Non-referential architecture is not an architecture that subsists as a referential vessel or as a symbol of something outside itself. Non-referential buildings are entities that are themselves meaningful and sense-making and, as such, no less the embodiment of society than buildings were in the past when they were the bearers of common social ideals."&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati. Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Referential Architecture is a response to a contemporary societal current that increasingly rejects ideologies of any kind, political and otherwise. While ideologies were the innovation of [[modernity]] and [[postmodernity]], the non-referential world is increasingly devoid of ideologies or it rejects to order the world in ideological ways. Valerio Olgiati has worked on the possibilities of a Non-Referential Architecture for years. The first documented use of the term Non-Referential in architecture appears in a reprint of an interview between Olgiati and Breitschmid in the Italian architecture journal Domus.&lt;ref&gt;Valerio Olgiati [in an interview with Markus Breitschmid], “Sulla non referezialita” in: Domus No. 974, Milano: 13/2013, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Breitschmid publishes a rebuttal titled "Architektur leitet sich von Architektur ab" (Architecture is Derived from Architecture) in the Swiss journal Werk, Bauen + Wohnen, thereby responding to an architectural claim made by others that attempts to imbue meaning into architecture from the extra-architectural, such as the economic, ecological, political. &lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid. “Architektur leitet sich von Architektur ab” in: Werk, Bauen + Wohnen, Zurich: 9/2014, 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Architect [[Christian Kerez]] investigated the limits of referentiality and speaks of "non-referential space" as a quality of his contribution for the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archdaily.com/867558/columbia-gsapp-conversations-4-wonder-structure-christian-kerez-contemporary-swiss-architecture&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, architect [[Peter Eisenman]] points out that architecture has been moving toward a “non-referential ‘objectivity’” for some time, in as much as architectural form is increasingly reduced “to a pure reality.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pantagruelista.com/blogeng/architecture-fiction-eisenman&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2018, Olgiati and Breitschmid published the architectural treatise Non-Referential Architecture, a book that has been in the making since 2013. It analyses the societal currents of the early 21st century and argues that those currents are radically different from the epoch of postmodernity.&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The book proposes a new framework for architecture and defines the seven underlying principles for Non-Referential Architecture:&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
1) Experience of Space; 
2) Oneness; 
3) Newness; 
4) Construction; 
5) Contradiction; 
6) Order; 
7) Sensemaking.

One of the hallmarks of Non-Referential Architecture is that each building exists for itself. Each building is governed by an architectural idea – and that idea has to be form-generative and sense-making.&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, pp. 13-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Referential Architecture states: "Non-referential architecture denotes but it refuses to explain or narrate, and it leaves behind any vestiges of a theatrical mode of persuasion and propagation."&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the intent of the exhibition ‘Inscriptions: Architecture before Speech’, held at [[Harvard University]]’s [[Graduate School of Design]] in 2018, [[K. Michael Hays]] argues that today’s architecture presupposes “not a particular meaning, but a specific kind of potentiality — a non-semantic materiality, a non-referential construct that can be developed into an actual architectural project.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.designboom.com/architecture/harvard-gsd-inscriptions-exhibition-03-01-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Parc Abbey Bible''' ([[London]], [[British Library]], Add. MS 14788, 14789, and 14790) is a 12th-century [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Bible]].  It was made in the [[Leuven]] region of [[Belgium]] at the [[Abbey of St. Mary of Parc]].  A [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] on  folio 197 indicates that the [[codex]] was produced in 1148.  The text is [[Latin]] and written in proto-[[blackletter|gothic book script]] on [[vellum]].  The folios are 437 by 300 mm, with the text block being 340 by 240 mm.  The [[manuscript]] is illuminated with miniatures, diagrams, decorated borders, and decorated initials.  The decorated initials include historiated, inhabited, and foliate initials.

The Bible was purchased by the British Library in 1844.  It is now kept in three volumes. The first volume (Add. MS 14788) contains the [[Pentateuch]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], [[Book of Job|Job]], [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], [[Book of Judith|Judith]], [[Book of Esther|Esther]], I [[Ezra]],  2 Ezra, and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]]. The second volume (Add. MS 14789) contains [[Books of Kings|Kings]], [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]], [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]] and [[Maccabees]]  The third volume (Add. MS 14790) contains [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], the [[minor prophets]], and the [[New Testament]].

'''Paris Theatre''', formerly '''Third Avenue Theatre''' and also known as '''Paris Theater''' or '''Ray's Paris Theatre''',&lt;ref name=Korfhage&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korfhage|first1=Matthew|title=Capture or Asylum|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-20859-capture_or_asylum.html|accessdate=February 14, 2015|work=[[Willamette Week]]|date=July 3, 2013|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=City of Roses Newspapers|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706075554/http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-20859-capture_or_asylum.html|archive-date=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an historic building in [[Portland, Oregon]]'s [[Old Town Chinatown]] neighborhood, in the United States. The theatre was constructed in 1890 and opened as a [[burlesque]] house. It was later converted to a cinema, then a club and music venue, before serving as an [[adult movie theater]] until 2016. The building is now a live venue and nightclub.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=February 2017}}
Paris Theatre, located at 6 Southwest Third Avenue at the intersection of Third and West Burnside Street in [[downtown Portland]]'s [[Old Town Chinatown]] neighborhood, operates as a venue and [[nightclub]].&lt;ref name="Nightclub"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korfhage|first1=Matthew|title=Paris Theatre Pornhouse and Sex Club Will Become New Live Venue and Nightclub|url=http://www.wweek.com/bars/2016/06/15/paris-theatre-pornhouse-and-sex-club-will-become-new-live-venue-and-nightclub/|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=Willamette Week|date=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was completed in 1890 and opened as a [[burlesque]] house under the name Third Avenue Theatre.&lt;ref name=CT&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Theatre|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/10089 |publisher=Cinema Treasures|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue was later renamed Paris Theatre and converted to a movie cinema. It was listed in ''[[Film Daily]]'' from at least 1941 to 1950. The cinema screened the 1972 [[pornographic film]] ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' for four years.&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

By 2003, the building served as a nightclub and music venue.&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

===Adult movie theater===
[[File:Vape Spot.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The theater and adjacent storefronts at Southwest Third Avenue and West Burnside Street in 2014]]

In 2007, Ray Billings, owner of [[Jefferson Theatre (Portland, Oregon)|Jefferson Theatre]], closed that venue and relocated his [[adult movie theater]] operation to the Paris.&lt;ref name=Korfhage/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Raw&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaquiss|first1=Nigel|title=Raw deal: The city is paying millions to get out of the porn business|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-6998-raw_deal.html |accessdate=February 14, 2015|work=Willamette Week|date=May 9, 2007|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=City of Roses Newspapers|authorlink=Nigel Jaquiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinema Treasures said the building's exterior featured a red [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] with "Theatre" written vertically and "Paris" appearing horizontally across the bottom. An additional four-panel marquee was displayed above the front entrance. The theater screened heterosexual adult films on one large screen and [[gay pornography]] on a smaller screen.&lt;ref name=CT/&gt; It featured a stage where guests could engage in sexual activities in front of a crowd, along with a "perky exam table" and a "voyeuristic bedroom".&lt;ref name=Korfhage/&gt; The venue was open 24 hours to patrons age 18 or older; as of 2007, entry cost $8.&lt;ref name=Ghosts&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Michael|title=Where Ghosts Wouldn’t Be Caught Dead|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-7918-where-ghosts-wouldnt-be-caught-dead.html |accessdate=December 30, 2016|work=Willamette Week|date=October 31, 2007|location=Portland, Oregon|publisher=City of Roses Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Willamette Week]]'' included the Paris in its list of Portland sites "Where Ghosts Wouldn't Be Caught Dead". The paper said of the venue, "Unfortunately, the Paris Theater... hosts a bunch of winos, users and sleazy old guys the same age as your dad (or granddad), with their pants around their ankles and greasy cum rags in hand. A deformed zombie may be slightly more grotesque, but at least he won’t flash you."&lt;ref name=Ghosts/&gt; In 2013, the same publication provided the following description of the theater and its clientele:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the many couples offerings, a recent visit finds a smattering of middle-aged men watching a massive projection of tattooed teenage girls being sloppily choked and slapped in the face. The men in the seats have their pants on and look nervous. The men standing in the aisles do not have their pants on, and look very comfortable.

As you enter, all faces—translucent in the pale pink flicker of the theater—look away from the interlocking figures on the screen and gaze hopefully, instead, on you. Perhaps you will be something new. Perhaps you will be interesting.&lt;ref name=Korfhage/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2016, ''Willamette Week'' referred to the Paris as "an adult movie theater, sex club and safe space for public masturbators", and a "shining beacon to furtive men hiding their faces from the [[Voodoo Doughnut]] line".&lt;ref name=Nightclub/&gt;

===Current use===
The Paris was an adult movie theater until 2016, when new owners Chris Lenahan, Michael Sun, and Brad McCray converted the space into a live venue and nightclub. Their plan is to host  weekend dance parties and return the venue to its old appearance, which includes front exterior improvements and returning the marquee.&lt;ref name=Nightclub/&gt; As of June 2016, the gay theater and dungeons were removed to open up the space, and a new bar was under construction. The projection room was being converted to a sound booth and seating was put into storage.&lt;ref name=Nightclub/&gt;

The Paris Theatre was completely remodeled in 2016, when new owners Chris Lenahan, Michael Sun, and Brad McCray converted the space into a live venue and nightclub. The improvements to the theatre included the installation of a state of the art sound and lighting system, a twenty-three foot P2.5 LED Wall that serves as a movie screen for films and live television, brand new seating/flooring and a new outdoor patio. The Paris regularly hosts dance parties, live music acts (local and touring), stand up comedy, independent movie viewings, live sports games, wedding receptions, company parties and private events. The owners also returned the venue to its old appearance: which includes front exterior improvements, as well as refurbishing the historical marquee and Paris Theatre sign.&lt;ref&gt;http://elevenpdx.com/live/know-your-venue/paris-theatre{{Unreliable source|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4798">'''Probabilistic design''' is a discipline within [[engineering design]]. It deals primarily with the consideration of the effects of [[random variable|random variability]] upon the performance of an [[engineering system]] during the design phase. Typically, these effects are related to quality and reliability. Thus, probabilistic design is a tool that is mostly used in areas that are  concerned with quality and [[reliability engineering|reliability]]. For example, product design, quality control, systems engineering, [[machine design]], [[civil engineering]] (particularly useful in [[limit state design]]) and manufacturing. It differs from the classical approach to design by assuming a small probability of failure instead of using the [[safety factor]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

When using a probabilistic approach to design, the designer no longer thinks of each variable as a single value or number. Instead, each variable is viewed as a [[probability distribution]]. From this perspective, probabilistic design predicts the flow of variability (or distributions) through a system. By considering this flow, a designer can make adjustments to reduce the flow of random variability, and improve quality. Proponents of the approach contend that many quality problems can be predicted and rectified during the early design stages and at a much reduced cost.

==The objective of probabilistic design==
Typically, the goal of probabilistic design is to identify the design that will exhibit the smallest effects of random variability. This could be the one design option out of several that is found to be most robust. Alternatively, it could be the only design option available, but with the optimum combination of input variables and parameters. This second approach is sometimes referred to as [[robustification]], parameter design or [[Design for Six Sigma|design for six sigma]]

==Methods used==
Essentially, probabilistic design focuses upon the prediction of the effects of random variability. Some methods that are used to predict the random variability of an output include:

*the [[Monte Carlo method]] (including [[Latin hypercube sampling|Latin hypercubes]]);
*[[propagation of error]];
*[[design of experiments]] (DOE)
*[[method of moments (statistics)|the method of moments]]
*[[Statistical interference]]
*[[quality function deployment]]
*[[Failure mode and effects analysis]]

'''''River Landscape with Riders''''' is a c.1653&amp;ndash;1657 painting by the Dutch artist [[Aelbert Cuyp]], now in the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, which bought it in 1965 from the [[Edmond de Rothschild]] collection in [[Exbury]], Hampshire.

As the title suggests, it shows two riders pausing by a river to let their horses drink. The mountainous landscape is based on those seen along the [[River Rhine]] between [[Nijmegen]] and [[Kleve]], an area visited and drawn by the artist in 1652.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4862">The '''Stern Conservatory''' (''Stern'sches Konservatorium'') was a private [[music school]] in [[Berlin]] with many notable tutors and alumni. Today the school is part of the [[Berlin University of the Arts]].

==History==
It was founded in 1850 as the ''Berliner Musikschule'' by [[Julius Stern]], [[Theodor Kullak]] and [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]]. Kullak withdrew from the conservatory in 1855 in order to create a new academy of sculpture and three-dimensional art. With Marx's withdrawal in 1856, the conservatory came exclusively under the Stern family and adopted its name. In 1894 it was taken over by Gustav Hollaender (the uncle of film composer [[Friedrich Hollaender]]), who moved the school's location to the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] concert hall on Bernburger Strasse in Berlin-[[Kreuzberg]].

In the course of the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process, the Stern Academy in 1936 was renamed ''Konservatorium der Reichshauptstadt Berlin'' controlled by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. Gustav Hollaender's heirs were disseized, but for a few years they were able to run a "Jewish Private Music School Hollaender" until they were [[The Holocaust|deported and murdered]] in 1941.

After the end of the Second World War in 1945, the school was again renamed as the ''Städtisches Konservatorium'' (City Conservatory) in what was to become [[West Berlin]]. In 1966 it was merged with the public ''Akademische Hochschule für Musik'' into the ''Staatliche Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst'' (Berlin State School of Music and the Performing Arts), since 2001 the [[Berlin University of the Arts]].

[[File:Strindbergs intima teater.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Strindbergs Intima Teater]]
'''Strindbergs Intima Teater''' or ''Intima teatern'', is a theatre stage in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. It was founded and managed by the famous Swedish playwright [[August Strindberg]] and the young actor August Falck between 1907 and 1910. The playhouse was a small (6 x 6 meters) but engaging space based on the designs of the French and German models of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strindbergsintimateater.se/om-teatern/den-gamla-teatern&lt;/ref&gt; The small auditorium could hold up to 150 patrons and featured some of the most advanced lighting innovations of the day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strindbergsintimateater.se/om-teatern/den-gamla-teatern&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the space in no way limited the company but actually encouraged continuous experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strindbergsintimateater.se/om-teatern/den-gamla-teatern&lt;/ref&gt; The author used the stage for his own plays as well as for guest performances of modern drama from abroad. 

In all, 25 of Strindberg's plays were performed and a total number of 2500 performances were given during the theatre's short but highly influential existence. Among its most successful stagings were the original productions of ''[[Easter (play) |Easter]]'', ''[[The Ghost Sonata]]'', ''[[Miss Julie]]'' and ''Svanevit''. The theatre also triumphed on tour throughout [[Scandinavia]] and Europe.

After Strindberg's death in 1912 the theatre was locked up and remained closed for years. Between the 1920s–1980s it was used as an assembly hall for various trade union meetings and for public lectures. 

In the early 1990s, however, the debate grew among theatre goers that Strindberg's old theatre deserved better. Discussions on how to make the theatre live again and have a permanent repertoire once more became lively, especially after the Strindberg Theatre Festival in 1993. Many theatre groups, businessmen and private people expressed their interest in a revival. Funds were raised in 1998 for renovations the theatre desperately needed. In 2001 the Culture Department in [[Stockholm]] took the initiative for its re-opening and production schedule.

The repertoire today consists of the theatre's own productions and those in association with the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], of international guest performances and those from Swedish regional theatres, as well as theatre productions for schools and children.

'''''The Farm''''' is an [[oil painting]] made by [[Joan Miró]] between the summer of 1921 in [[Mont-roig del Camp]] and winter 1922 in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = DDAA | title = the Great Encyclopedia in Catalan: volume 13 | publisher = editions 62 | place = Barcelona | year = 2004 | ISBN = 84-297-5441-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a kind of inventory of the [[masia]] (traditional Catalan farmhouse) owned by his family since 1911 in the town of Mont-roig del Camp. Miró himself regarded this work as a key in his career, describing it as "a summary of my entire life in the countryside" and "the summary of one period of my work, but also the point of departure for what was to follow."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C Danto, ''Encounters and Reflections: art in the historical present,'' University of California Press, 1997: p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It is preserved in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington DC]], where it was given in 1987 by [[Mary Hemingway]], coming from the private collection of [[United States|American]] writer [[Ernest Hemingway]], who had described it by saying, “It has in it all that you feel about Spain when you are there and all that you feel when you are away and cannot go there. No one else has been able to paint these two very opposing things.”

==History==
[[File:Mas Miró- vista obra la Masia.jpeg|thumb|left|Main view of [[Mas Miró]], the family farmhouse of Joan Miró.]]
The painter, though born in [[Barcelona]], was always linked with the rural world, especially the town of Mont-roig del Camp, and his early works show an influence of the landscapes and characters in their summer country views in the land of [[Tarragona]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rebull|Rebull 1994]]: p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship with the land can be captured in the paintings produced between 1918 and 1924 as ''Vegetable Garden with Donkey''(1918) or ''Montroig, the church and the people''(1919). ''The Farm'' was started on Miró's first trip back to Mont-roig del Camp from France, and was completed in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rebull|Rebull 1994]]: p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a time when Miró was established in Paris and alternated with some travels, especially summers in Mont-Roig.&lt;ref Name="Suárez297"&gt;[[#Suarez|Suarez/Vidal 1989]]: p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The observation of everything around him and the lights on the rocks and trees, that changed in certain times the brightness of the sun, made the artist feel bound to the element earth, which was said:

{{quote | ... is essential to have your feet firmly resting on the ground to lift the flight through the air when painting [...] has to walk on land, because, through the limbs, it communicates its force.|&lt;ref&gt;[[# Penrose|Penrose 1965]] p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By economic necessity, he began a tour with [[art dealer]]s to sell this artwork. [[Léonce Rosenberg]], among others who took care of the paintings of [[Picasso]], agreed to have it in storage and any time and at the insistence of Miró, he seriously suggested dividing the canvas into small pieces to make it easier to sell. Miró, angry, picked up the canvas and took it to his workshop. Then, Jacques Viot, of the Pierre gallery, who after a few treatments, sold it to the writer [[Ernest Hemingway]], for five thousand [[french franc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[# Malet|Malet 1992]]: pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway wrote in 1934 in the journal ''[[Cahiers d'art]]'', "I won't change ''The Farm'' for any painting in the world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Paporov | first = Yuri | title = Hemingway in Cuba | publisher= Editorial Siglo XXI | year = 1993 | ISBN = 978-968-23-1848-1 | page = 92 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miró later would use the area of Mont-Roig in other works such as ''Earth and worker'' or ''[[Catalan Landscape (The Hunter)]]''. In them, as in ''The Farm'', can be observed succession in the transformation of figurative forms to other places, where there are all kinds of [[symbol]] and graphics.&lt;ref&gt;[[# Muñoz Martinez|Martinez Muñoz 2000]]: p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History for Miró ===
Miró was the first reporter on the story of his artwork:

{{quote | Nine months of hard work! Nine months (curiously, the same as the human gestation) every day painting and erasing it and doing studies and returning to destroy them! The house was the summary of my life (spiritual and poetic) in the field. From a large tree in a small snail, I wanted to put everything I loved in the field. I think it's foolish to give more value to a mountain than to an ant (and this landscapers do not know) and therefore I did not hesitate to pass my hours to give life to the ant. During the nine months I worked there worked in the artwork I did it for seven or eight hours a day. I suffered terribly, like a condemned. I Erased lots. I began to get rid of foreign influences to get in touch with [[Catalonia]] .[...] In Paris, back to work again in the canvas, I realized immediately that something wasn't working .[...] Could not paint the herbs of Mont-roig del Camp from the Boulogne woods, and to continue the painting I ended up asking to be sent authentic herbs of Mont-roig del Camp inside an envelope. They got all dry, of course. But at least with these flowers, I could continue the work .[...] When I finished ... any dealer wanted to get the painting nor even take a look at it. I wrote a lot of people and nothing happened. [[Lluís Plandiura i Pou|Plandiura]], whom I also offered, didn't want to know anything. By late Rosenberg, probably for engagement with [[Picasso]], accepted having it on deposit at home [...] and there was left a few time [...] He made me this statement: "You know that Paris people currently is living in smaller rooms every day, because the crisis is passed.? [...] Well, why not do something? We could make this material into eight pieces and then sell it to small ... "Rosenberg spoke seriously. After a couple of months I removed the canvas from Rosenberg's and took it to my workshop, living with her in the midst of misery.|Joan Miró &lt;ref&gt;''Declarations'': p. 158. and next. included in ''Joan Miró: la intencionalidad oculta de su vida y obra'' by Saturnino Pesquero. Ed. Erasmus, 2009, {{ISBN|978-84-936972-1-1}} pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The building of the house belonging to the Miró family, [[Mas Miró]], was declared a [[Cultural Asset of National Interest]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://cultura.gencat.cat/invarquit/Fitxa.asp?idregistre=9474 | title = Mas Miró | publisher = [[Patrimoni.gencat]] | accessdate = 20 August 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425021336/http://cultura.gencat.cat/invarquit/Fitxa.asp?idregistre=9474 | archivedate = 25 April 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of paperwork between the family and various public institutions, they did an agreement to make the project an active museum, where the painter's personal items will be displayed in addition to the recreation of their most important works, including ''The Farm'' through prints that show the quality and texture of the oil paintings. According to statements made by the grandson of the artist Emilio Fernandez Miró, "In addition both the Barcelona [[Joan Miró Foundation]] and the family yield original works. The house is full of [[graffiti]]s, which my grandfather used as drafts for his works [...] We want it to be a living museum. We will be providing it with works in rotation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20110225/54119842599/la-masia-de-mont-roig-albergara-un-museu-miro.html |title=La masía de Mont-roig albergará un museu Miró| publisher = La Vanguardia| first= Massot | last= Joseph | date = 2011-02-25 | language = Spanish | accessdate = 20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Samuel Bausson using Qrpedia at Fundació Joan Miró.JPG|thumb|right|''The Farm'' is described using this article and similar articles from Wikipedia using [[QRpedia]] codes.]]
''The Farm'' is the culminating work of the "retailer" time of Joan Miró, made when he was twenty-nine years old, and [[James Johnson Sweeney|James J. Sweeney]] considered as "key work of the artist's later development."&lt;ref Name="Suárez297"/&gt; He worked on it for nine months of tough preparation. The mythical relationship with the land held by Miró is summarized in this table, the graphic nature of naive and unrealistic of all objects: the animals are domestic, plants are the ones that the man works and objects are all of daily use and necessary for the [[home]]. Learn all the details to a minimum, is called the "Miró handwriting" starting point for the following years of his contact with [[surrealism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rebull|Rebull 1994]] pp. 6-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting denotes all the familiarity that was represented with Miró. It is made in a place where you can see the daily activities of a [[farmhouse]] and the characteristics of the building objects and animals. The clear definition of the drawings can easily achieves the recognition of all without causing any confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[# Penrose91|Penrose 1991]]: p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Like a stock shows a mule, some chickens, a dog, a goat, a rabbit, snails, insects and lizards, most isolated and most of them placed on any object that ago as a display on pedestals, the possibility of union between the object and animal piece by [[Braque]] "says justification" and get moving among the other elements of the work depicted.&lt;ref&gt;[[# Raillard|Raillard 1992]]: p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The building of the house includes the crevices and cracks in the plastered wall. In the center of the painting is a large [[eucalyptus]] born of a black circle, which contrasts with the white circle representing the sun from the sky.&lt;ref&gt;[[# Penrose91|Penrose 1991]]: p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; All elements of this painting, animals and objects came to be in the form of prototypes [[symbol]] that would appear in several works by Miró, for example one of the most common is the ladder representing evasion.&lt;ref&gt;[[# Penrose|Penrose 1965]] p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calling the work "Miró's climactic masterpiece," American critic [[Arthur Danto]] wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''The Farm'' is energized by two incompatible artistic realities, corresponding to the polarities of Miró's life. It has the obsessive documentation of visual reality that we find in primitive painting: each leaf on the dominating eucalyptus tree is separately painted, each rock in the stony field to the right is given an autonomous space, each blade of grass is given its own identity. . . The barking dog, the rabbit, the snail, the cock, the donkey, the dove, the pail, the watering can, the wagon, the plow, the dozens of farm implements, the farmer's wife, the baby by the wash trough, are each suspended in the shadowless clarity of a metaphysical illumination — it is the kind of light one gets through an optical instrument. . . It is as though the artist had intermixed, in a single work, the illusory space of traditional landscape with the shallow space of Cubism, so that everything is on the surface and at the same time bears no relation to the surface, which, after all, is not part of the landscape...No one who knows great painting can look at it without sensing the divided consciousness and the aesthetic indeterminacy of an artist who sank into his art the oppositions of his vision: Catalan and Parisian, traditionalist and Cubist, naif and cosmopolite."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C Danto, ''Encounters and Reflections: art in the historical present,'' University of California Press, 1997: p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Analysis ===
Several historians and art critics have given their opinion on this reference work:
{{Quote | It comes completely perfect Miró, connects for a moment with the statement, which is prayer, Maragall: why another cell, if this land is so beautiful? "The error" before introducing the deep shadow of the artist thought was concitat the moment. The ''house'' is the terrestrial sky. In it, the roosters argue the lyricism, the tree raises the strength of the instinct to drink the astral light, which is not known whether the sun or the moon. Despite its transparent walls and absolute clarity the mysteries of what makes it accessible and far unfathomable that are the immediate things. Each line is a blow to the spirit, a joy each vertex, each built up a world to live happily in it. There is an atmosphere of ecstasy Taoist in this house that matches the Catalan peace on earth. | [[Juan-Eduardo Cirlot Laporta]], ''Joan Miró''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cirlot|Cirlot Laporta 1949]] p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote | Miró carried out with discretion and a perfect means of incredible accuracy, poetic and artistic experience that will raise the limits of the [[painting]] and the heart of this whole imaginary this truly surreal reality, the surrealists did not get to know and they rub only the periphery. | Jacques Dupin, ''Miró''''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dupin|Dupin, 2004]]: p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote | It was through this new vocabulary of signs that Miró was finally realize his poetic conception of the Catalan countryside, detached from politics and debates about the cultural situation of modern art. At a time when the beleaguered and vanguard estaba where the idea of the Mediterranean was used to reinforce political positions, ideological and rhetorical, Miró tried to consolidate a new kind of alliance between form and content in their archetypal images of a Catalonia primitive. With ''The House'' from 1921 to 1922, Miró laid bare his own house (or inside the poetic) in the field of Tarragona and cataloged the contents with unprecedented clarity and precision ... | Robert Lubar, ''The Mediterranean Miró : conceptions of identity''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lubar|Lubar 1993]]: p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote | Personally, I have no doubt in saying that ''The Farm'' represents for our nation Catalan the same as ''[[Guernica (painting)|The Guernika]]'' represents for our diverse Spain, for the uniqueness and richness of spiritual values, that both works possess and transmit to the members of their communities of origin and of all humanity. | Saturnino Pescador, ''Joan Miró: hidden intentionality of his life and work &lt;ref&gt;[[# Fishing|Fishing 2009]]: p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Ernest Hemingway and ''The Farm''==
The American writer [[Ernest Hemingway]] bought Miró's painting as a birthday present for his wife, Hadley; after paying off the last installment of the 5,000 francs it cost, he brought ''The Farm'' home: "In the open taxi the wind caught the big canvas as though it were a sail, and we made the taxi driver crawl along." Hemingway later said, "No one could look at it and not know it had been painted by a great painter." &lt;ref&gt;Arthur C Danto, ''Encounters and Reflections: art in the historical present,'' University of California Press, 1997: p. 101–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion''''' ({{lang-ru|Протоколы сионских мудрецов}}) or '''''The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion''''' is an [[antisemitic canard|antisemitic fabricated text]] purporting to describe a [[Jewish]] plan for global domination. The hoax, which was shown to be plagiarized from several earlier sources, some not antisemitic in nature,{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}} was first published in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. According to the claims made by some of its publishers, the ''Protocols'' are the minutes of a late 19th-century meeting where Jewish leaders discussed their goal of global Jewish [[hegemony]] by subverting the morals of [[Gentile]]s, and by controlling the press and the world's economies.

[[Henry Ford]] funded printing of 500,000 copies that were distributed throughout the United States in the 1920s. The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] sometimes used the ''Protocols'' as propaganda against Jews; it was assigned by some German teachers, as if factual, to be read by German schoolchildren after the Nazis came to power in 1933,&lt;ref name = "Segel"&gt;Segel, BW and Levy, RS. ''A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion''. University of Nebraska Press (1995), p. 30. {{ISBN|0803242433}},&lt;/ref&gt; despite having been exposed as fraudulent by ''[[The Times]]'' of [[London]] in 1921. It is still widely available today in numerous languages, in print and on the Internet, and continues to be presented by some proponents as a genuine document.

==Creation==
{{Antisemitism}}
The ''Protocols'' is a fabricated document purporting to be factual. Textual evidence shows that it could not have been produced prior to 1901. It is notable that the title of [[Sergei Nilus]]'s widely distributed edition contains the dates "1902–1903", and it is likely that the document was actually written at this time in Russia, despite Nilus' attempt to cover this up by inserting French-sounding words into his edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michelis|first1=Cesare G. De|title=The non-existent manuscript : a study of the Protocols of the sages of Zion|date=2004|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=0803217277|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cesare G. De Michelis]] argues that it was manufactured in the months after a Russian Zionist congress in September 1902, and that it was originally a parody of Jewish idealism meant for internal circulation among antisemites until it was decided to clean it up and publish it as if it were real. Self-contradictions in various testimonies show that the individuals involved—including the text's initial publisher, [[Pavel Krushevan]]—deliberately obscured the origins of the text and lied about it in the decades afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michelis|first1=Cesare G. De|title=The non-existent manuscript : a study of the Protocols of the sages of Zion|date=2004|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=0803217277|pages=76–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the placement of the forgery in 1902–1903 Russia is correct, then it was written at the beginning of the [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]], in which thousands of Jews died or fled the country. Many of the people whom De Michelis suspects of involvement in the forgery were directly responsible for inciting the pogroms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Political conspiracy background===
Towards the end of the 18th century, following the [[Partitions of Poland]], the [[Russian Empire]] inherited the world's largest Jewish population. The Jews lived in ''[[shtetls]]'' in the West of the Empire, in the [[Pale of Settlement]] and until the 1840s, local Jewish affairs were organised through the ''[[qahal]]'', including for purposes of taxation and conscription into the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. Following the ascent of [[liberalism]] in Europe, the Russian ruling class became more hardline in its reactionary policies, upholding the banner of ''[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]]'', whereby non-Orthodox and non-Russian subjects, including the Jews, were not always embraced. Jews who attempted to [[Jewish assimilation|assimilate]] were regarded with suspicion as potential "infiltrators" supposedly trying to "take over society", while Jews who remained attached to traditional Jewish culture were resented as undesirable aliens.

[[File:Kagal book.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869) by Jacob Brafman, in the Russian language original.]]
Resentment towards Jews, for the aforementioned reasons, existed in Russian society, but the idea of a Protocols-esque [[international Jewish conspiracy]] for world domination was minted in the 1860s. [[Jacob Brafman]], a Russian Jew from [[Minsk]], had a falling out with agents of the local kahal &amp;ndash; the semi-autonomous Jewish government &amp;ndash; and consequently turned against [[Judaism]]. He subsequently converted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and authored polemics against the [[Talmud]] and the kahal.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} Brafman claimed in his books ''The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods'' (1868) and ''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869), published in [[Vilna]], that the kahal continued to exist in secret and that it had as its principal aim undermining Christian entrepreneurs, taking over their property and ultimately seizing power. He also claimed that it was an international conspiratorial network, under the central control of the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'', which was based in Paris and then under the leadership of [[Adolphe Crémieux]], a prominent [[freemason]].{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} The Vilna Talmudist, [[Jacob Barit]], attempted to refute Brafman's claim.

The impact of Brafman's work took on an international aspect, as it was translated into English, French, German and other languages. The image of the "kahal" as a secret international Jewish shadow government working as a [[state within a state]] was picked up by anti-Jewish publications in Russia and was taken seriously by some Russian officials such as P. A. Cherevin and [[Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev]] who in the 1880s urged governor-generals of provinces to seek out the supposed kahal. This was around the time of the ''[[Narodnaya Volya]]''  assassination of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] and the subsequent [[pogrom]]s. In France it was translated by Monsignor [[Ernest Jouin]] in 1925, who supported the Protocols. In 1928, [[Siegfried Passarge]], a geographer active in the [[Third Reich]], translated it into German.

Aside from Brafman, there were other early writings which posited a similar concept to the Protocols. This includes ''The Conquest of the World by the Jews'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Forms of Hatred: The Troubled Imagination in Modern Philosophy and Literature|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M7Tdl6vgbmUC|publisher = Rodopi|date = 2003-01-01|isbn = 9042010665|first = Leonidas|last = Donskis}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in [[Basel]] and authored by Osman Bey (born Frederick Millingen). Millingen was a British subject of [[Dutch Jews|Dutch-Jewish]] extraction (the grandson of [[James Millingen]]), but served as an officer in the [[Ottoman Army]] where he was born. He converted to [[Islam]], but later became a Russian Orthodox Christian. Bey's work was followed up by [[Hippolytus Lutostansky]]'s ''The Talmud and the Jews'' (1879) which claimed  that Jews wanted to divide Russia among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://newspaperarchive.com/us/new-york/new-york/new-york-times/1911/08-27/page-42|title = Ritual murder encouraged...|last = |first = |date = August 27, 1911|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |publication-date = August 27, 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, in a 1904 edition of ''The Talmud and the Jews,'' Hippolytus directly quoted verbatim the first, little-known 1903 edition of the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Non-Existent Manuscript - University of Nebraska Press|url = http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Non-Existent-Manuscript,671722.aspx|website = www.nebraskapress.unl.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources employed===
Source material for the forgery consisted jointly of ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu|Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu]]'' (''Dialogue in Hell Between [[Niccolò|Machiavelli]] and [[Montesquieu]]''), an 1864 [[political satire]] by [[Maurice Joly]];{{Sfn | Jacobs | Weitzman | 2003 | p = 15}} and a chapter from ''Biarritz'', an 1868 novel by the antisemitic German novelist [[Hermann Goedsche]], which had been translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] in 1872.&lt;ref name = "translated97"&gt;{{Citation | last = Segel | first = Binjamin W | title = A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion | editor-link = Richard S.

A major source for the ''Protocols'' was ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' by [[Theodor Herzl]], which was referred to as ''Zionist Protocols'' in its initial French and Russian editions. Paradoxically, early Russian editions of the ''Protocols'' assert that they did not come from a Zionist organization.{{Sfn|De Michelis|2004|p=47}} The text, which nowhere advocates for [[Zionism]], resembles a parody of Herzl's ideas.{{Sfn |De Michelis|2004|p=114]}}

===Literary forgery===
''The Protocols'' is one of the best-known and most-discussed examples of [[literary forgery]], with analysis and proof of its fraudulent origin going as far back as 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/hoax.html | title = A Hoax of Hate | publisher = Jewish Virtual Library}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The forgery is an early example of "[[conspiracy theory]]" literature.&lt;ref name=Boym&gt;{{Citation | first = Svetlana | last = Boym | title = Conspiracy theories and literary ethics: Umberto Eco, Danilo Kis and 'The Protocols of Zion' | journal = Comparative Literature | issue = Spring | year = 1999 | doi = 10.2307/1771244 | volume = 51 | pages = 97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Written mainly in the first person plural,{{Efn | The text contains 44 instances of the word "I" (9.6%), and 412 instances of the word "we" (90.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.shoaheducation.com/protocols.html | title = The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion | others = Marsden, VE transl | publisher = Shoah education }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the text includes [[generalization]]s, [[truism]]s, and [[platitude]]s on how to take over the world: take control of the media and the financial institutions, change the traditional social order, etc. It does not contain specifics.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 85}}

===Maurice Joly===
Elements of the ''Protocols'' were plagiarized from Joly's fictional ''Dialogue in Hell'', a thinly veiled attack on the political ambitions of [[Napoleon III]], who, represented by the [[Gentile|non-Jewish]] character [[Machiavelli]],&lt;ref name ="Google Books Search"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Ye’r | first1 = Bat | first2 = Miriam | last2 = Kochan | author3-link = David Littman (historian)| first3 = David | last3 = Littman | title = Islam and Dhimmitude | publisher = [[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]] | place = US | date = December 1, 2001 | isbn = 978-0-8386-3942-9 | page = 142 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=n4kTdYgwQPkC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=The+Protocols+of+the+Learned+Elders+of+Zion++forgery+%22Maurice+Joly%22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; plots to rule the world. Joly, a [[Monarchism|monarchist]] and [[Legitimism|legitimist]], was imprisoned in France for 15 months as a direct result of his book's publication. Scholars have noted the irony that ''Dialogue in Hell'' was itself a plagiarism, at least in part, of a novel by [[Eugène Sue]], ''Les Mystères du Peuple'' (1849–56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Eco | first = Umberto | title = Six Walks in the Fictional Woods| year = 1994 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-674-81050-3| authorlink = Umberto Eco| page= 135| chapter= Fictional Protocols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifiable phrases from Joly constitute 4% of the first half of the first edition, and 12% of the second half; later editions, including most translations, have longer quotes from Joly.{{Sfn | De Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004 | p = [https://books.google.com/?id=9uG1jsrOenwC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=first+zionist+congress+nilus#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20zionist%20congress%20nilus&amp;f=false 8]}}

''The Protocols'' 1–19 closely follow the order of Maurice Joly's ''Dialogues'' 1–17. For example:

|}

[[Philip Graves]] brought this plagiarism to light in a series of articles in ''The Times'' in 1921, the first published evidence that the ''Protocols'' was not an authentic document.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Bein | first = Alex|year= 1990| page=339|title=The Jewish question: biography of a world problem|isbn = 978-0-8386-3252-9 |publisher= Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}}

===Hermann Goedsche===
{{main|Hermann Goedsche}}
"Goedsche was a postal clerk and a spy for the [[Prussian Secret Police]]. He had been forced to leave the postal work due to his part in forging evidence in the prosecution against the Democratic leader [[Benedict Waldeck]] in 1849."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = IGC | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://ddickerson.igc.org/The_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion.pdf | last = Keren | first = David | title = Commentary on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion | date = February 10, 1993 | page = 4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140729103854/http://ddickerson.igc.org/The_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion.pdf | archivedate = July 29, 2014 | df =  }}. Republished as {{Citation | contribution = Introduction | title = The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion | others = Marsden, Victor E transl}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his dismissal, Goedsche began a career as a conservative columnist, and wrote literary fiction under the pen name Sir John Retcliffe.&lt;ref name= Cohn1966&gt;{{Citation | first = Norman | last = Cohn | title = Warrant for Genocide: The Myth of the Jewish World-Conspiracy and the Protocols of the Elder of Zion | place = New York | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | year = 1966 | pages = 32–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His 1868 novel ''Biarritz'' (''To Sedan'') contains a chapter called "[[Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague|The Jewish Cemetery in Prague]] and the Council of Representatives of the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]]." In it, Goedsche (who was unaware that only two of the original twelve Biblical "tribes" remained) depicts a clandestine nocturnal meeting of members of a mysterious [[rabbi]]nical [[cabal]] that is planning a diabolical "Jewish conspiracy." At midnight, the Devil appears to contribute his opinions and insight. The chapter closely resembles a scene in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''Giuseppe Balsamo'' (1848), in which Joseph Balsamo a.k.a. [[Alessandro Cagliostro]] and company plot the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Serendipities: Language and Lunacy|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11134-7|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCyBIa34aAMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 a Russian translation of "The Jewish Cemetery in Prague" appeared in [[Saint Petersburg]] as a separate pamphlet of purported non-fiction. François Bournand, in his ''Les Juifs et nos Contemporains'' (1896), reproduced the soliloquy at the end of the chapter, in which the character Levit expresses as factual the wish that Jews be "kings of the world in 100 years" —crediting a "Chief Rabbi John Readcliff." Perpetuation of the myth of the authenticity of Goedsche's story, in particular the "Rabbi's speech", facilitated later accounts of the equally mythical authenticity of the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref name = Cohn1966 /&gt; Like the ''Protocols'', many asserted that the fictional "rabbi's speech" had a ring of authenticity, regardless of its origin: "This speech was published in our time, eighteen years ago," read an 1898 report in [[La Croix]], "and all the events occurring before our eyes were anticipated in it with truly frightening accuracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Maurice | last = Olender | authorlink = Maurice Olender | title = Race and Erudition | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2009 | page = 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictional events in Joly's ''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu'', which appeared four years before ''Biarritz'', may well have been the inspiration for Goedsche's fictional midnight meeting, and details of the outcome of the supposed plot. Goedsche's chapter may have been an outright plagiarism of Joly, Dumas père, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History | first1 = Paul R | last1 = Mendes-Flohr | first2 = Jehuda | last2 = Reinharz | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-19-507453-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0Bu5GnLZCw0C&amp;pg=PA363 |at=p.363 see footnote}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = lower-alpha name=Graves1921&gt;This complex relationship was originally exposed by {{Harvnb | Graves | 1921}}.

==History==

===Publication history===
{{see also|List of editions of Protocols of the Elders of Zion}}
''The Protocols'' appeared in print in the Russian Empire as early as 1903, published as a series of articles in ''[[Znamya (newspaper)|Znamya]]'', a [[Black Hundreds]] newspaper owned by [[Pavel Krushevan]]. It appeared again in 1905 as the final chapter (Chapter XII) of the second edition of ''Velikoe v malom i antikhrist'' ("The Great in the Small &amp; [[Antichrist]]"), a book by [[Sergei Nilus]]. In 1906, it appeared in pamphlet form edited by [[Georgy Butmi de Katzman]].{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}}

These first three (and subsequently more) Russian language imprints were published and circulated in the [[Russian Empire]] during the 1903–6 period as a tool for [[scapegoating]] Jews, blamed by the monarchists for the defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the [[Revolution of 1905]]. Common to all three texts is the idea that Jews aim for world domination. Since ''The Protocols'' are presented as merely a [[document]], the [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] and [[Book design#Back matter (end matter)|back matter]] are needed to explain its alleged origin. The diverse imprints, however, are mutually inconsistent. The general claim is that the document was stolen from a secret Jewish organization. Since the alleged original stolen manuscript does not exist, one is forced to restore a purported original edition. This has been done by the Italian scholar, [[Cesare G. De Michelis]] in 1998, in a work which was translated into English and published in 2004, where he treats his subject as [[Apocrypha]].{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}}{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967}}

As fiction in the genre of literature, the tract was further analyzed by [[Umberto Eco]] in his novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' in 1988 (English translation in 1989), in 1994 in chapter 6, "Fictional Protocols", of his ''[[Six Walks in the Fictional Woods]]'' and in his 2010 novel ''[[The Prague Cemetery]]''.

As the [[Russian Revolution]] unfolded, causing [[White movement]]-affiliated Russians to flee to the West, this text was carried along and assumed a new purpose. Until then, ''The Protocols'' had remained obscure;{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967}} it now became an instrument for blaming Jews for the Russian Revolution. It became a tool, a political weapon, used against the [[Bolsheviks]] who were depicted as overwhelmingly Jewish, allegedly executing the "plan" embodied in ''The Protocols''. The purpose was to discredit the [[October Revolution]], prevent the West from recognizing the [[Soviet Union]], and bring about the downfall of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s regime.{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}}{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967}}

===First Russian language editions===

====Conspiracy references====
According to [[Daniel Pipes]],
{{Quote |The great importance of ''The Protocols'' lies in its permitting antisemites to reach beyond their traditional circles and find a large international audience, a process that continues to this day. The forgery poisoned public life wherever it appeared; it was "self-generating; a blueprint that migrated from one conspiracy to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Umberto | last = Eco | author-link = Umberto Eco | title = [[Foucault's Pendulum]] | place = London | publisher = Picador | year = 1990 | page = 490}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's vagueness—almost no names, dates, or issues are specified—has been one key to this wide-ranging success. The purportedly Jewish authorship also helps to make the book more convincing. Its embrace of contradiction—that to advance, Jews use all tools available, including capitalism and communism, [[philo-Semitism]] and antisemitism, democracy and tyranny—made it possible for ''The Protocols'' to reach out to all: rich and poor, [[right-wing|Right]] and [[left-wing|Left]], Christian and [[Muslim]], American and Japanese.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 85}}}}

Pipes notes that the ''Protocols'' emphasizes recurring themes of conspiratorial antisemitism: "Jews always scheme", "Jews are everywhere", "Jews are behind every institution", "Jews obey a central authority, the shadowy 'Elders'", and "Jews are close to success."{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | pp = 86–87}}

''The Protocols'' is widely considered influential in the development of other conspiracy theories{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}, and reappears repeatedly in contemporary conspiracy literature, such as [[Jim Marrs]]' ''Rule by Secrecy,'' which identifies the work as a Czarist forgery. Some recent editions proclaim that the "Jews" depicted in the Protocols are a cover identity for other conspirators such as the [[Illuminati]],&lt;ref name="Freund2000" /&gt; [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], the [[Priory of Sion]], or even, in the opinion of [[David Icke]], "[[Reptilian humanoid|extra-dimensional entities]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Emergence in Russia===
[[File:1912ed TheProtocols by Nilus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|The front piece of a 1912 edition using occult symbols.]]
The chapter "In the Jewish Cemetery in Prague" from Goedsche's ''Biarritz'', with its strong antisemitic theme containing the alleged rabbinical plot against the European civilization, was translated into Russian as a separate pamphlet in 1872.&lt;ref name="translated97"/&gt;  However, in 1921, Princess [[Catherine Radziwill]] gave a private lecture in New York in which she claimed that the Protocols were a forgery compiled in 1904–5 by Russian journalists [[Matvei Golovinski]] and Manasevich-Manuilov at the direction of [[Pyotr Rachkovsky]], Chief of the Russian secret service in Paris.&lt;ref name = NYT_RadziwillQuizzed&gt;{{Cite news |title = Princess Radziwill Quizzed at Lecture; Stranger Questions Her Title After She Had Told of Forgery of "Jewish Protocols."

In 1944, German writer [[Konrad Heiden]] identified Golovinski as an author of the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref name = Freund2000&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/27585.html | title = Forging Protocols | first = Charles Paul | last = Freund | newspaper = Reason Magazine |date=February 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Radziwill's account was supported by Russian historian Mikhail Lepekhine, who published his findings in November 1999 in the French newsweekly ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = French | url = http://www.phdn.org/antisem/protocoles/origines.html | first = Éric | last = Conan | title = Les secrets d'une manipulation antisémite |trans-title=The secrets of an antisemite manipulation | newspaper = L’Express | date = November 16, 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lepekhine considers the ''Protocols'' a part of a scheme to persuade Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] that the modernization of Russia was really a Jewish plot to control the world.&lt;ref name=Skuratovsky&gt;{{Citation | first = Vadim | last = Skuratovsky | title = The Question of the Authorship of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" | publisher = Judaica Institute | place = Kiev | year = 2001 | isbn = 966-7273-12-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Bronner|Stephen Eric Bronner]] writes that groups opposed to progress, parliamentarianism, urbanization, and capitalism, and an active Jewish role in these modern institutions, were particularly drawn to the antisemitism of the document.{{Sfn | Bronner | 2003 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=kkl-ZxE6h0oC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=A+rumor+about+the+Jews+modernity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bd3tTKjkMcKt8Aa6_u3SDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20rumor%20about%20the%20Jews%20modernity&amp;f=false ix], [https://books.google.com/books?id=kkl-ZxE6h0oC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=A+rumor+about+the+Jews+attack+on+liberalism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WtvtTI3MOoK88gauzMGiDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 56]}} [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] scholar [[Vadim Skuratovsky]] offers extensive literary, historical and [[linguistics|linguistic]] analysis of the original text of the ''Protocols'' and traces the influences of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s [[prose]] (in particular, ''[[The Grand Inquisitor]]'' and ''[[The Possessed (novel)|The Possessed]]'') on Golovinski's writings, including the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref name = Skuratovsky /&gt;

Golovinski's role in the writing of the Protocols is disputed by Michael Hagemeister, Richard Levy and Cesare De Michelis, who each write that the account which involves him is historically unverifiable and to a large extent provably wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = M. Hagemeister | title = The Non-Existent Manuscript | pages = ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Michael Hagemeister | title = The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: Between History and Fiction | journal = New German Critique 103 | volume = 35 | number = 1 | year = 2008 | pages = 83–95 | quote = How can we explain that when it comes to the origins and dissemination of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the rules of careful historical research are so completely ignored and we are regularly served up stories}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levy-record/&gt;

In his book ''The Non-Existent Manuscript'', Italian scholar [[Cesare G. De Michelis]] studies early Russian publications of the ''Protocols''. The ''Protocols'' were first mentioned in the Russian press in April 1902, by the Saint Petersburg newspaper ''Novoye Vremya'' ({{lang|ru|Новое Время}} – ''The New Times''). The article was written by famous conservative publicist [[:ru:Меньшиков, Михаил Осипович|Mikhail Menshikov]] as a part of his regular series "Letters to Neighbors" ("Письма к ближним") and was titled "Plots against Humanity". The author described his meeting with a lady ([[Yuliana Glinka]], as it is known now) who, after telling him about her mystical revelations, implored him to get familiar with the documents later known as the ''Protocols''; but after reading some excerpts, Menshikov became quite skeptical about their origin and did not publish them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = Russian | url = http://www.vehi.net/asion/kon/08.html#_ftnref14 | first1 = T | last1 = Karasova | first2 = D | last2 = Chernyakhovsky | title = Afterword}} in {{Citation | language = Russian | edition = translated | first = Norman | last = Cohn | title = Warrant for Genocide}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Krushevan and Nilus editions====
The ''Protocols'' were published at the earliest, in serialized form, from August 28 to September 7 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) 1903, in ''[[Znamya (newspaper)|Znamya]]'', a Saint Petersburg daily newspaper, under [[Pavel Krushevan]]. Krushevan had initiated the [[Kishinev pogrom]] four months earlier.&lt;ref name = Kadzhaya&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.newtimes.ru/eng/detail.asp?art_id=470 |title= The Fraud of a Century, or a book born in hell |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051217032523/http://www.newtimes.ru/eng/detail.asp?art_id=470 | archivedate =December 17, 2005 | first = Valery | last = Kadzhaya | accessdate = September 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Sergei Nilus published the full text of the ''Protocols'' in ''Chapter XII'', the final chapter (pp&amp;#8239;305–417), of the second edition (or third, according to some sources) of his book, ''[[Velikoe v malom i antikhrist]]'', which translates as "The Great within the Small: The Coming of the Anti-Christ and the Rule of Satan on Earth". He claimed it was the work of the [[First Zionist Congress]], held in 1897 in [[Basel, Switzerland]].{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}} When it was pointed out that the First Zionist Congress had been open to the public and was attended by many non-Jews, Nilus changed his story, saying the Protocols were the work of the 1902–3 meetings of the Elders, but contradicting his own prior statement that he had received his copy in 1901:
{{quote |In 1901, I succeeded through an acquaintance of mine (the late Court Marshal Alexei Nikolayevich Sukotin of Chernigov) in getting a manuscript that exposed with unusual perfection and clarity the course and development of the secret Jewish Freemasonic conspiracy, which would bring this wicked world to its inevitable end. The person who gave me this manuscript guaranteed it to be a faithful translation of the original documents that were stolen by a woman from one of the highest and most influential leaders of the Freemasons at a secret meeting somewhere in France—the beloved nest of Freemasonic conspiracy.&lt;ref name= Kominsky1970&gt;{{Citation | first = Morris | last = Kominsky | author-link = Morris Kominsky | title = The Hoaxers | year = 1970 | page = 209 | isbn = 0-8283-1288-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Stolypin's fraud investigation, 1905====
A subsequent secret investigation ordered by [[Pyotr Stolypin]], the newly appointed chairman of the Council of Ministers, came to the conclusion that the ''Protocols'' first appeared in Paris in antisemitic circles around 1897–1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.fedorov.ru/stolypin.html | title = P. Stolypin's attempt to resolve the Jewish question | first = Boris | last = Fyodorov | language = Russian | place = [[Russia|RU]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Nicholas II]] learned of the results of this investigation, he requested, "The Protocols should be confiscated, a good cause cannot be defended by dirty means."&lt;ref name=Burtsev1938&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Jewniverse | language = Russian | url = http://www.jewniverse.ru/RED/Burtsev/BPSM-1-4.htm | place = Paris | title = The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery | first = Vladimir | last = Burtsev | author-link = Vladimir Burtsev | year = 1938 | page = 106 | chapter = 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the order, or because of the "good cause", numerous reprints proliferated.&lt;ref name=Kadzhaya /&gt;

===''The Protocols'' in the West===
[[File:1934 Protocols Patriotic Pub.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|A 1934 edition by the Patriotic Publishing Company of Chicago.]]
In the United States, ''The Protocols'' are to be understood in the context of the [[First Red Scare]] (1917–20). The text was purportedly brought to the United States by a Russian army officer in 1917; it was translated into English by [[Natalie de Bogory]] (personal assistant of [[Harris A. Houghton]], an officer of the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]]) in June 1918,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, N. ''Henry Ford and the Jews. The mass production of hate''. PublicAffair (2001), p. 82. {{ISBN|1891620525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Russian expatriate [[Boris Brasol]] soon circulated it in American government circles, specifically diplomatic and military, in typescript form,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. ''The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich''. St. Martin's Press (2003), p. 60. {{ISBN|0312290225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a copy of which is archived by the [[Hoover Institute]].{{Sfn | Singerman | 1980 | pp = 48–78}} It also appeared in 1919 in the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' as a pair of serialized newspaper articles. But all references to "Jews" were replaced with references to ''[[Bolsheviki]]'' as an [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] by the journalist and subsequently highly respected [[Columbia University]] School of Journalism dean [[Carl W. Ackerman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p61ACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT190&amp;lpg=PT190&amp;dq=ackerman.+zion.+bolshevik&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SQs_6856AM&amp;sig=1A-Ll7ZMvv3419WlV06ZPKKXnVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAhuCB_NLXAhWS3KQKHd4jAJcQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Replaced%20every%20reference%20to%20Jews%20with%20Bolshevists&amp;f=false|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|last=Toczek|first=Nick|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=1317525876|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Sfn | Singerman | 1980 | pp = 48–78}}

In 1923, there appeared an anonymously edited pamphlet by the [[Britons Publishing Society]], a successor to [[The Britons]], an entity created and headed by [[Henry Hamilton Beamish]]. This imprint was allegedly a translation by [[Victor E. Marsden]], who died in October 1920.{{Sfn | Singerman | 1980 | pp = 48–78}}

Most versions substantially involve "protocols", or minutes of a speech given in secret involving Jews who are organized as [[Elder (administrative title)|Elders]], or [[List of types of spiritual teachers|Sages]], of [[Zion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/3930590/The-Protocols-of-Zion-Chapter-5 | last = Rivera | first = David Allen | title = Final Warning: A History of The New World Order | chapter = 5 | origyear = 1994 | year = 1998 | url = http://www.silverbearcafe.com/private/NWO/nwotoc.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and underlies 24 protocols that are supposedly followed by the Jewish people.

====English language imprints====
On October 27 and 28, 1919, the [[Philadelphia]] ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' published excerpts of an English language translation as the "Red Bible," deleting all references to the purported Jewish authorship and re-casting the document as a [[Bolshevik]] [[manifesto]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{Citation | authorlink= Philip Jenkins|last=Jenkins | first = Philip | title = Hoods and Shirts: The Extreme Right in Pennsylvania, 1925–1950 | publisher = [[UNC Press]] | year = 1997 | page = 114 | isbn = 0-8078-2316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the articles was the paper's [[correspondent]] at the time, [[Carl W.

In the leader (editorial) titled "The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry", [[Wickham Steed]] wrote about ''The Protocols'':
{{Quote | What are these 'Protocols'? Are they authentic? If so, what malevolent assembly concocted these plans and gloated over their exposition? Are they forgery?

In 1934, an anonymous editor expanded the compilation with "Text and Commentary" (pp 136–41). The production of this uncredited compilation was a 300-page book, an inauthentic expanded edition of the twelfth chapter of Nilus's 1905 book on the coming of the anti-Christ. It consists of substantial liftings of excerpts of articles from Ford's antisemitic periodical ''The Dearborn Independent''. This 1934 text circulates most widely in the English-speaking world, as well as on the internet. The "Text and Commentary" concludes with [[quote mining|a comment]] on [[Chaim Weizmann]]'s October 6, 1920, remark at a banquet: "A beneficent protection which God has instituted in the life of the Jew is that He has dispersed him all over the world". Marsden, who was dead by then, is credited with the following assertion:
{{Quote | It proves that the Learned Elders exist. It proves that Dr. Weizmann knows all about them. It proves that the desire for a "National Home" in Palestine is only camouflage and an infinitesimal part of the Jew's real object. It proves that the Jews of the world have no intention of settling in Palestine or any separate country, and that their annual prayer that they may all meet "Next Year in Jerusalem" is merely a piece of their characteristic make-believe. It also demonstrates that the Jews are now a world menace, and that the Aryan races will have to domicile them permanently out of Europe.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Introduction | edition = English | first = Victor E | last = Marsden | title = The protocols of the learned Elders of Zion}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====''The Times'' exposes a forgery, 1921====
[[File:TheTimes exposes TheProtocols as a forgery.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|''The Times'' exposed the ''Protocols'' as a forgery on August 16–18, 1921]]
In 1920–1921, the history of the concepts found in the ''Protocols'' was traced back to the works of Goedsche and [[Jacques Crétineau-Joly]] by [[Lucien Wolf]] (an English Jewish journalist), and published in London in August 1921. But a dramatic exposé occurred in the series of articles in ''The Times'' by its [[Constantinople]] reporter, [[Philip Graves]], who discovered the plagiarism from the work of [[Maurice Joly]].{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}}

&lt;!-- Note: In 1921, the city of Istanbul was called Constantinople. don't change the city name without discussing. --&gt;
According to writer Peter Grose, [[Allen Dulles]], who was in Constantinople developing relationships in post-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] political structures, discovered "the source" of the documentation and ultimately provided him to ''The Times''. Grose writes that ''The Times'' extended a loan to the source, a Russian émigré who refused to be identified, with the understanding the loan would not be repaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Grose | title = Gentleman Spy: The Life of Allen Dulles | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Holmes, a lecturer in economic history at [[Sheffield University]], identified the émigré as Michael Raslovleff, a self-identified antisemite, who gave the information to Graves so as not to "give a weapon of any kind to the Jews, whose friend I have never been."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Leon Poliakov| last = Poliakov | first = Leon | year = 1997 | contribution = Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion | title = [[Encyclopedia Judaica]] | edition = CD-ROM 1.0 | editor-first = Cecil | editor-last = Roth | editor-link = Cecil Roth | publisher = Keter | isbn = 965-07-0665-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first article of Graves' series, titled "A Literary Forgery", the editors of ''The Times'' wrote, "our Constantinople Correspondent presents for the first time conclusive proof that the document is in the main a clumsy plagiarism. He has forwarded us a copy of the French book from which the plagiarism is made."{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}} In the same year, an entire book{{Sfn | Bernstein | 1921}} documenting the hoax was published in the United States by [[Herman Bernstein]]. Despite this widespread and extensive debunking, the ''Protocols'' continued to be regarded as important factual evidence by antisemites. Dulles, a successful lawyer and career diplomat, attempted to persuade the [[US State Department]] to publicly denounce the forgery, but without success.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Breitman et al. (2005).

===Arab world===
A translation made by an Arab Christian appeared in [[Cairo]] in 1927 or 1928, this time as a book. The first translation by an Arab Muslim was also published in Cairo, but only in 1951.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1986"&gt;{{Citation |last=Lewis |first=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Lewis |title=Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice | year=1986 |publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co. |isbn=0-393-02314-1 | page = 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===

====The Berne Trial, 1934–35====
{{Main|Berne Trial}}
The selling of the ''Protocols'' (edited by German antisemite [[Theodor Fritsch]]) by the [[National Front (Switzerland)|National Front]] during a political manifestation in the Casino of Berne on June 13, 1933,{{Efn | The main speaker was the former chief of the Swiss General Staff [[Emil Sonderegger]].}} led to the [[Berne Trial]] in the ''Amtsgericht'' (district court) of [[Berne]], the capital of [[Switzerland]], on October 29, 1934. The plaintiffs (the Swiss Jewish Association and the Jewish Community of Berne) were represented by Hans Matti and [[Georges Brunschvig]], helped by Emil Raas. Working on behalf of the defense was German antisemitic propagandist [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]]. On May 19, 1935, two defendants (Theodore Fischer and Silvio Schnell) were convicted of violating a Bernese statute prohibiting the distribution of "immoral, obscene or brutalizing" texts&lt;ref name="NZZ"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.nzz.ch/2005/12/23/fe/articleDEYRW.html|title= Die Quelle allen Übels? Wie ein Berner Gericht 1935 gegen antisemitische Verschwörungsphantasien vorging|last= Hafner|first= Urs|date= December 23, 2005|publisher= [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|language= German|accessdate= 2008-10-11|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201033419/http://www.nzz.ch/2005/12/23/fe/articleDEYRW.html|archivedate= February 1, 2011|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while three other defendants were acquitted. The court declared the ''Protocols'' to be forgeries, plagiarisms, and obscene literature. Judge Walter Meyer, a Christian who had not heard of the ''Protocols'' earlier, said in conclusion,
{{Quote | I hope the time will come when nobody will be able to understand how in 1935 nearly a dozen sane and responsible men were able for two weeks to mock the intellect of the Bern court discussing the authenticity of the so-called Protocols, the very Protocols that, harmful as they have been and will be, are nothing but laughable nonsense.&lt;ref name=Kadzhaya /&gt;}}

[[Vladimir Burtsev]], a Russian émigré, anti-Bolshevik and [[Anti-fascism|anti-Fascist]] who exposed numerous [[Okhrana]] [[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]] in the early 1900s, served as a witness at the Berne Trial. In 1938 in Paris he published a book, ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery'', based on his testimony.

On November 1, 1937, the defendants appealed the verdict to the ''Obergericht'' (Cantonal Supreme Court) of Berne. A panel of three judges acquitted them, holding that the ''Protocols'', while false, did not violate the statute at issue because they were "political publications" and not "immoral (obscene) publications (Schundliteratur)" in the strict sense of the law.&lt;ref name="NZZ"/&gt; The presiding judge's opinion stated, though, that the forgery of the ''Protocols'' was not questionable and expressed regret that the law did not provide adequate protection for Jews from this sort of literature. The court refused to impose the fees of defense of the acquitted defendants to the plaintiffs, and the acquitted Theodor Fischer had to pay 100 Fr. to the total state costs of the trial (Fr. 28'000) that were eventually paid by the Canton of Berne.{{Sfn | Ben-Itto | 2005 | loc = chapter 11}} This decision gave grounds for later allegations that the appeal court "confirmed authenticity of the Protocols" which is contrary to the facts. A view favorable to the pro-Nazi defendants is reported in an appendix to [[Leslie Fry]]'s ''Waters Flowing Eastward''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.iamthewitness.com/books/Denis.Fahey/Waters.Flowing.Eastward/Appendix.2_The.Berne.Trials.htm |title= Waters Flowing Eastward | chapter = Appendix II: The Berne Trials|last=Fry|first=Leslie|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more scholarly work on the trial is in a 139-page monograph by Urs Lüthi&lt;!--not [[Urs Lüthi]]--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lüthi | first = Urs | language = German | title = Der Mythos von der Weltverschwörung: die Hetze der Schweizer Frontisten gegen Juden und Freimaurer, am Beispiel des Berner Prozesses um die "Protokolle der Weisen von Zion" | place = Basel/Frankfurt am Main | publisher = Helbing &amp; Lichtenhahn | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-3-7190-1197-0 | oclc = 30002662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Basel Trial====
A similar trial in Switzerland took place at [[Basel]]. The Swiss [[National Front (Switzerland)|Frontists]] Alfred Zander and Eduard Rüegsegger distributed the ''Protocols'' (edited by the German Gottfried zur Beek) in Switzerland. Jules Dreyfus-Brodsky and Marcus Cohen sued them for insult to Jewish honor. At the same time, chief rabbi [[Mordecai Ehrenpreis|Marcus Ehrenpreis]] of Stockholm (who also witnessed at the Berne Trial) sued Alfred Zander who contended that Ehrenpreis himself had said that the ''Protocols'' were authentic (referring to the foreword of the edition of the ''Protocols'' by the German antisemite Theodor Fritsch). On June 5, 1936 these proceedings ended with a settlement.{{Efn | Zander had to withdraw his contention and the stock of the incriminated ''Protocols'' were destroyed by order of the court. Zander had to pay the fees of this Basel Trial.{{Sfn | Lüthi | 1992 | p = 45}}}}

===Germany===
According to historian [[Norman Cohn]],{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967 | p = 169}} the assassins of German Jewish politician [[Walter Rathenau]] (1867–1922) were convinced that Rathenau was a literal "Elder of Zion".

It seems likely Hitler first became aware of the ''Protocols'' after hearing about it from ethnic German [[white émigrés]], such as [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter]].&lt;ref&gt;Gellately, Robert (2012). ''Lenin, Stalin and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe'', {{ISBN|1448138787}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler refers to the ''Protocols'' in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'':

{{Quote | ... [The Protocols] are based on a forgery, the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' moans [ ] every week ... [which is] the best proof that they are authentic ... the important thing is that with positively terrifying certainty they reveal the nature and activity of the Jewish people and expose their inner contexts as well as their ultimate final aims.&lt;ref name = Hitler1924&gt;{{Citation | first = Adolf | last = Hitler | title = [[Mein Kampf]] | chapter = XI: Nation and Race | volume = I | pages = 307–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
	
The Protocols also became a part of the Nazi propaganda effort to justify persecution of the Jews. In ''[[The Holocaust]]: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933–1945'', [[Nora Levin]] states that "Hitler used the Protocols as a manual in his war to exterminate the Jews":
{{Quote | Despite conclusive proof that the ''Protocols'' were a gross forgery, they had sensational popularity and large sales in the 1920s and 1930s. They were translated into every language of Europe and sold widely in Arab lands, the US, and England. But it was in Germany after World War I that they had their greatest success. There they were used to explain all of the disasters that had befallen the country: the defeat in the war, the hunger, the destructive inflation.&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;Nora Levin, ''The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933–1945''. Quoting from [https://web.archive.org/web/20021001121141/http://ddickerson.igc.org/hitler-protokollen.html IGC.org]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitler endorsed the Protocols in his speeches from August 1921 on, and it was studied in German classrooms after the Nazis came to power. "Distillations of the text appeared in German classrooms, indoctrinated the Hitler Youth, and invaded the USSR along with German soldiers."&lt;ref name = "Segel"/&gt; Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels proclaimed: "The Zionist Protocols are as up-to-date today as they were the day they were first published."{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 95}}

In contrast to Hitler, Nazi leader [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewsky]] admitted:

{{Quote |I am the only living witness but I must say the truth. Contrary to the opinion of the National Socialists, that the Jews were a highly organized group, the appalling fact was that they had no organization whatsoever. The mass of the Jewish people were taken complete by surprise. They did not know at all what to do; they had no directives or slogans as to how they should act. This is the greatest lie of anti-Semitism because it gives the lie to that old slogan that the Jews are conspiring to dominate the world and that they are so highly organized. In reality, they had no organization of their own at all, not even an information service. If they had had some sort of organization, these people could have been saved by the millions, but instead, they were taken completely by surprise. Never before has a people gone as unsuspectingly to its disaster. Nothing was prepared. Absolutely nothing.&lt;ref name="Levin1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nora Levin|title=The holocaust: the destruction of European Jewry, 1933-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvFmAAAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=T.

[[Richard S.

====German language publications====
Having fled Ukraine in 1918–19, [[Piotr Shabelsky-Bork]] brought the Protocols to Ludwig Muller Von Hausen who then published them in German.{{Sfn | Kellogg | 2005 | pp = 63–65}} Under the pseudonym Gottfried Zur Beek he produced the first and "by far the most important"{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 94}} German translation. It appeared in January 1920 as a part of a larger antisemitic tract&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Geheimnisse der Weisen von Zion | publisher = Auf Vorposten | year = 1919 | language = German}}.&lt;/ref&gt; dated 1919. After ''The Times'' discussed the book respectfully in May 1920 it became a bestseller. "The [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern family]] helped defray the publication costs, and Kaiser [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Wilhelm II]] had portions of the book read out aloud to dinner guests".{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 95}} Alfred Rosenberg's 1923 edition&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alfred | last = Rosenberg | author-link = Alfred Rosenberg | title = Die Protokolle der Weisen von Zion und die jüdische Weltpolitik | place = Munich | publisher = Deutscher Volksverlag | year = 1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "gave a forgery a huge boost".{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 95}}

A new 1937 edition had a much higher impact, and three further editions in the following months sold 60,000 copies total.&lt;ref name="Pisanty2006"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2015}} The fifth edition had an introduction by [[Julius Evola]], which argued around the issue of forgery, stating: "The problem of the authenticity of this document is secondary and has to be replaced by the much more serious and essential problem of its truthfulness".&lt;ref name="Pisanty2006"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2015}}

===Modern era===

Governments or political leaders in most parts of the world have not referred to the ''Protocols'' since World War II. The exception to this is the Middle East, where a large number of [[Arab]] and Muslim regimes and leaders have endorsed them as authentic, including endorsements from Presidents [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[Anwar Sadat]] of [[Egypt]], the elder President Arif of [[Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;Katz, S. and Gilman, S.

{{Main|Ash-Shatat}}
''[[Ash-Shatat]]'' (Arabic: الشتات ''The Diaspora'') is a 29-part Syrian television series produced in 2003 by a private Syrian film company and was based in part on the ''Protocols.'' Syrian national television declined to air the program. ''Ash-Shatat'' was shown on Lebanon's Al-Manar, before being dropped.  The series was shown in Iran in 2004, and in Jordan during October 2005 on Al-Mamnou.

{{Nanjing Massacre}}
'''''The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II''''' is a [[Bestseller|bestselling]] 1997 [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Iris Chang]] about the 1937–1938 [[Nanking Massacre]], the massacre and atrocities committed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] after it captured [[Nanjing]], then capital of [[Republic of China|China]], during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. It describes the events leading up to the Nanking Massacre and the atrocities that were committed. The book presents the view that the [[Japanese government]] has not done enough to redress the atrocities. It is one of the first major English-language books to introduce the Nanking Massacre to [[Western world|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] readers alike, and has been translated into several languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischangmemorialfund.org/A_Brief_Biography_of_Iris_Chang.pdf|title=A Brief Biography of Iris Chang|publisher=Global Alliance for Preserving the History of WW II in Asia|accessdate=2007-07-27|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805185413/http://www.irischangmemorialfund.org/A_Brief_Biography_of_Iris_Chang.pdf|archivedate=2007-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received both acclaim and criticism by the public and by academics. It has been praised as a work that "shows more clearly than any previous account" the extent and brutality of the episode,&lt;ref name="KirbyForward"&gt;Forward by William C. Kirby, in: {{cite book|author=Iris Chang|title=The Rape of Nanking|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=0-465-06835-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while at the same time it was criticized as "seriously flawed" and "full of misinformation and harebrained explanations".&lt;ref name="Fogel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joshua A.

The book prompted [[AOL]] executive [[Ted Leonsis]] to fund and produce ''[[Nanking (2007 film)|Nanking]]'', a 2007 [[documentary film]] about the Nanking Massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/30/AR2006073000026.html|title=Ted Leonsis Takes a Sharp Turn|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2006-07-31|accessdate=2007-07-22 | first=Thomas | last=Heath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
When Iris Chang was a child, she was told by her parents, who had escaped with their families from [[China]] to [[Taiwan]] and then to the United States after [[World War II]], that during the [[Nanking Massacre]], the Japanese "sliced babies not just in half but in thirds and fourths." In the introduction of ''The Rape of Nanking,'' she wrote that throughout her childhood, the Nanking Massacre "remained buried in the back of [her] mind as a metaphor for unspeakable evil." When she searched the local public libraries in her school and found nothing, she wondered why no one had written a book about it.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking7-8"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iris Chang|title=The Rape of Nanking|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=0-465-06835-9|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of the Nanking Massacre entered Chang's life again almost two decades later when she learned of producers who had completed documentary films about it. One of the producers was Shao Tzuping, who helped produce ''Magee's Testament'', a film that contains footage of the Nanking Massacre itself, shot by the [[missionary]] [[John Magee (missionary)|John Magee]].&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~nanking/html/proposal.pdf|title=Proposal for The Nanking Conference at Princeton University|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=2007-07-23|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110100610/http://www.princeton.edu/~nanking/html/proposal.pdf|archivedate=2007-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other producer was Nancy Tong, who, together with Christine Choy, produced and co-directed ''In The Name of the Emperor'', a film containing a series of interviews with Chinese, American, and Japanese citizens.&lt;ref name="Princeton" /&gt;  Chang began talking to Shao and Tong, and soon she was connected to a network of activists who felt the need to document and publicize the Nanking Massacre.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking8-9"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking," pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1994, she attended a conference on the Nanking Massacre, held in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[California]], and what she saw and heard at the conference motivated her to write ''The Rape of Nanking.''&lt;ref name="Penguin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/rape_of_nanking.html|title=The Rape of Nanking|publisher=Penguin Group USA|accessdate=2007-07-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210146/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/rape_of_nanking.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As she wrote in the introduction to the book, while she was at the conference, she was "suddenly in a panic that this terrifying disrespect for death and dying, this reversion in human social evolution, would be reduced to a footnote of history, treated like a harmless glitch in a computer program that might or might not again cause a problem, unless someone forced the world to remember it."&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking10"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Chang spent two years on research for the book.&lt;ref name="SFGate2005-04-17" /&gt; She found source materials in the US, including diaries, films, and photographs of missionaries, journalists, and military officers who were in Nanjing at the time of the massacre.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking11"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, she traveled to Nanjing to interview survivors of the Nanking Massacre and to read Chinese accounts and confessions by Japanese army veterans.&lt;ref name="SFGate1998"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/07/26/SC77214.DTL|title=Wars of Memory|publisher=SFGate|date=1998-07-26|accessdate=2007-07-21 | first=Charles | last=Burress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang did not, however, conduct research in Japan, and this left her vulnerable to criticisms on how she portrayed modern Japan in the context of how it deals with its World War II past.&lt;ref name="SFGate1998" /&gt;

Chang's research led her to make what one ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' article called "significant discoveries" on the subject of the Nanking Massacre, in the forms of the diaries of two Westerners who were in Nanjing leading efforts to save lives during the Japanese invasion.&lt;ref name="SFGate2005-04-17" /&gt; One diary was that of John Rabe, a [[Germans|German]] [[Nazi Party]] member who was the leader of the Nanking Safety Zone, a [[demilitarized zone]] in Nanjing that Rabe and other Westerners set up to protect Chinese civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/NanjingMassacre/NMNR.html|title=Rabe's Records of "The Rape of Nanjing" Discovered|publisher=The Chinese University of Hong Kong|date=1996-09-26|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other diary belonged to Minnie Vautrin, the American missionary who saved the lives of about 10,000 women and children when she provided them with shelter in [[Ginling College]].&lt;ref name="Vautrin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~siupress/titles/s00_titles/hu_goddess.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070525134253/http://www.siu.edu/~siupress/titles/s00_titles/hu_goddess.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-05-25|title=American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking|publisher=Southern Illinois University|accessdate=2007-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The diaries documented the events of the Nanking Massacre from the perspectives of their writers, and provided detailed accounts of atrocities that they saw, as well as information surrounding the circumstances of the Nanking Safety Zone. Chang dubbed Rabe the "[[Oskar Schindler]] of Nanking" and Vautrin the "[[Anne Frank]] of Nanking".&lt;ref name="SFGate2005-04-17" /&gt;  Rabe's diary is over 800 pages, and contains one of the most detailed accounts of the Nanking Massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PrAoHzoP1QkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA121&amp;lpg=RA1-PA121&amp;dq=%22john+rabe%22+diary+%22detailed+accounts%22|author=Malcolm Trevor|title=Japan: Restless Competitor|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=1-903350-02-6|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated into English, it was published in 1998 by [[Random House]] as ''[[The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Rabe|title=The Good Man of Nanking: The Diaries of John Rabe|publisher=Random House|year=1998|isbn=0-375-40211-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vautrin's diary recounts her personal experience and feelings on the Nanking Massacre; in it, an entry reads, "There probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/223038.stm|title=Scarred by history: The Rape of Nanjing|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-04-11|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used as source material by Hua-ling Hu for a biography of Vautrin and her role during the Nanking Massacre, entitled ''[[American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/DH24Ad01.html|title=An American hero in Nanking|publisher=Asia Times|date=2002-08-24|accessdate=2007-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
''The Rape of Nanking'' is structured into three main parts. The first uses a technique that Chang called "the [[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon perspective]]" to narrate the events of the Nanking Massacre, from three different perspectives:  that of the Japanese military, the Chinese victims, and the Westerners who tried to help Chinese civilians.  The second part concerns the postwar reaction to the massacre, especially that of the American and European governments. The third part of the book examines the circumstances that, Chang believed, have kept knowledge of the massacre out of public consciousness decades after the war.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking14-15"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atrocities===
The book depicted in detail the killing, torture, and rape that occurred during the Nanking Massacre. Chang listed and described the kinds of torture that were visited upon the residents, including [[live burial]]s, [[mutilation]], "death by fire", "death by ice", and "death by dogs". Based on the testimony of a survivor of the massacre, Chang also described a killing contest amongst a group of Japanese soldiers to determine who could kill the fastest.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking83-88"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 83-88&lt;/ref&gt;  On the rape that occurred during the massacre, Chang wrote that "certainly it was one of the greatest mass rapes in world history." She estimated that the number of women raped ranged from 20,000 to as many as 80,000,&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking89"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', p. 89. Chang's sources listed as: Catherine Rosair, ''For One Veteran, Emperor Visit Should Be Atonement''; George Fitch, ''Nanking Outrages''; Li En-han, ''Questions of How Many Chinese Were Killed by the Japanese Army in the Great Nanking Massacre''&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that women from all classes were raped, including [[Buddhist nun]]s.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking90"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', p. 90.

Chang's sources listed as: Guo Qi, ''Shendu xueluilu'', Xijing Pingbao (August 1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death toll===
Chang wrote of the death toll estimates given by different sources; Chinese military specialist Liu Fang-chu proposed a figure of 430,000; officials at the [[Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall]] and the procurator of the District Court of Nanjing in 1946 stated at least 300,000 were killed; the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] (IMTFE) judges concluded that more than 260,000 people were killed; Japanese historian Fujiwara Akira approximated 200,000; John Rabe, who "never conducted a systematic count and left Nanking in February", estimated only 50,000 to 60,000; and Japanese author [[Ikuhiko Hata]] argued the number killed was between 38,000 and 42,000.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking100"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book discussed the research of historian Sun Zhaiwei of the Jiangsu Academy of Social Sciences. In his 1990 paper, ''The Nanking Massacre and the Nanking Population'', Sun estimated the total number of people killed at 377,400. Using Chinese burial records, he calculated that the number of dead exceeded the figure of 227,400. He then added estimates totaling 150,000 given by Japanese Imperial Army Major Ohta Hisao in a confessional report about the Japanese army's disposal efforts of dead bodies, arriving at the sum of 377,400 dead.&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking101"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang wrote that there is "compelling evidence" that the Japanese themselves, at the time, believed that the death toll may have been as high as 300,000. She cited a message that [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japan's foreign minister]] [[Kōki Hirota]] relayed to his contacts in [[Washington, DC]] in the first month of the massacre on January 17, 1938.  The message acknowledged that "not less than three hundred thousand Chinese civilians [were] slaughtered, many cases in cold blood."&lt;ref name="RapeOfNanking103-104"&gt;Chang, ''The Rape of Nanking'', pp. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acclaim==
''The Rape of Nanking'' sold more than half a million copies when it was first published in the U. S., and according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', received general critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischang.net/press_article.cfm?n=1|title=History's Shadow Foils Nanking Chronicle|publisher=The New York Times (article hosted by IrisChang.net)|date=1999-05-20|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iris Chang became an instant celebrity in the U.

The book received praise from news media. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that it was the "first comprehensive examination of the destruction of this Chinese imperial city", and that Chang "skillfully excavated from oblivion the terrible events that took place". ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' described the book as "a crushing indictment of the Japanese army's behavior". The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' called it "a powerful new work of history and moral inquiry" and stated that "Chang takes great care to establish an accurate accounting of the dimensions of the violence."  ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote that it was a "compelling account of a horrendous episode that, until recently, has been largely forgotten".&lt;ref name="MediaPraise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischang.net/press_article.cfm?n=14|title=Media Praise For The Rape of Nanking|publisher=IrisChang.net|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[William C. Kirby]], Professor of History at [[Harvard University]], Chang "shows more clearly than any previous account just what [the Japanese] did", and that she "draws connections between the slaughter in Europe and in Asia of millions of innocents during World War II".&lt;ref name="KirbyForward" /&gt; Ross Terrill, an associate in research at the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at [[Harvard University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/basic/author_detail.jsp?id=1000016300|title=Ross Terrill|publisher=Basic Books|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that the book is "scholarly, an exciting investigation and a work of passion".&lt;ref name="Quotes"&gt;Quotes on the Jacket and Interior of - {{cite book|author=Iris Chang|title=The Rape of Nanking|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|isbn=0-465-06835-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beatrice S.

==Criticism==
Joshua A. Fogel, at [[York University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinajapan.org/fogel|title=Joshua A. Fogel|publisher=Sino-Japanese Studies|accessdate=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the book is "seriously flawed" and "full of misinformation and harebrained explanations."&lt;ref name="Fogel" /&gt;  He suggested that the book "starts to fall apart" when Chang tries to explain why the massacre took place, as she repeatedly comments on "the Japanese psyche", which she sees as "the historical product of centuries of conditioning that all boil down to [[mass murder]]" even though in the introduction, she wrote that she would offer no "commentary on the Japanese character or the genetic makeup of a people who could commit such acts". Fogel asserted that part of the problem was Chang's "lack of training as a historian" and another part was "the book's dual aim as passionate polemic and dispassionate history".&lt;ref name="Fogel" /&gt; Fogel also writes: "Dozens of Japanese scholars are now actively engaged in research on every aspect of the war.... Indeed, we know many details of the Nanjing massacre, Japanese sexual exploitation of 'comfort women,' and biological and chemical warfare used in China because of the trailblazing research" of Japanese scholars.&lt;ref name="Fogel" /&gt;

[[David M. Kennedy (historian)|David M. Kennedy]], a Pulitzer Prize-winning professor of history at [[Stanford University]], also pointed out that while Chang noted that "this book is not intended as a commentary on the Japanese character," she then wrote about the "'Japanese identity'—a bloody business, in her estimation, replete with martial competitions, samurai ethics, and the fearsome warriors' code of [[bushido]]", making the inference that "'the path to Nanking' runs through the very marrow of Japanese culture." Kennedy also suggested that "accusation and outrage, rather than analysis and understanding, are this book's dominant motifs, and although outrage is a morally necessary response to Nanjing, it is an intellectually insufficient one."&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite magazine | author=David M. Kennedy | title=The Horror : Should the Japanese atrocities in Nanking be equated with the Nazi Holocaust? | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199804/nanking | magazine=[[The Atlantic Monthly]] | pages=110–116 | volume=281 | issue=4 |date=April 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy criticized Chang's accusation of "Western indifference" and "Japanese denial" of the massacre as "exaggerated", commenting that "the Western world in fact neither then nor later ignored the Rape of Nanking", "nor is Chang entirely correct that Japan has obstinately refused to acknowledge its wartime crimes, let alone express regret for them." Chang argues that Japan "remains to this day a renegade nation," having "managed to avoid the moral judgment of the civilized world that the Germans were made to accept for their actions in this nightmare time." However, according to Kennedy, this accusation has already become a cliché of Western criticism of Japan, most notably exemplified by [[Ian Buruma]]'s ''The Wages of Guilt'' (1994), whose general thesis might be summarized as "Germany remembers too much, Japan too little." Kennedy pointed out that a vocal Japanese left has long kept the memory of Nanking alive, noting the [[Resolution to renew the determination for peace on the basis of lessons learned from history|1995 resolution]] of Japan's [[House of Councillors]] that expressed "deep remorse" (''fukai hansei'') for the suffering that Japan inflicted on other peoples during World War II and clear [[List of war apology statements issued by Japan|apologies]] (''owabi'') for Imperial Japan's offenses against other nations from two Japanese Prime Ministers.&lt;ref name="Kennedy" /&gt;

Roger B. Jeans, professor of history at [[Washington and Lee University]], referred to Chang's book as "half-baked history", and criticized her lack of experience with the subject matter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In writing about this horrific event, Chang strives to portray it as an unexamined Asian holocaust. Unfortunately, she undermines her argument—she is not a trained historian—by neglecting the wealth of sources in English and Japanese on this event. This leads her into errors such as greatly inflating the population of Nanjing (Nanking) at that time and uncritically accepting the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and contemporary Chinese figures for the numbers of Chinese civilians and soldiers killed. What particularly struck me about her argument was her attempt to charge all Japanese with refusing to accept the fact of the 'Rape of Nanking' and her condemnation of the 'persistent Japanese refusal to come to terms with its past.'
&lt;ref name=Jeans&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jeans|first=Roger B.|date=January 2005|title=Victims or Victimizers?

Jeans continued what he calls "giving the lie to Iris Chang's generalizations about 'the Japanese'" by discussing the clashing interest groups within Japanese society over such things as museums, textbooks, and war memory.&lt;ref name=Jeans/&gt;

Robert Entenmann, professor of history at [[St. Olaf College]], criticized the work on the grounds that the "Japanese historical background Chang presents is clichéd, simplistic, stereotyped, and often inaccurate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/history/faculty/entenmann.html|title=Robert Entenmann|publisher=St. Olaf College|accessdate=2007-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705141913/http://www.stolaf.edu/depts/history/faculty/entenmann.html|archivedate=2007-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Chang's treatment of modern Japanese reaction to the massacre, he writes that Chang seemed "unable to differentiate between some members of the ultranationalist fringe and other Japanese", and that "her own ethnic [[prejudice]] implicitly pervades her book." Stating that Chang's description of the massacre is "open to criticism", Entenmann further commented that Chang "does not adequately explain why the massacre occurred".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/reviewswc3.htm|title=Book review of ''The Rape of Nanking''|publisher=University of the West of England|accessdate=2007-07-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211035132/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/reviewswc3.htm|archivedate=2008-12-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly further criticized Chang for her "lack of attention to detail".{{#tag:ref|As examples of this lack of attention to detail, Kelly cited a number of errors such as incorrectly referring to Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Perry]] as "Commander" and writing [[Itô Nobufumi]] ([[:ja:伊藤述史|伊藤述史]])'s name as "Ito Nobufumo", without a [[circumflex]] on the letter ''o''.  As an example of "sheer sloppiness", Kelly cited Chang's sentence, "Another rape victim was found with a golf stick rammed into her", and noted that "(while) golfers do colloquially refer to their clubs as 'sticks'", the terms "golf club" or "the shaft of a golf club" should have been used.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite journal|author=Timothy M.

Sonni Efron of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' warned that the bitter row over Iris Chang's book may leave Westerners with the "misimpression" that little has been written in Japan about the Nanjing Massacre, when in fact the [[National Diet Library]] holds at least 42 books about the Nanjing massacre and Japan's wartime misdeeds, 21 of which were written by liberals investigating Japan's wartime atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japanforum.hp.infoseek.co.jp/zheng/04/1122a.htm 我看张纯如《南京大屠杀》]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Efron noted that geriatric Japanese soldiers have published their memoirs and have been giving speeches and interviews in increasing numbers, recounting the atrocities they committed or witnessed. After years of government-enforced denial, Japanese middle school textbooks now carry accounts of the Nanjing massacre as accepted truth.&lt;ref name=once&gt;{{cite news | title=Once Again, Japan is at war over History | author=Sonni Efron | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=June 6, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Baoshan1937-Asahi-01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The original version of a photograph used by Chang—the accuracy of the caption in the book is disputed&lt;ref name="SFGate1998" /&gt;]]
''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' staff writer Charles Burress wrote that Chang's quote of a secret telegram sent by Japan's foreign minister in 1938 was incorrectly cited as "compelling evidence" that Japanese troops killed at least 300,000 Chinese civilians in Nanjing.&lt;ref name="SFGate1998" /&gt; According to Burress, the figure of 300,000 Chinese civilians killed actually came from a message sent by a British reporter, concerning deaths not only in Nanjing but in other places as well. Additionally, Burress questioned Chang's motivation for writing the book - whether she wrote it as an activist or as a historian, stating that the book "draws its emotional impetus" from her conviction to not let the Nanking Massacre be forgotten by the world.&lt;ref name="SFGate1998" /&gt;  Burress also cited [[Ikuhiko Hata]], a Japanese history professor at [[Nihon University]], who argued that 11 photos in the book were misrepresented or fake. One particular photo shows women and children walking across a bridge with Japanese soldiers, and captioned as "The Japanese rounded up thousands of women. Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution." Hata stated that the photo originally appeared in 1937 in a Japanese newspaper as part of a series of photos that showed peaceful scenes of Chinese villagers under Japanese occupation.&lt;ref name="SFGate1998" /&gt;

Chang responded to Charles Burress's criticism in a letter written to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', but the letter was not published by the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vikingphoenix.com/public/rongstad/news/bamr/changletter.htm|title=San Francisco Chronicle refused to publish Iris Chang's rebuttal|publisher=VikingPhoenix.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010305234642/http://www.vikingphoenix.com/public/rongstad/news/bamr/changletter.htm|archivedate=2001-03-05|date=1999-06-18|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the letter, she offered criticism of her own concerning Burress's article.&lt;ref name="ChangLetter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischang.net/press_article.cfm?n=9|title=Iris Chang's Letter to the San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=IrisChang.net|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chang found a "disturbing tendency" by Burress to quote right-wing Japanese critics "without demanding evidence to back up their allegations". She argued that Ikuhiko Hata, a source cited by Burress, was not "regarded as a serious scholar" in either Japan or in the U. S., because he was a regular contributor to "ultra right-wing" Japanese publications. One such publication had published an article from a [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] that argued that no [[gas chamber]]s were used in Germany to kill [[Jew]]s. This caused the parent publisher to shut down the publication. On Burress's criticism of her inaccurate photo captioning, Chang disputed the contention that the caption was wrong. She wrote that her book dealt with the "horror of the Japanese invasion of China", and that the caption reading "The Japanese rounded up thousands of women. Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution" contained two statements of indisputable fact.

Chang also issued a rejoinder to Burress's argument that she incorrectly cited a telegram sent by Japan's foreign minister. She wrote that while the original figure of 300,000 Chinese civilian deaths in Nanjing was reported by a British reporter, this figure was cited in a message that Japan's foreign minister sent to his contacts in [[Washington, DC]]. Chang argued that figure's use by a high-ranking Japanese government official was evidence that the Japanese government recognized 300,000 as the number of Chinese civilian deaths. Finally, she criticized Burress for his "nitpick" of small details in order to draw attention away from the scope and magnitude of the Nanking Massacre, writing that such was a "common tactic" of Holocaust deniers.&lt;ref name="ChangLetter" /&gt;

==Reaction in Japan==
''The Rape of Nanking'' has caused controversy in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070223a5.html|title=LDP-DPJ group plan to scrutinize 'Rape of Nanking'|publisher=The Japan Times|date=2007-02-23|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' staff writer, Sonni Efron, reported that Chang's flawed work was repeatedly cited by Japanese "ultranationalists" as evidence that any claim of massacre are baseless, and Japanese liberals, in turn "insist the massacre happened but allege that Chang's flawed scholarship damages their cause".&lt;ref name="CHGS"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://chgs.umn.edu/news/v3i1.html#nanjingmassacre|journal=CHGS Newsletter|publisher=University of Minnesota Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies|title=Nanjing Massacre Disputed Again!|year=2000|volume=3|issue=1|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Professor David Askew of
[[Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University]] stated that Chang's work dealt a "severe blow" to the "Great Massacre School" of thought, which advocates for the validity of the findings at the [[Tokyo Trials]], the tribunal convened to try the leaders of the [[Empire of Japan]] for crimes committed during World War II. Askew further argued that "the Great Massacre School has thus been forced into the (unusual) position of criticising a work that argues for a larger death toll."&lt;ref name="Askew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html|title=The Nanjing Incident|publisher=Electronic journal of contemporary Japanese studies|date=2002-04-04|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of ''The Rape of Nanking'', Japanese critic [[Masaaki Tanaka]] had his 1987 book on Nanking translated into English. Entitled ''What Really Happened in Nanking: The Refutation of a Common Myth'', Tanaka stated in his introduction "I am convinced that [American researchers] will arrive at the realization that violations of international law of the magnitude alleged by Iris Chang in ''The Rape of Nanking'' (more than 300,000 murders and 80,000 rapes) never took place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Critic disputes 'Rape of Nanking' in English translation of '87 work What Really Happened in Nanking--The Refutation of Common Myth |last=Anai|first=Ikuo|date=6 May 2001|publisher=''[[The Daily Yomiuri]]'' (Tokyo)|page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang's book was not published in a translated Japanese language edition until December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | script-title=ja:「ザ・レイプ・オブ・南京」の日本語版が出版 | url=http://j.people.com.cn/2007/12/17/jp20071217_81293.html | publisher=[[People's Daily]] | date=2007-12-17|accessdate=2007-12-18 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ザ・レイプ・オブ・南京—第二次世界大戦の忘れられたホロコースト. Translated by 巫召鴻. {{ISBN|4-88683-617-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with translation efforts surfaced immediately after a contract was signed for the Japanese publishing of the book. A Japanese literary agency informed Chang that several Japanese historians declined to review the translation, and that one professor backed out because of pressure placed on his family from "an unknown organization".&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes" /&gt;  According to Japan scholar Ivan P. Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanreview.net/interview_ivan_hall.htm|title=Ivan P.

They prevailed on Kashiwa Shobo, the contracted Japanese publisher of the book, to insist that Chang edit the book for "corrections" they wanted made, to delete photographs and alter maps, and to publish a rebuttal to Chang's book. Chang disagreed with the changes and, as a result, withdrew the Japanese publishing of the book.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op28.html|title=Japan and the U.S.: Sidelining the Heterodox|publisher=Japan Policy Research Institute|date=December 2002|accessdate=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rebuttal piece was nonetheless published as a book by [[Nobukatsu Fujioka]] and Shudo Higashinakano entitled ''A Study of 'The Rape of Nanking'''.&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Higashinakano" /&gt;

Shudo Higashinakano, a professor of intellectual history at [[Asia University (Japan)|Asia University of Japan]], argued in ''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'' that the book was "pure baloney", that there was "no witness of illegal executions or murders", and that "there existed no 'Rape of Nanking' as alleged by the Tokyo Trial."&lt;ref name="Higashinakano"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jiyuu-shikan.org/e/nanking4.html |title=California State Assembly Should Indict the Atomic Bomb Droppings on Japan |publisher=Association for Advancement of Unbiased View of History |date=1999-09-05 |accessdate=2007-07-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810191502/http://www.jiyuu-shikan.org/e/nanking4.html |archivedate=2007-08-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He identified 90 historical factual errors in the first 64 pages of the book, some of which were corrected in the 1998 [[Penguin Books]] edition.&lt;ref name="Mistakes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jiyuu-shikan.org/nanjing/errors.html |title=Thanks for correcting some mistakes |publisher=Association for Advancement of Unbiased View of History |accessdate=2007-07-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705013557/http://www.jiyuu-shikan.org/nanjing/errors.html |archivedate=2007-07-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chang's death===
After publishing the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese [[Nationalism#Ultranationalism|ultranationalists]],&lt;ref name="SFGate2005-04-17" /&gt; and threatening notes on her car and also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book "made Iris sad". Suffering from [[Clinical depression|depression]], Chang was diagnosed with [[brief reactive psychosis]] in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood.&lt;ref name="SFGate2005-04-17" /&gt; She wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined.
