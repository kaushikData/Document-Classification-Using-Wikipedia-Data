The '''Awami National Party''' ({{lang-ps|ملي عوامي ګوند}}, {{lang-ur|{{nastaliq|عوامی نيشنل پارٹی}}}}; [[Acronym]]: '''ANP''') is a [[secular]] and [[leftist]] [[Pashtun nationalism|Pashtun nationalist]] [[list of political parties in Pakistan|political party in Pakistan]]. The party was founded by [[Abdul Wali Khan]] in 1986 and its current president is [[Asfandyar Wali Khan]], grandson of [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan|Bacha Khan]], with Tajuddin Khan serving as the [[Secretary-General]]. Part of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]]-led [[Cabinet of Pakistan|cabinet]] of the [[Pakistani government]] during 2008−13, the ANP's political position is considered [[Left-wing politics|left wing]], advocating for [[secularism]], [[Socialism in Pakistan|democratic socialism]], [[public sector]] government, and [[economic egalitarianism]].&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2008/0505/p06s01-wosc.html|title=Pakistan's 'Gandhi' party takes on Taliban, Al Qaeda|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ANP was the largest [[Pashtun people|Pashtun nationalist]] party in Pakistan between 2008−2013 with influence lying in the Pashtun dominated areas in and around [[Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]]. They governed the province from 2008-2013 but lost to [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] in the general election of 2013.

==History==
[[Khan Abdul Wali Khan]]'s political career had been built on the tradition of intense Pashtun nationalism inherited from his father, [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] (Bacha Khan). Although it was formed after the partition of India but most of the leaders were Pro-India, and were against the creation of Pakistan. Most of the leaders were used to congress right hands before the independence. Both men were opposed to the creation of Pakistan, and after the proclamation of [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, they were imprisoned. In 1956 Wali Khan joined the [[National Awami Party]] (NAP), led by a charismatic Bengali socialist, [[Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani]]. In 1965 the NAP split into two factions, with Wali Khan becoming president of the pro-[[Moscow]] faction.&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/pa/pakistancountrys00bloo_0/pakistancountrys00bloo_0.pdf|title=Pakistan: A Country Study|publisher=Library of Congress (U.S.)|date=April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's members participated in [[Pakistani general election, 1970|1970 parliamentary elections]] through the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]]'s platform and the [[National Awami Party]], forming a largest socialist alliance with [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in 1970. However, the alliance fell apart and its members joined the [[Pakistan National Alliance]].

In 1972 the party was strong enough to form coalition provincial governments, with its partner the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]] (JUI) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. These governments were short lived. Wali Khan was again jailed, and his party was barred from politics when the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] upheld the finding of [[List of Presidents of Pakistan|President]] [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] that the NAP was conspiring against the state of Pakistan. General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] subsequently withdrew the charges against the NAP. Wali Khan was released, joined the National Democratic Party, and ultimately formed the Awami National Party. In the meantime, President Bhutto was imprisoned and executed in April 1979.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

===Formation and struggle for democracy===
{{Main|Democracy in Pakistan}}
The Awami National Party (awami means "people's"), which depends on ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] (Pukhtuns) of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] (formerly NWFP) and northern [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] as its political base, was formed in 1986 by the merger of several left-leaning parties including the Awami Tehrik and the [[National Democratic Party (Pakistan)|National Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

The [[National Democratic Party (Pakistan)|National Democratic Party]] merged with several other [[Progressivism|progressive]] political and nationalist groups to form the Awami National Party. Wali Khan, the influential Pashtun and Soviet-backed leader, was elected as its first president and [[Sindhi nationalist|Sindhi]] socialist [[Rasul Bux Palejo]] was appointed its first secretary general. From 1986 to 1988, the ANP party was a member of the [[Movement for Restoration of Democracy]].

===Alliance with Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)===
Since its inception, the ANP has been an important ally of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP). The party formed a coalition government with the PPP in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and in [[Sindh]] province and Islamabad for central government after the [[Pakistani general election, 1988|Pakistani parliamentary elections]] in 1988. This alliance, however, collapsed in April 1989 after differences cropped up between the two parties, after [[List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] ordered a [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992)|military action]] that brutally failed. The Awami National Party later formed an alliance with the [[Pakistan Muslim League]] (PML) in early June 1989 which led to a formal split in the party with many activists allying with the PPP.

After the election of [[Nawaz Sharif]] in 1990, the ANP again formed a coalition with former rivals PML. This alliance proved longer lasting, surviving till 1998 when it collapsed over differences over the building of [[Kalabagh Dam]] and renaming the province NWFP to Pakhtunkhwa. It won six seats in the National Assembly in the 1990 elections. In the 1993 national elections, the party won three seats in the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; It then joined the Grand Democratic Alliance, campaigning against the Sharif government's policies. After Nawaz Sharif's overthrow by [[Pervez Musharraf]], the party stayed an active member of the [[Alliance for Restoration of Democracy]], until the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, when it left the alliance over supporting [[NATO]]'s ouster of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban government]]. The party's reputation was damaged in this period following the arrest of former Federal Minister and senior party leader Azam Khan Hoti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asianstudies.github.io/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Dawn/2001/sep2901.html#govt|title=Govt-ANP deal seen behind Hoti's release|author=Waseem Ahmad Shah|date=23 September 2001|work=Dawn Wire Service|issue=07/39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2002 elections the party struck up an alliance with the PPP. However, both parties were electorally routed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the religion-political alliance [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal]] (MMA) riding on a wave of anti-American sentiment in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pakistan on the Brink: Politics, Economics, and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFNtVqYqAwEC&amp;pg=PA113|author=Craig Baxter|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2004|isbn=0-7391-0498-5|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Pakistani parliamentary election, 2008|2008 parliamentary elections]], the ANP dominated the far-right wing coalition, the MMA, a party formed by coalition of Islamic movements in 2002. The ANP has also won provincial seats in Balochistan and in Sindh for the first time in 15 years. It formed a coalition government with the [[Pakistan People's Party]] in all three provinces. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the ANP has its first chief minister since 1948.

The strongholds of the ANP are in the Pashtun dominated areas of Pakistan, particularly in the [[Mardan]] area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and it has traditionally dominated [[Charsadda]], Mardan, [[Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]], Peshawar, and [[Swabi]] areas of central KPK. On the other hand, the city of Karachi in Sindh province hosts one of the largest Pashtun populations in the world, but the ANP only had 2 seats in 2011, whereas the number of Pashtuns present would predict them having "up to 25 seats".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta2/tft/article.php?issue=20110715&amp;page=5|title=Demographic divide|author=Zia Ur Rehman|newspaper=The Friday Times|date=July 15–21, 2011|location=Karachi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent events===

In May 2008, [[Asfandyar Wali Khan]] made an unannounced visit to the [[United States]] in which he and his delegate held high-level meetings with top U.S. officials. A source explained that "the delegation is here as part of a visitors programme that brings important people from other nations for meeting US civil and military officials and members of the civic society." This was Wali Khan's second such visit to the United States, a country where he has several relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US silent on visit of Asfandyar|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/302108/us-silent-on-visit-of-asfandyar|newspaper=Dawn|date=10 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decade, hundreds of members of the ANP have been assassinated or became victims of target killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Shaheryar Popalzai|author2=Atika Rehman|author3=Gibran Ashraf|title=Karachi violence, over 100 dead|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/205202/karachi-violence-live-updates/|newspaper=The Tribune Express|date=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://herald.dawn.com/news/1152964|title=Troubled north-west comes to town|work=Herald - Dawn|author=Maqbool Ahmed|author2=Mansoor Khan|date=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/print/114871-ANP-PTI-lose-highest-number-of-MPs-to-terrorism|title=ANP, PTI lose highest number of MPs to terrorism|newspaper=The News International|date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the attacks occurred in the [[Karachi]] and [[Peshawar]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/489654/ambushed-police-anp-leader-come-under-attack/|title=Ambushed: Police, ANP leader come under attack|newspaper=The Express Tribune|date=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Nine-including-senior-minister-killed-in-Pakistan-suicide-blast/articleshow/17723681.cms|title=Nine, including senior minister, killed in Pakistan suicide blast|newspaper=Times Of India|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ANP rally in Quetta was subject to a bomb blast on 13 July 2012. The blast killed six people and injured 12 others. It was speculated that a cycle parked behind the stage was the probable cause. The dead included two children as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blast at ANP rally in Quetta: death toll rises to eight|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/734012/quetta-blast-kills-two|date=13 July 2012|newspaper=Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has also accused [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] chairman [[Imran Khan]] and of being complicit in the Taliban attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/633364-imran-khan-responsible-for-blasts-anp|title=Imran Khan responsible for blasts: ANP|newspaper=The News International|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2018, during the [[Pakistani general election, 2018]] there was a [[2018 Peshawar suicide bombing|suicide bombing attack]] on political rally of Awami National Party (ANP) in YakaToot neighborhood of [[Peshawar]] in which fourteen people were killed and sixty five injured. Among the killed was ANP's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly candidate, Haroon Bilour. Bilour was son of [[Bashir Ahmad Bilour]] who was also killed in a suicide bombing attack in December 2012. Elections for [[Constituency PK-78 (Bunair-II)|Constituency PK-78]] were postponed to an disclosed date by the Election Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geo.tv/amp/202742|title='Skip the meeting': Late ANP hopeful Haroon Bilour told son minutes before blast|author=|date=|website=www.geo.tv|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
[[File:Red flag II.svg|thumb|200px|The official flag of the party, which represents red color, inspired by the Red Shirt ([[Khudai Khidmatgar]]) non-violent movement of [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]]]]
The party espouses a nonviolent approach to tackling extremism.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt; It promotes [[democratic socialism]], [[secularism]], [[economic egalitarianism]], and [[Pashtun nationalism]]. The party has dense support among the Pashtun population in the country. Since 2000, its [[liberal socialism]] and pro-Pashtun philosophy has become the integral part of the party, advocating for the regional autonomy and increased Pashtun cultural expression. A frequent coalition partner in provincial politics, it was routed in the 2002 elections because of its opposition to the Taliban and support for the NATO-backed [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] in neighboring Afghanistan.

It joined the opposition All Parties Democratic Movement, and along with other parties except the Pakistan Peoples Party resigned from Parliament in October 2007 in protest against the military regime of Pervez Musharraf. It was targeted in 2007 and 2008 by presumed supporters of the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANP MNA hands over resignation|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/267881/anp-mna-hands-over-resignation|date=24 September 2007|newspaper=Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/29/AR2008022903675.html|title=Secularists Face Tests In Northwest Pakistan|date=1 March 2008|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the attacks, the party has advocated dialogue with moderate tribal elements to end the violence in the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]].

{{Original research|date=March 2011}}
'''Berava''' are a [[social group]] or [[Caste system in Sri Lanka|caste]] amongst the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. Like the [[Paraiyar]] of the neighboring [[Tamil people|Tamil]] ethnic group in Sri Lanka as well as [[Tamil Nadu]] state in [[South India]] they were segregated from the mainstream society yet played and still play an important and vital role in the religious rituals of the mainstream community.

==Origins==
As the mainstream Sinhalese speakers claim [[North Indian]] ethnic origins the presence of many South Indian type [[Jatis]] like the Beravas indicate a complex migration history from India to Sri Lanka. Beravas do not indicate any tribal origins like the other formerly untouchable caste of [[Rodiyas]]. They are part and parcel of the caste structure albeit with a primary function associated with Tom Tom or drum besting in all ritual occasions.  Yet they are also used as agricultural workers, weavers and domestic help throughout the country.

===South Indian roots===
Some [[anthropologists]] believe that the early society of Sri Lanka has looked to neighboring South India for manpower to fulfill functional needs as land was cleared and many new villages found. Berava are believed to be descended from [[Paraiyar]] like caste of South India who also play an important role in Tom Tom or Drum or Bera beating

===Colonial period===
The powerful [[Sri Lankan Mudaliyars|Mudaliyar]] class created by the British in the 19th century attempted to keep this caste and all other Sri Lankan castes out of colonial appointments. They also used all possible means to economically and socially marginalise and subjugate all other communities. The oppression by the Mudaliars and connected headmen extended to demanding subservience, service, appropriation of cultivation rights and even restrictions on the type of personal names that could be used by this community. Continuous oppression and prejudices created by the [[Siyam Nikaya|Buddhist monastic establishment]] has made it difficult for this community to progress.

==Etymology of Bera==
The [[etymology]] of the word Bera for Drum in Sinhalese is derived from after the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word ''Parai'' which originally meant ''speak'' came to denote a ''drumming'' caste. Thus this etymology indicates that Berava were a late addition to the Sinhalese Society.

==Sub divisions==
There are many subdivisions within the caste, some of which are ''Badgam Berava'' and ''Gahala Berava'' indicating drumming specializations. They denote Temple drummers who occupied and cultivated ''Bathgam'' (rice producing villages) as [[tenant farmers]] and [[Executioner]]'s drummers respectively. It may indicate diverse origins for this caste as for all castes in India.

==Role in folk religion==
Although great many Sinhalese purport to profess the conservative [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] there is a thriving belief in [[demons]], [[spirit]]s, [[Hindu]] [[deity|gods]] and connected rituals such as [[spirit possession]], [[Curse|cursing]] ceremonies throughout the country also referred as the Spirit Religion or Folk Tradition. Some of these are facilitated by [[shamans]], [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] and native priests and astrologers.  Berava perform the needed role as sorceress in some villages and also gain respectability by building cultic shrines to attract devotees from other castes.

One of the most famous Black-dominated urban neighbourhoods in Montreal is [[Little Burgundy]], regarded as the spiritual home of Canadian [[jazz]] due to its association with many of Canada's most influential early jazz musicians. In present-day Montreal, Little Burgundy and the boroughs of [[Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce]], [[LaSalle, Quebec|LaSalle]], [[Pierrefonds-Roxboro]], and [[Montréal-Nord]] have large Black populations, the latter of which has a large Haitian population.

==History==

[[File:Mathieu da costa.jpg|thumb|[[Mathieu de Costa]], the first recorded free black person to arrive in Canada.]]
The first recorded black person to set foot on land now known as Canada was a free man named [[Mathieu de Costa]]. Travelling with navigator [[Samuel de Champlain]], de Costa arrived in [[Nova Scotia]] some time between 1603 and 1608 as a translator for the French explorer [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts]]. The first known black person to live in what would become Canada was a slave from [[Madagascar]] named [[Olivier Le Jeune]], who may have been of partial [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] ancestry. As a group, black people arrived in Canada in several waves. The first of these came as free persons serving in the [[French Army]] and [[French Navy|Navy]], though some were enslaved or [[indentured servant]]s.

An enslaved woman, [[Marie-Joseph Angélique]] was tried and convicted of setting fire to her owner's home, burning much of what is now referred to as Old Montreal in 1734.

Many of Canada's [[Porter (railroad)|railway porters]] were recruited from the U.S., with many coming from [[Southern United States|the South]], New York City, and Washington, D.C.  They settled mainly in the major cities of [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Vancouver]], which had major rail connections. In Montreal, they settled primarily in the [[Little Burgundy]] neighbourhood. The railroads were considered to have good positions, with steady work and a chance to travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/llt/50/carson.html |title=Riding the Rails: Black Railroad Workers in Canada and the United States | work=Labour/Le Travail, 50 |author= Jenny Carson |publisher=The History Cooperative |date=2002-05-04 |accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat poverty and social exclusion, the nascent black community of [[Little Burgundy]] founded numerous social organizations: the Women's Coloured Club of Montreal in 1902, the [[Union United Church|Union United Congregational Church]] in 1907, and the [[Negro Community Center]] in 1927.&lt;ref name="mcgill"&gt;[http://www.arch.mcgill.ca/prof/mellin/arch671/winter2001/marcan/drm/html/littleburgundy.htm "Little Burgundy."] McGill University Faculty of Architecture. Accessed July 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighbourhood became famous for producing several talented [[jazz]] musicians. During [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] and the later pre-[[Jean Drapeau]] years as an 'open city,' Little Burgundy was home to many lively [[Montreal night life|nightclubs]] featuring homegrown and international performers; one of them was [[Rockhead's Paradise]], owned by [[Rufus Rockhead]], after whom a street is named. [[Oscar Peterson]] and [[Oliver Jones (pianist)|Oliver Jones]] are the two best-known musicians who emerged from the bebop and post-bop era.&lt;ref name="mcgill" /&gt;

In 1968 the [[Sir George Williams affair]] occurred as a result of racist policies at Sir George Williams University.

West Indian women, from both the Francophone and Anglophone Caribbean, came to Montreal after the [[Domestic Immigration Program of 1955]] was established.&lt;ref&gt;Dubinsky, Karen. ""We Adopted a Negro": Interractial Adoption and the Hybrid Baby in 1960s Canada" (Chapter 11). In: Rutherdale, Robert and Magda Fahrni.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=8uKz-8jB4WsC&amp;pg=PA279 279]. Retrieved on October 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Most settled in [[Little Burgundy]].

Canada maintained its restrictions of immigration until 1962, when racial rules were eliminated from the immigration laws. This coincided with the dissolution of the [[British Empire]] in the Caribbean.  Over the next decades, several hundred thousand Afro-Caribbeans came from that region, becoming the predominant black population in Canada. Since then, an increasing number of new immigrants from Africa have been coming to Canada; they have also immigrated to the United States and Europe. This includes large numbers of refugees, but also many skilled and professional workers pursuing better economic conditions. Today's Black Canadians are largely of Caribbean origin, with some of recent African origin, and smaller numbers from the United States, Europe and Latin America.

Montreal's [[Haiti]]an community of 100,000 people is the largest in Canada. Large percentages of Haitians live in [[Montréal-Nord]],
[[Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension|Saint-Michel]] and [[Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles|R.D.P.]] Today, [[Haitian Creole]] is the sixth most spoken language in Montreal and the seventh most spoken language in the province of [[Quebec]].

==Culture==
[[Carifiesta]] ({{lang-fr|Carifête}}) is an annual [[Caribbean Carnival]] held in Montreal. The festival incorporates the diversities that exist among the Canadians of African and Caribbean descent.

The [http://montrealblackfilm.com/ Montreal Black Film Festival] is held annually.

Black Canadians have had a major influence on [[Music of Canada|Canadian music]], helping pioneer many genres including [[Canadian hip hop]], [[Canadian blues]], [[Canadian jazz]], [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[Caribbean music in Canada|Caribbean music]], pop music and classical music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monique Desroches|author2=Marie-Thérèse Lefebvre |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/black-music-emc/  |title=Black Music |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest musical influences include [[Oliver Jones (pianist)|Oliver Jones]], [[Oscar Peterson]] and [[Charlie Biddle]].

Because the visibility of distinctively Black Canadian cultural output is still a relatively recent phenomenon, academic, critical and sociological analysis of Black Canadian literature, music, television and film tends to focus on the ways in which cultural creators are actively engaging the process of ''creating'' a cultural space for themselves which is distinct from both mainstream Canadian culture and African American culture.&lt;ref name=walcott&gt;[[Rinaldo Walcott]], ''Black Like Who?: Writing Black Canada''. 2003, [[Insomniac Press]]. {{ISBN|1-894663-40-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, most of the Black-themed television series which have been produced in Canada to date have been [[ensemble cast]] comedy or drama series centred around the creation and/or expansion of a Black-oriented cultural or community institution.&lt;ref name=walcott /&gt;

In the late 19th century a '''captain of industry''' was a business leader whose means of amassing a personal fortune contributed positively to the country in some way. This may have been through increased productivity, expansion of markets, providing more jobs, or acts of [[philanthropy]].&lt;ref&gt;Scranton, Philip. [http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24287 "Fine Line Between Thief and Entrepreneur"]. Teachinghistory.org. Retrieved 12 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation contrasts with that of the [[robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]], a business leader using political means to achieve personal ends.

==Versus "robber baron"==

Some 19th-century industrialists who were called "captains of industry" overlap with those called "[[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]]". These include people such as [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Andrew W. Mellon]], [[Henry Ford]], and [[John D. Rockefeller]]. The term was coined by [[Thomas Carlyle]] in his 1843 book, ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]''.

The education division of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] has prepared a lesson plan for schools asking whether "robber baron" or "captain of industry" is the better terminology. The lesson states that it attempts to help students "establish a distinction between robber barons and captains of industry. Students will uncover some of the less honorable deeds as well as the shrewd business moves and highly charitable acts of the great industrialists and financiers. It has been argued that only because such people were able to amass great amounts of capital could our country become the world's greatest industrial power. Some of the actions of these men, which could only happen in a period of economic [[laissez faire]], resulted in poor conditions for workers, but in the end, may also have enabled our present day standard of living."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/industrial-age-america-robber-barons-and-captains-industry#sect-preparation "The Industrial Age in America: Robber Barons and Captains of Industry" ''EDSITEment!

The Assembly of the '''Church of the Universe''', an [[entheogen]] [[religion]], was established by [[Walter Tucker (Church of the Universe)|Walter Tucker]] in 1969 in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]]. The Church uses [[spiritual use of cannabis|marijuana]] as a [[sacrament]] and promotes [[nudity]] as a demonstration of human honesty.

==Theology==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
The guiding rules of the church are variations on the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]]:
* Do not hurt yourself. 
* Do not hurt anyone else.

Although often quoting from the [[Bible]] and other scriptures, the church denies a direct connection to [[Christianity]]. It also accepts as valid sources of inspiration ancient and modern sources such as the culture of [[Sumer]], pagan holidays of the [[solstice]]s, [[Canada Day]], the [[Knights Templar]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Gnostic]] [[Gospel]]s and the [[Desiderata]].

Their sacrament is [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and followers are encouraged to smoke it and use hemp products. They draw on accounts in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and associate the [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|Tree of Life]] with the hemp plant, additionally quoting [[Psalm]] 22:30 and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 22:2,14.

Nudity also finds its origins in Genesis, since Adam and Eve were unclothed until they ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]] rather than the Tree of Life. However, members are enjoined to cover their heads on any official occasion or when interacting with government agents. Each person is encouraged to do so as God directs. Nudism is no longer practiced in many communities within the Church of the Universe.

Since all members joining the church are simultaneously considered to be [[ordinations|ordained]] as ministers, there is theoretically no distinction made between "clergy" and "ordinary members". However, founder Walter Tucker and leading member [[Michael Baldasaro]] have partially developed a system of structured religious titles derived from [[Order of Precedence (Catholic Church)|Catholic Christianity]], such as [[reverend]], [[archbishop]], [[bishop]] and [[abbot]].

==Activities==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}
Tucker founded the church at a water-filled former quarry in [[Puslinch, Ontario]] in [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington County]] between [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Guelph]] in 1969. After he leased the site for a nominal fee, he renamed it ''Clearwater Abbey''.

Clearwater Abbey's presence in the area was not without controversy, including allegations of noisy ceremonies on the property, the discovery nearby of human remains in 1975, the termination of its lease in 1982, and the final forcible removal of members from the property by police and sheriffs.  An attempt to relocate to a disused foundry, renamed ''Hempire Village'', in Guelph in 1994 met a similar fate.  The church is now located in north Hamilton.

The church's ritual use of cannabis and its occasional practice of nudism has attracted attention from both the media and police. Because of members regular possession and use of cannabis as a sacrament, legal charges of criminal possession and trafficking in marijuana laid against individual members are a common occurrence.

Frequent court challenges, based on charges or the exercise of political rights, have created an additional pair of intertwined activities: the Legal Self-Defence fund and the University of Universe.  Members who defend themselves or others in court are granted degrees from this non-accredited university, the level depending on the level of court involved.

In the past, both Baldasaro and Tucker have utilized [[perennial candidate|political candidacy]] for various public and party offices as a platform for espousing their religious beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

'''Classical Tibetan''' refers to the language of any text written in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic]] after the [[Old Tibetan]] period; though it extends from the 7th century until the modern day,&lt;ref&gt;Tournadre, Nicolas (2003). Manual of Standard Tibetan (MST). Ithaca, NY: Snow Lion Publications, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; it particularly refers to the language of early canonical texts translated from other languages, especially [[Sanskrit]]. The [[phonology]] implied by Classical Tibetan [[orthography]] is basically identical to the phonology of Old Tibetan, but the [[grammar]] varies greatly depending on period and geographic origin of the author. Such variation is an under-researched topic.

In 816, during the reign of King [[Sadnalegs]], literary Tibetan underwent a thorough reform aimed at standardizing the language and vocabulary of the translations being made from Indian texts, which resulted in what is now called Classical Tibetan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stephen | last = Hodge | title = An Introduction to Classical Tibetan | edition= "Revised" |year = 1993 | publisher =Aris &amp; Phillips| place = Warminster | isbn = 0856685488| pages = vii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nouns==

===Structure of the noun phrase===
Nominalizing suffixes &amp;mdash; ''pa'' or ''ba'' and ''ma'' &amp;mdash; are required by the [[noun]] or [[adjective]] that is to be singled out;
* ''po'' or ''bo'' ([[Grammatical gender|masculine]]) and ''mo'' ([[Grammatical gender|feminine]]) are used for distinction of gender.

The [[plural]] is denoted, when required, by adding the morpheme ''-rnams'', when the collective nature of the plurality is stressed the morpheme ''-dag'' is instead used. These two morphemes combine readily (e.g. ''rnams-dag'' 'a group with several members', and ''dag-rnams'' 'several groups').&lt;ref&gt;Hahn 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cases===
The classical written language has ten [[Grammatical case|case]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hill 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* absolutive (unmarked morphologically'')
* genitive (གི་ -''gi'',  གྱི་ -''gyi'', ཀྱི་ -''kyi'', འི་ -'''i'', ཡི་ -''yi'')
* agentive (གིས་ -''gis'', གྱིས་ -''gyis'', ཀྱིས་ -''kyis'', ས་ -''s'', ཡིས་ -''yis'')
* locative (ན་ -''na'')
* allative (ལ་ -''la'')
* terminative (རུ་ -''ru'', སུ་ -''su'', ཏུ་ -''tu'', དུ་ -''du'', ར་ -''r'')
* comitative (དང་ -''dang'')
* ablative (ནས་ -''nas'')
* elative (ལས་ -''las'')
* comparative (བས་ -''bas'')

Case morphology is affixed to entire noun phrases, not to individual words (i.e. ''Gruppenflexion'').

Traditional Tibetan grammarians do not distinguish case markers in this manner, but rather distribute these case morphemes (excluding ''-dang'' and ''-bas'') into the eight cases of [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]].

===Pronouns===
There are personal, demonstrative, interrogative and reflexive [[pronoun]]s, as well as an [[indefinite article]], which is plainly related to the numeral for "one."

====Personal pronouns====
As an example of the pronominal system of classical Tibetan, the ''Milarepa rnam thar'' exhibits the following personal pronouns.&lt;ref name=Hill2007&gt;Hill 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Person !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| First person || ང་  ''nga'' || ངེད་ ''nged''
|-
| First + Second ||  || རང་རེ་ ''rang-re''
|-
| Second person || ཁྱོད་ ''khyod'' || ཁྱེད་ ''khyed''
|-
| Third person || ཁོ་ ''kho'' || ཁོང་ ''khong''
|}

Like in French, the plural (vous / ཁྱེད་ ''khyed'') can be used a polite singular.&lt;ref name=Hill2007 /&gt;

==Verbs==
[[Verb]]s do not inflect for person or number. Morphologically there are up to four separate stem forms, which the Tibetan grammarians, influenced by Sanskrit grammatical terminology, call the "present" (''lta-da''), "past" ('''das-pa''), "future" (''ma-'ongs-pa''), and "imperative" (''skul-tshigs''), although the precise semantics of these stems is still controversial. The so-called future stem is not a true future, but conveys the sense of necessity or obligation.

The majority of Tibetan verbs fall into one of two categories, those that express implicitly or explicitly the involvement of an agent, marked in a sentence by the instrumental particle (''kyis'' etc) and those that express an action that does not involve an agent.  Tibetan grammarians refer to these categories as ''tha-dad-pa'' and ''tha-mi-dad-pa'' respectively. Although these two categories often seem to overlap with the English{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} grammatical concepts of transitive and intransitive, most modern writers on Tibetan grammar have adopted the terms "voluntary" and "involuntary", based on native Tibetan descriptions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;!--Involuntary is very different from intransitive, and which of these is the case should be clear from the texts, not from "native linguistics".--&gt; Most involuntary verbs lack an imperative stem.

===Inflection===
Many verbs exhibit stem ablaut among the four stem forms, thus ''a'' or ''e'' in the present tends to become ''o'' in the imperative ''byed'', ''byas'', ''bya'', ''byos'' ('to do'), an ''e'' in the present changes to ''a'' in the past and future (''len'', ''blangs'', ''blang'', ''longs'' 'to take'); in some verbs a present in ''i'' changes to ''u'' in the other stems ('''dzin'', ''bzung'', ''gzung'', ''zung'' 'to take').  Additionally, the stems of verbs are also distinguished by the addition of various prefixes and suffixes, thus ''sgrub'' (present), ''bsgrubs'' (past), ''bsgrub'' (future), ''sgrubs'' (imperative).  Though the final -''s'' suffix, when used, is quite regular for the past and imperative, the specific prefixes to be used with any given verb are less predictable; while there is a clear pattern of ''b''- for a past stem and ''g''- for a future stem, this usage is not consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Hill 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Meaning !! present !! past !! future !! imperative
|-
| do || བྱེད་ ''byed'' || བྱས་ ''byas'' || བྱ་ ''bya'' || བྱོས་ ''byos''
|-
| take || ལེན་ ''len'' || བླངས་ ''blangs'' || བླང་ ''blang'' || ལོངས་ ''longs''
|-
| take || འཛིན་ '''dzin'' || བཟུངས་ ''bzungs'' || གཟུང་ ''gzung'' || ཟུངས་ ''zungs''
|-
| accomplish || སྒྲུབ་ ''sgrub'' || བསྒྲུབས་ ''bsgrubs'' || བསྒྲུབ་ ''bsgrub'' || སྒྲུབས་ ''sgrubs''
|}

Only a limited number of verbs are capable of four changes; some cannot assume more than three, some two, and many only one. This relative deficiency is made up by the addition of auxiliaries or suffixes both in the classical language and in the modern dialects.

===Negation===
Verbs are negated by two prepositional particles: ''mi'' and ''ma''.  ''Mi'' is used with present and future stems. The particle ''ma'' is used with the past stem; prohibitions do not employ the imperative stem, rather the present stem is negated with ''ma''. There is also a negative stative verb ''med'' 'there is not, there does not exist', the counterpart to the stative verb ''yod'' 'there is, there exists'

===Honorifics===
As with nouns, Tibetan also has a complex system of honorific and polite verbal forms.  Thus, many verbs for everyday actions have a completely different form to express the superior status, whether actual or out of courtesy, of the agent of the action, thus ''lta'' 'see', hon. ''gzigs''; ''byed'' 'do', hon. ''mdzad''. Where a specific honorific verb stem does not exist, the same effect is brought about by compounding a standard verbal stem with an appropriate general honorific stem such as ''mdzad''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13140">A '''communication management unit''' is a type of self-contained group within a facility in the United States [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] that severely restricts, manages and monitors all outside communication (telephone, mail, visitation) of inmates in the unit.

==Origins==
As part of the Bush Administration's [[War on Terrorism]], the April 3, 2006, [[Federal Register]] included proposed rules by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] (FBOP) that "Limited Communication for Terrorist Inmates".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2006/04/03/E6-4766/limited-communication-for-terrorist-inmates"] Federal Register, April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
The changes were in response to criticism that the FBOP had not been adequately monitoring the communications of prisoners, permitting several terrorists convicted for the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] to send letters to other terrorists overseas. "By concentrating resources in this fashion, it will greatly enhance the agency's capabilities for language translation, content analysis and intelligence sharing", according to a government statement released with the rules.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;Eggen, Dan: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/24/AR2007022401231_pf.html "Facility Holding Terrorism Inmates Limits Communication"] Washington Post, February 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The public was given until June 2, 2006, to comment, as required by law. Civil liberty and human rights groups immediately questioned the constitutionality and stated that the provisions were so broad that they could be applied to non-terrorists, witnesses and detainees. The bureau appeared to abandon the program, but on December 11, 2006, a Communication Management Unit (CMU) was quietly implemented at Indiana's [[Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute]]. "From April to June 2010, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) opened up a period for public comment around the establishment of two Communications Management Units" with several civil rights groups and advocates "coming together to urge the federal Bureau of Prisons to close the experimental prison units."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccrjustice.org/cmu-comments "Stop Isolating Prisoners in Experimental Units"] The Center for Constitutional Rights, retrieved 2011 04 21&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear who authorized the program; it was either the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, FBOP Director Harley Lappin or [[United States Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]].&lt;ref name=RAW&gt;Ven Bergen, Jennifer: [http://www.rawstory.com/news/2007/Documents_show_new_secretive_new_US_0216.html "Documents show new secretive US prison program isolating Muslim, Middle Eastern prisoners"] The Raw Story, February 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication restrictions==
Compared to other inmates, those placed in the CMU have little contact with the outside world. At least $14 million is spent on surveillance of the CMUs. A counterterrorism team in West Virginia monitors verbal communication remotely.&lt;ref name="npr1"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2011/03/03/134168714/guantanamo-north-inside-u-s-secretive-prisons 'Guantanamo North': Inside Secretive U.S. Prisons], Carrie Johnson and Margot Williams, [[NPR]], 2011 Mar 3, via www.npr.org on 2011 03 04&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visitation===
The CMU permits two hours, twice per month, and no contact, meaning the visitor and inmate are in separate rooms with viewing through a glass window and talking via telephone. All conversations must be in English unless special permission is granted 10 days in advance. In addition to the already imposed restrictions, CMU "prisoners are banned from any physical contact with visiting friends and family, including babies, infants, and minor children."&lt;ref name="Aref, et al. v. Holder, et al. "&gt;[http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/aref-et-al-v-holder-et-al "Aref, et al. v. Holder, et al. "] The Center for Constitutional Rights, retrieved 2011 04 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mail===
Non-CMU prisoners can usually send and receive unlimited mail, where incoming mail is checked for contraband, then delivered to the inmate. With the exception of correspondence with lawyers and the courts, letters sent to and from the CMU are read, copied and evaluated before being released, which results in delays of a week or more.&lt;ref name=RAW /&gt;

===Telephone===
Convicts in the general population are permitted 300 phone minutes per month; rules in the CMU allow one call per week, limited to 15 minutes, and it must be in English unless special permission is granted 10 days in advance. The duration of the single call can be reduced to 3 minutes at the discretion of the warden.&lt;ref name=RAW /&gt;

==CMU 1, Terre Haute, Indiana==
On February 25, 2007, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported the creation of a medium security ''Communication Management Unit'' housing 213 inmates in Terre Haute. The staff monitors all telephone calls and mail, and requires that all inmate conversations occur in English unless special permission is arranged for conversations in other languages.
It was physically situated in the former death row section, and all but two of the inmates are [[Arab Muslims]], leading the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) to raise a concern about [[racial profiling]]. The ACLU also charged that the communication restrictions are unduly harsh for prisoners who are not sufficiently serious security threats to warrant placement in [[ADX Florence]], the [[Supermax]] facility in Colorado.&lt;ref name=WP /&gt;

Current inmates include "American Taliban" [[John Walker Lindh]],&lt;ref name="aplindhramadanplea"/&gt; the [[Lackawanna Six]], [[Rafil A. Dhafir]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} [[Enaam Arnaout]], and [[Kirksey Nix]].

==CMU 2, Marion, Illinois==
Although the [[Supermax]] facility is gone, the [[United States Penitentiary, Marion]], in 2008 became home to the other known "Communication Management Unit" in the federal prison system.&lt;ref name=HUFF&gt;McGowan, Daniel: [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-mcgowan/tales-from-inside-the-us_b_212632.html "Tales from Inside the U.S. Gitmo"] Huffington Post, June 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The inmates are predominantly Arab Muslims, but it once housed [[Daniel G. McGowan|Daniel McGowan]], after his involvement in two arsons at logging operations in Oregon. His sentence was given ''"terrorism enhancements"'' as authorized by the [[USA PATRIOT Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mortensen|first=Camilla|title=Terror Label: Feds seek to 'enhance' sentences for eco-saboteurs|url=http://eugeneweekly.com/2007/05/10/news2.html|accessdate=24 October 2010|newspaper=Eugene Weekly|date=2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News &amp; Updates: June 6, 2007|url=http://www.supportdaniel.org/news/|work=Support for Daniel McGowan|accessdate=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traits of CMU and its prisoners==

A 2011 story by [[NPR]] reported 50 units and 71 inmates at CMUs. It also described open cells, and a basketball court. A lawyer from [[ACLU]] has been inside the Terre Haute CMU.&lt;ref name=npr1/&gt; NPR also claimed to have identified dozens of inmates at the CMU and compiled a list on its website. The sorts of cases include:&lt;ref name="npr2"&gt;

*Cases involving material support of terrorist groups like [[Hamas]] or [[Hezbollah]] (and various charity frauds)
*Plots: [[2005 Los Angeles bomb plot]], [[Buffalo Six]], [[Portland Seven]], [[Liberty City Seven]], [[Shahawar Matin Siraj|2004 New York City Subway plot]], [[Toledo terror plot]], [[Virginia Jihad Network]], etc.
*Crime attempts from within jail, including threatening judges
*Various murder, bank robbery, and drug cases.

Ed Ross of the [[Bureau of Prisons]] said the units were designed for the following offenses:&lt;ref name=npr1/&gt;

*prisoners who tried to recruit or radicalize others
*prisoners who have abused their communications privileges by harassing victims, judges and prosecutors

The Terre Haute CMU restricts Muslim group prayer to once per week (once per day during Ramadan) according to a 2010 lawsuit filed by inmates Enaam Arnaout and John Walker Lindh. The suit alleges that the prison violates religious rights to pray five times per day, in a ritually clean place, "preferably in a group".&lt;ref name="aplindhramadanplea"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Charles|title=John Walker Lindh seeks Ind. prison prayer ruling|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2010/09/01/john_walker_lindh_prison_prayer|accessdate=23 October 2010|newspaper=Associated Press|date=1 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 30, 2010, the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of plaintiffs Yassin Muhiddin Aref, Avon Twitty, Daniel McGowan, Royal Jones, Kifah Jayyousi, Hedaya Jayyousi, and Jenny Synan "challenging policies and conditions at two experimental prison units that are being operated in Terre Haute, Indiana, and Marion, Illinois, as well as the circumstances under which they were established." &lt;ref name="Aref, et al. v. Holder, et al. "/&gt; As of 2011, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights estimates the Muslim population of CMUs at roughly 70 percent. They are also barred from praying together.&lt;ref name=npr1/&gt;

Conceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].

==Mechanism==

The mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.&lt;ref name ="lynott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Connell | first2 = L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of prosody on conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 1107–1123 | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01119.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===

Cognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. 
  
====Constraint Theory====

Constraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. ''Diagnosticity'' refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. ''Plausibility'' refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. ''Informativeness'' is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum.  If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. [[algorithms]] and [[heuristics]]).&lt;ref name = ck2000&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costello | first1 = F. J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = M. T. | year = 2000 | title = Efficient creativity: Constraint-guided conceptual combination | url = | journal = Cognitive Science | volume = 24 | issue = 2| pages = 299–349 | doi = 10.1016/S0364-0213(00)00020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spreading Activation====

The [[spreading activation]] model is a model in [[connectionism|connectionist]] theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, [[brainstorming]], and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.&lt;ref name="bd1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balota | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Duchek | first2 = J. M. | year = 1988 | title = Age-related differences in lexical access, spreading activation, and simple pronunciation | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 84–93 | doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.3.1.84 | pmid = 3268246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;

When one concept is employed in [[working memory]], the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as "priming.&lt;ref name=bd1988 /&gt;"

Spreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.

====Feature-Based Theories====

The features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features.&lt;ref name="spring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Springer | first1 = K. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = G. L. | year = 1992 | title = Feature availability in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 111–117 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might reason that the complex concept "white jacket," if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of "good for winter camouflage," despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts "white" nor "jacket." This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.

This model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial  spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

===Neurological===

The neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis.&lt;ref name = "bo2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Osherson | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence for conceptual combination in the left anterior temporal lobe | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1847–1852 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.01.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.&lt;ref name=bo2011 /&gt;

Of particular relevance is the left anterior [[temporal lobe]]. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.&lt;ref name = bo2011 /&gt;

Further support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. [[Semantic dementia]] is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahon | first1 = B. Z. | last2 = Caramazza | first2 = A. | year = 2009 | title = Concepts and categories: A cognitive neuropsychological perspective | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 27–51 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163532 | pmid=18767921 | pmc=2908258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==

As [[language]] is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory&lt;ref name=ck2000 /&gt; were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.

===Lexical Concepts===

A concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a ''lexical concept.'' A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.

Two lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of [[adjective]]s to modify [[noun]]s and the use of [[adverb]]s to modify [[verb]]s and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as "burnt toast," "eat roughly," and "readily loved." Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts.  Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as "sound wave," "video game," and "sleeping pill."&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, G. L. &amp; Myers, T. F. (1988). Concept combination and the characterization of lexical concepts. In W. Hüllen, &amp; R. Schulze (Eds.), (pp. 292-302) Niemeyer. {{DOI|10.1515/9783111355191.292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===

In addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are [[semantics|interpreted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynott | first1 = D. | last2 = Tagalakis | first2 = G. | last3 = Keane | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = Conceptual Combination with PUNC | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 353–374 | doi = 10.1007/s10462-004-5219-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these is ''dual-process theory.'' Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. ''Relational interpretation'' attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase "snake mouse" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. ''Property interpretation'' identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase "snake mouse" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.&lt;ref name= wiz1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wisniewski | first1 = E. J. | year = 1998 | title = Property instantiation in conceptual combination | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1330–1347 | doi = 10.3758/BF03201205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second principal theory is known as the ''Competition in Relations among Nominals'' theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, "chocolate cat" is usually interpreted as "a cat made of chocolate" rather than "a chocolate-eating cat" simply because the "made of" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with "chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;Gagne, C. L. (2002). The competition-among-relations-in-nominals theory of conceptual combination: Implications for stimulus class formation and class expansion. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 78 (3), 551-65. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/214835280&lt;/ref&gt;"

Explanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to [[spreading activation]] models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities.&lt;ref name="ews2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elvevåg | first1 = B. | last2 = Wisniewski | first2 = E. | last3 = Storms | first3 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Conceptual combination and language in schizophrenia | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 120 | issue = 1–3| pages = 238–239 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2010.04.006 | pmid=20452747 | pmc=2900465}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider the example, "John spread butter on a bagel." In this sentence, the lexical concepts "spread," "butter," and "bagel" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, "John baked a computer." Because "baked" and "computer" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.

However, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence "John saw an elephant cloud." "Elephant" and "cloud" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term "elephant cloud" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.&lt;ref name="ews2010"/&gt;

====Social Context====

Although many theories of  novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.

When lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed ''sense generation.'' This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The ''generation hypothesis'' accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.&lt;ref name="vlw"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Middleton | first1 = E. L. | last2 = Rawson | first2 = K. A. | last3 = Wisniewski | first3 = E. J. | year = 2011 | title = How do we process novel conceptual combinations in context? | url = | journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 807–822 | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2010.520414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[anaphor]] resolution hypothesis'' instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed ''anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

The ''dual-process hypothesis'' not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.&lt;ref name = vlw /&gt;

==Creativity==

[[Creativity]] necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to [[convergent thinking]], but not [[divergent thinking]]. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohn | first1 = N. W. | last2 = Paulus | first2 = P. B. | last3 = Korde | first3 = R. M. | year = 2011 | title = Conceptual combinations and subsequent creativity | url = | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1080/10400419.2011.595659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational applications==

The psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to [[problem solving|solve new problems]]. Máder &amp; Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school [[mathematics education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Máder | first1 = A. | last2 = Vajda | first2 = R. | year = 2010 | title = Elementary approaches to the teaching of the combinatorial problem of rectangular islands | url = | journal = International Journal of Computers for Mathematical Learning | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 267–281 | doi = 10.1007/s10758-010-9171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder rate ==

When Jamaica gained independence in 1962, the murder rate was 3.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the lowest in the world.&lt;ref name="focal.ca"&gt;http://www.focal.ca/en/publications/focalpoint/307-september-2010-don-robotham&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Jamaica had 1,674 murders for a murder rate of 58 per 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="un37820"&gt;{{cite web

There were 1,682 reported murders in 2009 and 1,428 in 2010. Since 2011 the murder rate has continued to fall following the downward trend started in 2010, with increases in police patrols, curfews, and more effective anti-gang activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime Minister Golding Speaks on Crime Reduction|url=http://go-jamaica.com/news/read_article.php?id=29278}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Ministry of National Security reported a 30 percent decrease in murders.&lt;ref&gt;Pachico, Elyssa (2012-3-30).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2203">'''Daniel "Chaka" Ramos''' (Born August 27, 1972 in the Boyle Heights district of Los Angeles, CA) was one of the most prolific graffiti writers in the late 20th century. ''CHAKA'' tags were widespread from California, San Diego on up to San Francisco.

Authorities in Los Angeles County, California Los Angeles County and surrounding areas throughout the West Coast described to CHAKA between ten and fifty thousand unique incidents of him "writing" the word "CHAKA" on various vertical surfaces of private and state property, primarily using spray paint, and incurring about a million dollars in monetary damage. His name was given to him by his friends who lived in the Aliso Village Projects in 1980 from the character of show: Land of the Lost, Chaka and Sleez...Chaka tagged  All City Wide Spread throughout the entire state of California. Chaka was eventually caught and tried and convicted in 1991 on these charges. He was sentenced to three years probation and 1,560 hours of community service to be spent cleaning graffiti. Daniel "CHAKA" Ramos was accused of tagging the interior of a civic-center elevator as he left a courtroom. He was arrested and charged again.&lt;ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com"&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/03/grafitti-artist.html "Chaka, long-lost L.A. tagger-artist, to have first legit art show"]  Mike Boehm, March 28, 2009, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;   
In the music video for the song, "[[Smells like Teen Spirit]]," by Nirvana, [[Dave Grohl]]'s  drum kit has "CHAKA" written on it in white lettering, supposedly in tribute to Ramos. In the Nirvana video "Smells like Teen Spirit" Dave Grohl, wrote Chaka on his drumset because he had seen "Chaka" written all over the place when he was driving down from Seattle to film the music video.

Ramos lives in [Los Angeles, California]. He had his first legitimate solo art show in April 2009 in the City of Los Angeles and continues to produce art.&lt;ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com" /&gt;

The '''Dansalan Declaration''' was published by [[Philippine Muslims]] on March 18, 1935 requesting not to be included in the Philippines and be granted separate independence by the United States. 

The declaration was prepared by [[Didato Amai Manabilang]] and one hundred twenty datus of Lanao, with 30 sultans who signed a strongly worded letter, popularly known as "Dansalan Declaration" to the U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[United States Congress|U.S. congress]] that in the U.S. grant of Philippine independence, Mindanao and its Muslim inhabitants should not be included and should remain under American rule to be granted separate independence at the right time. The Declaration stressed that Luzon and the Visayas are Christian-dominated  while Mindanao is predominantly  Muslims and therefore the two people with different religion and culture cannot peacefully co-exist with one another. 

The Dansalan Declaration was introduced by Congressman Robert Bacon (Democrat, Ohio) as an amendment to the Philippine Independence bill at the U.S Congress but was defeated by the lobby of pro-Philippine Independence leaders led by President [[Manuel L. Quezon]].

Many Muslim scholars believe that had the U.S. Congress adopted the Dansalan Declaration the secessionist wars for an independent Mindanao state waged by the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] and other extremist groups would have been prevented.  The secessionist wars which continued to this day have claimed the lives of more than 100,000 mostly Muslim lives and 10,000 soldiers and policemen.

While they are ancestrally and genealogically descended from groups that migrated from the [[Lesser Antilles]], mainly [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], many Garifuna today are of [[mixed ancestry]], primarily with [[West Africa]]n, [[Central Africa]]n, [[Island Carib|Island Carib, European]], and [[Arawak]] admixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Michael H|date=1981|title=The Black Caribs (Garifuna) of Livingston, Guatemala: Genetic Markers and Admixture Estimates|journal=Human Biology|volume=53.1|pages=87–103|hdl=1808/17973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Garifuna people live along the Caribbean Coast of Honduras, with smaller populations in Belize, Guatemala, Nicaragua. They arrived there after being exiled from the islands of the Lesser Antilles by British colonial administration as "[[Black Carib|Black Caribs]]" after a series of [[slave revolt]]s. Those Caribs deemed to have had less African admixture were not exiled and are still present in the Caribbean. There is now also a large number that have moved to the United States.

==History==
The Carib people migrated from the mainland to the islands circa 1200, according to carbon dating of artifacts. They largely displaced, exterminated and assimilated the [[Taíno]] who were resident on the islands at the time.&lt;ref name="Sweeney"&gt;[http://www.diaspora.uiuc.edu/news0307/news0307-7.pdf Sweeney, James L. (2007). "Caribs, Maroons, Jacobins, Brigands, and Sugar Barons: The Last Stand of the Black Caribs on St. Vincent"], ''African Diaspora Archaeology Network'', March 2007, retrieved 26 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The French missionary [[Raymond Breton]] arrived in the Lesser Antilles in 1635, and lived on [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Dominica]] until 1653. He took ethnographic and linguistic notes on the native peoples of these islands, including [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], which he visited briefly. According to oral history noted by the English governor [[Sir William Young, 2nd Baronet|William Young]] in 1795, Carib-speaking people of the [[Orinoco River]] area on the mainland came to [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] long before the arrival of Europeans to the New World. They subdued the local inhabitants called Galibeis, and unions took place between the peoples.

According to Young's record, the first Africans arrived in 1675 following the wreck of a slave ship from the Bight of [[Biafra]]. The survivors, members of the Mokko people of today's Nigeria (now known as [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]]) and the British sailors, reached the small island of [[Bequia]]. The Carib took them to [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] and intermarried with them, supplying the  men with wives, as it was taboo in their society for men to go unwed.

In 1635 the Carib were overwhelmed by French forces led by the adventurer [[Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc]] and his nephew [[Jacques Dyel du Parquet]]. They imposed [[French colonial empires|French colonial rule]] on the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] Carib peoples. [[Cardinal Richelieu]] of France gave the island to the [[Compagnie de Saint-Christophe|Saint Christophe Company]], in which he was a shareholder. Later the company was reorganized as the [[Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique|Company of the American Islands]]. The French colonists imposed [[French Law]] on the inhabitants, and [[Jesuit]] [[missionaries]] arrived to [[religious conversion|convert]] them to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinique.pref.gouv.fr/pages/histoireinstitang.html "Institutional History of Martinique"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325234539/http://www.martinique.pref.gouv.fr/pages/histoireinstitang.html |date=25 March 2010 }}, Martinique Official site, French Government (translation by Maryanne Dassonville). Retrieved 26 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Carib people resisted working as laborers to build and maintain the sugar and [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] plantations which the French began to develop in the Caribbean, in 1636 King [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] proclaimed ''[[La Traité des Noirs]]''. This authorized the capture and purchase of [[slavery|slaves]] from sub-Saharan Africa and their transportation as labor to Martinique and other parts of the [[French West Indies]].&lt;ref name="Sweeney"/&gt;

In 1650, the Company liquidated, selling Martinique to Jacques Dyel du Parquet, who became governor. He held this position until his death in 1658. His widow Mme. du Parquet took over control of the island from France. As more French colonists arrived, they were attracted to the fertile area known as ''Cabesterre'' (leeward side). The French had pushed the remaining Carib people to this northeastern coast and the Caravalle Peninsula, but the colonists wanted the additional land. The [[Jesuits]] and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] agreed that whichever order arrived there first, would get all future parishes in that part of the island. The Jesuits came by sea and the Dominicans by land, with the Dominicans' ultimately prevailing.

When the Carib revolted against French rule in 1660, the Governor [[Charles Houël du Petit Pré|Charles Houel sieur de Petit Pré]] retaliated with war against them. Many were killed; those who survived were taken captive and expelled from the island. On Martinique, the French colonists signed a peace treaty with the few remaining Carib. Some Carib had fled to [[Dominica]] and [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], where the French agreed to leave them at peace.

[[File:SaintVincent Carib Treaty Negotiation 1773.jpg|thumb|180px|Depiction of the 1773 treaty negotiations between the British and the [[Black Carib]]s]]
Britain and France both made conflicting claims on [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] from the late seventeenth century onward.  French pioneers began informally cultivating plots on the island around 1710. In 1719 the governor of [[Martinique]] sent a force to occupy it, but was repulsed by the Carib inhabitants.  A British attempt in 1723 was also repelled.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''Black Charaibs,'' pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1748, Britain and France agreed to put aside their claims and declared [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] to be a neutral island, under no European sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''Black Charaibs'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, however, unofficial, mostly French settlement took place on the island, especially on the Leeward side. African refugees continued to reach [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], and a mixed-race population developed through unions with the Carib.&lt;ref name="Sweeney"/&gt;

In 1763 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], Britain gained rule over [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] following its defeat of France in the [[Seven Years' War]], fought in both Europe and North America. It also took over all French territory in North America east of the Mississippi River. Through the rest of the century, the Carib-African natives mounted a series of Carib Wars, which were encouraged and supported by the French. By the end of the 18th century, the indigenous population was primarily mixed race. Following the death of their leader ''Satuye'' ([[Joseph Chatoyer]]), the Carib on [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] finally surrendered to the British in 1796 after the [[Second Carib War]], having resisted for much longer than natives on other islands. "St. Vincent was the last of the Windward Islands to be totally subjugated."&lt;ref name="Sweeney"/&gt;

This was also in the period of the violent slave revolts in the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]], which ultimately led to the slaves gaining the independent republic of [[Haiti]] in 1804. The French lost thousands of troops in an attempt to take back the island in 1803, many to [[yellow fever]] epidemics. Thousands of whites and [[free people of color]] were killed in the revolution. Europeans throughout the Caribbean and in the [[American South]] feared future slave revolts.

The British deported the Garifuna to [[Roatán]], an island off the coast of [[Honduras]]. Based in part on their experience with slavery in other parts of the Caribbean and North America, the British separated the more African-looking Caribs from the more Amerindian-looking ones. They decided that the former had to be exiled, while the latter were "misled" and allowed to remain. Five thousand Garinagu were exiled but, weakened by captivity, only about half of them (2,500) survived the voyage to Roatán.  Because the island was too small and infertile to support their population, the Garifuna petitioned Spanish authorities to be allowed to settle on the mainland in the Spanish colonies. The Spanish employed them, and they spread along the Caribbean coast of the Central American colonies.

Large-scale sugar production and chattel slavery were not established on [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] until the British took it over. As Great Britain abolished slavery in 1832, it operated it for roughly a generation on the island, creating a legacy different than on other Caribbean islands.&lt;ref name="Sweeney"/&gt;  Elsewhere slavery had been institutionalized for much longer.

In the 21st century, the Garifuna population is estimated to be around 600,000 in total, taking together its people in Central America, Yurumein ([[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]), and the United States.  As a result of extensive emigration from Central America, the United States has the second-largest population of Garifuna outside Central America.  New York has the largest population, dominated by Garifuna from [[Honduras]], Guatemala and Belize.  Los Angeles ranks second with Honduran Garifuna being the most populous, followed by those from Belize and Guatemala.  There is no information regarding Garifuna from Nicaragua having migrated to either coast of the United States. The Nicaraguan Garifuna population is quite small. Community leaders are attempting to resurrect the Garifuna language and cultural traditions.

By 2014 more Garifuna were leaving Honduras and "illegally" immigrating to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Garsd, Jasmine.

===Three Diasporas: African, Garifuna, and Central American===
The distinction between diaspora and transnational migration is that diaspora implies the dispersal of a people from a homeland, whether voluntarily or through exile, to multiple nation-states. Transnational migration is generally associated with two locations. In addition, in contrast to the more intense contact which contemporary transmigrants have with their country of origin, diasporic populations often have a more tenuous relationship to the "homeland" or society of origin. Historically there was little hope of return; the relationship is more remote, or even imagined.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Mark. "Black Indigenism: The Making of Ethnic Politics and State Multiculturalism", ''Black and Indigenous: Garifuna Activism and Consumer Culture in Honduras''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2009: 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the African diaspora was that of people being taken captive and sold into slavery, and delivered to various parts of the New World. In those early centuries, return was impossible. Slaves from West African peoples formed relationships with the Carib and a new people developed.

The Garifuna people developed through a process of [[ethnogenesis]] on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent, and were exiled in the colonial period to the Caribbean coasts of Central America. Since the late 20th century, many have emigrated from what are now Honduras, Belize and Guatemala to the United States. For the Garífuna, the politics of diaspora are complex because they have several different homelands and different relationships to them: from the mainly symbolic relationship to Africa and St. Vincent, to the closer relationship to various national homelands of Central America. The specific form of identification by individuals with each homeland has different political implications. Garifuna identity in diaspora is complex, involving local, national, and transnational processes, as well as global ethnic politics.

==Language==
{{main|Garifuna language}}
The [[Garifuna language]] is an offshoot of the [[Island Carib language]], and it is spoken in [[Honduras]], [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Nicaragua]] by the Garifuna people. It is an [[Arawakan language]] with French, English, and Spanish influences, reflecting their long interaction with various colonial peoples. Garifuna has a vocabulary featuring some terms used by women and others used primarily by men. This may derive from historical Carib practices: in the colonial era, the Carib of both sexes spoke Island Carib. Men additionally used a distinct [[pidgin]] based on the unrelated mainland [[Carib language]].

Although many people speak it, it is not treated as a real language by some as it has no official written component to it, it is only spoken. This makes the language hard to learn unless it is learned in early childhood, along with other languages simultaneously. This occurs most often as children learn the Garifuna as a cultural language and a language such as Spanish or English spoken as the official language of where they live.

Almost all Garifuna are [[bilingual]] or [[multilingual]]. They generally speak the official languages of the countries they inhabit, such as Spanish and English, most commonly as a [[first language]]. Many also speak Garifuna, mostly as a cultural language, as a part of their families heritage.

==Spirituality==
The Garinagu do not have an official religion, but a complex set of practices for individuals and groups to show respect for their ancestors and Bungiu [God] or Sunti Gabafu [All Powerful]. A [[shaman]] known as a ''buyei'' is the head of all Garifuna traditional practices. The spiritual practices of the Garinagu have qualities similar to the voodoo rituals performed by other tribes of African descent. [[Mystical]] practices and participation such as in the [[Dugu ceremony]] and chugu are also widespread among Garifuna. At times, traditional religions have prohibited members of their congregation from participating in these or other rituals.

Today, the majority of Garifuna are officially [[Catholic]] but some following other religions. They practice a syncretic Catholicism, incorporating traditional beliefs.

There is also a [[Rastafarian Movement|Rastafarian]] minority, primarily living in [[Dangriga]], [[Belize City]], Belize, and in [[Livingston, Guatemala]].

==Culture==
[[File:Garifuna SanIsidro 1996-05 2.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Garifuna parade on San Isidro Day, in Livingston (Guatemala).]]
In 2001 [[UNESCO]] proclaimed the language, dance, and music of the Garifuna as a [[Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] in Nicaragua, Honduras, and Belize. In 2005 the First Garifuna Summit was held in [[Corn Islands]], Nicaragua, with the participation of the government of other Central American countries.&lt;ref&gt;Sletto, Jacqueline W.

===Food===
There is a wide variety of Garifuna dishes, including the more commonly known ''ereba'' ([[cassava bread]]) made from grated cassava root, yucca. The process of making "ereba" is arguably the most important tradition practiced by the Garifuna people.  Cassava is so closely tied to the Garifuna culture that the very name Garifuna draws its origin from the Caribs who were originally called  "Karifuna" of the cassava clan.  They later adopted the name "Garifuna", which literally means cassava-eating people. Making "ereba" is a long and arduous process that involves a large group of Garifuna (mostly women and children) hiking into the jungle to dig up a large quantity of the cassava root (usually several dozen pounds) and taking it back to the village.  The root is then washed peeled and grated over small sharp stones affixed to wooden boards.  The grating is difficult and time consuming, and the women sing sad and slow songs to break the monotony of the work.  The grated cassava is then placed into a large cylindrical woven bag called a "ruguma". The "ruguma" is hung from a tree and weighted at the bottom with heavy rocks in order to squeeze out and remove the poisonous liquid and starch from the grated pulp.  The counterweight is sometimes provided by piercing the bottom of the "ruguma" with a tree branch and having one or two Garifuna women sit on the branch. Whatever the manner in which the weight is provided, the result is the same.  The cassava is then ready to be made into flour.  The remaining pulp is dried overnight and later sieved through flat rounded baskets (''hibise'') to form flour that is baked into pancakes on a large iron griddle (''Comal''). ''Ereba'' is eaten with fish, ''machuca'' (pounded [[Plantain (boiled to soften)|green and ripe plantain]]s) or alone with gravy (''lasusu'') often made with a fish soup called "hudutu". Other accompanying dishes may include: ''bundiga'' (a green banana [[lasusu]]), ''[[mazapan]]'', and ''bimecacule'' (sticky sweet rice), as well as a coconut rice made with red beans.  Nigerians also make "eba", "gari" and "fufu" from dried, grated cassava flour and similar accompanying dishes such as "ewuro" or egusi" (made with melon seeds) soup. An alcoholic drink called ''[[gifiti]]'' is commonly made at home; it is rum-based [[bitters]], made by soaking roots and herbs.

===Music===
{{main|Garifuna music}}
[[File:Garifuna dancers in Dangriga, Belize.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Traditional Garifuna dancers in [[Dangriga]], Belize]]
Garifuna music is quite different from that of the rest of Central America. The most famous form is [[punta]].  In its associated dance style, dancers move their hips in a circular motion. An evolved form of traditional music, still usually played using traditional instruments, punta has seen some modernization and electrification in the 1970s; this is called [[punta rock]].  Traditional punta dancing is consciously competitive.  Artists like [[Pen Cayetano]] helped innovate modern punta rock by adding guitars to the traditional music, and paved the way for later artists like [[Andy Palacio]], Children of the Most High, and [[Black Coral]].  Punta was popular across the region, especially in Belize, by the mid-1980s, culminating in the release of ''[[Punta Rockers]]'' in 1987, a compilation featuring many of the genre's biggest stars. Punta musicians in Central America, the US, and elsewhere made further advances with the introduction of the piano, woodwind, brass and string instruments. Punta-rock has grown since the early 1980s to include other electronic instruments such as the synthesizer and electric bass guitar as well as other percussive instruments.

Punta along with Reggaeton music are predominantly popular and influential among the entire population in Honduras. Often mixed with Spanish, Punta has a widespread audience due to the immigration of Hondurans and Guatemalan to the United States, other parts of Latin America and Europe, notably Spain. Punta bands in Honduras such as Kazzabe, Shabakan, Silver Star, Los Rolands, Banda Blanca, Los Gatos Bravos and Grupo Zambat have appeal for Latin American migrant communities. Honduran Punta has caused Belizean and Guatemalan Punta to use more Spanish due to the commercial success achieved by bands that use it.

When Banda Blanca of Honduras sold over 3 million copies of "Sopa De Caracol" ("Conch Soup"), originally written by Belizean Chico Ramos, the Garifunas of Belize felt cheated but celebrated the success. The genre is continuing to develop a strong following in the United States and South America and the Caribbean.[14]

Belizean punta is distinctive from traditional punta in that songs are usually in Kriol or Garifuna and rarely in Spanish or English. calypso and soca have had some effect on it. Like calypso and soca, Belizean punta provides social commentary and risqué humor, though the initial wave of punta acts eschewed the former. Calypso Rose, Lord Rhaburn and the Cross Culture Band assisted the acceptance of punta by Belizean Kriol people by singing calypso songs about punta - songs such as "Gumagrugu Watah" and "Punta Rock Eena Babylon".[14]

Prominent broadcasters of Punta music include WAVE Radio and Krem Radio.

Other forms of Garifuna music and dance include: hungu-hungu, combination, wanaragua, abaimahani, matamuerte, laremuna wadaguman, gunjai, sambai, charikanari, eremuna egi, paranda, berusu, teremuna ligilisi, arumahani, and Mali-amalihani.  However, punta is the most popular dance in Garifuna culture.  It is performed around holidays and at parties and other social events.  Punta lyrics are usually composed by the women.  [[Chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]] involve circular dancing to a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta.  There are other types of songs typical of each gender: women having [[eremwu eu]] and [[abaimajani]], rhythmic [[a cappella]] songs, and [[laremuna wadaguman]]; and men having [[work song]]s, [[chumba]], and [[hunguhungu]].

Drums play a very important role in Garifuna music.  Primarily two types of drums are used: the ''primero'' (tenor drum) and the ''segunda'' (bass drum). These drums are typically made of hollowed-out hardwood, such as mahogany or mayflower, with the skins coming from the peccary (wild bush pig), deer, or sheep.

Also used in combination with the drums are the ''sisera'', which are shakers made from the dried fruit of the gourd tree, filled with seeds, and then fitted with hardwood handles.

Paranda music developed soon after the Garifunas' arrival in Central America.  The music is instrumental and percussion-based.  The music was barely recorded until the 1990s, when [[Ivan Duran]] of [[Stonetree Records]] began the [[Paranda Project]].
  
In contemporary Belize there has been a resurgence of Garifuna music, popularized by musicians such as Andy Palacio, Mohobub Flores, and Aurelio Martinez.  These musicians have taken many aspects from traditional Garifuna music forms and fused them with more modern sounds.  Described as a mixture of punta rock and paranda, this music is exemplified in Andy Palacio's album ''Watina,'' and in ''[[Umalali|Umalali: The Garifuna Women's Project]]'', both of which were released on the Belizean record label, Stonetree Records. Canadian musician [[Danny Michel]] has also recorded an album, ''Black Birds Are Dancing Over Me'', with a collective of Garifuna musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2013/07/15/202385726/next-danny-michel-and-the-garifuna-collective "World Cafe Next: Danny Michel And The Garifuna Collective"]. [[NPR]], 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Garifuna culture there is another dance called "dugu", which is included as part of a ritual done following a death in the family so as to pay respect to the departed loved one.

Through traditional dance and music, musicians have come together to raise awareness of [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name=PulitzerCenter-HIV-Garifuna&gt;{{cite news|title=The Forgotten: HIV and the Garifuna of Honduras|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/honduras-garifuna-people-culture-health-developing-world-AIDS-HIV|accessdate=19 October 2015|work=[[Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender relations==
Gender roles within the Garifuna communities are significantly defined by the job opportunities available to everyone. The Garifuna people have relied on farming for a steady income in the past, but much of this land was taken by fruit companies in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Women and Religion in the African Diaspora: Knowledge, Power, and Performance'', page 51, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These companies were welcomed at first because the production helped bring an income to the local communities, but as business declined these large companies sold the land and it has become inhabited by mestizo farmers.&lt;ref&gt;''Neither Enemies Nor Friends: Latinos, Blacks, Afro-Latinos'', page 105, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since this time the Garifuna people have been forced to travel and find jobs with foreign companies. The Garifuna people mainly rely on export businesses for steady jobs; however, women are highly discriminated against and are usually unable to get these jobs.&lt;ref&gt;''Sex Roles and Social Change in Native Lower Central American Societies'', page 24, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Men generally work for foreign-owned companies collecting timber and chicle to be exported, or work as fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;''Sex Roles and Social Change in Native Lower Central American Societies'', page 25, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garifuna people live in a [[matrilocal residence|matrilocal]] society, but the women are forced to rely on men for a steady income in order to support their families, because the few jobs that are available, housework and selling homemade goods, do not create enough of an income to survive on.&lt;ref name="Chernela, Janet M. 1991"&gt;Chernela, Janet M. ''Symbolic Inaction in Rituals of Gender and Procreation among the Garifuna (Black Caribs) of Honduras'' ''Ethos'' 19.1 (1991): 52–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Although women have power within their homes, they rely heavily on the income of their husbands.

Although men can be away at work for large amounts of time they still believe that there is a strong connection between men and their newborn sons.  Garifunas believe that a baby boy and his father have a special bond, and they are attached spiritually.&lt;ref name="Chernela, Janet M. 1991"/&gt; It is important for a son's father to take care of him, which means that he must give up some of his duties in order to spend time with his child.&lt;ref name="Chernela, Janet M. 1991"/&gt; During this time women gain more responsibility and authority within the household.

==Genetics==
According to one genetic study the ancestry of the Garifuna people on average, is 76% African, 20% Arawak/Carib and 4% European,&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, M.H. 1997 [http://www2.ku.edu/~lba/courses/articles/Crawford%20Carib.pdf Biocultural adaptation to disease in the Caribbean: Case study of a migrant population] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105001105/http://www2.ku.edu/~lba/courses/articles/Crawford%20Carib.pdf |date=5 November 2012 }}. Journal of Caribbean Studies. Health and Disease in the Caribbean. 12(1): 141–155.&lt;/ref&gt; but the admixture levels vary greatly between island and Central American Garinagu Communities with Stann Creek, Belize Garinagu having 79.9% African, 2.7% European and 17.4% Amerindian and Sandy Bay, St. Vincent Garinagu having 41.1% African, 16.7% European and 42.2% Amerindian.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, M.H. 1983 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/ajpa.1330260508/asset/1330260508_ftp.pdf The anthropological genetics of the black  The anthropological genetics of the Black Caribs (Garifuna) of  Central America and the Caribbean ]. Yearbook of Physical Anthropology. 26: 161-192 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
The Garifuna culture is greatly affected by the economic atmosphere surrounding the community. This makes the communities extremely susceptible to outside influence. Many worry that the area will become extremely commercialized since there are few economic opportunities within the area.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Mark. ''When Afro Becomes (like) Indigenous: Garifuna and Afro-Indigenous Politics in Honduras.'' ''Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology'' 12.2 (2007): 384–413.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global cooling''' was a [[conjecture]] during the 1970s of imminent cooling of the [[Earth]]'s surface and atmosphere culminating in a period of extensive [[glaciation]].

== Introduction: general awareness and concern ==

By the 1970s, scientists were becoming increasingly aware that estimates of global temperatures showed cooling since 1945, as well as the possibility of large scale warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases. In the scientific papers which considered climate trends of the 21st century, less than 10% inclined towards future cooling, while most papers predicted future warming.&lt;ref name="The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus" /&gt; The general public had little awareness of carbon dioxide's effects on climate, but ''[[Science News]]'' in May 1959 forecast a 25% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in the 150 years from 1850 to 2000, with a consequent warming trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/science-past-issue-may-9-1959|title=Science Past from the issue of May 9, 1959|last=|first=|date=April 23, 2009|newspaper=Science News|access-date=|page=30|subscription=Yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual increase in this period was 29%. [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] mentioned climate change from [[greenhouse gases]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="erhlich_1968"&gt;page 52 of The Population Bomb, 1968, available from {{cite web | title=Paul Erhlich on climate change in 1968 | work=Backseat driving | url=http://backseatdriving.blogspot.com/2005_07_01_backseatdriving_archive.html#112148592454360291 | accessdate=November 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the idea of global cooling reached the public press in the mid-1970s temperatures had stopped falling, and there was concern in the climatological community about [[carbon dioxide]]'s warming effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schneider|first=Stephen H.|date=November 1972|title=Atmospheric Particles and Climate: can we Evaluate the Impact of man's Activities?|url=|journal=Quaternary Research|volume=2|issue=3|pages=425–35|bibcode=1972QuRes...2..425S|doi=10.1016/0033-5894(72)90068-3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to such reports, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] issued a warning in June 1976 that "a very significant warming of global climate" was probable.&lt;ref&gt;World's temperature likely to rise; [[The Times]]; 22 June 1976; pg 9; col A&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are some concerns about the possible regional cooling effects of a slowdown or [[shutdown of thermohaline circulation]], which might be provoked by an increase of [[fresh water]] mixing into the North [[Atlantic]] due to [[glacier|glacial melting]]. The [[probability]] of this occurring is generally considered to be very low, and the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] notes, "even in models where the [[Thermohaline circulation|THC]] weakens, there is still a warming over Europe. For example, in all [[Global climate model|AOGCM]] integrations where the [[radiative forcing]] is increasing, the sign of the [[temperature]] change over north-west Europe is positive."&lt;ref name="IPCC sci basis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/357.htm|title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis|author=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305033059/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/357.htm|archive-date=March 5, 2016|dead-url=|accessdate=November 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical mechanisms==

The cooling period is reproduced by current (1999 on) [[global climate model]]s (GCMs) that include the physical effects of [[sulfate aerosols]], and there is now general agreement that [[aerosol]] effects were the dominant cause of the mid-20th century cooling. At the time there were two physical mechanisms that were most frequently advanced to cause cooling: aerosols and orbital forcing.

===Aerosols===

Human activity &amp;mdash; mostly as a by-product of [[fossil fuel]] [[combustion]], partly by [[land use]] changes &amp;mdash; increases the number of tiny particles ([[aerosol]]s) in the atmosphere. These have a direct effect: they effectively increase the planetary [[albedo]], thus cooling the [[planet]] by reducing the [[solar radiation]] reaching the surface; and an indirect effect: they affect the properties of clouds by acting as [[cloud condensation nuclei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rasool|first1=S.I.|last2=Schneider|first2=S.H.|date=|title=Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Aerosols: Effects of Large Increases on Global Climate|url=|journal=Science|publication-date=July 9, 1971|volume=173|issue=3992|pages=138–41|bibcode=1971Sci...173..138R|doi=10.1126/science.173.3992.138|pmid=17739641|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s some speculated that this cooling effect might dominate over the warming effect of the [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] release: see discussion of Rasool and Schneider (1971), below. As a result of observations and a switch to cleaner fuel burning, this no longer seems likely; current scientific work indicates that [[global warming]] is far more likely. Although the temperature drops foreseen by this mechanism have now been discarded in light of better theory and the observed warming, aerosols are thought to have contributed a cooling tendency (outweighed by increases in greenhouse gases) and also have contributed to "[[Global dimming|Global Dimming]]."

===Orbital forcing===
[[Image:Vostok Petit data.svg|thumb|right|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, temperature, and dust concentration measured by Petit et al. from Vostok ice core at Antarctica.]]
[[Orbital forcing]] refers to the [[Milankovitch cycles|slow, cyclical changes]] in the tilt of Earth's [[Axis of rotation|axis]] and shape of its [[orbit]]. These cycles alter the total amount of sunlight reaching the Earth by a small amount and affect the timing and intensity of the [[seasons]]. This mechanism is thought to be responsible for the timing of the [[ice age]] [[climate change|cycles]], and understanding of the mechanism was increasing rapidly in the mid-1970s.

The paper of Hays, Imbrie and Shackleton "Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages" qualified its predictions with the remark that "forecasts must be qualified in two ways. First, they apply only to the natural component of future climatic trends - and not to anthropogenic effects such as those due to the burning of fossil fuels. Second, they describe only the long-term trends, because they are linked to orbital variations with [[Orbital period|period]]s of 20,000 years and longer. Climatic [[oscillations]] at higher frequencies are not predicted... the results indicate that the long-term trend over the next 20,000 years is towards extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation and cooler climate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hays|first1=J.D.|last2=Imbrie|first2=John|last3=Shackleton|first3=N.J.|date=|title=Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages|url=|journal=Science|publication-date=December 10, 1976|volume=194|issue=4270|pages=1121–32|bibcode=1976Sci...194.1121H|doi=10.1126/science.194.4270.1121|pmid=17790893|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that ice ages cycles were predictable appears to have become conflated with the idea that another one was due "soon" - perhaps because much of this study was done by geologists, who are accustomed to dealing with very long time scales and use "soon" to refer to periods of thousands of years. A strict application of the [[Milutin Milanković|Milankovitch]] theory does not allow the prediction of a "rapid" ice age onset (i.e., less than a century or two) since the fastest orbital period is about 20,000 years. Some creative ways around this were found, notably one championed by [[Nigel Calder]] under the name of "snowblitz", but these ideas did not gain wide acceptance.

It is common to see it asserted that the length of the current [[interglacial]] temperature peak is similar to the length of the preceding interglacial peak (Sangamon/Eem), and from this conclude that we might be nearing the end of this warm period. This conclusion is mistaken. Firstly, because the lengths of previous interglacials were not particularly regular;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clim-past.net/8/1473/2012/cp-8-1473-2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; see figure. Petit et al. note that "interglacials 5.5 and 9.3 are different from the [[Holocene]], but similar to each other in duration, shape and amplitude. During each of these two events, there is a warm period of 4 kyr followed by a relatively rapid cooling". Secondly, future orbital variations will not closely resemble those of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petit|first=Jean-Robert|displayauthors=et al.|date=|title=Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica|url=|journal=Nature|publication-date=June 3, 1999|volume=399|issue=6735|pages=429–36|doi=10.1038/20859|via=|bibcode=1999Natur.399..429P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns that a new ice age was approaching was revived in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/11/11/archives/get-out-the-ear-muffs-new-ice-age-forecast.html|title=Get Out the Ear Muffs.

==Concern in the 1960s and 1970s==

===Pre-1970s===

[[J. Murray Mitchell]] showed as early as 1963 a multidecadal cooling since about 1940.&lt;ref name="The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Peterson|first=Thomas|author2=Connolley|first2=William|author3=Fleck,|first3=John|date=September 2008|title=The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|publisher=American Meteorological Society|volume=89|issue=9|pages=1325–1337|bibcode=2008BAMS...89.1325P|doi=10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a conference on climate change held in [[Boulder, Colorado]] in 1965, evidence supporting [[Milankovitch cycles]] triggered speculation on how the calculated small changes in sunlight might somehow trigger ice ages. In 1966, [[Cesare Emiliani]] predicted that "a new glaciation will begin within a few thousand years." In his 1968 book ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] wrote "The [[greenhouse effect]] is being enhanced now by the greatly increased level of [[carbon dioxide]]... [this] is being countered by low-level clouds generated by contrails, dust, and other contaminants... At the moment we cannot predict what the overall climatic results will be of our using the [[atmosphere]] as a garbage dump."&lt;ref name="erhlich_1968"/&gt;

===1970s awareness===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Global cooling.jpg|image2=Global Temperature Anomaly.svg|width=200|caption1=The temperature record as seen in 1975; compare with the next figure.|caption2=Global mean surface temperature change since 1880. Source: [http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ NASA GISS]}}
Concern peaked in the early 1970s, though "the possibility of anthropogenic warming dominated
the peer-reviewed literature even then" &lt;ref name="The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus"/&gt; (a cooling period began in 1945, and two decades of a cooling trend suggested a trough had been reached after several decades of warming). This peaking concern is partially attributable to the fact much less was then known about world climate and [[Ice age#Causes of ice ages|causes of ice ages]]. Climate scientists were aware that predictions based on this trend were not possible - because the trend was poorly studied and not understood (for example see reference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= QJRMS, 1976, p 473 (Symons Memorial Lecture) | work=Was an imminent Ice Age predicted in the '70s? No |author= Mason, B. J. | url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/iceage/mason.1976.html | accessdate=November 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Despite that, in the popular press the possibility of cooling was reported generally without the caveats present in the scientific reports, and "unusually severe winters in Asia and parts of North America in 1972 and 1973...pushed the issue into the public consciousness".&lt;ref name="The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus"/&gt;

In the 1970s, the compilation of records to produce hemispheric, or global, temperature records had just begun.

[[Spencer R. Weart]]'s history of ''[[The Discovery of Global Warming]]'' states that: ''While neither scientists nor the public could be sure in the 1970s whether the world was warming or cooling, people were increasingly inclined to believe that global climate was on the move, and in no small way.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Modern Temperature Trend | work=The Discovery of Global Warming | author= Weart, Spencer | url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/20ctrend.htm#L_0338 | accessdate=November 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 1970, the [[Washington Post]] reported that "Colder Winters Held Dawn of New Ice Age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/147902052.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=&amp;type=historic&amp;date=washingtonpost+%2C+&amp;author=Washington+Post+Staff+Writer%3B+By+David+R.+Boldt&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post%2C+Times+Herald+%281959-1973%29&amp;desc=Colder+Winters+Held+Dawn+of+New+Ice+Age&amp;pqatl=top_retrieves|title=Colder Winters Held Dawn of New Ice Age|last=|first=|date=January 11, 1970|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=March 11, 2015|agency=|quote=Get a good grip on your long johns, cold weather haters -- the worst may be yet to come.

In 1972, Emiliani warned "Man's activity may either precipitate this new ice age or lead to substantial or even total melting of the ice caps...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Cesare |last1=Emiliani |title=Quaternary hypsithermals |journal=Quaternary Research |volume=2 |issue=3 |date=November 1972 |pages=270–3 |doi=10.1016/0033-5894(72)90047-6|bibcode = 1972QuRes...2..270E }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1972 a group of glacial-epoch experts at a conference agreed that "the natural end of our warm epoch is undoubtedly near";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/climate/cycles.htm#N_29_ Past Climate Cycles: Ice Age Speculations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but the volume of Quaternary Research reporting on the meeting said that "the basic conclusion to be drawn from the discussions in this section is that the knowledge necessary for understanding the mechanism of climate change is still lamentably inadequate". Unless there were impacts from future human activity, they thought that serious cooling "must be expected within the next few millennia or even centuries"; but many other scientists doubted these conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Past Cycles: Ice Age Speculations | work=The Discovery of Global Warming | author= Weart, Spencer | url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/cycles.htm | accessdate=November 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kukla72"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Kukla GJ, Matthews RK, Mitchell JM|date=November 1972|title=Guest Editorial: The End of the Present Interglacial|url=|journal=Quaternary Research|volume=2|issue=3|pages=261–9|bibcode=1972QuRes...2..261.|doi=10.1016/0033-5894(72)90046-4|via=|laysummary=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[George Kukla]] and Robert Matthews, in a [[Science (journal)|Science]] write-up of a conference, asked when and how the current interglacial would end; concluding that "Global cooling and related rapid changes of environment, substantially exceeding the fluctuations experienced by man in historical times, must be expected within the next few millennia or even centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=When Will the Present Interglacial End? |first1=G.J. |last1=Kukla |first2=R.K. |last2=Matthews |journal=Science |year=1972 |volume=178 |issue=4057 |pages=190–202 |doi=10.1126/science.178.4057.190 |pmid=17789488 |bibcode = 1972Sci...178..190K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971 to 1975: papers on warming and cooling factors===
By 1971, studies indicated that human caused air [[pollution]] was spreading, but there was uncertainty as to whether aerosols would cause warming or cooling, and whether or not they were more significant than rising {{co2}} levels. [[J. Murray Mitchell]] still viewed humans as "innocent bystanders" in the cooling from the 1940s to 1970, but in 1971 his calculations suggested that rising emissions could cause significant cooling after 2000, though he also argued that emissions could cause warming depending on circumstances. Calculations were too basic at this time to be trusted to give reliable results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Weart | first = Spencer | title = Aerosols: Volcanoes, Dust, Clouds and Climate – Warming or Cooling?

Applied Meteorology 10: 703-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early numerical computation of climate effects was published in the journal ''Science'' in July 1971 as a paper by [[S. Ichtiaque Rasool]] and [[Stephen Schneider|Stephen H. Schneider]], titled "Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Aerosols: Effects of Large Increases on Global Climate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/doc/148085303.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=&amp;type=historic&amp;date=washingtonpost+%2C+&amp;author=By+Victor+Cohn%3B+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post%2C+Times+Herald+%281959-1973%29&amp;desc=U.S.+Scientist+Sees+New+Ice+Age+Coming&amp;pqatl=top_retrieves|title=U.S. Scientist Sees New Ice Age Coming|last=Cohn|first=Victor|date=July 9, 1971|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2015-03-11|agency=|quote=The world could be as little as 50 or 60 years away from a disastrous new ice age, a leading atmospheric scientist predicts. Dr. S. I. Rasool of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Columbia University says ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The paper used rudimentary data and equations to compute the possible future effects of large increases in the densities in the atmosphere of two types of human environmental emissions:&lt;ref name="Weart aerosols"&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Weart | first = Spencer | title = Aerosols: Volcanoes, Dust, Clouds and Climate | url = http://www.aip.org/history/climate/aerosol.htm#L_0338 | publisher = American Institute of Physics | date = 2003–2011 | accessdate = 6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide;
# particulate pollution such as smog, some of which remains suspended in the atmosphere in aerosol form for years.
The paper suggested that the global warming due to greenhouse gases would tend to have less effect with greater densities, and while aerosol pollution could cause warming, it was likely that it would tend to have a cooling effect which increased with density. They concluded that "An increase by only a factor of 4 in global aerosol background concentration may be sufficient to reduce the surface temperature by as much as 3.5 ° K. If sustained over a period of several years, such a temperature decrease over the whole globe is believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rasool | first1 = S.

Both their equations and their data were badly flawed, as was soon pointed out by other scientists and confirmed by Schneider himself.&lt;ref name="Weart aerosols"/&gt; In January 1972, [[Robert Jay Charlson]] et al. pointed out that with other reasonable assumptions, the model produced the opposite conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Charlson|first1=R.

When the model included estimated changes in solar intensity, it gave a reasonable match to temperatures over the previous thousand years and its prediction was that "{{CO2}} warming dominates the surface temperature patterns soon after 1980."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Weart | first = Spencer | title = Aerosols: Volcanoes, Dust, Clouds and Climate: Schneider part b | url = http://www.aip.org/history/climate/aerosol.htm#b_Schneider | publisher = American Institute of Physics | date = 2003–2011 | accessdate = 6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972 and 1974 National Science Board===
The [[National Science Board]]'s ''Patterns and Perspectives in Environmental Science'' report of 1972 discussed the cyclical behavior of climate, and the understanding at the time that the planet was entering a phase of cooling after a warm period. "Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end, to be followed by a long period of considerably colder temperatures leading into the next glacial age some 20,000 years from now."&lt;ref name="NSB72-p55"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; But it also continued; "However, it is possible, or even likely, that human interference has already altered the environment so much that the climatic pattern of the near future will follow a different path."&lt;ref name="NSB72-p55" /&gt;

The Board's report of 1974, ''Science And The Challenges Ahead'', continued on this theme. "During the last 20-30 years, world temperature has fallen, irregularly at first but more sharply over the last decade."&lt;ref name="NSB74-p24"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of cyclic [[glacial period]]s does not feature in this report. Instead it is the role of humans that is central to the report's analysis.
"The cause of the cooling trend is not known with certainty. But there is increasing concern that man himself may be implicated, not only in the recent cooling trend but also in the warming temperatures over the last century".&lt;ref name="NSB74-p24" /&gt; The report did not conclude whether carbon dioxide in warming, or agricultural and industrial pollution in cooling, are factors in the recent climatic changes, noting;
"Before such questions as these can be resolved, major advances must be made in understanding the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere and [[oceans]], and in measuring and tracing [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] through the system."&lt;ref name="NSB74-p25"&gt;{{cite book

===1975 National Academy of Sciences report===
There also was a Report by the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) entitled, "Understanding Climate Change: A Program for Action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingcli00unit|title=Understanding Climate Change: A Program for Action|author=U. S. National Academy of Sciences|first=|date=|year=1975|website=|via=Internet Archive|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report stated (p.&amp;nbsp;36) that, "The average surface air temperature in the northern hemisphere increased from the 1880's until about 1940 and has been decreasing thereafter."

It also stated (p.&amp;nbsp;44) that, "If both the {{chem|CO|2}} and particulate inputs to the atmosphere grow at equal rates in the future, the widely differing atmospheric residence times of the two pollutants means that the particulate effect will grow in importance relative to that of {{chem|CO|2}}."

The report did not predict whether the 25-year cooling trend would continue. It stated (Forward, p. v) that, "we do not have a good quantitative understanding of our climate machine and what determines its course [so] it does not seem possible to predict climate," and (p.&amp;nbsp;2) "The climates of the earth have always been changing, and they will doubtless continue to do so in the future. How large these future changes will be, and where and how rapidly they will occur, we do not know."

The Report's "program for action" was a call for creation of a new "National Climatic Research Program." It stated (p.&amp;nbsp;62), "If we are to react rationally to the inevitable climatic changes of the future, and if we are ever to predict their future course, whether they are natural or man-induced, a far greater understanding of these changes is required than we now possess. It is, moreover, important that this knowledge be acquired as soon as possible." For that reason, it stated, "the time has now come to initiate a broad and coordinated attack on the problem of climate and climatic change."

===1974 ''Time'' magazine article===
While these discussions were ongoing in scientific circles, other accounts appeared in the popular media. In their June 24, 1974 issue, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' presented an article titled "Another Ice Age?" that noted "the atmosphere has been growing gradually cooler for the past three decades" but noted that "Some scientists... think that the cooling trend may be only temporary." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944914,00.html | work=Time | title=Science: Another Ice Age? | date=June 24, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1975 ''Newsweek'' article===
An April 28, 1975 article in ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine was titled "The Cooling World",&lt;ref name="newsweek-1975"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://html1-f.scribdassets.com/yal7w1ekg3t0s2a/images/1-9c290725b9.jpg|title=The Cooling World|author=Gwynne|first=Peter|date=April 28, 1975|newspaper=[[Newsweek]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625112826/https://html1-f.scribdassets.com/yal7w1ekg3t0s2a/images/1-9c290725b9.jpg|archive-date=June 25, 2018|dead-url=No|via=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt; it pointed to "ominous signs that the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change" and pointed to "a drop of half a degree [Fahrenheit] in average ground temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere between 1945 and 1968." The article stated "The evidence in support of these predictions [of global cooling] has now begun to accumulate so massively that meteorologists are hard-pressed to keep up with it." The ''Newsweek'' article did not state the cause of cooling; it stated that "what causes the onset of major and minor ice ages remains a mystery" and cited the NAS conclusion that "not only are the basic scientific questions largely unanswered, but in many cases we do not yet know enough to pose the key questions."

The article mentioned the alternative solutions of "melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting Arctic rivers" but conceded these were not feasible. The ''Newsweek'' article concluded by criticizing government leaders: "But the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic projections of future food supplies...The longer the planners (politicians) delay, the more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the results become grim reality." The article emphasized sensational and largely unsourced consequences - "resulting famines could be catastrophic", "drought and desolation," "the most devastating outbreak of tornadoes ever recorded", "droughts, floods, extended dry spells, long freezes, delayed monsoons," "impossible for starving peoples to migrate," "the present decline has taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age."&lt;ref name="newsweek-1975"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/newsweek-rewind-debunking-global-cooling-252326|title=Newsweek Rewind: Debunking Global Cooling|last=Verger|first=Rob|date=May 23, 2014|newspaper=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2006, ''Newsweek'' issued a correction, over 31 years after the original article, stating that it had been "so spectacularly wrong about the near-term future" (though editor Jerry Adler stated that "the story wasn't 'wrong' in the journalistic sense of 'inaccurate.'")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/72481|title=Remember Global Cooling?|author=Adler|first=Jerry|date=October 22, 2006|newspaper=Newsweek|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other 1970s sources===
Academic analysis of the peer-reviewed studies published at that time shows that most papers examining aspects of climate during the 1970s were either neutral or showed a warming trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Thomas C.|last2=Connolley|first2=William M.|last3=Fleck|first3=John|date=|title=The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus|url=|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|publication-date=September 1, 2008|volume=|pages=1325–37|doi=10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1|via=|bibcode=2008BAMS...89.1325P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, a popular book on the topic was published, called ''The Weather Conspiracy: The Coming of the New Ice Age''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

There were also a US TV show narrated by [[Leonard Nimoy]] in the 1977 ''[[In Search of...

===1979 WMO conference===

Later in the decade, at a [[WMO]] conference in 1979, F K Hare reported:
{{quotation|
:Fig 8 shows [...] 1938 the warmest year. They [temperatures] have since fallen by about 0.4 °C. At the end there is a suggestion that the fall ceased in about 1964, and may even have reversed.

:Figure 9 challenges the view that the fall of temperature has ceased [...] the weight of evidence clearly favours cooling to the present date [...] The striking point, however, is that interannual variability of world temperatures is much larger than the trend [...] it is difficult to detect a genuine trend [...]

:It is questionable, moreover, whether the trend is truly global. Calculated variations in the 5-year mean air temperature over the southern hemisphere chiefly with respect to land areas show that temperatures generally rose between 1943 and 1975. Since the 1960-64 period this rise has been strong [...] the scattered SH data fail to support a hypothesis of continued global cooling since 1938.

==Late 20th Century cooling predictions==

===1980s===
Concerns about [[nuclear winter]] arose in the early 1980s from several reports. Similar speculations have appeared over effects due to catastrophes such as [[Impact event|asteroid impacts]] and [[Yellowstone Caldera|massive volcanic eruptions]]. In 1991, a prediction that [[Kuwaiti oil fires|massive oil well fires in Kuwait]] would cause significant effects on climate was incorrect.

===1990s===
In January 1999, contrarian [[Patrick Michaels]] wrote a commentary offering to "take even money that the 10 years ending on December 31, 2007, will show a statistically significant global cooling trend in temperatures measured by satellite", on the basis of his view that record temperatures in 1998 had been a blip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/fighting-fire-facts|title=Fighting Fire With Facts|last=Michaels|first=Patrick J.|authorlink=Patrick Michaels|date=January 18, 1999|website=|publisher=[[Cato Institute]]|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, over that period, satellite-measured temperatures never again approached their 1998 peak. Due to a sharp but temporary dip in temperatures in 1999-2000, a least-squares linear regression fit to the satellite temperature record showed little overall trend. The RSS satellite temperature record showed a slight cooling trend,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=RSS MSU lower trop. global mean |url=http://woodfortrees.org/plot/rss/from:1998.0/to:2008.0/plot/rss/from:1998.0/to:2008.0/trend |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MR4cvCKU?url=http://woodfortrees.org/plot/rss/from:1998.0/to:2008.0/plot/rss/from:1998.0/to:2008.0/trend |publisher=WoodForTrees |accessdate=6 January 2014 |archivedate=7 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the UAH satellite temperature record showed a slight warming trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=UAH NSSTC lower trop. global mean |url=http://woodfortrees.org/plot/uah/from:1998.0/to:2008.0/plot/uah/from:1998.0/to:2008.0/trend |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MR4eILM6?url=http://woodfortrees.org/plot/uah/from:1998.0/to:2008.0/plot/uah/from:1998.0/to:2008.0/trend |publisher=WoodForTrees |accessdate=6 January 2014 |archivedate=7 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Office of Net Assessment]] at the [[United States Department of Defense]] was commissioned to produce a study on the likely and potential effects of abrupt modern climate change should a [[shutdown of thermohaline circulation]] occur.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Peter|author2=Randall, Doug|date=October 2003|title=An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National Security|url=http://www.climate.org/PDF/clim_change_scenario.pdf|deadurl=yes|format=|journal=|publisher=|volume=|pages=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320054750/http://www.climate.org/PDF/clim_change_scenario.pdf|archivedate=March 20, 2009|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study, conducted under ONA head [[Andrew Marshall (foreign policy strategist)|Andrew Marshall]], modelled its prospective climate change on the [[8.2 kiloyear event]], precisely because it was the middle alternative between the [[Younger Dryas]] and the [[Little Ice Age]]. Scientists acknowledge that "abrupt climate change initiated by [[Greenland ice sheet]] melting is not a realistic scenario for the 21st century".&lt;ref name="Jungclaus2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jungclaus|first=Johann H.|display-authors=etal|date=|year=2006|title=Will Greenland melting halt the thermohaline circulation?|url=|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|publication-date=September 7, 2006|volume=33|issue=17|pages=L17708|bibcode=2006GeoRL..3317708J|doi=10.1029/2006GL026815|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present level of knowledge==

Currently, the concern that cooler temperatures would continue, and perhaps at a faster rate, has been observed to be incorrect by the IPCC.&lt;ref name="IPCC sci basis" /&gt; More has to be learned about climate, but the growing records have shown that the cooling concerns of 1975 have not been borne out.

As for the prospects of the end of the current interglacial, while the four most recent interglacials lasted about 10,000 years, the interglacial before that lasted around 28,000 years. Milankovitch-type calculations indicate that the present interglacial would probably continue for tens of thousands of years naturally in the absence of human perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As the NAS report indicates, scientific knowledge regarding climate change was more uncertain than it is today. At the time that Rasool and Schneider wrote their 1971 paper, climatologists had not yet recognized the significance of greenhouse gases other than water vapor and carbon dioxide, such as [[methane]], [[nitrous oxide]], and [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Other Greenhouse Gases | work=The Discovery of Global Warming | author= Weart, Spencer |url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/othergas.htm | accessdate=November 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in that decade, carbon dioxide was the only widely studied human-influenced greenhouse gas. The attention drawn to atmospheric gases in the 1970s stimulated many discoveries in subsequent decades. As the temperature pattern changed, global cooling was of waning interest by 1979.&lt;ref name="wcc-1979.html"/&gt;

==The ice age fallacy==
A common argument used to [[Climate change denial|dispute the significance of human caused climate change]], which TIME Magazine calls the Ice Age Fallacy, is to allege that scientists showed concerns about global cooling which did not materialise, therefore there is no need to heed current scientific concerns about climate change.&lt;ref name="Time 16713"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://science.time.com/2013/06/06/sorry-a-time-magazine-cover-did-not-predict-a-coming-ice-age/|title=TIME Magazine Cover Warning of Coming Ice Age Is a Fake|last=Walsh|first=Bryan|date=June 6, 2013|work=|accessdate=July 16, 2013|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 article promoting the [[Oregon Petition]], [[Fred Singer]] argued that expert concerns about global warming should be dismissed on the basis that what he called "the same hysterical fears" had supposedly been expressed earlier about global cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sepp.org/glwarm/sciaddheat.html|title=Scientists add to heat over global warming|author=Singer|first=S.

Illustrating this argument, for several years an image has been circulated of a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] cover, supposedly dated 1977, showing a penguin above a cover story title "How to Survive the Coming Ice Age". In March 2013, ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' published an article by [[David Rose (journalist)|David Rose]], showing this same cover image, to support his claim that there was as much concern in the 1970s about a "looming 'ice age'" as there was now about global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://viewfrommidamerica.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/from-global-cooling-to-global-cooling.html|title=From Global Cooling to Global Cooling|last=|first=|date=September 30, 2010|website=|publisher=The View From Mid-America|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www.dailymail March 2013"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2294560/The-great-green-1-The-hard-proof-finally-shows-global-warming-forecasts-costing-billions-WRONG-along.html|title=The Great Green Con no. 1: The hard proof that finally shows global warming forecasts that are costing you billions were WRONG all along|last=Rose|first=David|date=March 16, 2013|work=|accessdate=July 16, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FE7qlyAG?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2294560/The-great-green-1-The-hard-proof-finally-shows-global-warming-forecasts-costing-billions-WRONG-along.html|archivedate=March 19, 2013|dead-url=yes|publisher=[[Daily Mail|Mail Online]]|location=London|quote=In the Seventies, scientists and policymakers were just as concerned about a looming ‘ice age’ as they have been lately about global warming – as the Time magazine cover pictured here illustrates.|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After researching the authenticity of the magazine cover image, in July 2013, Bryan Walsh, a senior editor at ''Time'', confirmed that the image was a hoax, modified from a 2007 cover story image for "The Global Warming Survival Guide".&lt;ref name="Time 16713" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2496">{{About|the DSP microchip|the Han Dynasty general|Han Xin|the King of [[Han (state)|Hán]], who is also known as Han Wang Xin|King Xin of Han}}

'''Hanxin''' ({{zh|s=汉芯|t=漢芯|p=Hànxīn}}) is the name of a [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) [[Integrated circuit|microchip]]. A Chinese professor, [[Chen Jin (professor)|Chen Jin]], claimed to have developed the chip in 2003. Chen Jin was a professor at the prestigious [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Jiaotong University]] in [[Shanghai]]. The Hanxin 1 was reportedly the first DSP chip to have been wholly developed in [[People's Republic of China|China]]; however, the chip was later revealed to be a duplicate of a chip developed in the West, with the original identifications sanded away.

==Exposure==
At the beginning of 2006, an anonymous user in a popular Chinese internet forum [[Tianya Club]] wrote an article about the forgery of this DSP chip with very detailed references.  Later various Chinese media including [[Ming Pao]], a [[Hong Kong]] newspaper, claims that various ministries of the Chinese government have been investigating the Hanxin, and Chen may have duplicated a [[Freescale]] DSP from the [[Western world|West]]. Ming Pao claimed on March 14, 2006 that the investigation had determined that the claims by Chen were exaggerated, and that the investigation was continuing.

On May 12, 2006, the [[China News Service]] reported that Chen's research was faked and the Hanxin project had been cancelled.

The government decided to retrieve all funds allocated to the Hanxin research, and permanently banned Chen from doing any government-funded research and ordered him to return investment money. He could also face a criminal investigation.

[[Trinidad and Tobago]] is a destination, source, and transit country for women and children subjected to [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons, specifically forced prostitution, and children and men in conditions of forced labor. Some women and girls from [[Colombia]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Suriname]] who had been in prostitution in Trinidadian brothels and clubs have been identified as trafficking victims. Trinidadian trafficking victims have been identified in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Undocumented economic migrants from the region and from [[Asia]] may be vulnerable to [[forced labor]] and [[forced prostitution]]. As a hub for regional travel, Trinidad and Tobago also is a potential transit point for trafficking victims traveling to Caribbean and South American destinations.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Trinidad and Tobago". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of Trinidad and Tobago does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, Trinidad and Tobago is placed on Tier 2 Watch List because the government did not show progress in prosecuting and punishing trafficking crimes and protecting trafficking victims, whom the government often jailed and deported. The government’s formation of a working group to substantively address its human trafficking problem portends good prospects for future improvements, and if effective legislation were adopted and enforced, the government would be poised to take the further steps in prosecuting trafficking cases and identifying and assisting victims.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The anti-trafficking task force, which is co-chaired by an official from the Ministry of National Security in partnership with [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], has been overseeing the implementation of a nine-month anti-trafficking action plan and organized three subcommittees: one to draft legislation, one to develop victim assistance policies, and a third to raise public awareness; however, the government made no discernible progress in its prosecution and punishment of sex and labor trafficking offenders during the reporting period. The lack of comprehensive legislation that would make human trafficking a crime and would ensure protection of trafficking victims was a significant limitation in the government’s ability to prosecute trafficking offenders and address human trafficking in Trinidad and Tobago during the reporting period. The government reported no prosecutions, convictions, or sentences of trafficking offenders. The government reported one trafficking investigation during the year, and it began extradition proceedings in February 2010 against a foreign national wanted for human trafficking in another country. The government provided logistical, human resources, and some financial support to IOM anti-trafficking training for police, immigration officers, police, and other officials during the reporting period.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government made minimal progress in protecting victims during the reporting period. The government did not employ systematic procedures for law enforcement authorities to proactively identify victims and refer them to available services; however, in a positive step, some law enforcement officers are reported to have taken suspected victims to shelters. The task force recently began development of guidelines for officials to refer potential victims to shelter, counseling, medical care, and interpreter assistance. The government did not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. The government did not report proactively identifying any victims during the reporting period. [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] identified foreign trafficking victims in jail for immigration or other violations committed as a direct result of being trafficked that were later deported. The government offered some social services directly and through NGOS that received government funding, but due to a lack of a formal procedures to guide officials in victim identification and referral to services, few victims received assistance. Trinidadian authorities encouraged crime victims in general to assist with the investigation and prosecution of offenders, though without legislation criminalizing human trafficking or formal trafficking victim protection provisions there were few incentives for victims to assist.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
The government made some progress in preventing human trafficking during the reporting period through the establishment of the anti-trafficking task force. While the government did not conduct public awareness activities during the reporting period, the responsible subcommittee developed plans to implement a trafficking victim hotline and nationwide information campaign. While prostitution is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, the government did not take additional measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period. Authorities did not consider child sex tourism to be a problem in Trinidad and Tobago during the reporting period and reported no prosecutions related to child sex tourism.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

[[File:Blue water,hussian sagar lake,hyderabad,A.P - panoramio.jpg|thumb|230px|left|[[Hussain Sagar]] is the biggest lake in Hyderabad.]]
Once upon a time, [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] was known as '''City of Lakes'''. Some of these lakes are natural and various are manmade bodies. As per various sources only a few decades back, Hyderabad had a large number of [[water bodies]] such as lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, aquaculture ponds, tanks etc. (as per some sources between 3000 and 7000 including natural and manmade bodies. Locally known as ''cheruvu, kunta, tanks'' ). Most of these lakes have totally disappeared and the surface area of most of the surviving lakes have shrunken and turned to tiny ponds and cesspool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=B. |first=Nitin |date= 2018-12-28|title= Say your goodbyes to Hyderabad lakes |trans-title= |url= https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/say-your-goodbyes-hyderabad-lakes-citys-water-bodies-shrinking-stinking-mess-54934|language=en |work=The NEWS Minute|location=Hyderabad |access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the lakes which have totally disappeared are Tigal Kunta, Somajiguda Tank, Mir Jumla tank, Pahar Tigal Kunta, Kunta Bhawani Das, Nawab Saheb Kunta, Afzalsagar, Nallakunta, Masab Tank etc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1= Gumma |first1=Ravi Kumar|date=September 2013 |title=GROUND WATER BROCHURE |year=2013|url=http://cgwb.gov.in/District_Profile/Telangana/Hyderabad.pdf?bcsi_scan_50e22d9f1bebc2c5=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=Hyderabad.pdf |access-date=2018-11-08 |department=CENTRAL GROUND WATER BOARD, MINISTRY OF WATER RESOURCES, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA|location= Hyderabad|publisher= MINISTRY OF WATER RESOURCES, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA|publication-place= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Hussainsagar Lake, Kunta Mallaiyapalli have shrunk drastically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Nanisetti|first=Serish |date= 2017-10-14|title= In Hyderabad, lakes are nothing but urban myths|trans-title= |url= https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/in-hyderabad-lakes-are-nothing-but-urban-myths/article19862817.ece|language=en |work=[[The Hindu]]|location=Hyderabad |access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of thousands of water bodies those were existing in 1970s in various sizes in and around Hyderabad, today  only about 70 to 500 of them have survived. Most of them have disappeared due to encroachment or have been illegally drained for real estate projects by private or government agencies.  The existing lakes have been used to dump garbage and sewage water. Most of these lakes and tanks were built during the regime of Qutub Shah in 16th and 17th century and later by Nizams as a source of drinking water for the residents of Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watertales.wwfindia.org/water_story_hyderabad.php

Out of this 62 lakes were under the control of government, 25 are owned by private organisations and 82 lakes are under joint government private ownership.As per existing government norms, no construction of any kind, irrespective of the ownership status is allowed on the lake bed.

'''Ian L. McHarg''' (20 November 1920 – 5 March 2001) was a Scottish [[landscape architect]] and writer on [[regional planning]] using natural systems. He was the founder of the department of landscape architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the United States. His 1969 book ''Design with Nature'' pioneered the concept of ecological planning. It continues to be one of the most widely celebrated books on landscape architecture and land-use planning. In this book, he set forth the basic concepts that were to develop later in [[geographic information system]]s.

==Biography==

===Formative years===
His father was a manager and later a salesman in the industrial city of [[Glasgow]], Scotland.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471086282.html|title=A quest for life|last=McHarg|first=Ian|publisher=Wiley|year=1996|isbn=0471086282|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McHarg showed an early talent for drawing and was advised to consider a career in landscape architecture. His early experiences with the bifurcated landscapes of Scotland—the smoky industrial urbanism of Glasgow and the sublimity of the surrounding environs—had a profound influence on his later thinking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It was not until after his term in the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], serving in war-stricken Italy during [[World War II]], however, that he was able to explore the field of urban landscape architecture. After working with the [[Royal Engineers]] during World War II, he travelled to America. He was admitted to the school of architecture at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Graduate School of Design]] where he received professional degrees in both [[landscape architecture]] and city planning in 1949. After completing his education he returned to his homeland, intending to help rebuild a country ravaged by war. In Scotland he worked on housing and programs in "[[New Towns Act 1946|new towns]]", until he was contacted by Dean G. Holmes Perkins from the University of Pennsylvania. Dean Perkins wanted McHarg to build a new graduate program in landscape architecture at the University.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Steiner, Frederick. "Healing the earth: the relevance of Ian McHarg's work for the future." Philosophy &amp; Geography Feb. 2004: 141+. Academic Search Complete&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon thereafter, McHarg began teaching at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he developed the department of landscape architecture, and developed a popular new course, titled ''Man and Environment'' in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Ian McHarg, ''A quest for life: an autobiography,'' John Wiley and Sons, 1996 pp.157–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The course featured leading scholars whom McHarg invited to his class to discuss ethics and values, as well as other ideas ranging from entropy to plate tectonics. In 1960, he hosted his own television show on [[CBS]], ''The House We Live In'', inviting prominent theologians and scientists of the day to discuss the human place in the world, in a style similar to the one he honed teaching "Man and Environment."

In 1963 Ian McHarg and [[David A. Wallace]], his academic colleague from the University of Pennsylvania, founded the firm of Wallace and McHarg Associates, later [[Wallace McHarg Roberts &amp; Todd (WMRT)]] which is known for its central role in the development of the American [[environmental planning]] and urbanism movements. The seminal work of the firm includes the plan for [[Baltimore]]'s ''[[Inner Harbor]]'', the ''Plan for the Valleys'' in [[Baltimore County, MD]], and the ''Plan for Lower Manhattan'' in New York City from 1963 through 1965.

As the first-wave American environmental movement swept across American college campuses in the 1960s and early 1970s, McHarg became an important figure, linking a compelling personal presence and a powerful rhetoric with a direct and persuasive proposal for a new integration of human and natural environments. Through the 1960s and 1970s, his course was the most popular on the Penn campus,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; and he was often invited to speak on campuses throughout the country.

===Design with Nature===
In 1969, he published ''Design with Nature'', which was essentially a book of step-by-step instructions on how to break down a region into its appropriate uses.&lt;ref name=wenz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecotecture.com/reviews/mcharg2.html |title=Design with Nature by Ian L. Mcharg |last1=Wenz |first1=Philip |date=6 February 1995 |website= |publisher=ecotecture.com |access-date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McHarg also was interested in garden design and believed that homes should be planned and designed with good private garden space. He promoted an ecological view, in which the designer becomes very familiar with the area through analysis of soil, climate, hydrology, etc. ''Design With Nature'' was the first work of its kind "to define the problems of modern development and present a methodology or process prescribing compatible solutions".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1920"&gt;Schnadelbach, R. Terry, et al. "Ian McHarg 1920–." Fifty Key Thinkers on the Environment (7 Dec 2000): 228–241. Environment Complete&lt;/ref&gt; The book also affected a variety of fields and ideas. [[Frederick R. Steiner]] tells us that "environmental impact assessment, new community development, coastal zone management, brownfields restoration, zoo design, river corridor planning, and ideas about sustainability and regenerative design all display the influence of ''Design with Nature''".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;

''Design with Nature'' had its roots in much earlier landscape architecture philosophies.  It was sharply critical of the French Baroque style of garden design, which McHarg saw as a subjugation of nature, and full of praise for the English picturesque style of garden design. McHarg's focus, however, was only partially on the visual and sensual qualities which had dominated the English picturesque movement.  Instead, he saw the earlier tradition as a precursor of his philosophy, which was rooted less in aristocratic estate design or even garden design and more broadly in an ecological sensibility that accepted the interwoven worlds of the human and the natural, and sought to more fully and intelligently design human environments in concert with the conditions of setting, climate and environment.  Always a polemicist, McHarg set his thinking in radical opposition to what he argued was the arrogant and destructive heritage of urban-industrial modernity, a style he described as "Dominate and Destroy."

Following the publication of ''Design with Nature'', [[Wallace McHarg Roberts &amp; Todd (WMRT)]] worked in major American cities – Minneapolis, Denver, Miami, New Orleans, and Washington (DC) – and created environmentally-based master plans for [[Amelia Island Plantation]] and [[Sanibel Island]]s in Florida.

===Later career===
In 1971 McHarg delivered a speech at the North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference in Portland, Oregon, called "Man: Planetary Disease". In the speech he asserted that, due to the views of man and nature that have infiltrated all of western culture, we are not guaranteed survival. Of man, McHarg said, "He treats the world as a storehouse existing for his delectation; he plunders, rapes, poisons, and kills this living system, the biosphere, in ignorance of its workings and its fundamental value." &lt;ref&gt;McHarg, I (1971). Man, Planetary Disease. Vital Speeches of the Day (October). p. 634-640.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end man is a "planetary disease", who has lived with no regard for nature. He discusses how in the Judeo-Christian traditions, the Bible says that man is to have dominion over the earth. McHarg says that for man to survive, this idea must be taken as an allegory only, and not as literally true. Lest this statement be construed as anti-religion, he cites Paul Tillich (Protestantism), Gustav Weigel (Catholicism), and Abram Heschel (Judaism) as noted religious scholars who are also in agreement with him on this point.

Ian McHarg was the original co-designer of [[The Woodlands, Texas]], an unincorporated community in [[Montgomery County, Texas]]. This community was developed from timberland located thirty miles north of Houston, by [[George P. Mitchell]], who hired McHarg to consult on the project and, as a result, the original plans featured many of his unique designs. Due in part to concerns of flooding, McHarg identified the water system as the most critical aspect of the site. The natural drainage system the firm designed was successful at limiting the runoff with which McHarg was concerned, and was also much cheaper than a conventional drainage system would have been. In 1998, in his collection ''To Heal the Earth'', McHarg wrote that the Woodlands is one of the best examples of his ideals. Most of the actual work was done by a large team while McHarg was still there, and by many others in the years since he left. The Woodlands continues to be a successful ecological community even today.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, Ann. "Ian McHarg's Woodlands: A Second Look." Planning 69.8 (Aug. 2003): 10–13. Environment Complete.&lt;/ref&gt;

McHarg's own plans for urban expansion projects also were more 'English' than 'French' in their geometry. He favoured what became known as 'cluster development' with relatively dense housing set in a larger natural environment.

In 1975 WMRT began the planning phase of a project for the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]], an environmental park to be called [[Pardisan]], unlike any the world had ever seen.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1920"/&gt; The park was to demonstrate the heritage of the Iranian people, as well as to illustrate the major ecosystems of the world. McHarg was enthusiastic about this project, and greatly invested in the work. The other partners of the firm, however, believed the project to be a significant risk, despite the fact that Iran was wealthy from the sale of oil. Their concerns became justified when the [[Iranian Revolution|Shah was overthrown]] and the firm was left with a large amount of debt from the project. Located in a north western area of Tehran, Pardisan still remains as a large, relatively un-designed, green space but McHargs designs were never implemented. &lt;ref&gt;http://wikimapia.org/1538316/fa/%D9%BE%D8%A7%D8%B1%DA%A9-%D8%AC%D9%86%DA%AF%D9%84%DB%8C-%D9%BE%D8%B1%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
McHarg was the recipient of numerous awards, including the Harvard Lifetime Achievement Award, the Pioneer Award from the American Institute of Certified Planners, and 15 medals,&lt;ref name="Penn Obit"&gt;[http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/article.php?id=359 ''University Of Pennsylvania Prof. Ian McHarg Dies''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031160524/http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/article.php?id=359 |date=31 October 2005 }}, Penn News, 6 March 2001.

McHarg also received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1992 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1980 McHarg left the firm he founded and the firm changed its name to [[Wallace Roberts &amp; Todd]] (WRT).

In 1996, McHarg published his autobiography ''A Quest for Life''. He was also instrumental in the founding of Earth Week, and participated on task forces on environmental issues for the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]], [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], and [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administrations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/between/McHarg.html |title=Death: Ian McHarg of Landscape Architecture &amp; Regional Planning – Almanac Between Issues 3/8/01 |publisher=Upenn.edu |date=8 March 2001 |accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
McHarg died on 5 March 2001 at the age of eighty from pulmonary disease.

==The Ian L. McHarg Center==
In the summer of 2017, the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Design]] launched a new, interdisciplinary research center in McHarg's honor. Anticipating the 50th publication anniversary of his seminal text ''Design with Nature'', the [https://mcharg.upenn.edu/ McHarg Center]'s public launch will take place in June 2019 as a part of an event, exhibition, and book project known as "Design with Nature Now." It's mission is to build on PennDesign’s position as a global leader in urban ecological design by bringing environmental and social scientists together with planners, designers, policy-makers, and communities to develop practical, innovative ways of improving the quality of life in the places most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mcharg.upenn.edu/ian-l-mcharg-center-urbanism-and-ecology|title=The Ian L.

The '''Korpela movement''', or '''Siikavaara sect''', was a [[religious sect]] started by [[Laestadianism|Laestadian]] preacher [[Toivo Korpela]] in [[Sweden]] during the 1920s. It saw its decline later during the next decade as its practices involved heavy drinking and unconventional sexual activities toward the end of its existence, which subsequently led to the conviction of 60 of its followers.

== History ==

The grounds for the Korpela movement were laid in 1928 when Toivo Korpela, a self-proclaimed [[Laestadianism|Laestadian]] [[preacher]] who had been rejected from his congregation in western [[Finland]], started to travel around the [[Torne Valley]] to preach. The mainstream of the Laestadian movement were troubled by his activities and in 1931, it was openly suggested that Korpela could have "succumbed to [[vice]]" and that "the authority of the word of god was endangered" unless he changed his view on important matters of faith. When Korpela stopped preaching in 1934 due to his conflicting views with the Swedish Laestadian church, the movement survived without his leadership and new leaders emerged from inside the community.

One of the new leaders of the cult was [[Sigurd Siikavaara]], who officially started the movement following Korpela's exile (thus the alternative name of the movement). More unorthodox elements such as [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] beliefs and ecstatic rituals were introduced following the change of leadership. These beliefs and practices were later denounced by Korpela himself in an interview given in 1935. Following the involvement of Swedish authorities, Siikavaara was institutionalised in an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] for 67 days, and upon his release the practices of the movement took a turn towards sexual rituals, which would ultimately lead to its demise.&lt;ref name="lena"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/714005596|last=Malkki|issn=0954-6553|first=Lena|date=Spring 2002|title= Apocalypse - Not in Finland. Millenarianism and Expectations on the Eve of the Year 2000|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence| volume=14| issue=1 | pages=187–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the radical change in practices, the Swedish government involved itself further, previously being tolerant toward religion, now targeting the [[sexual ritual]]s, especially with concern for the involvement of minors. In 1939, police arrested 60 people,&lt;ref name="lena"/&gt; leading to the end of the movement, which at its peak had gained an estimated total of 600 followers.&lt;ref name="dala"&gt;{{cite web|title=Populärmusik från Tornedalen| url=http://www.dalademokraten.se/ArticlePages/200405/17/1000245068_TT/1000245068_TT.dbp.asp |publisher=Dalademokraten| accessdate=2006-11-25|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs and practices ==

The spiritual beliefs of the movement were initially similar to those of [[Laestadianism]], although apparently not accepted by the Laestadian community as a whole, hence Korpela's initial reaction from central Finland.&lt;ref name="edu"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hepokoski| first=Warren H.| title=The Laestadian Movement: Disputes and Divisions 1861 - 2000| origyear=1997| year=2002| url=http://www.me.mtu.edu/~mahepoko/disputes/disputes.htm|accessdate=2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the exile of Korpela, his two closest preachers, Sigurd Siikavaara and [[Arthur Niemi]] began to introduce the belief that a flying [[Interstellar ark|ark]] would bring 666 true believers to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and that the last 1,335 days of the world had begun, one date set for the arrival of the ark that was reported by newspapers at the time was March 14, 1935. It was later taught that the ark would not be an actual physical ark, but the spirit of [[Christ]], granted to the followers of the Korpela movement. All claims and beliefs were more or less loosely based on interpretations of an old version of the Bible, as the new translation of the Bible at the time was preached as an abomination.&lt;ref name="edu"/&gt;

Following Siikavaara and Niemi's brief confinement to mental asylums the beliefs and practices changed focus; Siikavaara claimed to have been invested with the spirit of the prophets and Christ, essentially proclaiming divine status, and gave the followers of the movement forgiveness for their [[sin]]s, thus enabling them to engage in swearing, drinking, gambling and hitherto-prohibited sexual rituals. Upon his arrest in 1939, Siikavaara was an alcoholic and had allegedly engaged in sexual intercourse with 30 women other than his wife.&lt;ref name="edu"/&gt;

These facts have been questioned by relatives of Siikavaara who say that there actually were not any sexual rituals. Said rituals were merely rumours created by Laestadians, imagining the worst possible sins.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The '''Kpelle people''' (also known as the ''Guerze, Kpwesi, Kpessi, Sprd, Mpessi, Berlu, Gbelle, Bere, Gizima,'' or ''Buni''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard M. |last=Fulton |title=The Political Structures and Functions of Poro in Kpelle Society |journal=American Anthropologist |series=n.s. |volume=74 |issue=5 |year=1972 |pages=1218–1233 |doi=10.1525/aa.1972.74.5.02a00140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are the largest ethnic group in Liberia. They are located primarily in an area of central [[Liberia]] extending into [[Guinea]]. They speak the [[Kpelle language]],&lt;ref name=Erchak&gt;http://go.galegroup.com.mctproxy.mnpals.net/ps/start.do?p=GVRL&amp;u=mnaminncom&lt;/ref&gt; which belongs to the [[Mande languages|Mande language family]].

Despite their yearly heavy rainfalls and rough land, Kpelle survive mostly on their [[Staple food|staple]] crop of rice. Culturally the Kpelle take a functional approach to life;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kpelle|title=Kpelle {{!}} people|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are organized under several paramount chiefs who serve as [[mediation|mediator]]s for the public, preserve order and settle disputes. Their local economy rest on trade with local tribes. They are arguably the most rural and conservative of the major [[Demographics of Liberia|Liberian peoples.]]&lt;ref name="Kpelle, UCLA, Anthropology"&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/kpelle.htm "Kpelle", UCLA, Anthropology.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The Kpelle are the largest ethnic group of the West African nation of Liberia and are also an important ethnic group also in southern [[Guinea]] (where they are also known as ''Guerze'') and north western [[Ivory Coast]]. Most Kpelle inhabit [[Bong County]], [[Bomi County]], [[Gbarpolu County]], and [[Lofa County]].&lt;ref name="Kpelle, UCLA, Anthropology"/&gt;  They are major food suppliers of the capital cities.

The terrain in the area includes swamps, hills and, in lowland areas, rivers. May through October brings their rainy season with an annual rainfall from 180 to 300 centimeters. The Kpelle territory sees the lowest temperatures dropping to 19 degrees C with the average temp around 36 degree C.&lt;ref name=Erchak/&gt;

==Food==
The Kpelle people eat [[Rice University|rice]] as their primary staple. It is supplemented by [[cassava]], vegetables, and fruits; [[cash crop]]s include rice, [[peanut]]s, [[sugarcane]], and [[kola nuts]] they also enjoy [[fufu]] and soup, sometimes the soup is spicy but it depends on the way they want it. Soup may be eaten as an appetizer or in conjunction to the main dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-9046174 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition |publisher=Library.eb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Traditionally, the Kpelle have been farmers with [[rice]] as the main crop.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1982 edition, p. 907&lt;/ref&gt; The word Kpelle is often used as an adjective to refer to someone as hard working and very humble people in Liberia and Guinea.

Traditionally, a Kpelle family consists of a man, his wives and his children. The household has been the usual farming unit, and all the family members participate in daily farming work. Young children learn how to farm and help the older family members with farm activities.

In their social structure, leadership was very crucial. Every Kpelle tribe used to have a chief who oversaw their own interests as well as the interests of the society. These chiefs were recognized by the national government. They used to act as mediators between the government and their own tribes. Each town also had its own chief. The chiefs act as liaisons for different groups in the society. Anthropologists such as Caroline Bledsoe have characterized Kpelle social organization as one premised on [[wealth in people]].

[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/kpelle.htm Their flight was due to internal conflicts between the tribes from the crumbling Sudanic empire.][[File:Raccolte Extraeuropee - AFR 00021 Bassani - Figura femminile Temne - Sierra Leone.jpg|thumb|Kpelle wood made structure]]

===Psychological research===
In intelligence research, the Kpelle people perform differently from Westerners on sorting tasks. While Westerners tend to take a taxonomic approach, the Kpelle take a more functional approach. For example, instead of grouping food and tools into separate categories, a Kpelle participant stated, "The knife goes with the orange because it cuts it" (Glick 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Glick, J. (1975). Cognitive development in cross-cultural perspective. Review of child development research, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Kpelle or Guerze lived in [[North Sudan]] during the sixteenth century, before fleeing to other parts of north west Africa into what is now Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/kpelle.htm|title=Kpelle|last=Fiske|first=Alan|website=www.sscnet.ucla.edu|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some migrated to Liberia, Mauritania, and Chad&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/kpelle.htm|title=Kpelle|last=Fiske|first=Alan|website=www.sscnet.ucla.edu|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They still maintained their traditional and cultural heritage despite their migration. A handful are still of Kpelle origin in North Sudan. They are mixed with the Nubians of the North Sudan where they remain a large minority.

Kpelle are also located in Mali and maintain their heritage. Some Arabs in Mali enslaved the Africans and took women as their concubines, with those descendants being of Kpelle admixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/kpelle.htm|title=Kpelle|last=Fiske|first=Alan|website=www.sscnet.ucla.edu|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kpelle also used to trade with the Muslim Vai and [[Mandingo Empire|Mandingo]] who live in small numbers in the country and reside nearby. The Kpelle trade with Lebanese merchants, U.S. missionaries and Peace Corps volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/kpelle.htm|title=Kpelle|last=Fiske|first=Alan|website=www.sscnet.ucla.edu|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurds in France''' may refer to people born in or residing in [[France]] of full or partial [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] origin.

There is a large Kurdish community in France, numbering around 150,000&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; people. This makes the Kurdish community in France the second largest Kurdish community in the Kurdish diaspora, after Germany.

In [[France]], Kurdish immigrant workers from [[Turkey]] first arrived in the second half of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="institutkurde.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institutkurde.org/en/kurdorama/|title=The Kurdish Diaspora|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Kurdish refugees and political refugees fled from Turkey during the 1970s and onward, from [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] during the 1980s and 1990s, and from [[Syria]] especially during the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="institutkurde.org"/&gt;

==Political activism==
In October 2014, Kurds in France and other European countries marched in protest over the [[ISIS]] offensive on the Syrian town of Ayn al-Arab, known in Kurdish as Kobani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.rfi.fr/europe/20141012-thousands-march-france-germany-austria-support-kurds-kobane|title=Thousands march in France, Germany, Austria to support Kobane Kurds|date=12 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/10/18/382739/kurds-hold-antiisil-rally-in-paris/|title=PressTV|website=www.presstv.ir|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both accused were sentenced to death, but Grans's sentence was reduced to 12 years in prison on retrial, in 1926.

This witness also claimed that one of the bodies was abandoned in a ditch, but the body found there did not belong to either of the sisters. All seven were sentenced to death, but the sentences were changed to life in prison when the Philippines abolished the [[death penalty]] in 2006.

| November 16, 1491
| Six [[converso]]s and two Jews were arrested by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and confessed under torture to have murdered a Christian child in La Guardia as part of a magic ritual; at least five were burned at an [[auto de fe]] in 1491. Because of constant contradictions and legal irregularities, the fact that the child was never named, no body was found, no child disappearance or murder was reported in La Guardia around that time, and obvious similarities with other European [[blood libel]]s and [[antisemitic]] legends, modern historians believe that neither crime nor child actually existed. It is believed that the process was a sham to incite the expulsion of all Jews from Spain, which was [[Alhambra decree|decreed]] four months later.

| A shepherd from nearby [[Tresjuncos]] who disappeared after an animal sale. His family accused local farm wardens Valero and Sánchez, who had a history of [[bullying]] Grimaldos, of murdering him to steal the money. The case was at first dismissed due to lack of evidence, but it was reopened in 1913 by a newly appointed [[examining magistrate]], Emilio Isasa Echenique. Under Isasa's watch, Valero and Sánchez were arrested and extrajudicially [[torture]]d to make them [[false confession|confess]]. No body was found and the accused ended up claiming that they had fed it to pigs, then burned and grinded all remains left. Each was sentenced to 18 years in prison. After Grimaldos was found alive in [[Mira, Spain|Mira]] in 1926, the [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] overturned the sentence and started proceedings against those responsible for the 1913 investigation. Isasa could not be judged because of his sudden death, officially attributed to a [[heart attack]] but suspected of being a [[suicide]].

| [[Chipping Campden]], [[England]]
| August 16, 1660
| Spring 1661
| A wealthy 70-year-old man last seen walking to Charingworth. After his hat, coat and neckband were found on the side of the road with a sharp cut and sprinkled in blood, his servant John Perry claimed that Perry's own brother and mother had murdered Harrison to rob him, and subsequently dumped the body in a pond. The pond was drained but no body was found. The Perrys then alternated between pleading guilt and innocence, until they were all found guilty and hanged. However, Harrison reappeared in 1662, claiming to have been abducted by [[Barbary pirates]]. It has been said that this case caused British courts to not give murder sentences without a body for the next 250 years.

Onufrejczyk, who had been previously denounced by Sykut for violence and was about to lose the farm as a result of legal action, offered wildly varying stories to explain his partner's sudden disappearance. He was convicted largely because of the finding of over 2000 blood stains in the passage leading from the farm's kitchen to the backyard, which Onufrejczyk claimed to be from rabbits he had skinned. Police believed that Onufrejczyk dismembered Sykut's body in the kitchen and fed the parts to the pigs. The ruling was cited as a precedent in later murder without a body cases in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/grisly-history-welsh-murders-2205058|title=A grisly history of Welsh murders|first=Nathan|last=Bevan|date=27 January 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| A Danish-American woman murdered by her husband, in a case popularly known as the "wood-chipper murder". It is believed Crafts had been beaten to death and was then dismembered, frozen and placed in a wood chipper aimed over a bridge. Fragments of a body were found, yet only a tooth with a filling as well as hair consistent with the victim's indicated the body was Crafts'. Despite this, the case is often referred to as a conviction without a body, as the remains could not be definitively proven to be that of Crafts.

| In 1980, Gina, who was 18 years of age, was attending summer school at [[Radford University]] in [[Radford, Virginia]], On June 28, Gina drove her sister's car to a nightspot in Blacksburg to go dancing. She left after a few hours with Epperly, who drove the car to a lake-front home on Claytor Lake in Pulaski County. Gina mistakenly believed that others in a group of friends at the nightspot were to follow. However, only she and Epperly went to the house. Police were notified when it was apparent that she was missing. They found her sister's car abandoned with the trunk lid up and large blood stains on the trunk carpet. When investigators searched the house, a large blood stain was on the den carpet and blood spatter was on several items in an adjacent utility room. It was assumed that Epperly beat Gina to death because she resisted his sexual advances. All of her clothing, with blood stains on her suit jacket, were eventually found, as were both of her shoes. Epperly, who denied killing Gina, was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, where he remains today. He was the first person in the State of Virginia to be convicted of murder without a body.&lt;ref&gt;See Supreme Court of Virginia opinion upholding Epperly's conviction, Epperly v.

The '''Lomwe''' (Lowe) language, ''Elomwe'', also known as '''Western Makua''', is the fourth-largest language in [[Mozambique]]. It belongs with [[Makhuwa language|Makua]] in the group of distinctive Bantu languages in the northern part of the country: The Makhuwa-using area proper (Nampula, etc.) is separated by a large Lomwe-speaking area from the related eChuwabo, although eMakhuwa neighbours eChuwabo in a more coastal zone. To the south, the rather more distantly related Sena (ChiSena) should be assigned to a group with Nyanja and Chewa, while the distinct group which includes Yao, Makonde and Mwera is found to the north.&lt;ref&gt;''Relatório do I Seminário sobre a Padronização da Ortografia de Línguas Moçambicanas, NELIMO, Maputo, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the regional variations found within eMakhuwa proper, eLomwe uses '''ch''' where '''tt''' appears in eMakhuwa orthography: for instance eMakhuwa '''mirette''' ("remedy") corresponds to eLomwe '''mirecce''', eMakhuwa '''murrutthu''' ("dead body") to eLomwe '''miruchu''', eMakhuwa '''otthapa''' ("joy") to eLomwe '''ochapa'''.

Unusual among Bantu languages is the infinitive of the verb with '''o-''' instead of the typically Bantu '''ku-''' prefix: '''omala''' (eMakhuwa) is "to finish", '''omeeela''' (also an eMakhuwa form) is "to share out".&lt;ref&gt;''Relatório'', as above.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[mutually unintelligible]] form containing elements of [[Chewa language|Chewa]], [[Malawian Lomwe]], is spoken in [[Malawi]]. Maho (2009) separates out Ngulu (Mihavane) as a separate language, close to [[Malawi Lomwe language|Malawi Lomwe]].&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;

During the [[Prohibition era]] of the 1920s and 1930s Kelly worked as a bootlegger for himself as well as a colleague.&lt;ref name="Flyer"/&gt; After a short time, and several run-ins with the local Memphis police, he decided to leave town and head west with his girlfriend. To protect his family and to escape law enforcement officers, he changed his name to George R. Kelly. &lt;ref name="Mattix2009"&gt;{{cite web |title=Machine Gun Kelly |url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/r/o/r/John-Davis-Rorer/FILE/0002page.html |publisher=Family Tree Genealogy |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to commit smaller crimes and bootlegging. He was arrested in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], for smuggling liquor onto an Indian Reservation in 1928 and sentenced to three years at [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth Penitentiary, Kansas]], beginning February 11, 1928. He was reportedly a model inmate and was released early. Shortly thereafter, Kelly married [[Kathryn Kelly|Kathryn Thorne]], an experienced criminal who purchased Kelly's first machine gun, insisted- despite his lack of interest in weapons- on target practice in the countryside, and went to great lengths to familiarize his name within underground crime circles.&lt;ref&gt;200 Texas Outlaws and Lawmen, 1835-1935, Laurence J.

[[File:Kathryn and George "Machine Gun" Kelly 1933.gif|right|thumb|George and Kathryn Kelly receive life sentences for the Urschel kidnapping, October 12, 1933.]]

Nonetheless, Kelly's last criminal activity &amp;ndash; the successful July 1933 kidnapping of wealthy [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] resident, [[Charles F. Urschel]] and his friend Walter R. Jarrett &amp;ndash; would become his undoing. The Kellys demanded a ransom of $200,000 (${{Inflation|US|0.2|1933|r=1|fmt=c}} million today), and held Urschel at the farm of Kathryn's mother and step-father.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/kidnappings/kathryn-kelly/|title=Kathryn Kelly – Crime Museum|work=Crime Museum|access-date=May 18, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urschel, having been blindfolded, made note of evidence of his experience including remembering background sounds, counting footsteps and leaving [[fingerprint]]s on surfaces in reach. This proved invaluable for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in its investigation, as agents concluded that Urschel had been held in [[Paradise, Texas]], based on sounds that Urschel remembered hearing while he was being held hostage.
[[File:M-gun Kelly hideout 1408 Rayner St Memphis TN 02.jpg|thumb|right|Machine Gun Kelly's hideout at 1408 Rayner Street in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] (2010).]]
An investigation conducted at Memphis disclosed that the Kellys were living at the residence of J. C. Tichenor. Special agents from [[Birmingham, Alabama]], were immediately dispatched to Memphis, where, in the early morning hours of September 26, 1933, a raid was conducted. George and Kathryn Kelly were taken into custody by FBI agents and Memphis police. Caught without a weapon, George Kelly allegedly cried, "Don't shoot, G-Men! Don't shoot, G-Men!" as he surrendered to FBI agents. The term, which had applied to all federal investigators, became synonymous with FBI agents. The couple was immediately removed to Oklahoma City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The FBI: A Centennial History, 1908-2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYyg2-lAWWAC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2008|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington, D. C.|isbn=978-0-16-080954-5|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest of the Kellys was overshadowed by the escape of ten inmates, including all of the members of the future [[John Dillinger|Dillinger gang]], from the penitentiary in [[Michigan City, Indiana]], that same night.&lt;ref name="FeeWebb2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fee|first1=Christopher R.|last2=Webb|first2=Jeffrey B.|title=American Myths, Legends, and Tall Tales: An Encyclopedia of American Folklore (3 Volumes)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXnEDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA310|date=31 August 2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-568-8|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 1933, George and Kathryn Kelly were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial was held at the [[United States Post Office, Courthouse, and Federal Office Building (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma)|Post Office, Courthouse and Federal Office Building]] in Oklahoma City.

An investigation in [[Coleman, Texas]], disclosed that the Kellys had been housed and protected by Cassey Earl Coleman and Will Casey, and that Coleman had assisted George Kelly in storing $73,250 of the Urschel ransom money on his ranch. This money was located by Bureau agents in the early morning hours of September 27 in a cotton patch on Coleman's ranch. They were both indicted at [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], on October 4, 1933, charged with harboring a fugitive and conspiracy, and on October 17, 1933, Coleman, after entering a plea of guilty, was sentenced to serve one year and one day, and Casey after trial and conviction, was sentenced to serve two years in the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.&lt;ref name="fbi100"&gt;{{cite web

The kidnapping of Urschel and the two trials that resulted were historic in several ways. They were: 
# the first federal criminal trials in the United States in which film cameras were allowed; 
# the first kidnapping trials after the passage of the so-called [[Federal Kidnapping Act|Lindbergh Law]], which made [[kidnapping]] a [[federal crime]]; 
# the first major case solved by [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s FBI; and 
# the first prosecution in which defendants were transported by airplane.

==Death==
[[File:Machine Gun Kelly's marker.jpg|thumb|His gravestone, marked "George B. Kelley".]]
Machine Gun Kelly spent his remaining 21 years in prison. During his time at [[Alcatraz]] he got the nickname "Pop Gun Kelly". This was in reference, according to a former prisoner, that Kelly was a model prisoner and was nowhere near the tough, brutal gangster his wife made him out to be. He spent 17 years on Alcatraz as inmate number 117, working in the prison industries, and boasting of and exaggerating his past escapades to other inmates, and was quietly transferred back to Leavenworth in 1951. He died of a heart attack at Leavenworth on July 18, 1954, his 59th birthday, and is buried at Cottondale Texas Cemetery with a small headstone marked "George B. Kelley 1954".&lt;ref name="wise2003"&gt;{{cite web|title=George "Machine Gun" Kelly |url=http://www.sheriff.co.wise.tx.us/machine_gun_kelley.htm |publisher=Wise County Sheriff's Department |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |year=2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927211319/http://www.sheriff.co.wise.tx.us/machine_gun_kelley.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathryn Kelly was released from prison in 1958 and lived in relative anonymity in Oklahoma under the assumed name "Lera Cleo Kelly" until her death in 1985 at the age of 81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kathryn Kelly - Crime Museum |url=http://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/kathryn-kelly/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Machine Gun Kelly and his crimes are portrayed in films such as ''[[Machine-Gun Kelly (film)|Machine-Gun Kelly]]'' (1958), ''[[The FBI Story]]'' (1959) and ''[[Melvin Purvis: G-Man]]'' (1974).

Crime novelist [[Ace Atkins]]' 2010 book ''Infamous'' is based on the Urschel kidnapping and George and Kathryn Kelly. Kelly is (along with [[Pretty Boy Floyd]] and [[Baby Face Nelson]]) one of the main characters of the comic book series ''[[Pretty, Baby, Machine]]''.

George and Kathryn Kelly were the inspiration for "Machine Gun Kelly" (1970), a song written by [[Danny Kortchmar|Danny "Kootch" Kortchmar]] and recorded by [[James Taylor]] on his 1971 album ''[[Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon]]''.  [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] is the stage name for an American rapper from [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

'''Malay Indonesians''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''orang Melayu Indonesia''; [[Jawi script]]: اورڠ ملايو ايندونيسيا) are [[Malays (ethnic group)|ethnic Malays]] living throughout [[Indonesia]] as one of the indigenous peoples of the [[Island country|island nation]]. Indonesia has the second largest ethnic Malay population after [[Malaysia]]. Historically, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], which is the national language of Indonesia, was derived from the [[Malay language]] spoken in the [[Riau Islands|Riau archipelago]], a province in eastern Sumatra. There were a number of Malay kingdoms in Indonesia that covered the islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Kalimantan]], such as [[Srivijaya]], [[Melayu Kingdom]], [[Sultanate of Deli]], [[Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura]], [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate]], [[Sultanate of Bulungan]], [[Pontianak Sultanate]], and the [[Sultanate of Sambas]].

==History==

===Sumatra===
There have been various Malay kingdoms based on the island of Sumatra: the [[Melayu Kingdom]], [[Srivijaya]], [[Sultanate of Deli]], [[Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura]] and the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate]].

===Kalimantan===
In the [[Pontianak incidents]] during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], the Japanese massacred most of the Malay elite and beheaded all of the Malay Sultans in Kalimantan.

During the [[Fall of Suharto]], there was a resurgence in Malay nationalism and identity in Kalimantan and ethnic Malays and [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] in Sambas massacred [[Madurese people|Madurese]] during the [[Sambas riots]].

==Language==

{{Main article|Malay language|Malayan languages|History of the Malay language}}
Sumatra is the homeland of the Malay languages, which today spans all corners of [[Insular Southeast Asia]]. The [[Indonesian language]] which is the country's official language and [[lingua franca]] was based on Riau-Lingga (or Johor-Riau) Malay. The Malay language has a long history, which has a literary record as far back as the 7th century AD. A famous early Malay inscription, the [[Kedukan Bukit Inscription]], was discovered by the Dutchman M. Batenburg on 29 November 1920, at Kedukan Bukit, South Sumatra, on the banks of the River Tatang, a tributary of the River Musi. It is a small stone of 45 by 80&amp;nbsp;cm. It is written in Old Malay, a possible ancestor of today's Malay language and its variants. Most Malay languages and dialects spoken in Indonesia are mutually unintelligible to Standard Indonesian. The most widely spoken are [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]] (3.2 million), [[Jambi Malay]] (1 million), [[Bengkulu language|Bengkulu Malay]] (1.6 million) and [[Banjar language|Banjarese]] (4 million) (although not considered to be a dialect of Malay by its speakers; its minor dialect is typically called Bukit Malay). Besides the proper Malay languages, there are several languages closely related to Malay such as [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]], [[Kerinci language|Kerinci]], [[Kubu language|Kubu]] and others. These languages are closely related to Malay, but their speakers do not consider their languages to be Malay. There are many [[Malay-based creoles]] spoken in the country especially in eastern Indonesia due to contacts from the western part of Indonesia and during colonial rule where Malay replaced Dutch as a lingua franca. The most well-known Malay creoles in Indonesia are [[Ambonese Malay]], [[Betawi language|Betawi]], [[Manado Malay]] and [[Papuan Malay]].

Majority of the Population follows [[Hindu]] religion.Some of the Malai Arayans turned their religious belief from their centuries-old "Mala Daivangal" (renegades and traditional Hindus following the hereditary regulations and customs are included in this group) to [[Christianity]], especially to [[Church of South India]].

'''Meanness''' is a personal quality whose classical form, discussed by many from [[Aristotle]] to [[Thomas Aquinas]], characterizes it as a [[vice]] of "lowness", but whose modern form deals more with [[cruelty]].

== Classical formulation ==
In his dictionary, [[Noah Webster]] defined meanness as "want of excellence", "want of rank", "low estate", "lowness of mind", and "sordidness, niggardliness, opposed to liberality or charitableness" pointing out that "meanness is very different from frugality".{{sfn|Webster|1832}}  These, in particular the final one, largely summarize the aspects of the classical definition of meanness that have been propounded by philosophers, Aristotelian and otherwise, over the centuries.

=== Aristotle ===
In his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', where each virtue is considered as a midway point on a continuum bracketed by two vices, Aristotle places meanness as one of the two vices that bracket the virtue of liberality/generosity.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=83}}  It is the deficiency of giving to or the excess of taking from others.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=86,88}}{{sfn|Holgate|1999|p=231}}  The other vice is prodigality (excess of giving to or deficiency of taking from), which Aristotle describes as both less common than meanness and less of a vice.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=234,102}}

Meanness can take many forms, as there are several ways in which one can deviate from the liberal/generous virtue.  It can be a desire for wealth with insufficient desire to benefit others; or a desire to benefit others suppressed by an excessive desire to keep what money one has; or the desire for too much wealth.  Aristotle said that "meanness we always impute to those who care more than they ought for wealth" and "there seem to be many kinds of meanness".{{sfn|Holgate|1999|p=231}}{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=99&amp;ndash;100}}

The translation of what Aristotle meant is not without problems.  Aristotle's actual word ''ἐλευθερία'' ([[eleutheria]]) corresponds with both liberality and freedom.  Its opposite, ''ανἐλευθερία'', is both meanness and servility.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=94}}  Philosophers such as Susanne E. Foster (in {{harvnb|Foster|1997}}) have attempted to reconcile these by explaining that the connotation is that meanness is enslavement by one's material possessions.  A slave has no possessions to give and is not the recipient of gifts from others; whereas a free person, in a gift-exchanging culture, can give and take freely.  Meanness, therefore, is the vice of a free person behaving, in such a culture, as a slave does.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=94}}

Another problem that has taxed philosophers analysing Aristotle is that the expected continuum (on which vices and a virtue lie) is from excess to deficiency; but Aristotle describes meanness as ''both'' excess (of taking from) ''and'' deficiency (of giving to).  Philosophers have attempted to explain this, and characterize what Aristotle was trying to say as an excess or a deficiency in some other form.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=101}}  Howard J. Curzer takes the view that in fact both were meant, and that it is "misguided" to ask whether Aristotelian meanness is excess or deficiency, because what constitutes excess and what constitutes deficiency "depends upon how the parameters are described" and is "purely a verbal matter".  Exactly which vice of the two that brackets a virtue is "excess" and which is "deficiency" is entirely arbitrary.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=101}}

Curzer also contends that Aristotle's statement that meanness is worse than prodigality is "a mistake", based upon an erroneous choice of exemplars of prodigality.  There are, in Curzer's contention "true prodigals", who are not merely young and foolish (as Aristotle would have prodigals be, and arguing thereby that youth and foolishness are curable &amp;mdash; the former by simple dint of growing old &amp;mdash; whereas meanness is not{{sfn|Holgate|1999|p=231}}) but "incurably wicked" and thus more proper exemplars of the vice, who demonstrate that it is just as much of a vice as meanness is.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=101}}

=== Aquinas ===
In his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' {{harv|Aquinas|loc=question 135}}, [[Thomas Aquinas]] explicitly cited Aristotle (as "The Philosopher") and held meanness &amp;mdash; ''parvificentia'' in his original Latin &amp;mdash; to be the opposite of magnificence (''magnificentia'').{{sfn|Davies|2014|p=271}}  Whilst a magnificent person is willing to pay for great projects and good causes, a mean person focuses upon penny-pinching and settles for small goals at the expense of great ones.{{sfn|Davies|2014|p=271}}

=== Others ===
[[Theodore Parker]], like Aristotle, opposed meanness and generosity, declaring meanness as an "unmanly and unwomanly vice".  He differentiated two forms of meanness: ''pecuniary meanness'', which is meanness in things measurable with money, and ''meanness of behaviour'', which is meanness in things not thus measurable.{{sfn|Parker|1872|p=114}}

[[George Crabb (writer)|George Crabb]] described meanness as "[w]hatever a man does in common with those below him" and that "evinces a temper that is prone to sink rather than rise in the scale of society".  He considered meanness to be only relatively bad, as what may constitute meanness for one person may be generosity or prudence for another.  Seeking to save or to gain for oneself at the expense of others, in particular with respect to what one can afford to pay, "is denominated a mean temper".{{sfn|Crabb|Hedley|1839|p=392}}

[[Henry Sidgwick]] in ''The Methods of Ethics'' held meanness to be both the opposite of liberality and generosity.{{sfn|Crisp|2015|p=183}} A mean person "chooses a trifling gain to himself rather than the avoidance of disappointment to others", and meanness is not injustice per se.{{sfn|Crisp|2015|p=183}}

== Modern view as cruelty ==
[[Samuel Johnson]] wrote in ''The False Alarm'' that "[a]n infallible characteristic of meanness is cruelty".{{sfn|Johnson|1770|p=49}} [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Linda Zagzebski]] stated that meanness is "an acquired defect" that is "opposed to kindness".{{sfn|Zagzebski|2015|p=256}}  These signifiy the modern view of meanness, which has concentrated upon cruelty, bullying, and remorselessness.

In the [[Psychopathy#Triarchic model|Triarchic Psychopathy Measure]], one of the several ways of defining what psychopathy is, meanness is one of the three components, an index of a person's "callous aggression".{{sfn|Patrick|2014|p=201}}  It is characterized as callous unemotionality, antagonism, coldheartedness, exploitativeness, remorselessness, and empowerment through cruelty; encompassing destructive acts, the inability to bond with other people, bullying, fight-picking, and other forms of active engagement against other people (in contrast to social withdrawal, which is a passive moving away from other people).{{sfn|Drislane|Patrick|2014|p=695}}{{sfn|Drislane|Venables|Patrick|2014|pp=110&amp;ndash;111}}

=== "Mean girls" ===

Many of these aspects of meanness &amp;mdash; namely empowerment, bullying, aggression, cruelty, and ruthlessness &amp;mdash; have been incorporated in the late 20th and early 21st century popular cultural concept of the "mean girl".{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=9&amp;ndash;10}}  Social science professor Valerie Walkerdine argues that "meanness is becoming a dominant motif for Western girlhood", as it fits well with the normative, repressive, boundaries of what is appropriate to modern femininity in work and school, and supports the narrative that empowered, successful, females cannot treat empowerment and success positively, but rather always risk slipping into cruelty.{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=10}}  With sociology professor Jessica Ringrose she contends that the "mean girl" stereotype from popular culture, as supported by what they criticise as "highly suspect" research in [[developmental psychology]], is being increasingly taken up by policy makers in education.{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=10}}  And that in turn, with things like the Hollywood movie ''[[Mean Girls]]'' being partly based upon the [[self-help]] book ''[[Queen Bees and Wannabes]]'' by [[Rosalind Wiseman]], feeds from psychology and pedagogy back into popular culture.{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=11}}

'''Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|میر نورالدین مینگل}}}}; 13 July 1952 – 13 October 2010) was a senior [[Baloch people|Baloch]] politician who was active in Balochistan's political scene for nearly four decades, from 1970 to 2010. He belonged to the famed [[Zagar Mengal]] tribe and was the nephew of the Baloch National Poet [[Mir Gul Khan Nasir]]. His father's name was [[Mir Lal Bakhsh Mengal]] and he had seven siblings. His mother was a prominent member of the Gichki family from Mekran.

==Early life==

Mir Noor-ud-din was named after Sardar Noordin Mengal (an uncle of Sardar Attaullah Mengal and a close friend of Mir Lal Baksh Mengal who died in a road traffic accident near Kalat). He was brought up in his hometown of [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]]. His father was a prominent tribal and political figure of Balochistan while his uncle [[Mir Gul Khan Nasir|Gul Khan Nasir]] belonged to the top tier Baloch leadership along with [[Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo]], [[Abdul Aziz Kurd]] and, later, [[Sardar Ataullah Khan Mengal]] and [[Khair Bux Marri]].&lt;ref&gt;Warsa i Nasiriyat p3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;All local newspapers of Balochistan dated 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this he was exposed to politics from a very early age. This exposure instilled a nascent sense of political awareness in him which, with age, kept growing.

Mengal passed high school from Kalat and after [[matriculating]] from [[Noshki]], enrolled in [[F.Sc]] [[Pre-Engineering]] in Government Science College, Quetta.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Balochistan National Party Movement published in memory of Mir Nooruddin Mengal Shaheed&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher education==

After he had finished college, [[Mir Gul Khan Nasir|Gul Khan Nasir]] advised Mengal to get into a university instead of just relying on a college degree. Following his uncle's advice, he applied to [[Peoples' Friendship University of Russia|Patrice Lumumba University]] and was accepted. Mengal had chosen a University in [[Moscow]] because at that time it was a very common practice for Baloch students to go to [[Russia]] in pursuit of a higher education but because of his political activities (which he had already begun by 1970 from [[Baloch Students Organization]]'s (BSO) platform) his name was put on the [[Exit Control List]] and he was unable to go.

With that door closed, Mengal applied for [[Mining Engineering]] at [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore]] in 1973 and was, once again, accepted. He spent four years in Lahore and graduated with a [[B.E]] Degree in 1977.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Politics==

Throughout his student life, Mengal had been active in politics and from 1974 to 1976 had served as BSO's Vice Chairman. During his time in Lahore he had opened sixteen units of BSO in different cities of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. After returning to Quetta he served a second term as the Vice Chairman of BSO from 1978 to 1980&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and while he managed to secure a job as a [[Mining Engineer]] in a private mining company, his political life remained dominant over his professional life. So much so, in fact, that he eventually quit his job to devote all his time and energy to politics.

[[File:Nooruddin Mengal as a student.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Nooruddin Mengal giving a speech in [[Lahore]] as the Vice Chairman of BSO. [[Mahmud Ali Kasuri]] (left) is sitting beside him.]]

After serving his second term as the Vice Chairman of BSO, he joined the political party of [[Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo]], The [[Pakistan National Party]]. After Mir Ghaus Bakhsh's death in August 1989, the leadership of the party shifted to [[Mir Bizen Bizenjo]] but he wasn't able to hold on to it for long. When Mir Bizen vacated the office of the Party President, PNP was thrown into turmoil. During this tumultuous time the position of Party Organizer was also vacant, so Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was named the Organizer of the Party. After successfully organizing the council session of PNP where [[Mir Hasil Bizenjo]] was named President, Mengal went back to being the Deputy Organizer of the Party while [[Raziq Bugti]] became the Organizer. A few months after this, in 1992, Mir Noor-ud-din was elected as the [[Vice President]] of PNP, an office he held until the merger of PNP with BNM in 1996.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

By 1996 it seemed that no single political party was able to represent the whole Province of Balochistan. In light of this discussions began between the leaders of Pakistan National Party and Baloch National Movement. Mengal played a central role in these talks and was pivotal in the merger of the two parties to form [[Balochistan National Party (Mengal)|Balochistan National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;BNP statement released in Daily Jang Quetta, Daily Express Quetta, Daily ustmaan Quetta and Daily Intekhab Quetta dated 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Mir Noor-ud-din was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee of BNP after the merger and held the position until his death in October 2010.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Mengal remained an active and loyal member of the BNP right up until his death. When the Balochistan National Party was split into two factions, i.e., BNP Awami which was a forward block led by [[Israr Zehri]], and BNP which was led by Akhtar Mengal, Mir Noor-ud-din remained in BNP proving his loyalty. He set up his political base in his hometown of Kalat and was arrested and persecuted for his political beliefs numerous times from 2000 to 2007 . In 2006, Balochistan National Party announced a Long March against, what they termed, the continued exploitation of the Baloch land and people by the Establishment especially during the dictatorship of General Pervez Musharaff. The long march was to start from Gwadar and culminate at Quetta. Before the long march could even begin, the Government launched a crackdown against the BNP Leaders. Party President [[Akhtar Mengal]] was the first to be arrested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balochistan.wordpress.com/bnp-long-march/ |title=News Updates About LONG MARCH &amp;#124; Balochistan National Party |publisher=Balochistan.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; triggering protests throughout Balochistan. After Akhtar Mengal's arrest Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was chosen as the Acting President of BNP. On 3 January 2007 he too was arrested while en route to [[Khuzdar]] to meet incarcerated party workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2007/01/05/top7.htm|title=Acting chief of BNP-M arrested|date=5 January 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political cases under 16 M.P.O were registered against him and he was put under physical remand in Quetta for a month after which he was shifted to Khuzdar Jail where he was detained for four more months.

After being released, Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal began preparing to take part in the upcoming 2008 elections. He submitted his papers for the National Assembly Seat from Kalat but the [[All Parties Democratic Movement]] (APDM, an alliance of several political parties against General Musharaff's regime) announced to boycott the elections&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007\11\25\story_25-11-2007_pg1_6 The Daily Times Pakistan 25 November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; and since BNP was also a part of APDM, therefore all the BNP candidates withdrew their candidacy.

Akhtar Mengal was released in 2008 after a change of regime and went to [[Dubai]] for treatment of a disease he had contracted while in detention. So in his absence the party was being run by [[Habib Jalib Baloch]], Dr [[Jahanzaib Jamaldini]] and Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal. In 2010 the BNP Leaders began receiving death threats and the threats were put into action for the first time when a BNP worker, Naseer Langove, was murdered in May 2010. A group named Baloch Musallah Difaee Tanzeem (Baloch Armed Defence Organization) claimed the responsibility for the murder and issued a statement claiming that their intended target had been Habib Jalib. On 14 July 2010 the shadow organization struck again, this time succeeding in assassinating Jalib in front of his house in Quetta. Only four days later another BNP Leader [[Haji Liaquat Mengal]] was assassinated near his house in [[Kalat, Pakistan|Kalat]].

==Assassination==

After the death of [[Habib Jalib Baloch|Habib Jalib]] Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was the man directing the affairs of Balochistan National Party in the absence of Akhtar Mengal&lt;ref&gt;http://news.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/front-page/bnpm-leader-shot-dead-in-kalat-400{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also one of the few top leaders of the party who wasn't keeping private security guards with him. On 13 October 2010 he had gone to the market in Kalat to get his Blood Pressure checked. As soon as he got back and turned his car into the gate of his house, unknown gunmen riding a motorcycle came up behind him and opened indiscriminate fire upon him. He was hit by three bullets; One in the neck and two in the back.&lt;ref name="thebalochhal1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thebalochhal.com/2010/10/top-bnp-leader-shot-dead-in-kalat/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916205810/http://www.thebalochhal.com/2010/10/top-bnp-leader-shot-dead-in-kalat/# |archive-date=16 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Jang Quetta 14th october, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He was immediately rushed to the local hospital but none of the doctors who were supposed to be on duty were there. Mengal was sent to Quetta without being given basic first aid. He died on the way to Quetta due to profuse bleeding. He had been conscious for nearly 75 minutes after being shot. As the news of his death spread in Balochistan, the traffic began thinning on the roads from the fear of riots erupting. Mengal was buried beside his father's grave in Kalat the same evening. Hundreds of people flocked to attend his funeral.&lt;ref name="thebalochhal1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Intekhab Quetta 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/front-page/bnpm-leader-shot-dead-in-kalat-400{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Daily Dawn Karachi 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

His death was assailed by all the local and national political parties such as the [[Pakistan National Party]], the [[Awami National Party]], [[Pakhtun-khwa Milli Awami Party]], [[Balochistan National Party (Mengal)|Balochistan National Party]], [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz]], [[Pakistan Muslim League (Q)|Pakistan Muslim League Quaid-i Azam]], the [[Baloch National Front]], [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]] and the [[Pakistan People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;All the newspapers of Quetta dated 14 and 15 October 2010. Including Daily Jang, Daily Intekhab, Daily Express, Daily Mashriq&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 and 15 October all the main cities of Balochistan remained closed to mourn Mengal's death. Strikes were also observed on the National Highway by BNP and BNF over Mir Noor-ud-din's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2010%5C10%5C17%5Cstory_17-10-2010_pg3_1|title=Daily Times|website=Daily Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hendersonmüll.jpg|thumb|300px|Plastic waste on [[Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)|Henderson Island]]]]

'''Plastic pollution''' is the accumulation of [[plastic]] objects(e.g.: plastic bottles and much more) in the Earth's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] that adversely affects [[wildlife]], [[wildlife habitat]] and  humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1589019/plastic-pollution |title=Plastic pollution |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/06/plastic-planet-waste-pollution-trash-crisis |title=We Depend on Plastic.

M. (editors) (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=TCfYfIDymd8C&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marine Pollution and Human Health]. Royal Society of Chemistry. pp. 84-85. {{ISBN|184973240X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of [[environmental degradation|degradation]] and as a result they are slow to degrade.&lt;ref name="Plastic Pollution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plastic-pollution.org/|title=When The Mermaids Cry: The Great Plastic Tide|last1=Le Guern|first1=Claire|date=March 2018|website=Coastal Care|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405071834/http://plastic-pollution.org/|archive-date=5 April 2018|dead-url=no|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic [[pollution]] in the environment.

Plastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans. Living organisms, particularly [[marine animals]], can be harmed either by mechanical effects, such as entanglement in plastic objects or problems related to ingestion of plastic waste, or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that interfere with their physiology. Humans are also affected by plastic pollution, such as through disruption of various [[hormone|hormonal]] mechanisms.

As of 2018, about 380 million tons of plastic is produced worldwide each year. From the 1950s up to 2018, an estimated 6.3 billion tons of plastic has been produced worldwide, of which an estimated 9% has been recycled and another 12% has been incinerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The known unknowns of plastic pollution |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21737498-so-far-it-seems-less-bad-other-kinds-pollution-about-which-less-fuss-made |accessdate=17 June 2018 |publisher=The Economist |date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK alone, more than 5 million tonnes of plastic are consumed each year, of which only an estimated one-quarter is recycled, with the remainder going to landfills.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} This large amount of plastic waste inevitably enters the environment{{fact|date=October 2018}}, with studies suggesting that the bodies of 90% of seabirds contain plastic debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://globalnomadic.com/turning-rubbish-into-money-environmental-innovation-leads-the-way/|title=Turning rubbish into money – environmental innovation leads the way|first=Global|last=Nomadic|publisher=|date=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plasticizer" /&gt; In some areas there have been significant efforts to reduce the prominence of plastic pollution, through reducing plastic consumption and promoting [[plastic recycling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.02.014|title = A call for Canada to move toward zero plastic waste by reducing and recycling single-use plastics| journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling| volume=133| pages=99–100|year = 2018|last1 = Walker|first1 = Tony R.| last2=Xanthos| first2=Dirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by weight.&lt;ref name="Sutter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/12/world/sutter-vanishing-help/|title=How to stop the sixth mass extinction |first=John D. |last=Sutter |date=12 December 2016|work=CNN|accessdate= 18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of plastic debris==
There are three major forms of plastic that contribute to plastic pollution: [[microplastics]] as well as mega- and macro-plastics. Mega- and micro plastics have accumulated in highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, concentrated around urban centers and water fronts. Plastic can be found off the coast of some islands because of currents carrying the debris. Both mega- and macro-plastics are found in packaging, footwear, and other domestic items that have been washed off of ships or discarded in landfills. Fishing-related items are more likely to be found around remote islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0025-326X(96)00053-7|title = Marine debris surveys at Bird Island, South Georgia 1990–1995| journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin| volume=34| pages=61–65|year = 1997|last1 = Walker|first1 = T.R.| last2=Reid| first2=K.| last3=Arnould| first3=J.P.Y.| last4=Croxall| first4=J.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; These may also be referred to as micro-, meso-, and macro debris.

Plastic debris is categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary plastics are in their original form when collected. Examples of these would be [[bottle cap]]s, [[cigarette butt]]s, and [[microbead]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2016.02.025|title = A Canadian policy framework to mitigate plastic marine pollution| journal=Marine Policy| volume=68| pages=117–122|year = 2016|last1 = Pettipas|first1 = Shauna| last2=Bernier| first2=Meagan| last3=Walker| first3=Tony R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary plastics, on the other hand, account for smaller plastics that have resulted from the degradation of primary plastics.&lt;ref name="Driedger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Driedger|first1=Alexander G.J.|last2=Dürr|first2=Hans H.|last3=Mitchell|first3=Kristen|last4=Van Cappellen|first4=Philippe|title=Plastic debris in the Laurentian Great Lakes: A review|journal=Journal of Great Lakes Research|date=March 2015|volume=41|issue=1|pages=9–19|doi=10.1016/j.jglr.2014.12.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microdebris===
{{Main|Microplastics}}
Microdebris are plastic pieces between 2&amp;nbsp;mm and 5&amp;nbsp;mm in size.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Plastic debris that starts off as meso- or macrodebris can become microdebris through degradation and collisions that break it down into smaller pieces.&lt;ref name="plastics in marine environment"/&gt; Microdebris is more commonly referred to as [[Nurdle (bead)|nurdles]].&lt;ref name="plastics in marine environment"/&gt; Nurdles are recycled to make new plastic items, but they easily end up released into the environment during production because of their small size. They often end up in ocean waters through rivers and streams.&lt;ref name="plastics in marine environment"/&gt; Microdebris that come from cleaning and cosmetic products are also referred to as scrubbers. Because microdebris and scrubbers are so small in size, [[filter feeder|filter-feeding organisms]] often consume them.&lt;ref name="plastics in marine environment"/&gt;

Primary microplastics, a type of microdebris, known as Nurdles enter the ocean by means of spills during transportation or from land based sources. These micro-plastics can accumulate in the oceans and allow for the accumulation of Persistent Bio-accumulating Toxins such as DDT and PCB's which are hydrophobic in nature and can cause adverse health affects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nurdlehunt.org.uk/whats-the-problem/small-plastics.html|title=Small, Smaller, Microscopic!|last=User|first=Super|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study by Richard Thompson from the University of Plymouth, UK, found a great amount of microdebris on the [[beach pollution|beaches]] and waters in Europe, the Americas, Australia, Africa, and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="Plastic Pollution"/&gt; Thompson and his associates found that plastic pellets from both domestic and industrial sources were being broken down into much smaller plastic pieces, some having a diameter smaller than human hair.&lt;ref name="Plastic Pollution"/&gt; If not ingested, this microdebris floats instead of being absorbed into the marine environment. Thompson predicts there may be 300,000 plastic items/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of sea surface and 100,000 plastic particles/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of seabed.&lt;ref name="Plastic Pollution"/&gt; International pellet watch collected samples of polythene pellets from 30 beaches from 17 countries which were then analysed for organic micro-pollutants. It was found that pellets found on beaches in America, Vietnam and southern Africa contained compounds from pesticides suggesting a high use of pesticides in the areas.&lt;ref&gt;Otaga, Y.

===Macrodebris===
Plastic debris is categorized as macrodebris when it is larger than 20&amp;nbsp;mm. These include items such as plastic grocery bags.&lt;ref name="plastics in marine environment"/&gt; Macrodebris are often found in ocean waters, and can have a serious impact on the native organisms. Fishing nets have been prime pollutants. Even after they have been abandoned, they continue to trap marine organisms and other plastic debris. Eventually, these abandoned nets become too difficult to remove from the water because they become too heavy, having grown in weight up to 6 tons.&lt;ref name="plastics in marine environment"/&gt;

==Decomposition of plastics==
Plastics themselves contribute to approximately 10% of discarded waste. Many kinds of plastics exist depending on their precursors and the method for their polymerization. Depending on their chemical composition, plastics and resins have varying properties related to contaminant [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[adsorption]]. [[Polymer degradation]] takes much longer as a result of saline environments and the cooling effect of the sea. These factors contribute to the persistence of plastic debris in certain environments.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Recent studies have shown that plastics in the ocean decompose faster than was once thought, due to exposure to sun, rain, and other environmental conditions, resulting in the release of toxic chemicals such as [[bisphenol A]]. However, due to the increased volume of plastics in the ocean, decomposition has slowed down.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chemical Society|first1=American|title=Plastics In Oceans Decompose, Release Hazardous Chemicals, Surprising New Study Says|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090819234651.htm|website=Science Daily|publisher=Science Daily|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marine Conservancy has predicted the decomposition rates of several plastic products. It is estimated that a foam [[plastic cup]] will take 50 years, a plastic beverage holder will take 400 years, a [[disposable nappy]] will take 450 years, and [[fishing line]] will take 600 years to degrade.&lt;ref name="Plastic Pollution"/&gt;

==Persistent organic pollutants==
It was estimated that global production of plastics is approximately 250 mt/yr. Their abundance has been found to transport [[persistent organic pollutant]]s, also known as POPs. These pollutants have been linked to an increased distribution of algae associated with [[red tide]]s.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barnes|first1=D. K.

&lt;!--
The following chemicals are commonly found in plastics:
*[[Bisphenol A]]: (4,4'-(propane-2,2-diyl)diphenol) is a large component of polycarbonate plastics and of the epoxy resin coating of metal cans. It can act as a synthetic estrogen, disrupting a plethora of biological pathways. Prolonged exposure can be detrimental to a person's health, resulting in disorder and illness such as premature puberty, ADHD, heart disease, and cancer.&lt;ref name="bpa invisible pollution"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Groff|first1=Tricia|title=Bisphenol A: invisible pollution|journal=Current Opinion in Pediatrics|date=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=524-529|doi=10.1097/MOP.0b013e32833b03f8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Phthalates]]: (1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid) are found in many plastics and [[plasticizer]]s at a high quantity, in order to make them more malleable.&lt;ref name="plastics and health risks"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halden|first1=Rolf U.|title=Plastics and Health Risks|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|date=March 2010|volume=31|issue=1|pages=179–194|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.012809.103714|pmid=20070188}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Diisononyl phthalate]]: is used as a plasticizer to give polycinyl chloride (PVC) products flexibility.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilkinson|first1=CF|last2=Lamb JC|first2=4th|title=The potential health effects of phthalate esters in children's toys: a review and risk assessment.|journal=Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology: RTP|date=October 1999|volume=30|issue=2 Pt 1|pages=140-55|pmid=10536109|accessdate=14 March 2015|doi=10.1006/rtph.1999.1338}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dioxin]]: is a common additive also found in PVC plastic.&lt;ref name="Breast Cancer Fund"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chemicals in Plastics|url=http://www.breastcancerfund.org/clear-science/environmental-breast-cancer-links/plastics/|website=Breast Cancer Fund|publisher=Breast Cancer Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Styrene]]: is commonly found in food trays, egg cartons, and [[Styrofoam]] products.&lt;ref name="Breast Cancer Fund"/&gt;
*[[Vinyl Chloride]]: is also used in the manufacture of [[PVC]] and was one of the first to be declared as a human carcinogen by the [[National Toxicology Program]] and [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]].&lt;ref name="Breast Cancer Fund"/&gt;--&gt;

==Effects on the environment==
The distribution of plastic debris is highly variable as a result of certain factors such as wind and ocean currents, coastline geography, urban areas, and trade routes. Human population in certain areas also plays a large role in this. Plastics are more likely to be found in enclosed regions such as the Caribbean. It serves as a means of distribution of organisms to remote coasts that are not their native environments. This could potentially increase the variability and dispersal of organisms in specific areas that are less biologically diverse. Plastics can also be used as vectors for chemical contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

===Land===
[[Chlorinated]] plastic can release harmful chemicals into the surrounding soil, which can then seep into [[groundwater]] or other surrounding water sources and also the ecosystem of the world.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Aggarwal,Poonam; (et al.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8_d2Wkgq_rYC&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Interactive Environmental Education Book VIII]. Pitambar Publishing. p. 86. {{ISBN|8120913736}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can cause serious harm to the species that drink the water.

[[Landfill]] areas contain many different types of plastics. In these landfills, there are many [[microorganism]]s which speed up the biodegradation of plastics. The microorganisms include bacteria such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', [[nylon-eating bacteria]], and [[Flavobacteria]]. These bacteria break down nylon through the activity of the [[nylonase]] enzyme.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Breakdown of [[biodegradable plastic]]s releases [[methane]], a very powerful [[greenhouse gas]] that contributes significantly to [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=are-biodegradeable-plastics-doing-m-11-06-05 |title=Are Biodegradeable Plastics Doing More Harm Than Good? |publisher=Scientific American |date=5 June 2011 |accessdate=1 August 2013 |author=Biello, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceans===
{{See also|Marine pollution#Plastic debris}}

In 2012, it was estimated that there was approximately 165 million tons of plastic pollution in the world's oceans.&lt;ref name="Knight3"/&gt; One type of plastic that is of concern in terms of ocean plastic pollution is [[plastic particle water pollution|nurdles]]. Nurdles are manufactured plastic pellets (a type of [[microplastics|microplastic]]) used in the creation of plastic products and are often shipped via [[cargo ship]].&lt;ref name="Knight2"&gt;Knight 2012, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Many billions of nurdles are spilled into oceans each year, and it has been estimated that globally, around 10% of beach litter consists of nurdles.&lt;ref name="Knight2"/&gt; Plastics in oceans typically degrade within a year, but not entirely. In the process, toxic chemicals such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[polystyrene]] can [[leachate|leach]] into waters from some plastics.&lt;ref name="Knight3"&gt;Knight 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Polystyrene pieces and nurdles are the most common types of plastic pollution in oceans, and combined with [[plastic bag]]s and food containers make up the majority of oceanic debris.&lt;ref name="Knight4"&gt;Knight 2012, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

One study estimated that there are more than 5 trillion plastic pieces (defined into the four classes of small microplastics, large microplastics, meso- and macroplastics) afloat at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eriksen|first1=Marcus|title=Plastic Pollution in the World's Oceans: More than 5 Trillion Plastic Pieces Weighing over 250,000 Tons Afloat at Sea|journal=PLOS ONE|date=10 December 2014|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0111913|volume=9|issue=12|pages=e111913|pmid=25494041|pmc=4262196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The litter that is being delivered into the oceans is toxic to marine life, and humans. The toxins that are components of plastic include diethylhexyl phthalate, which is a toxic [[carcinogen]], as well as lead, cadmium, and mercury.

Plankton, fish, and ultimately the human race, through the food chain, ingest these highly toxic carcinogens and chemicals. Consuming the fish that contain these toxins can cause an increase in cancer, immune disorders, and birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=Esteve|last2=Chatenoud|first2=Liliane|date=1 July 1999|title=Fish consumption and cancer risk|doi=10.1093/ajcn/70.1.85|pmid=10393143|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=70| issue = 1|pages=85–90|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the litter near and in the ocean is made up of plastics and is a persistent pervasive source of marine pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T. R. (2018). Drowning in debris: Solutions for a global pervasive marine pollution problem. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 126, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Marcus Eriksen of The [[5 Gyres]] Institute, there are 5.25 trillion particles of plastic pollution that weigh as much as 270,000 tons (2016). This plastic is taken by the ocean currents and accumulates in large vortexes known as [[ocean gyre]]s. The majority of the gyres become pollution dumps filled with plastic.

====Sources of ocean-based plastic pollution====
Almost 20% of plastic debris that pollutes ocean water, which translates to 5.6 million tons, comes from ocean-based sources. Merchant ships expel cargo, [[sewage]], used medical equipment, and other types of waste that contain plastic into the ocean. Naval and research vessels eject waste and military equipment that are deemed unnecessary. Pleasure crafts release fishing gear and other types of waste, either accidentally or through negligent handling. The largest ocean-based source of plastic pollution is discarded fishing gear (including traps and nets), estimated to be up to 90% of plastic debris in some areas.&lt;ref name="plastics in marine environment"/&gt;

Continental plastic [[litter]] enters the ocean largely through storm-water runoff, flowing into watercourses or directly discharged into coastal waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cozar|first1=Andres|title=Plastic debris in the open ocean|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/28/10239.full|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=28|pages=10239–10244|accessdate=4 December 2017|doi=10.1073/pnas.1314705111|pmid=24982135|pmc=4104848|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic in the ocean has been shown to follow ocean currents which eventually form into what is known as Great Garbage Patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Pacific Garbage Patch|url=https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/info/patch.html|website=Marine debris program|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=4 December 2017|date=2013-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the routes that plastic follows in ocean currents comes from accidental container drops from ship carriers. For example, in May 1990 The [[Hansa Carrier]], sailing from Korea to the United States, broke apart due to a storm, ultimately resulting in thousands of dumped shoes; these eventually started showing up on the U.S western coast, and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ocean Currents|url=http://www.seos-project.eu/modules/oceancurrents/oceancurrents-c01-p02.html|website=SEOS|publisher=SEOS|accessdate=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of plastic pollution accumulating in the oceans is estimated at over five trillion pieces floating in the waters. This paper provides an overview of the amount of plastic pollution in the world’s waterways, and why it is there. Researching credible sources on this topic aided in answering the research question: 
“what would it take to reduce the amount of plastic in the ocean?” 
The findings suggest businesses to replace 50%, or more, of their common plastic products with biodegradable, or compostable, items because of the following:
The main type of plastic being used by businesses is petroleum-based plastics. Businesses should switch to compostable items which break down within 90 days and do not leave a toxic residue (EPA, 2018a). The effect of plastic waste in the ocean has a negative impact on animal life, as well as, the coral reefs. The oceans are filled with harmful plastics which are being digested and entangled by sea life on a daily basis (Dissanayake, 2016). Single-use items are contributing to the amount of plastic found in the five ocean gyres. There were over 260,000 tons of plastic debris in the ocean in 2013 (Eriksen et al., 2014). The problem with single-use items is the waste it involves. While it is very convenient to the consumer and provider to have access to disposable items, it poses a significant problem in landfills and waterway volumes. Industrialized countries need to take aggressive action on the types of plastic being used, or evoke a monetary discipline (Dissanayake, 2016). By creating legislative mandates for recycling, ocean life may be able to thrive, and human life may be able to improve from a healthier environment.
Using existing resources to convert from petroleum-based plastics to bioplastics. These conclusions identified a potential solution in reducing plastic pollution. With education and awareness, people can begin to clean the rivers and waters, and make them a safe place for sea animals to live.

====Land-based sources of ocean plastic pollution====
Estimates for the contribution of land-based plastic vary widely. While one study estimated that a little over 80% of plastic debris in ocean water comes from land-based sources, responsible for {{convert|0.8|e6t}} every year.&lt;ref name="plastics in marine environment"/&gt; In 2015, Jambeck et al. calculated that {{convert|275|e6t}} of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to {{convert|12.7|e6t}} entering the ocean - a percentage of only up to 5%.&lt;ref name="Jambeck2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jambeck | first=J. R. | last2=Geyer | first2=R. | last3=Wilcox | first3=C. | last4=Siegler | first4=T. R. | last5=Perryman | first5=M. | last6=Andrady | first6=A. | last7=Narayan | first7=R. | last8=Law | first8=K.

In a study published by ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Jambeck ''et al'' (2015) estimated that the 10 largest emitters of oceanic plastic pollution worldwide are, from the most to the least, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jambeck |first1=Jenna R. |last2=Geyer |first2=Roland |last3=Wilcox |first3=Chris |title=Plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean |journal=Science |date=12 February 2015 |volume=347 |issue=6223 |page=769 |url=https://www.iswa.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Calendar_2011_03_AMERICANA/Science-2015-Jambeck-768-71__2_.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A source that has caused concern is [[landfills]]. Most waste in the form of plastic in landfills are [[single-use]] items such as [[packaging]]. Discarding plastics this way leads to accumulation.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Although disposing of plastic waste in landfills has less of a gas emission risk than disposal through incineration, the former has space limitations. Another concern is that the liners acting as protective layers between the landfill and environment can break, thus leaking toxins and contaminating the nearby soil and water.&lt;ref name="plastics environ health"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=North|first1=Emily J.|last2=Halden|first2=Rolf U.|title=Plastics and environmental health: the road ahead|journal=Reviews on Environmental Health|date=1 January 2013|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1515/reveh-2012-0030|pmid=23337043|pmc=3791860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landfills located near oceans often contribute to ocean debris because content is easily swept up and transported to the sea by wind or small waterways like rivers and streams. [[Marine debris]] can also result from sewage water that has not been efficiently treated, which is eventually transported to the ocean through rivers. Plastic items that have been improperly discarded can also be carried to oceans through storm waters.&lt;ref name="plastics in marine environment"/&gt;

====Plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean====
[[File:North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone.jpg|thumb|North Pacific Subtropical Convergence Zone]]
{{Main|Great Pacific garbage patch}}
In the [[ocean gyre|Pacific Gyre]], specifically 20°N-40°N latitude, large bodies with floating marine debris can be found.&lt;ref name="debris north pacific"&gt;{{cite web |title=Marine Debris in the North Pacific A Summary of Existing Information and Identification of Data Gaps|url=http://www.epa.gov/region9/marine-debris/pdf/MarineDebris-NPacFinalAprvd.pdf|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency|date=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models of wind patterns and ocean currents indicate that the plastic waste in the northern Pacific is particularly dense where the Subtropical Convergence Zone (STCZ), 23°N-37°N latitude, meets a southwest-northeast line, found north of the [[Hawaiian archipelago]].&lt;ref name="debris north pacific"/&gt;

In the Pacific, there are two mass buildups: the western garbage patch and the eastern garbage patch, the former off the coast of Japan and the latter between [[Hawaii]] and [[California]]. The two garbage patches are both part of the [[great Pacific garbage patch]], and are connected through a section of plastic debris off the northern coast of the [[Hawaiian islands]]. It is approximated that these garbage patches contain 100 million tons of debris.&lt;ref name="debris north pacific"/&gt; The waste is not compact, and although most of it is near the surface of the pacific, it can be found up to more than 100 feet deep in the water.&lt;ref name="debris north pacific"/&gt;

Research published in April 2017&lt;ref name="2017-05-09_PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1619818114|pmid=28507128|pmc=5468685|title=Exceptional and rapid accumulation of anthropogenic debris on one of the world's most remote and pristine islands|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=114|issue=23|pages=6052–6055|year=2017|last1=Lavers|first1=Jennifer L.|last2=Bond|first2=Alexander L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported "the highest density of plastic rubbish anywhere in the world" on remote and uninhabited [[Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands)|Henderson Island]] in South Pacific as a result of the [[South Pacific Gyre]].

===Plastic pollution in tap water===
A 2017 study found that 83% of [[tap water]] samples taken around the world contained plastic pollutants.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://orbmedia.org/stories/Invisibles_plastics|title=Invisibles|website=orbmedia.org|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://orbmedia.org/stories/Invisibles_final_report|title=Synthetic Polymer Contamination in Global Drinking Water|website=orbmedia.org|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first study to focus on global drinking water pollution with plastics,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-09-plastic.html|title=Your tap water may contain plastic, researchers warn (Update)|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and showed that with a contamination rate of 94%, tap water in the [[United States]] was the most polluted, followed by [[Lebanon]] and [[India]]. [[Europe]]an countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]] and [[France]] had the lowest contamination rate, though still as high as 72%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This means that people may be ingesting between 3,000 and 4,000 microparticles of plastic from tap water per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The analysis found particles of more than 2.5 microns in size, which is 2500 times bigger than a [[Nanometre|nanometer]]. It is currently unclear if this contamination is affecting human health, but if the water is also found to contain nano-particle pollutants, there could be adverse impacts on human well-being, according to scientists associated with the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/06/plastic-fibres-found-tap-water-around-world-study-reveals|title=Plastic fibres found in tap water around the world, study reveals|last=editor|first=Damian Carrington Environment|date=5 September 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=15 September 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, plastic tap water pollution remains under-studied, as are the links of how pollution transfers between humans, air, water, and soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4928759/plastic-fiber-tap-water-study/|title=Plastic Fibers Are Found in '83% of the World's Tap Water'|last=Lui|first=Kevin|website=Time|access-date=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on animals==
Plastic pollution has the potential to poison animals, which can then adversely affect human food supplies.&lt;ref name="Chiras"&gt;Daniel D. Chiras (2004).

Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning. pp. 517-518. {{ISBN|0763735698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight 2012, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic pollution has been described as being highly detrimental to large [[marine mammal]]s, described in the book ''Introduction to Marine Biology'' as posing the "single greatest threat" to them.&lt;ref&gt;Karleskint, George; (et al.) (2009).[https://books.google.com/books?id=0JkKOFIj5pgC&amp;pg=PA536#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Introduction to Marine Biology]. Cengage Learning. p. 536. {{ISBN|0495561975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some marine species, such as [[sea turtle]]s, have been found to contain large proportions of plastics in their stomach.&lt;ref name="Chiras"/&gt; When this occurs, the animal typically starves, because the plastic blocks the animal's digestive tract.&lt;ref name="Chiras"/&gt;  Sometimes Marine mammals are entangled in plastic products such as nets, which can harm or kill them.&lt;ref name="Chiras"/&gt;

===Entanglement===
[[File:Sea turtle entangled in a ghost net.jpg|thumb|[[Sea turtle]] entangled in a ghost net]]

Entanglement in plastic debris has been responsible for the deaths of many marine organisms, such as fish, [[pinniped|seal]]s, [[sea turtle|turtles]], and [[sea bird|birds]]. These animals get caught in the debris and end up [[suffocating]] or [[drowning]]. Because they are unable to untangle themselves, they also die from [[starvation]] or from their inability to escape predators.&lt;ref name="plastics in marine environment"/&gt; Being entangled also often results in severe lacerations and ulcers. In a 2006 report known as ''Plastic Debris in the World's Oceans'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/plastic_ocean_report/|title=Plastic Debris in the World's Oceans|website=Greenpeace International|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was estimated that at least 267 different animal species have suffered from entanglement and ingestion of plastic debris.&lt;ref name="Plastic Pollution"/&gt; It has been estimated that over 400,000 marine mammals perish annually due to plastic pollution in oceans.&lt;ref name="Chiras"/&gt; Marine organisms get caught in discarded fishing equipment, such as [[ghost net]]s. Ropes and nets used to fish are often made of synthetic materials such as nylon, making fishing equipment more durable and buoyant. These organisms can also get caught in circular plastic packaging materials, and if the animal continues to grow in size, the plastic can cut into their flesh. Equipment such as nets can also drag along the seabed, causing damage to coral reefs.&lt;ref name="env implications"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gregory|first1=M.

[[Sea turtle]]s are affected by plastic pollution. Some species are consumers of [[jelly fish]], but often mistake [[plastic bag]]s for their natural prey. This plastic debris can kill the sea turtle by obstructing the [[oesophagus]].&lt;ref name="env implications"/&gt; So too are [[whale]]s; large amounts of plastics have been found in the stomachs of [[cetacean stranding|beached whales]]&lt;ref name="env implications"/&gt; In June 2018, more than 80 plastic bags were found inside a dying [[pilot whale]] that washed up on the shores of Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=June 2, 2018 |title=Whale dies from eating more than 80 plastic bags|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/03/whale-dies-from-eating-more-than-80-plastic-bags|work= [[The Guardian]]|location= |access-date=June 17, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the tiniest bits of plastic are being consumed by small fish, in a part of the [[pelagic zone]] in the ocean called the ''[[Mesopelagic zone]]'', which is 200 to 1000 metres below the ocean surface, and completely dark. Not much is known about these fish, other than that there are many of them. They hide in the darkness of the ocean, avoiding predators and then swimming to the ocean's surface at night to feed.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, L. (2014). New Map Reveals Extent of Ocean Plastic. National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt; Plastics found in the stomachs of these fish were collected during [[Malaspina Expedition 2010|''Malaspina's circumnavigation'']], a research project that studies the impact of global change on the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez-Armesto, F. (2006). Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Scripps Institution of Oceanography showed that the average plastic content in the stomachs of 141 mesopelagic fish over 27 different species was 9.2%. Their estimate for the ingestion rate of plastic debris by these fish in the North Pacific was between 12000 and 24000 tons per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.05.032| pmid=21700298|title = Small plastic debris changes water movement and heat transfer through beach sediments| journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin| volume=62| issue=8| pages=1708–1713|year = 2011|last1 = Carson|first1 = Henry S.| last2=Colbert| first2=Steven L.| last3=Kaylor| first3=Matthew J.| last4=McDermid| first4=Karla J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular [[pelagic fish|mesopelagic fish]] is the [[lantern fish]]. It resides in the central [[ocean gyre]]s, a large system of rotating ocean currents. Since lantern fish serve as a primary food source for the fish that consumers purchase, including tuna and swordfish, the plastics they ingest become part of the food chain. The lantern fish is one of the main bait fish in the ocean, and it eats large amounts of plastic fragments, which in turn will not make them nutritious enough for other fish to consume.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, C. J. (2014) Choking the Oceans with Plastic. New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deep sea]] animals have been found with plastics in their stomachs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Taylor|first=Matthew|date=15 November 2017 |title=Plastics found in stomachs of deepest sea creatures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/15/plastics-found-in-stomachs-of-deepest-sea-creatures|work=The Guardian |location= |access-date= 16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birds====
Plastic pollution does not only affect animals that live solely in oceans. [[Seabird]]s are also greatly affected. In 2004, it was estimated that [[gull]]s in the [[North Sea]] had an average of thirty pieces of plastic in their stomachs.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Marquita K. (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=A-zaEGx_Y8cC&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Understanding Environmental Pollution]. Cambridge University Press. p. 257. {{ISBN|1139486403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seabirds often mistake trash floating on the ocean's surface as prey. Their food sources often has already ingested plastic debris, thus transferring the plastic from prey to predator. Ingested trash can obstruct and physically damage a bird's digestive system, reducing its digestive ability and can lead to malnutrition, starvation, and death. Toxic chemicals called ''[[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s'' (PCBs) also become concentrated on the surface of plastics at sea and are released after seabirds eat them. These chemicals can accumulate in body tissues and have serious lethal effects on a bird's reproductive ability, immune system, and hormone balance. Floating plastic debris can produce ulcers, infections and lead to death. Marine plastic pollution can even reach birds that have never been at the sea. Parents may accidentally feed their nestlings plastic, mistaking it for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rodríguez|first1=A|title=High prevalence of parental delivery of plastic debris in Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea)|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=64|issue=10|pages=2219–2223|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.06.011|pmid=22784377|display-authors=etal|year=2012|hdl=10261/56764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seabird chicks are the most vulnerable to plastic ingestion since they can't vomit up their food like the adult seabirds.&lt;ref&gt;Derraik, J. G. B. (2002) The Pollution of the Marine Environment by Plastic Debris: a review&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial observation that many of the beaches in New Zealand had high concentrations of plastic pellets, further studies found that different species of [[prion (bird)|prion]] ingest the plastic debris. Hungry prions mistook these pellets for food, and these particles were found intact within the birds' [[gizzards]] and [[proventriculus|proventriculi]]. Pecking marks similar to those made by [[northern fulmar]]s in [[cuttlebone]]s have been found in plastic debris, such as [[expanded polystyrene foam|styrofoam]], on the beaches on the [[Netherlands|Dutch coast]], showing that this species of bird also mistake plastic debris for food.&lt;ref name="env implications"/&gt;

An estimate of 1.5 million [[Laysan albatross]]es, which inhabit [[Midway Atoll]], all have plastics in their digestive system. [[Midway Atoll]] is halfway between [[Asia]] and [[North America]], and north of the [[Hawaiian archipelago]]. In this remote location, the plastic blockage has proven deadly to these birds. These seabirds choose red, pink, brown, and blue plastic pieces because of similarities to their natural food sources. As a result of plastic ingestion, the digestive tract can be blocked resulting in starvation. The windpipe can also be blocked, which results in suffocation.&lt;ref name="Plastic Pollution"/&gt; The debris can also accumulate in the animal's gut, and give them a false sense of fullness which would also result in starvation. On the shore, thousands of birds corpses can be seen with plastic remaining where the stomach once was. The durability of the plastics is visible among the remains. In some instances, the plastic piles are still present while the bird's corpse has decayed.&lt;ref name="Plastic Pollution"/&gt;

Similar to humans, animals exposed to [[plasticizer]]s can experience developmental defects. Specifically, sheep have been found to have lower birth weights when prenatally exposed to bisphenol A. Exposure to BPA can shorten the distance between the eyes of a tadpole. It can also stall development in frogs and can result in a decrease in body length. In different species of fish, exposure can stall egg hatching and result in a decrease in body weight, tail length, and body length.&lt;ref name="plasticizer"/&gt;

==Effects on humans==
Due to the use of chemical additives during plastic production, plastics have potentially harmful effects that could prove to be carcinogenic or promote [[endocrine disruption]]. Some of the additives are used as [[phthalate]] [[plasticizer]]s and brominated [[flame retardant]]s.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Through [[biomonitoring]], chemicals in plastics, such as [[Bisphenol A|BPA]] and phthalates, have been identified in the human population. Humans can be exposed to these chemicals through the nose, mouth, or skin. Although the level of exposure varies depending on age and geography, most humans experience simultaneous exposure to many of these chemicals. Average levels of daily exposure are below the levels deemed to be unsafe, but more research needs to be done on the effects of low dose exposure on humans.&lt;ref name="plastics environment human health"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thompson|first1=R. C.|last2=Moore|first2=C. J.|last3=vom Saal|first3=F. S.|last4=Swan|first4=S.

Some of the chemicals used in plastic production can cause [[dermatitis]] upon contact with human skin.&lt;ref name="Brydson"&gt;Brydson, J. A. (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rka3nPiiRi4C&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Plastics Materials]. Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 103-104. {{ISBN|0750641320}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many plastics, these toxic chemicals are only used in [[trace amount]]s, but significant testing is often required to ensure that the toxic elements are contained within the plastic by inert material or polymer.&lt;ref name="Brydson"/&gt;

It can also affect humans in which it may create an eyesore that interferes with enjoyment of the [[natural environment]].&lt;ref&gt;(1973). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGo5AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=plastic+pollution,+mental+health,+eyesore&amp;dq=plastic+pollution,+mental+health,+eyesore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ymT6UZrHFceeiQKM24C4Dw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ Polyvinyl Chloride Liquor Bottles: Environmental Impact Statement]. United States. Department of the Treasury (contributor).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical significance===
Due to the pervasiveness of plastic products, most of the human population is constantly exposed to the chemical components of plastics. 95% of adults in the United States have had detectable levels of BPA in their urine. Exposure to chemicals such as [[bisphenol A#Health effects|BPA]] have been correlated with disruptions in fertility, reproduction, sexual maturation, and other [[Bisphenol A#Health effects|health effects]].&lt;ref name="plastics environ health"/&gt; Specific [[phthalates#Health effects|phthalates]] have also resulted in similar biological [[phthalate#Health effects|effects]].

====Thyroid hormone axis====
Bisphenol A affects [[gene expression]] related to the [[thyroid hormone]] axis, which affects biological functions such as metabolism and development. BPA can decrease [[thyroid hormone receptor]] (TR) activity by increasing TR transcriptional corepressor activity. This then decreases the level of thyroid hormone binding proteins that bind to triiodothyronine. By affecting the thyroid hormone axis, BPA expoure can lead to [[hypothyroidism]].&lt;ref name="plasticizer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mathieu-Denoncourt|first1=Justine|last2=Wallace|first2=Sarah J.|last3=de Solla|first3=Shane R.|last4=Langlois|first4=Valerie S.|title=Plasticizer endocrine disruption: Highlighting developmental and reproductive effects in mammals and non-mammalian aquatic species|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|volume=219|pages=74–88|date=November 2014|doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2014.11.003|pmid=25448254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sex hormones====
BPA can disrupt normal, physiological levels of [[sex hormone]]s. It does this by binding to [[globulin]]s that normally bind to sex hormones such as [[androgen]]s and [[estrogen]]s, leading to the disruption of the balance between the two. BPA can also affect the metabolism or the catabolism of sex hormones. It often acts as an [[antiandrogen]] or as an estrogen, which can cause disruptions in gonadal development and sperm production.&lt;ref name="plasticizer"/&gt;

==Reduction efforts==
[[File:Plastic household items.jpg|thumb|right|Household items made of various types of plastic.]]

Efforts to reduce the use of plastics and to promote [[plastic recycling]] have occurred. Some supermarkets charge their customers for [[plastic bag]]s, and in some places more efficient reusable or [[biodegradable]] materials are being used in place of plastics. Some communities and businesses have put a ban on some commonly used plastic items, such as [[bottled water]] and plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/5778162/Australian-town-bans-bottled-water.html |title=Australian town bans bottled water |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2013 |author=Malkin, Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodegradable and degradable plastics===
The use of [[biodegradable plastic]]s has many [[biodegradable plastic#Advantages and disadvantages|advantages and disadvantages]]. Biodegradables are [[biopolymer]]s that degrade in industrial [[compost]]ers. Biodegradables do not degrade as efficiently in domestic composters, and during this slower process, [[methane|methane gas]] may be emitted.&lt;ref name="plastics environment human health"/&gt;

There are also other types of degradable materials that are not considered to be biopolymers, because they are oil-based, similar to other conventional plastics. These plastics are made to be more degradable through the use of different additives, which help them degrade when exposed to UV rays or other physical stressors.&lt;ref name="plastics environment human health"/&gt; yet, biodegradation-promoting additives for polymers have been shown not to significantly increase biodegradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es504258u|pmid=25723056|title=Evaluation of Biodegradation-Promoting Additives for Plastics|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=49|issue=6|pages=3769–3777|year=2015|last1=Selke|first1=Susan|last2=Auras|first2=Rafael|last3=Nguyen|first3=Tuan Anh|last4=Castro Aguirre|first4=Edgar|last5=Cheruvathur|first5=Rijosh|last6=Liu|first6=Yan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although biodegradable and degradable plastics have helped reduce plastic pollution, there are some drawbacks. One issue concerning both types of plastics is that they do not break down very efficiently in natural environments. There, degradable plastics that are oil-based may break down into smaller fractions, at which point they do not degrade further.&lt;ref name="plastics environment human health"/&gt;

===Incineration===
Up to 60% of used plastic medical equipment is [[incineration|incinerated]] rather than deposited in a [[landfill]] as a precautionary measure to lessen the transmission of disease. This has allowed for a large decrease in the amount of plastic waste that stems from medical equipment. If plastic waste is not incinerated and disposed of properly, a harmful amount of toxins can be released and dispersed as a gas through air or as ash through air and waterways.&lt;ref name="plastics environ health"/&gt; Many studies have been done concerning the [[incineration#Gaseous emissions|gaseous emissions]] that result from the incineration process.

===Policy===
Agencies such as the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] often do not assess the safety of new chemicals until after a negative side effect is shown. Once they suspect a chemical may be toxic, it is studied to determine the human reference dose, which is determined to be the lowest observable adverse effect level. During these studies, a high dose is tested to see if it causes any adverse health effects, and if it does not, lower doses are considered to be safe as well. This does not take into account the fact that with some chemicals found in plastics, such as [[bisphenol A|BPA]]; lower doses can have a discernible effect.&lt;ref name="bpa invisible pollution"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Groff|first1=Tricia|title=Bisphenol A: invisible pollution|journal=Current Opinion in Pediatrics|date=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=524–529|doi=10.1097/MOP.0b013e32833b03f8|pmid=20489636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with this often complex evaluation process, policies have been put into place in order to help alleviate plastic pollution and its effects. Government regulations have been implemented that ban some chemicals from being used in specific plastic products.

In [[Canada]], the [[United States]], and the [[European Union]], BPA has been banned from being incorporated in the production of [[baby bottle]]s and children's cups, due to health concerns and the higher vulnerability of younger children to the effects of BPA.&lt;ref name="plastics environ health"/&gt; Taxes have been established in order to discourage specific ways of managing plastic waste. The [[landfill tax]], for example, creates an incentive to choose to recycle plastics rather than contain them in landfills, by making the latter more expensive.&lt;ref name="plastics environment human health"/&gt; There has also been a standardization of the types of plastics that can be considered compostable.&lt;ref name="plastics environment human health"/&gt; The European Norm EN 13432, which was set by the [[European Committee for Standardization|European Committee for Standardization (CEN)]], lists the standards that plastics must meet, in terms of compostability and biodegradability, in order to officially be labeled as compostable.&lt;ref name="plastics environment human health"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EN 13432|url=http://greenplastics.com/wiki/EN_13432|website=Green Plastics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional arrangements in Canada===
The Canadian federal government formed a current institution that protects marine areas; this includes the mitigation of plastic pollution. In 1997, Canada adopted legislation for oceans management and passed the Oceans Act.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/management-gestion/integratedmanagement-gestionintegree/Governance-eng.htm|title= Oceans Act: Governance for sustainable marine ecosystems|date= 2014|accessdate= |website= Government of Canada|publisher= Government of Canada|author= Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal governance, Regional Governance, and Aboriginal Peoples are the actors involved in the process of decision-making and implementation of the decision. The Regional Governance bodies are federal, provincial, and territorial government agencies that hold responsibilities of the marine environment. Aboriginal Peoples in Canada have treaty and non-treaty rights related to ocean activities. According to the Canadian government, they respect these rights and work with Aboriginal groups in oceans management activities.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

With the Oceans Act made legal, Canada made a commitment to conserve and protect the oceans. The Ocean Acts' underlying principle is sustainable development, precautionary and integrated management approach to ensure that there is a comprehensive understanding in protecting marine areas. In the integrated management approach, the Oceans Act designates federal responsibility to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Canada for any new and emerging ocean-related activities.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The Act encourages collaboration and coordination within the government that unifies interested parties. Moreover, the Oceans Act engages any Canadians who are interested in being informed of the decision-making regarding ocean environment.

In 2005, federal organizations developed the Federal Marine Protected Areas Strategy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This strategy is a collaborative approach implemented by [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]], [[Parks Canada]], and [[Environment Canada]] to plan and manage federal marine protected areas. The federal marine protected areas work with Aboriginal groups, industries, academia, environmental groups, and NGOs to strengthen marine protected areas. The federal marine protected areas network consists of three core programs: Marine Protected Areas, [[Marine Wildlife Area]]s, and [[National Marine Conservation Area]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The MPA is a program to be noted because it is significant in protecting ecosystems from the effects of industrial activities. The MPA guiding principles are [[Integrated Management]], [[ecosystem-based management]] approach, [[Adaptive Management]] Approach, [[Precautionary Principle]], and Flexible Management Approach.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; All five guiding principles are used collectively and simultaneously to collaborate and respect legislative mandates of individual departments, to use scientific knowledge and [[traditional ecological knowledge]] (TEK) to manage human activities, to monitor and report on programs to meet conservation objectives of MPAs, to use best available information in the absence of scientific certainty, and to maintain a balance between conservation needs and sustainable development objectives.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Collection===
The two common forms of waste collection include curbside collection and the use of drop-off recycling centers. About 87 percent of the population in the United States (273 million people) have access to curbside and drop-off recycling centers. In curbside collection, which is available to about 63 percent of the United States population (193 million people), people place designated plastics in a special bin to be picked up by a public or private hauling company.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt; Most curbside programs collect more than one type of plastic resin; usually both [[PETE]] and [[HDPE]].&lt;ref name="name1"/&gt; At drop-off recycling centers, which are available to 68 percent of the United States population (213 million people), people take their recyclables to a centrally located facility.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web|title=AF&amp;PA Releases Community Recycling Survey Results|url=http://www.paperrecycles.org/news/press_releases/2010_community_survey_results.html|accessdate=3 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602132040/http://paperrecycles.org/news/press_releases/2010_community_survey_results.html|archivedate=2 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once collected, the plastics are delivered to a [[materials recovery facility]] (MRF) or handler for sorting into single-resin streams to increase product value. The sorted plastics are then [[baler#Industrial balers|baled]] to reduce shipping costs to reclaimers.&lt;ref name="name1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/doc.asp?CID=1571&amp;DID=5972 |title=Life cycle of a plastic product |work=[[American Chemistry Council|Americanchemistry.com]] |accessdate=3 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317004747/http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_plastics/doc.asp?CID=1571&amp;DID=5972 |archivedate=17 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are varying rates of recycling per type of plastic, and in 2011, the overall plastic recycling rate was approximately 8% in the United States.&lt;ref name="name 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/materials/plastics.htm |title=Plastics |work=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Epa.gov]] |accessdate=3 September 2012|date=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2.7 million tons of plastics were recycled in the U.S. in 2011.&lt;ref name="name 3"/&gt; Some plastics are recycled more than others; in 2011 "29 percent of HDPE bottles and 29 percent of PET bottles and jars were recycled."&lt;ref name="name 3"/&gt;

===Non-usage and reduction in usage===
The [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]], Government of India, has requested various governmental departments to avoid the use of [[plastic bottle]]s to provide drinking water during governmental meetings, etc., and to instead make arrangements for providing drinking water that do not generate plastic waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://himachal.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/17_l892s/Circular_WATER%20BOTTLED-21798821.pdf |title=Avoiding use of bottled water |accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aghp.cag.gov.in/pag/sites/pag/files/Avoiding%20use%20of%20bottled%20water%20during%20meetings,%20conferences%20etc..pdf |title=Avoiding use of bottled water |accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Sikkim]] has restricted the usage of plastic water bottles (in government functions and meetings) and styrofoam products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sikenvis.nic.in/ViewGeneralLatestNews.aspx?Id=4964&amp;Year=2016|title=Ban on Styrofoam Products and Packaged Water Bottles|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state of [[Bihar]] has banned the usage of plastic [[water bottle]]s in governmental meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/bihar-bans-plastic-packaged-water-bottles-48475|accessdate=2 September 2016 |title=Bihar bans plastic packaged water bottles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action for creating awareness==
On 11 April 2013 in order to create awareness, artist [[Maria Cristina Finucci]] founded The [[Garbage Patch State]] at [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/about-this-office/single-view/news/the_garbage_patch_territory_turns_into_a_new_state/#.U71u8fl_u9U|title=The garbage patch territory turns into a new state - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; –Paris in front of Director General [[Irina Bokova]].

International organisations have also been raising awareness of plastic pollution.

Every year, June 5 is observed as World Environment Day to raise awareness and increase government action on the pressing issue. In 2018, India is the host to this year’s World Environment Day and the theme is ‘Beat Plastic Pollution'  with focus on single-use or disposable plastic. The Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of India invited people to take care of their Green Social Responsibility and urged them to take up Green Good Deeds in everyday life.

'''Polish decrees''', '''Polish directives''' or '''decrees on Poles''' ({{lang-de|Polen-Erlasse, Polenerlasse}}) were the decrees of the [[Nazi Germany]] government announced on 8 March 1940 during [[World War II]]&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulrich Herbert|title=Hitler's Foreign Workers: Enforced Foreign Labor in Germany Under the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uifw3BgBDU4C&amp;pg=PR71|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47000-1|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; to regulate the working and living conditions of the [[Poles|Polish]] workers (''[[Zivilarbeiter]]'') [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|used during World War II as forced laborers in Germany]].&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt; The regulation intentionally supported and even created [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish racism]] and [[discrimination]] on the grounds of ethnicity and racial background.&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|72}}

==Purpose==
[[File:Anti-Polish poster published by Volksbund für das Deutschtum im Ausland (Association for 'Germanness' abroad) Gauverband Danzig Westpreußen (Association of the “shire or county”, Gdansk, West Prussia).png|left|thumb|250px|Anti-Polish poster published by Volksbund für das Deutschtum im Ausland (Association for 'Germanness' abroad) Gauverband Danzig Westpreußen (Association of the “shire or county”, Gdansk, West Prussia)]]
[[File:Polenabzeichen.jpg|thumb|200px|Polish-forced-workers' badge]]
The decrees were an important step towards [[Codification (law)|codifying]] Nazi Germany policies and laws on foreign forced labor.&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt; They were meant to provide a legal basis for discriminating against Poles, fulfilling at the same time Nazi ideology and the needs of the [[Nazi economy]].&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt; The racist notion of the inferiority of the forced laborers and prisoners of war from Poland when compared with the German [[master race]] was a prominent feature of the orders.&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|72}} The decrees, which recommended that examples of severe punishment be demonstrated to workers early on, were also aiming at clearly distinguishing the new conditions from pre-war voluntary [[seasonal labor]].&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|74}}

==Specific content==

Polish workers were required to wear a clearly visible letter "[[P (symbol)|P]]" badge, in addition to a work permit with a photo.&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|72}} The letter "P" badge was to be  to worn on the right breast of every garment worn. Those who did not obey the rules were subject to a fine of up to 150 RM [Reichsmarks] and arrested with a possible penalty of six weeks detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Waldemar Maszewski |language=Polish |title = To był pierwszy prawdziwy "widoczny znak" |publisher= Nasz Dziennik |url = http://stary.naszdziennik.pl/index.php?typ=sw&amp;dat=20090309&amp;id=sw11.txt |website = stary.naszdziennik.pl |date=9 March 2009 |accessdate = 2015-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They should also be kept away from German "cultural life" and "places of amusement" (this included churches and restaurants).&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|72}} Sexual relations between Poles and Germans was prohibited as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (race defilement), and so it was recommended that the same numbers of Polish males and females should be recruited, or that [[brothel]]s should be set up.&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|72}}&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|73}} To keep them segregated from the German population, they were often housed in segregated barracks behind barbed wire.&lt;ref name="ushmm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era |url=http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=24 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303110620/http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php |archivedate= 3 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobility of workers, housed as far away as possible from Germans, was to be restricted, hence they were barred from using public transportation.&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|72}} They were also affected by after dark [[curfew]].&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|72}} Wages paid to Polish workers were to be lower than those paid to the German workers, even through they had to work longer hours.&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|73}}&lt;ref name="ushmm"/&gt; Polish workers were also to receive substandard nutrition. They were not allowed certain types of possessions (bicycles, cameras). They often were denied holidays and had to work seven days a week. They could not enter a marriage without permission. Births were discouraged, and children were sometimes taken away from their families (see [[kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi Germany]]).

Punishments for disobedience for Polish workers included being sent to a [[concentration camp]] and the death penalty.&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|74}}&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|73}} Germans who disobeyed those laws by helping or sympathizing with the workers were to be punished as well, in extreme cases, by being sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|74}}

Workers' lives were almost totally regimented.&lt;ref name=HerbertTempler71/&gt;{{rp|74}}

In December 1941 the decrees were supplemented by Polish Criminal Regulation (''Polenstrafrechtsverordnung''), which introduced [[kangaroo court|shortened trials]] for Poles in criminal cases.

[[Pope Francis]], elected in 2013, has repeatedly spoken about the need for the [[Catholic Church]] to welcome and love all people regardless of sexual orientation. Speaking about gay people in 2013, he said, "the key is for the church to welcome, not exclude and show mercy, not condemnation."&lt;ref name=latino/&gt; He said, "If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?" "The problem," he continued, "is not having this orientation. We must be brothers."&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;  The pope has reiterated the [[Catholic teaching on homosexuality|Catholic Church's teaching on homosexuality]], including [[Catholic Church and gay marriage|its position on marriage]].  He has also been outspoken on the need to be compassionate towards LGBT people, and was named the Person of the Year by the LGBT magazine ''The Advocate''.

==Archbishop of Buenos Aires==
Before he became pope and while serving as Archbishop of [[Buenos Aires]], Cardinal [[Jorge Mario Bergoglio]] reportedly privately urged his fellow Argentine bishops in 2010 to signal the Church's public support for civil unions, as a compromise response to calls for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=pragmatist/&gt; Fellow bishops rejected the idea.&lt;ref name="pragmatist"/&gt;  Other sources both support and deny this account.&lt;ref name="Catholic News Agency"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hardquestions/&gt;  At that time  Argentina already permitted civil unions, and was debating a bill to allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children.

Publicly, Bergoglio strongly opposed the bill,&lt;ref name=pentin/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc20130318/&gt; warning it could lead to a situation that could "seriously harm the family" and deprive children of the developmental supports of both their father and mother.&lt;ref name=pentin/&gt;&lt;ref name=feder/&gt;&lt;ref name=humble/&gt;  After ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' reported this, several priests expressed their support for the law and one was defrocked.&lt;ref name=suspendido/&gt; Observers believe that the church's opposition and Bergoglio's language worked in favor of the law's passage and that in response, Catholic officials adopted a more conciliatory tone in later debates on social issues such as parental [[surrogacy]].&lt;ref name=lanacion/&gt;

In a 2010 book written with Rabbi [[Abraham Skorka]], Bergoglio also spoke of same-sex marriage as "a weakening of the institution of marriage, an institution that has existed for thousands of years and is 'forged according to nature and anthropology.'"&lt;ref name=repeats/&gt;

==On the need to welcome LGBT people==
As pope, Francis has repeatedly spoken about the need for the church to welcome and love all people, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Speaking about gay people in 2013, he said that "the key is for the church to welcome, not exclude and show mercy, not condemnation."&lt;ref name=latino/&gt; In July of that year, he said "If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him? The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] explains this in a beautiful way, saying…: 'no one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society.'"&lt;ref name="Pope Full declerations"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

Several LGBT groups welcomed the comments, noting that this was the first time a pope had used the word "gay" in public, and had also accepted the existence of gay people as a recognizable part of the Catholic Church community.&lt;ref name=mcgarry/&gt; In October 2016, Francis said that "When a person (who is gay) arrives before Jesus, Jesus certainly will not say, 'Go away because you are homosexual.'"&lt;ref name=embraced/&gt;

According to two [[gay right]]s activists, Marcelo Márquez and Andrés Albertsen, Bergoglio expressed support for the spiritual needs of "homosexual people" and willingness to support "measured actions" on their behalf in private conversations with them.&lt;ref name="closed doors"/&gt;

In April 2018 Pope Francis met with Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of [[Karadima case|sexual abuse by Chilean priest Fernando Karadima]].&lt;ref name=this/&gt; Cruz discussed with Francis in detail how his sexual orientation was used by Latin American media and news outlets to discredit his report of abuse and label him as a pervert and liar.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; In a private conversation between the two Francis reportedly said to Cruz, who identifies as homosexual, in regards to his sexuality, "You know Juan Carlos, that does not matter. God made you like this. God loves you like this. The Pope loves you like this and you should love yourself and not worry about what people say."&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt;&lt;ref name=cruz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;&lt;ref name=cheers/&gt;

These remarks have been seen as an encouraging change of tone from the papacy, so much so that the American [[LGBT]] magazine ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' named Pope Francis their Person of the Year for 2013.&lt;ref name=advocate/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

On 26 August 2018 Pope Francis said in Ireland, that homosexual peope exist in whole history of human mankind.  He teaches catholic parents to talk with their homosexual children and that they are part of their families and shouldn't "thrown out" of family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rp-online.de/panorama/ausland/papst-eltern-sollen-ihre-homosexuellen-kinder-nicht-verurteilen_aid-32151641 Rheinische Post: Eltern sollen ihre homosexuellen Kinder nicht verurteilen (german)]&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 August 2018 Pope Francis press statement declares, that homosexuality is not an illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/papst-franziskus-vatikan-zieht-aeusserung-zu-homosexuellen-kindern-zurueck-a-1225215.html Spiegel.de: Vatikan zieht umstrittene Äußerung zu homosexuellen Kindern zurück]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/katholische-kirche-vatikan-aendert-papst-zitate-zu-homosexuellen-neigungen-von-kindern/22957736.html Tagesspiegel.de:Vatikan ändert Papst-Zitate zu homosexuellen Neigungen von Kindern ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/nach-kritik-vatikan-relativiert-papst-aeusserungen-zu.2932.de.html?drn:news_id=918704 Deutschlandfunk.de: Vatikan relativiert Papst-Äußerungen zu Homosexualität], abgerufen am 28. August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT families and children==

Francis has also spoken of the importance of education in the context of the difficulties now facing children, indicating that the Church had a challenge in not being welcoming enough of children brought up in a multiplicity of household arrangements, specifically including the children of gay couples.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; He mentioned as an example a case of a child with a mother living in a lesbian relationship: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I remember the case of a very sad little girl who finally confided to her teacher the reason for her state of mind: 'my mother's fiancée doesn't like me'.... How can we proclaim Christ to these boys and girls? How can we proclaim Christ to a generation that is changing? We must be careful not to administer a vaccine against faith to them."&lt;ref name=wake/&gt;&lt;ref name=akin/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Italian [[tabloid journalism|tabloids]] suggested his comments indicated a shift towards accepting civil unions for gay couples, the Director of the Holy See Press Office said the pope was talking only about the difficulties of children in non-traditional fmailies, not making a declaration on the debate in Italy concerning gay unions.&lt;ref name=open/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pullella/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes.com/&gt;

==Teaching on marriage==
Francis has taught that "Marriage is between a man and a woman. Secular states want to justify civil unions to regulate different situations of cohabitation, pushed by the demand to regulate economic aspects between persons, such as ensuring health care. It is about pacts of cohabitating of various natures, of which I wouldn't know how to list the different ways. One needs to see the different cases and evaluate them in their variety."&lt;ref name=sera/&gt; Some interpreted this as suggesting that the Catholic Church could tolerate some types of non-marital civil unions, but the Vatican later clarified that was not Francis' intention.&lt;ref name=cns/&gt;&lt;ref name=clarifies/&gt;

In February 2015, Francis encouraged people in [[Slovakia]], who were considering limiting marriage to opposite sex couples, to "continue their efforts in defense of the family, the vital cell of society."&lt;ref name="J Lester Feder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blumberg"/&gt;   At the start of 2014, Bishop [[Charles J. Scicluna]] of Malta reported that in a private conversation held with Pope Francis in December 2013, the pope said that gay marriage was "an anthropological regression."&lt;ref name=repeats/&gt;

''The New York Times'' considers that Bergoglio may have supported gay unions in Argentina only as a negotiated compromise, but that his context as a Pope is very different.&lt;ref name="pragmatist"/&gt; In 2015, Pope Francis declared that "the family is threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage" and suggested that same-sex marriage "disfigures God's plan for creation."&lt;ref name="Ben Tufft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michele Richinick"/&gt;

==''Amoris Laetitia''==
Francis presided over the [[Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|2014 Synod on the Family]], the first assembly of the Synod to explicitly examine the issue of pastoral care for people in same-sex civil unions and marriages.&lt;ref name=Preparatory/&gt;&lt;ref name=survey/&gt; The synod's working document called for less judgment towards people that are gay and more understanding towards same-sex couples in civil unions or marriages, as well as an equal welcome for children of such couples (including conferring baptism), while still rejecting the validity of same-sex marriage itself.&lt;ref name=judgemental/&gt;&lt;ref name=softens/&gt; However, the final report failed to contain the proposed language as it did not receive the necessary two-thirds support of attending bishops.'&lt;ref name=policy/&gt;

In the post-synodal [[apostolic exhortation]]  ''[[Amoris Laetitia]]'', issued in 2016, Francis encouraged better understanding from all members of the church on the acceptance of gay people, without suggesting any specific doctrinal changes. Instead, he reiterated the need for every person to be respected regardless of their sexual orientation, and to be free from threats of aggression and violence. He avoided any recognition of unions between same sex couples, but rather maintained that these were not equal to heterosexual unions. Some parts of the media interpreted his remarks as more moderate on the issue of homosexuality than that taken by church leaders in previous years.&lt;ref name=eagerly/&gt;

==Transgender issues==

On 2 October 2016, Pope Francis spoke in favor of pastoral care for and including [[transgender]] Catholics in the church, stating priests should "accompany them spiritually" and that they should never be turned away, even if they have undergone [[gender transition]] and [[sex reassignment surgery|sex-reassignment operations]].&lt;ref name=deserve/&gt; He spoke out against "Gender Theory"—the idea that [[gender identity]] is not definite and can change—being taught in schools.&lt;ref name=acts/&gt;&lt;ref name=warns/&gt;  He referred to it as "ideological colonization" and said it was a threat to traditional marriage and is destructive to children.&lt;ref name=acts/&gt;&lt;ref name=warns/&gt; [[New Ways Ministry]] and [[DignityUSA]], two dissenting LGBT Catholic advocacy groups, both spoke out against Pope Francis's statements regarding gender identity, calling it "dangerous ignorance" of the issue.&lt;ref name=remarks/&gt;

Francis once held an audience with a Spanish transgender man, who had transitioned from female to male, and his wife.&lt;ref name=abandon/&gt;

==Other==

During his [[Pope Francis' visit to the United States|2015 visit to the United States]], Francis held a private meeting with [[Kim Davis]], a county clerk from Kentucky who had gained international attention after defying a federal court order requiring that she issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;&lt;ref name=visited/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eversley/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chappell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt; The [[Holy See Press Office|Vatican press office]] shortly after issued a statement saying that the pope was unaware of her situation and the meeting was not to be considered an endorsement.&lt;ref name=kim/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yardley"/&gt; The only [[audience (meeting)|audience]] given by Francis while in Washington was with an Argentine former student, Yayo Grassi, who is openly gay, and his same-sex partner of 19 years.&lt;ref name="Yardley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burke-151002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Green-151002"/&gt;

Francis has suggested that he believed a "gay lobby" existed within the Vatican itself, in remarks during a meeting held in private with Catholic [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] from Latin America in 2013. He was reported to have promised to see what could be done to address the issue.&lt;ref name="bbcrumours"/&gt;  In October 2015, priest and Vatican theologian Priest [[Krzysztof Charamsa]] was stripped of his posts after announcing he was in a homosexual relationship.&lt;ref name=Wyatt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Philipson/&gt;

In relation to reports that a Vatican official whom he had recently promoted had had a homosexual relationship, the pope drew a distinction between sins, which can be forgiven if repented of, and crimes, such as sexual abuse of minors.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

'''Portuguese Mozambicans''' ({{lang-pt|luso-moçambicanos}}) are [[Mozambique|Mozambican]]-born descendants of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese settlers]].

==History==
Portuguese explorers turned to present-day [[Mozambique]] and two other [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP]] [[nations]] ([[Angola]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]]) to bring [[Black people|black]] [[slaves]] to [[Portugal]] before bringing them to work for their [[plantations]] in their [[Latin America]]n [[province]], the present-named [[Brazil]]. The first permanent Portuguese [[communities]] in the region were established in the 16th century. The whole region was divided into ''[[prazos]]'' ([[Estate in land|agricultural estates]]), to be lived by [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[settler]] families in the 17th century. [[Mozambique]] was declared a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese province]] by the 19th century. By the early 20th century, the mainland government permitted more white emigration and settlement to the region, and Mozambique had 370,000 Portuguese settlers, who improved its economy, by the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Contrary to the other settlers which often had lived in Mozambique for two or even three generations, the Portuguese arriving during the last phase of colonial occupation did not become identified with Mozambique.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] led Portugal, in which several thousands of Portuguese citizens fled to other countries, especially neighbouring [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]] as well as [[Brazil]] and the [[United States]]. Blacks and some [[mulattos|''mestiços'']] and whites revolted against Portuguese rule in 1974. 

The [[Carnation Revolution|return to liberal democracy]] in Portugal led to the independence of its overseas colonies in 1975. By July 1975 around 80,000 Portuguese Mozambicans were left in the country from around 250,000 that lived in the country in the early 1970s.  Of the 80,000 only around 10,000 opted for Mozambican citizenship instead of Portuguese citizenship. The most decisive factors for the preference for white emigration according to US diplomat William Jacobsen was a "combination of doctors leaving for good, plummeting standards of medical care... and uncertainty about country's willingness to allow Mozambican citizens to leave national territory."&lt;ref name="ANCbeforeC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/the-anc-before-the-collapse-of-communism | title=The ANC before the collapse of Communism | publisher=Politicsweb | date=18 December 2013 | accessdate=6 April 2016 | author=James Myburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large numbers of Portuguese residents emigrated shortly after, most of them to Portugal, where they were called [[History_of_Portugal_(1974-1986)#The_retornados|''retornados'']], while others moved to neighbouring [[Malawi]], [[Rhodesia]], or [[South Africa]], and/or Brazil&lt;ref&gt;[https://imigrantes.no.sapo.pt/page6portugal.html Portuguese Immigration (History)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GrrUiDTj?url=http://imigrantes.no.sapo.pt/page6portugal.html |date=2013-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States. Most notable legacy of Portuguese Mozambican settlers in South Africa is [[Nando's]], created in 1987, which incorporated influences from former Portuguese settlers from Mozambique, many of whom had settled on the south-eastern side of [[Johannesburg]], after Mozambique's independence in 1975. 

When the [[Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries]] was founded in 1996, many Portuguese and [[Portuguese Brazilian]]s arrived for economic and educational aid to Mozambique. They have helped increase Portuguese-language fluency especially in remote rural places and improved the economy, as the [[Mozambican Metical|metical]] has a large value converted from the [[Euro]]. Many among them have adopted the country as their permanent home. Many more Portuguese settlers returned from Portugal, it is estimated by the Mozambican embassy that about 6,000 returned.

==Language==

Portuguese is the [[official language]] and [[lingua franca]] of Mozambique. Their dialect called [[Mozambican Portuguese]] is closer to Standard [[European Portuguese]] than [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian dialects]]. Among them speak one of main [[Bantu languages]] (like [[Tsonga language|Xitsonga]], [[Makhuwa language|Makhuwa]], and [[Ndau language|Ndau]] dialect of [[Shona language|Shona]]) as second languages. Many educated Portuguese Mozambicans speak [[English language|English]], as it is an international lingua franca and Mozambique is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

==Religion==

Most Portuguese Mozambicans are [[Christianity|Christians]] belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

}}'''Razzaq Gul''' (1977(?) – 19 May 2012) was a senior Pakistani journalist covering war and politics for [[Express News (Pakistan)|Express News]] in [[Turbat]], [[Pakistan]] who was abducted 18 May 2012 and found murdered 19 May 2012. According to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]],&lt;ref name=cpj1 /&gt;  Razzaq Gul was a member of the [[Baloch National Movement]] and secretary of the Press Club of Turbat.

== Personal ==
Razzaq Gul, 35, native of [[Pakistan]], was taken against his will and executed while working as a journalist in [[Turbat]], Pakistan.

== Context ==
The city of [[Turbat]], where Gul was found murdered, is located in the province of [[Balochistan]], where intense manoeuvres have been carried out by the Pakistani Military from 2001. The military wants to build temporary quarters for troops in the area which has been met by strong opposition from the citizens of the province due to the growing number of innocent people being killed. The [[Pakistan Air Force]] has bombed many of the districts in the region allegedly killing over 3000 people. Over 200,000 people have been forced to relocate to shelters due to the bombings.&lt;ref name=humanrights.asia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/news/urgent-appeals/UA-125-2007 |title=PAKISTAN: Four persons missing including a political activist and a journalist in Balochistan — Asian Human Rights Commission |language=ur |publisher=Humanrights.asia |date= |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Due to the violence in the [[Balochistan]] province, many reporters are scared to speak out. Razzaq Gul continued to report the facts even though journalists were being persecuted in his home country. Journalists are being targeted and murdered as a way to keep them from reporting the truth about the violent situation in this area of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/pakistan/2012/05/22/razzaq_gul/ |title=Abducted journalist found dead in Balochistan |publisher=IFEX |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has placed [[Pakistan]] at the top of the list for countries posing the most danger to journalists

Reaction to Razzaq Gul's murder was strong and swift. Owais Aslam Ali, secretary general of [[Pakistan Press International]], said journalists in [[Balochistan]] need protection to make it possible for them to report the facts as it has become almost impossible for them to do their jobs.&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenslade |first=Roy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/may/22/journalist-safety-pakistan |title=Pakistani journalist abducted and killed &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balochistan Union of Journalists called for a mourning period of three days which began 1 June 2012&lt;ref name=cpj1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpj.org/killed/2012/razzaq-gul.php |title=Razzaq Gul – Journalists Killed |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date= |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations took place in [[Turbat]] and surrounding areas with shops closing and protestors marching as they chanted for Gul's murderers to be brought to justice.&lt;ref name=youtube&gt;{{cite web|author=baloch warna |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMmPiKGm2I8 |title=BHRO Demonstration in front of Karachi Press club. 22 May 2012 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters said they did not want Razzaq Gul or any other innocent civilian or media worker to be just another name on a list of the dead that goes unsolved.&lt;ref name=cpj1 /&gt;

[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "I condemn the killings of Abdul Razaq Gul and Aurengzeb Tunio who died alongside two companions. I urge the authorities to investigate these killings. It is essential for freedom of expression and for good governance that those responsible for the death of journalists be brought to justice." Other human rights groups called on Pakistani authorities to thoroughly investigate Gul's killing and bring the unknown assailants to justice, and the Acting Inspector General of Police Hussain Karar Khwaja initiated an investigation.&lt;ref name=express /&gt;&lt;ref name=alyunaniya&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alyunaniya.com/number-of-journalists-killed-in-pakistan-rising/ |title=Number of journalists killed in Pakistan rising |publisher=AlYunaniya |date= |accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian community in [[Greece]] are [[ethnicity|ethnic]] [[Russians]] living in Greece, and not the [[Greeks in Russia]] who immigrated to Greece in the 1990s. 

There are 13,635 people of [[Russians|Russian]] origin living in Greece. Mostly in [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Crete]]. A small part came in the 1920s after the [[Russian Civil War]], however the majority emigrated in the 1990s.

[[File:Painted pebbles.jpg|thumb|right|Pictish painted pebbles]]
'''Painted pebbles''' are a class of Early Medieval [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] found in northern [[Scotland]] dating from the [[first millennium]] AD.

== Appearance ==
They are small rounded beach pebbles made of [[quartzite]], which have been painted with simple designs in a dye which is now dark brown in colour. The size varies from 18&amp;nbsp;mm by 22&amp;nbsp;mm to 65&amp;nbsp;mm by 51mm. It has not proven possible to analyse the dye itself from the stains that remain.

The [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] are carefully executed and the most common are dots and wavy lines. Other motifs are small circles, pentacles, crescents and triangles, showing strong relationships with the Pictish symbol stone motifs.&lt;ref name="PSAS"&gt;{{harvnb|Ritchie|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental archaeology suggests that the designs were likely to have been painted with peat tar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arthur|Murray|Ritchie|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==

To date, 55 painted pebbles have been found. 11 of these were found in [[Caithness]], 5 in [[Orkney]], 27 in [[Shetland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arthur|Murray|Ritchie|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most have come from [[broch]] sites which have been shown to have had an extensive post-broch occupation. An [[ogham]]-inscribed spindle-whorl was associated with one find at Buckquoy in [[Orkney]] (see [[Buckquoy spindle whorl]]). Several have been associate with [[Wheelhouse (archaeology)|wheelhouse]]s or their outbuildings. An example was found at a Pictish site at Buckquoy in Orkney as reported in 1976. It had the "small ring" type decoration.&lt;ref name="PSAS108"&gt;{{harvnb|Ritchie|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural significance ==
Scottish Painted pebbles have been dated to the period 200 AD to the eighth century AD, the Pictish period. They may have been sling-stones that were thought to be of magical nature by the Picts, however local traditions suggest that they were '[[charm-stone]]s', often known as 'Cold-stones'. Such stones were used within living memory to cure sickness in animals and humans.&lt;ref name="PSAS"/&gt;

In the ''Life of [[St. Columba]]'' it is recorded that he visited [[Bridei I of the Picts|King Bridei]] in Pictland in around the year 565 AD and taking a white stone pebble from the [[River Ness]] he blessed it and any water it came into contact with would cure sick people. It floated in water and cured the king from a terminal illness. It remained as one of the great treasures of the king and cured many others.

'''Seychellois Creole''', also known as '''kreol''' is the [[French-based creole language]] of the [[Seychelles]]. It shares [[official language]] status with [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] (in contrast to [[Mauritian Creole|Mauritian]] and [[Réunion Creole]], which lack official status in [[Mauritius]] and [[France]]).

== Description ==

Since its independence in 1976, the government of the Seychelles has sought to develop the language, with its own orthography and codified grammar, establishing ''Lenstiti Kreol'' (the Creole Institute) for this purpose.

{| class="IPA wikitable"
! Language !! colspan="11" | Word
|-
! Creole 
| Nou || || tou || bezwen || || travay || ansanm || pou || kree || nou || lavenir
|-class=IPA
! French ([[Help:IPA|IPA]])
| /nu‿z/ || /a.vɔ̃/ || /tus/ || /bə.zwɛ̃/|| /də/ || /tʁa.va.je/ || /ɑ̃.sɑ̃bl/|| /puʁ/ || /kʁre.e/|| /nɔtʁ/|| /av.niʁ/

! French 
|  Nous || avons || tous || besoin || de || travailler || ensemble || pour || créer || notre || avenir
|-
! Gloss
| We || ||all || need || to || work || together || to || create || our || future
|}

In Creole, the [[definite article]] (derived from the French ''le'', ''la'' and ''les'') forms part of the word, so that 'the future' is ''lavenir'' (as opposed to the French ''l'avenir''). The possessive is formed by adding the pronoun, so that 'our future' is ''nou lavenir'', literally, 'we-the-future'.  Similarly in the plural, ''les Îles Éloignées Seychelles'' in French ('the Outer Seychelles Islands') becomes ''Zil Elwanyen Sesel'' in Creole.  Note the ''z'' in ''Zil'', as, in French, ''les Îles'' is pronounced /le.'''z'''‿il/.

49 fables of La Fontaine were adapted to the dialect around 1900 by Rodolphine Young (1860–1932) but these remained unpublished until 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sM-5aGQHv2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=rodolphine+young&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AwfXgePKos&amp;sig=2zUKu6jMVkb4q2A9Jl5HylNCxDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VGcHTLfFIpaI0wThv8hl&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Fables de La Fontaine traduites en créole seychellois'', Hamburg, 1983]; there is also a selection at [http://www.potomitan.info/atelier/contes Potomitan.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

simPRO was founded in 2002, after electrical business owner Steve Bradshaw approached [[software engineering]] student Vaughan McKillop about creating a website for his growing electrical contracting business&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simprogroup.com/about-us|title=The simPRO Software Story {{!}} simPRO US|website=www.simprogroup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When Vaughn explained to Steve that his strengths lay in writing software rather than web design, Steve quickly realised he could build something big to help his business&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Using the web-based [[PHP]] and [[MySQL]] languages that Vaughan knew well, the two men began to create simPRO's first iteration&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

Initially they focused on making digital job lists, and then moved on to building a scheduling tool that could allocate time and [[technicians]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. As Vaughan and Steve continued to expand on the software's capability and functionality, they realised that the tool they had created could not only help Steve's business, but many others&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

The company first started trading as Acorn Software and Service Management Pty Ltd in 2003, then changed its name is simPRO Software in 2011 and simPRO in 2017&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6170">[[File:Siyah Qalam Demons1.jpg|thumb|600px|Folio 64, recto; Demons and the dead in ritualistic dance. This scene shows Buddhist influence, especially in the flowing drapery, and wild rhythms of their dance]]
The '''''Siyah Qalam''''' or '''''Siāh-Qalam''''' ({{lang-fa|سیاه‌قَلَم}}, {{lang-tr|Siyah Kalem}}, meaning "Black Pen") comprise around 80 extant late 14th and early 15th century miniature [[folios]] and ink drawings (''qalam-siāhi''), paintings and calligraphies, on various material, often silk. Measuring up to 335 x 485&amp;nbsp;cm, they are generally attributed to Central Asia and bear the strong influence of Chinese art and techniques, as well as symbols of Buddhism and [[Tengrism|Shamanism]], which were both major faiths in the region of Central Asia before the arrival of Islam.&lt;ref name="bb21"&gt;Bloom; Blair, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In tone and theme, the images are a highpoint of Persian draughtsmanship and include works from the [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Mozaffarid]], [[Jalairid Sultanate|Jalāyerid]] and [[Oghuz Turk|Turkmen]] periods.&lt;ref name="irani"&gt;"[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/siah-qalam Siāh-Qalam “black pen” the genre of paintings or drawings done in pen and ink; the painters of such drawings]". [[Encyclopædia Iranica]]. Retrieved 27 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes attributed to the [[notname]] Muhammad Siyah Qalam; equivalent in English to the ''Master of the Black Pen''.

The figures span a variety of cultures: Iranian, Turkic, Chinese, [[Mongols|Mongolian]], and [[Mughal Empire|Indian]], and date to the century after reign of the [[Turco-Mongol]] conqueror [[Timur]]. Notable for their intrinsic quality, they contain depictions of diabolic imagery, everyday nomadic life in the Euroasian steppe, and contemporary culture's relationship with the dead.

They are held at the [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapi Saray Library]], Istanbul; parts of the larger ''Diez Albums'' of the [[Berlin State Library]] are closely related.&lt;ref name="bb21" /&gt;
  
==Illustrations==
The more fantastical and intensely coloured&lt;ref name="bb225"&gt;Bloom; Blair, 225&lt;/ref&gt; images seem to conjure the devastation and bleakness of [[Genghis Khan]]'s reign.&lt;ref name="w254" /&gt; The drawings have been described as evidencing the "brutal realism of the draftsmanship [while] the lyricism of the refined delineations is of such intensity that it has been matched only in isolated instances in Buddhist as well as Islamic paintings".&lt;ref name="w25-4"&gt;Walther, 254-5&lt;/ref&gt; In general the inscribed text is banal and not of comparable quality to the illustrations, either in craft or meaning.&lt;ref name="bb225" /&gt;

[[File:Dancing Men Siyah Qalam.jpg|thumb|left|400px|''Dancing Men'']]
The compositions are highly expressive, and a number of figures are engaged in ecstatic ritual or dance.&lt;ref name="r37"&gt;Robinson,  37&lt;/ref&gt; The fantastical monsters are drawn from local Pre-Islamic Central Asian folklore, bearing resemblance to beings of Indian, Chinese and middle Eastern legend as Central Asia lies on the cultural crossroad between the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia.&lt;ref name="w254" /&gt; Many of the earthly scenes depict everyday life in the Central Asian [[Eurasian Steppe|Steppes]] as lived by various ethnic people, most prominent the Turkic and Iranian; washing clothes, blowing fire on a cooker, hanging lines of bows and arrows.&lt;ref name="w255"&gt;Walther, 255&lt;/ref&gt; The living wear various head-dress and costumes and carry a variety of tools and weapons, and engage in different rituals.&lt;ref name="w254" /&gt;

The miniatures bear the heavy influence of Chinese art, subtly in their sinuous lines and fluid rhythms, overtly in the figure's dress in that country's traditional dress. The works are of historical interest because of their depictions of everyday life of the faded world of historic Central Asia; with descriptions of tools, costumes, rituals, headdress, and the treatment of domesticated animals.&lt;ref name="w254" /&gt;

The cultic acts, especially the ecstatic movement of the dancing figures, filled with emotion and vehement gestures, according to art historian Ingto Walther show "twisted limb and windining motifs...[and are contrasted by the]...brutal realism that overlies the virtuosity of draftsmanship, the lyricism of the refined delineation is of such intensity that it has been matched in isolated subsequent instances in Buddhist as well as Islamic painting".&lt;ref name="w254"&gt;Walther, 254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
The sources for the drawings are uncertain; various parts may be influenced by the [[Shahnameh]] and the biblical [[Solomon]]. In addition, given their often disparate size; their precise function cannot be determined with much certainty, though it might be that they were intended as aids to storytelling, to Royal elites.&lt;ref name="irani" /&gt;  
{{clear}}

==Provenance==
The extant leaves are taken from a number of scrolls that transferred ownership during wars and land occupations. Leaves are recorded in inventories in Istanbul and in the library of Topkapi palace of [[Sultan]] [[Selim I]] as booty from his 1514 Persian adventure.&lt;ref name="w254" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12513">'''Sociophysiology''' is the "interplay between society and physical functioning" (Freund 1988: 856) involving "collaboration of two neighboring sciences: [[physiology]] and [[sociology]]" ([[Marcel Mauss|Mauss]] 1936: 373).&lt;ref&gt;"Collaboration de deux sciences voisines: physiologie, sociologie" (Mauss 1936: 373). Furthermore, Freund (1988) discusses the work of F. J. Buytendijk (1974), which "is one example of an effort to redefine mechanistic physiology in such a way as to include subjectivity and social existence as interrelated aspects of our physical being" (Freund 1988: 847), such that there exists a "mutually 'conditioning' relation between sociopsychological and biological factors. Social environments 'construct' bodies, which in turn affect social behavior, and this behavior in turn further modifies bodies" (Freund 1988: 849).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, sociophysiology is physiological sociology, a special science that studies the physiological side of human (and other animals') interrelations ([[G. P. Zeliony|Zeliony]] 1912: 405–406).&lt;ref&gt;"Die physische Seite der Wechselbeziehungen der Menschen kann nichtsdestoweniger Gegenstand einer besonderen Naturwissenschaft sein, welche ich als "physiologische Soziologie" oder besser "Soziophysiologie" zu bezeichnen vorschlage" (Zeliony 1912: 405-406). Zeliony’s 1912 paper — the earliest known which uses the term "sociophysiology" and its derivatives, e.g., ''Soziophysiologie'', ''soziophysiologische'', etc. — was originally delivered as a lecture to the Saint Petersburg Philosophical Society on March 19, 1909 (Zeliony 1912: 405). Although Zeliony (1912: 406) attributes the term "sociophysiology" to Russian philosopher [[:ru:Введенский, Александр Иванович (философ)|A. I. Wedensky]], [[Paul von Lilienfeld]], in 1879, published a book titled ''Social Physiology'', which uses throughout the unified concept, conjoined with a dash, "social-physiology" [''social-physiologie''] in addition to the modified substantive, separated by a space, "social physiology" [''sociale Physiologie'']. [[G. P. Zeliony]], a worker in [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov's]] lab, took as the starting point for his "future sociophysiology," the study of the "[[reflex]]ive interrelations" [''reflektorischen Wechselbeziehungen''] of humans and other animals (Zeliony 1912: 405; 412–413).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary field of research==
In addition to having been termed an "interdisciplinary area for research, an area which demonstrates the concomitant relationship between physiology and social behavior" (Di Mascio et al. 1955: 4), sociophysiology may also be described as "social [[ethology]]" and "social energetics" ([[Emile Waxweiler|Waxweiler]] 1906: 62). That is, the "physiology of reactive phenomena caused by the mutual excitations of individuals of the same species" (Waxweiler 1906: 62).&lt;ref&gt;"Éthologie sociale; énergétique sociale — physiologie des phénomènes réactionnels dus aux excitations mutuelles des individus de même espèce" (Waxweiler 1906: 62).&lt;/ref&gt;

The interdisciplinary nature of sociophysiology largely entails a "synthesis of [[psychophysiology]] and [[social interaction]]" (Adler 2002: 884) such that a "socio-psycho-biological study" (Mauss 1936: 386) of "biologico-sociological phenomena" (Mauss 1936: 385) may ensue.&lt;ref&gt;"Étude socio-psycho-biologique" (Mauss 1936: 386); "phénomènes biologico-sociologiques" (Mauss 1936: 385).&lt;/ref&gt; Such "socio-psycho-biological study" has uncovered a "sharing of physiology between people involved in a meaningful interaction" (Adler 2002: 884), as well as "mutually responsive physiologic engagement having normative function in maintaining social cohesion and well-being in higher social animals" (Adler 2002: 885). This "mutually responsive physiologic engagement" brings into play the "close links uniting social phenomena to the biological phenomena from which they immediately derive" ([[Ernest Solvay|Solvay]] 1906: 26).&lt;ref&gt;"Liens étroits qui unissent les phénomènes sociologiques aux phénomènes biologiques dont ils dérivent immédiatement" (Solvay 1906: 26).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal physiology==
Furthermore, sociophysiology explores the "intimate relationship and mutual regulation between social and physiological systems that is especially vital in human groups" (Barchas 1986: 210). In other words, sociophysiology studies the "physio- and psycho-energetic phenomena at the basis of social groupings" (Solvay 1906: 25).&lt;ref&gt;"Phénomènes physic- et psycho-énergétiques à la base des groupements sociaux" (Rolvaag 1906: 25). Such phenomena are now known to involve [[neurotransmitter]]s, [[hormone]]s, [[pheromone]]s, the [[immune system]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, Zeliony (1912) noted that

{{cquote|The changes of society are the result of the activities of the nervous system. Excitations vary with the same animal and with the same class of animals. The problem of the socio-physiologist is to find out what are the excitors and what the inhibitors. Physiology gives the laws of the nervous system.... Thus the duty of the socio-physiologist is to give a description of the nervous processes of groups which have resulted in changes in the [physical and social] environment.|4=[[Georgii Zeliony|Georgii Pavlovich Zeliony]] |5=summarized in Ellwood, C. A. (1916). Objectivism in sociology. American Journal of Sociology, vol. 22, no. 3, p. 297-298.}}

In addition, sociophysiology "describes structure-function relationships for body structures and interactive functions relevant to psychiatric illness" (Gardner 1997: 351), and also "assumes that psychiatric disorders are pathological variants of the motivation, emotions, and conflict involved in normal communicational processes" (Gardner and Price 1999: 247–248). [[Psychiatry]], thus, involves the diagnosis and treatment of what [[Paul von Lilienfeld|Lilienfeld]] (1879: 280) termed "physiological social pathology", and may be classed as a subfield of sociophysiology, called "pathological sociophysiology" by Zeliony (1912: 405).&lt;ref&gt;"Die physiologische Socialpathologie" (Lilienfeld 1879: 280); "Pathologische Soziophysiologie" (Zeliony 1912: 405).&lt;/ref&gt; As summarized by Ellwood (1916), Zeliony thought that, in the future,

{{cquote|A socio-physiological pathology will become necessary. Its field of observation will be the deviations from the norm which are observed either as a result of the pathological differences in the organism or as a result of other conditions, as in the insane or those addicted to the use of alcohol.|4=[[Georgii Zeliony|Georgii Pavlovich Zeliony]]|5=Ellwood, C. A. (1916). Objectivism in sociology. American Journal of Sociology, vol. 22, no. 3, p. 298.}}

Ellwood (1916: 298) also noted that Zeliony's future sociophysiology, being a natural biological science, must be [[Darwinism|Darwinian]].

In short, sociophysiology is "reciprocal, interpersonal physiology" (Adler 2002: 885). Such interpersonal physiology may have implications in the realm of human politics. For example, the findings of a recent study "suggest that political attitudes vary with physiological traits linked to divergent manners of experiencing and processing environmental threats" (Oxley et al. 2008: 1669).

{{Moresources|date=June 2014}}

'''Urairat Soimee''' (อุไรรัตน์ สร้อยมี) (1968 – 2006) was a victim of [[human trafficking]] in [[Japan]]. She was from [[Phetchabun]]'s Lom Sak district in [[Thailand]] and had lived in [[Yokkaichi|Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, Japan]], where she was forced into [[prostitution]]. She was incarcerated for several years in a Japanese prison until she was released in September 2005 due to the development of a terminal form of [[ovarian cancer]]. She was allowed to return to her hometown in Thailand to spend her final days with her family. Upon her return, Soimee filed a civil lawsuit against her traffickers in Thailand, reported to be the first suit of its kind in the country. However, she died in May 2006 before the case was adjudicated. Her adoptive mother has said that she will continue her case in court.

==Background==
Urairat Soimee was born in the [[Lom_Sak_District|Lom Sak]] district of Phetchabun, Thailand. She had three children and a husband, who became disabled due to a car accident. Like many women in her village, she was poor and had little formal education. She went by the nickname "Bua", which means "lotus flower" in Thai. She was recruited to work in Japan by a wealthy neighbor, Patama Kosaka, an alleged childhood friend of Soimee's mother. Kosaka claimed she was married to a Japanese man and that she owned a Thai restaurant in Japan where she wanted Soimee to work as a waitress. The girl had no radio or television and little formal education, and therefore was not aware of the many cases in which women from Thailand were tricked or coerced into prostitution abroad. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

==Forced prostitution in Japan==
Soimee arrived in Japan in 2000 and was transported to [[Yokkaichi]] by a Thai woman named Dao and her husband, where she was told that she would have to work as a prostitute. When she protested, she was told that if she did not comply, she would be sold to a brothel on an island and thrown into the sea if she tried to escape. Soimee was told that she could leave after paying off her debt within five months. During this time, she was locked in the apartment with other Thai sex slaves, and taken out by Dao and her husband to hotel rooms to service customers, ranging from three to six a day. Soimee was forced to service customers even when menstruating, and after having contracted a painful sexually transmitted disease. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

However, at the end of five months, Dao refused to release her, saying that she had been sold to another [[yakuza]] gang and that her debt had increased. It was at that point that Soimee reportedly contacted another Thai sex slave, Pranee, and a Thai friend, Boon, to help her escape. {{cn|date=June 2014}}

==Escape and incarceration==
The circumstances surrounding Dao's death and Urairat's escape are disputed. In an interview with the ''[[Bangkok Post]]'', Soimee claimed that Boon, her friend, came to the apartment and helped her escape, and that Boon eventually killed Dao to prevent her from going to the yakuza. However, the [[Kyodo]] news service reported that Japanese prosecutors accused Soimee of robbery and murder by smashing Dao's head with a bottle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/01/23/national/index.php?news=national_19721754.html Woman's dying wish: to punish traffickers who ruined her life] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312032349/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/01/23/national/index.php?news=national_19721754.html |date=2007-03-12 }}, nationmultimedia.com, 23 January 2006; accessed 10 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite pleas from human rights organizations, Boon was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the murder, and Soimee was sentenced for seven years. While in prison, Soimee was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer and released from custody to spend her remaining days with her family in Thailand.&lt;ref name="terminalcancer"&gt;[http://blog.silveradomedia.com/?p=89 Profile of Urairat Soimee], silveradomedia.com; accessed 10 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court battle and final days==
Patama and her parents, the three traffickers who deceived Soimee and Pranee into coming to Japan, were sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in criminal court. Soimee filed a 4.6 million baht civil lawsuit against the three, reported to be the first of its kind in Thailand. However, she died in May 2006 before her case was adjudicated.&lt;ref name="terminalcancer"/&gt;

Her adoptive mother, Lamyai Kaewkerd, vowed to continue her battle in court. Upon her return to Thailand, Soimee became a strong voice against human trafficking, leading a campaign that urged other victims to step forward. She earned an award from Thailand's Social Development and Human Security Ministry in March 2006 to celebrate International Women's Day for her work in fighting human trafficking.&lt;blockquote&gt;"My wish is for the government and all sides to get tough with human trafficking rackets, the same way it suppresses drugs", she was quoted as saying. "I want my last wish to be fulfilled. It is not only a gift for me, but also for women in general because they shouldn't live through a hellish experience like I have."{{cn|date=June 2014}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''We Will Rock You''''' (often abbreviated as '''''WWRY''''') is a rock [[Musical theatre|musical]] based on the songs of British rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] with a book by [[Ben Elton]]. The musical tells the story of a group of Bohemians who struggle to restore the free exchange of thought, fashion, and live music in a distant future where everyone dresses, thinks and acts the same. Musical instruments and composers are forbidden, and rock music is all but unknown.

Directed by Christopher Renshaw and choreographed by [[Arlene Phillips]], the original [[West End theatre|West End]] production opened at the [[Dominion Theatre]] on 14 May 2002, with [[Tony Vincent]], [[Hannah Jane Fox]], [[Sharon D. Clarke]] and [[Kerry Ellis]] in principal roles. Although the musical was at first panned by critics, it has become an audience favourite, becoming the longest-running musical at the Dominion Theatre, celebrating its tenth anniversary on 14 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1169307/For-time--Queen-Ten-great-hits-sensational-rock-band-todays-The-Mail-Sunday.html For the first time ever...Queen: Ten great hits from the sensational rock band] ''[[The Mail On Sunday]]'' Retrieved 23 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatsonstage.com/photos/theatre/london/E8831337077023/Photos%3A+Robert+De+Niro+rocks+up+to+WWRY%27s+tenth+birthday.html Photos: Robert De Niro rocks up to WWRY's tenth birthday]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518125442/http://www.whatsonstage.com/photos/theatre/london/E8831337077023/Photos%3A%2BRobert%2BDe%2BNiro%2Brocks%2Bup%2Bto%2BWWRY%27s%2Btenth%2Bbirthday.html |date=18 May 2012 }} ''[[Whatsonstage]]'' Retrieved 15 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of the longest-running West End shows|fifteenth longest-running musical in West End history]], the London production closed on 31 May 2014 after a final performance in which Brian May and Roger Taylor both performed.&lt;ref name="close"&gt;A final song, The show must go, on was performed to mark the occasion. The show must go on was the same song the cast performed in the 2014 Westend Eurovision. [http://www.broadwayworld.com/westend/article/WE-WILL-ROCK-YOU-to-Close-at-the-Dominion-May-31-2014031132#.Ux9HbfldV8E WE WILL ROCK YOU to Close at the Dominion, 31 May] broadwayworld, Retrieved 11 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; A number of international productions have since followed the original, and ''We Will Rock You'' has been seen in six of the world's continents. Many productions are still active globally.

==Development==
According to Brian May, Queen's manager [[Jim Beach]] had spoken with the band about creating a jukebox musical with Queen's songs since the mid-1990s. Initially, the intent was to create a biographical story of [[Freddie Mercury]]. About this time, [[Robert De Niro]]'s production company Tribeca expressed interest in a Queen musical, but it found the original idea difficult to work with.&lt;ref name=WWRYbook /&gt;

In 2000, Ben Elton was approached to start talks with May and Taylor on the project. He suggested taking the musical down a different path than initially imagined, creating an original story that would capture the spirit of much of their music. He worked closely with May and Taylor to incorporate Queen's songs into the story. Elton has also stated that he was in part inspired by the computer-controlled [[dystopia]] of the science-fiction film ''[[The Matrix]]''. The script was eventually completed midway through 2001.&lt;ref name="WWRYbook"&gt;''We Will Rock You The Musical by Queen and Ben Elton: The Official Book''. pp. 10–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
London's critics almost uniformly panned the show, criticising the concept and direction. ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that the premise "really is as [[sixth form]] as it sounds", called the production "ruthlessly packaged and manufactured" and opined that the "sometimes funny" libretto exists mainly to "devise more unlikely ways to wring out another Queen song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,766309,00.html|title="We Will Rock You" Guardian Unlimited Arts |work=The Guardian |location=London  | first=Brian | last=Logan | date=15 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' wrote that "Ben Elton should be shot for this risible story."&lt;ref name="BBC 1988767"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1988767.stm|title=Raspberries for Queen's Rhapsody|date=15 May 2002|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2017|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described it as "guaranteed to bore you rigid" and "[[prolefeed]] at its worst."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1988767.stm|title=Raspberries for Queen's Rhapsody|date=2002-05-15|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some individual performances received praise&lt;ref name="BBC 1988767"/&gt; and the production remains a popular success.

==Productions==
===West End and UK tour===
The original production of ''We Will Rock You'' opened on 12 May 2002 at the [[Dominion Theatre]], London, with previews beginning on 26 April. [[Tony Vincent]] played the lead role of Galileo, with [[Hannah Jane Fox]] as Scaramouche, [[Sharon D. Clarke]] as Killer Queen, [[Nigel Planer]] as Pop, Nigel Clauzel as Brit and [[Kerry Ellis]] as Meat. For her performance, Clarke was nominated for "Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical or Entertainment" at the 2003 [[Olivier Awards]].

On 17 August 2005 ''We Will Rock You'' became the longest running musical at that venue, surpassing the previous record-holder ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''.&lt;ref name="dominion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londontheatredirect.com/information/ltdItem.asp?lngID=69&amp;lngCategory=1&amp;datItem=Wed%20Aug%2017%2000:00:00%20UTC+0100%202005 |title=We Will Rock You becomes longest running show at the Dominion. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005135/http://londontheatredirect.com/information/ltdItem.asp?lngID=69&amp;lngCategory=1&amp;datItem=Wed%2BAug%2B17%2B00%3A00%3A00%2BUTC%2B0100%2B2005 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a notable achievement because the Dominion Theatre is one of the largest theatrical venues in West End, with a seating a capacity of 2,163 patrons. At the 2011 [[Laurence Olivier Awards]], the show won the [[Audience Award for Most Popular Show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olivierawards.com/about/previous-winners/view/item120248/olivier-winners-2011/ Olivier Winners 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905073810/http://www.olivierawards.com/about/previous-winners/view/item120248/olivier-winners-2011/ |date=5 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable cast replacements include [[Mig Ayesa]], who played Galileo, taking over from [[Tony Vincent]]. [[Mazz Murray]] took over the role of Killer Queen after [[Sharon D. Clarke]]'s departure in April 2004. Murray left the production in August 2011, which made her the longest running principal cast member, although she left the production briefly in September 2010 for maternity leave. Brenda Edwards, who was an ''X-Factor'' semi-finalist in 2005, is currently performing the role of Killer Queen. On 22 September 2008 ''[[I'd Do Anything (BBC TV series)|I'd Do Anything]]'' semi-finalist, [[Rachel Tucker]], began performing in the role of Meat. She left the production on 19 September 2009. The role was then taken on by Irish born performer Louise Bowden, who had already performed in several prolific musicals including ''Mamma Mia!'', ''Guys and Dolls'' and ''Mary Poppins''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = IDA's Rachel Tucker Joins Queen We Will Rock You | publisher = Whatsonstage.com | date = 10 July 2008 | url = http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8821215617989&amp;title=IDA%92s+Rachel+Tucker+Joins+Queen+We+Will+Rock+You | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130209044639/http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8821215617989&amp;title=IDA%92s+Rachel+Tucker+Joins+Queen+We+Will+Rock+You | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 9 February 2013 | accessdate = 10 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowden unexpectedly quit the production in May 2010. It was then left to Amanda Coutts to perform the role Meat. Coutts was originally Bowden's understudy. The West End production featured a nine piece live band under the musical direction of Stuart Morley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwry-london.co.uk/index.php?page=band |title=We Will Rock You London » The Unofficial Home of We Will Rock You on the West End! |publisher=Wwry-london.co.uk |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005153307/http://www.wwry-london.co.uk/index.php?page=band |archive-date=5 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary: Original London production==

===Act One===
The story is set exactly 300 years in the future in a vaguely [[Orwellian]] world. Earth has been renamed as the "iPlanet" (Planet Mall in older and school productions) and is controlled by the Globalsoft Corporation. ("[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]")
On the iPlanet, mainstream commercial conformity reigns, in which Ga Ga Kids watch the same movies, listen to computer-generated music, wear the same clothes and hold the same thoughts and opinions. Musical instruments are forbidden, and rock music is unknown. ("[[Radio Ga Ga]]")

In the newest graduating class is [[black sheep]], Galileo, who has dreams and hears strange words in his head, most of which are lyrics of songs long since lost, though he does not understand their significance. Despite his teacher's advice, Galileo refuses to conform like the rest of his classmates. ("[[I Want to Break Free]]") Galileo is captured by Khashoggi, commander of Globalsoft's police. The teacher also reveals a second anomaly, a young, [[Goth subculture|goth]] woman named Scaramouche who is openly mocked and derided by her peers ("[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]"). She too is arrested by Khashoggi.

Ruling Globalsoft Corporation is Killer Queen. ("[[Killer Queen]]") She has heard of a prophecy that instruments have been hidden somewhere on the iPlanet in the "place of living rock", and a "bright star" will show the way to them. She orders Khashoggi to get to the bottom of the matter and crush the rebel Bohemians who believe in the prophecy. Killer Queen then basks in her power over the iPlanet. ("[[Play the Game (song)|Play the Game]]" (in some productions "Now I'm Here"))

Galileo and Scaramouche wake up in a hospital. They realise that they are kindred spirits, feared by the rest of their society. ("[[Under Pressure]]") They flee together from the hospital.
Khashoggi has blown up all the rocks on the iPlanet, but cannot find any supposed hidden instruments. Killer queen insists that they have won, and the prophecy will not come to pass. ("[[A Kind of Magic]]")

On the streets, Bohemian couple Britney and Meat climb out of the sewers, where they have been gathering materials to make musical instruments. Britney is a believer in the Dreamer who will fulfil the prophecy, and insists to the cynical Meat that it's the key to bringing real music back into the world. ("[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]") Brit and Meat hear footsteps approaching, and hide.

Galileo and Scaramouche arrive, with Galileo talking about his belief that he has a destiny. He says that he dreamt a name for the woman: "Scaramouche". Britney and Meat reveal themselves, and accuse Galileo and Scaramouche of being spies, because Galileo keeps spouting words of the "sacred text". Galileo insists that he only hears those words in his head. Britney tests Galileo, singing the first few lines of "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]". Galileo responds correctly with the subsequent lines, and Britney realises that he is the Dreamer of the prophecy. They bring Galileo and Scaramouche to the [[Heartbreak Hotel]], which is located at the ruins of the [[Tottenham Court Road tube station]], where the Bohemians have made their home. ("[[Headlong (song)|Headlong]]") Of note, the original London production is staged at the Dominion Theatre, which is located above the real Tottenham Court Road tube station.

The Bohemians explain to Galileo that they take their names after singers long gone, and mourn the deaths of those who died young. ("[[No One But You (Only The Good Die Young)|No One But You]]") The group then celebrate the reason rock bands started playing music in the first place, which was for love. ("[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]")

Khashoggi and his police suddenly arrive at the Heartbreak Hotel, where they round up the Bohemians for capture. Britney breaks free and battles the police in order to enable Galileo and Scaramouche to escape, but in the process is killed.

===Act Two===
The Ga Ga Kids of the iPlanet move on in their regular fashion. ("[[One Vision]]")

Galileo and Scaramouche have escaped the Heartbreak Hotel, and realise that back at the hospital, tracking devices were installed in their heads. They remove them, and upon realising that they are all that's left of the rebels, they confess their love for each other. ("[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]")

The surviving Bohemians have been rounded up by Khashoggi to be tortured. ("[[Flash (song)|Flash]]") When he cannot get any information from them about the prophecy, he has them brain-drained. ("[[Seven Seas of Rhye]]"—[[Interpolation (music)|interpolating]] "[[Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon]]")

Galileo wakes up, and tells Scaramouche that he had a dream that the Bohemians were sent to the Seven Seas of Rhye. Scaramouche agrees they have to go there, but then Galileo insists that she stay because she's a "chick", to which Scaramouche takes offence. They argue, and decide that both of them will go to the Seven Seas of Rhye, but their relationship will be purely professional.

Back at Globalsoft headquarters ("[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]") Khashoggi reports that the Bohemians are no longer a problem. Killer Queen prematurely starts to celebrate. ("[[Don't Stop Me Now]]") Khashoggi interrupts her, explaining that Galileo and Scaramouche escaped. Killer Queen declares this is the last time Khashoggi has disappointed her, and has him brain-drained. ("[[Another One Bites the Dust]]")

Galileo and Scaramouche are making their way to the Seven Seas of Rhye, arguing all the way. ("[[Hammer to Fall]]") At the Seven Seas of Rhye pub in Montreaux, Pop the librarian is serving drinks to the lifeless Bohemians. ("[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]") When Galileo and Scaramouche arrive, Pop explains the full nature of the prophecy to them as inscribed by the three remaining members of the band Queen just before they were sentenced to death (Brian May, his last request being a final guitar solo, apparently delayed his execution for three and a half days). Scaramouche figures out that the bright shining star of the prophecy is rock star Freddie Mercury's statue, and that it's pointing to [[Wembley Stadium]], the "place of living rock". After initially preparing to travel by bicycle, (opening of "[[Bicycle Race]]") Scaramouche protests that the method "isn't very cool", and so they travel there by motorcycle. ("Headlong (reprise)")

Wembley Stadium is in ruins, with no instruments to be found. Reconciling and their love for each other rekindled ("[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]"), Scaramouche inspires Galileo to perform the opening of "[[We Will Rock You]]", and an [[Red Special|electric guitar]] is revealed. Galileo cannot play it, but Scaramouche can. ("[[Brighton Rock (song)|Brighton Rock]] solo") Pop hacks into Globalsoft's network so their music can be heard by everyone on the iPlanet, and Killer Queen is defeated. ("[[Tie Your Mother Down]]", "[[We Will Rock You]] / [[We Are the Champions]]")

After the curtain calls ("[[Live Killers|We Will Rock You &lt;small&gt;(fast version)&lt;/small&gt;]]"), the entire company performs "Bohemian Rhapsody" as an [[encore (concert)|encore]].

===Variations===
International productions of the musical feature changes in the story and song line-up in order to better reach target audiences. All the main characters retain their general personalities across productions, but the names vary depending on the production. (See [[#Characters|characters]] section below).

The dialogue contains many references to popular culture, with lyrics from numerous non-Queen songs and albums inserted into the text. These references are constantly changing, and according to writer Elton, this is to keep the show "fresh".&lt;ref name=WWRYbook /&gt; Songs that have been referenced include [[The Beatles]]' "[[Help! (song)|Help!]]", "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", "[[Penny Lane]]", "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]", "[[I Am the Walrus]]" and "[[Hello, Goodbye]]", [[Little Richard]]'s "[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Fruitti]]" and "[[Long Tall Sally]]", the theme from [[The Wombles]], [[The Goodies]]' "[[Funky Gibbon]]", [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[Born to Run (Bruce Springsteen song)|Born to Run]]", [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Rebel Rebel]]" and "[[Space Oddity]]", [[The Wild Ones (band)|The Wild Ones']] "[[Wild Thing (Chip Taylor song)|Wild Thing]]", [[Rolling Stones]]' "[[Honky Tonk Women]]", [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]", [[ABBA]]'s "[[Dancing Queen]]" and "[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]", [[Oasis (band)|Oasis']] "[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]", [[Eminem]]'s "[[The Real Slim Shady]]", [[Spice Girls]]' "[[Wannabe (song)|Wannabe]]", [[Elton John]]'s "[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (song)|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]", [[Black Lace (band)|Black Lace's]] "[[Agadoo]]", [[The Clash]]'s "[[Complete Control]]", ''[[Teletubbies]]'' and songs by [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Michael Jackson]].

May often performs with the London production on special occasions such as anniversaries&lt;ref name="MayAnniversary"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130118123721/http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbmay06a.html WWRY ANNIVERSARY, entry 13 May 2006] – Brian May's blog&lt;/ref&gt; and Freddie Mercury's birthday.&lt;ref name="FreddieBirthday"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130119043009/http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbsep06a.html September 2006] – Brian May's blog&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hannah Jane Fox]], who originated Scaramouche, was the last original principal cast member to remain with the show. She gave her final performance on 28 January 2006, four years after the musical opened at the Dominion Theatre, and the event was celebrated with May appearing on stage to perform the guitar solo during the "Bohemian Rhapsody" encore.&lt;ref name="HannahJaneFoxFinal"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130118112541/http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbjan06.html HANNAH JANE FOX'S LAST NIGHT, entry 29 January 2006] – Brian May's blog&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 2006, the London show celebrated what would have been Freddie Mercury's 60th birthday. During the song "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]", ordinarily sung by Killer Queen, the band "[[McFly]]" (who were at No. 1 with the song on the singles charts the previous week) emerged onto the stage to sing it instead.&lt;ref name="McFly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popdirt.com/we-will-rock-you-charity-performance/52293/|title=McFly - popdirt.com|website=popdirt.com|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian May and Roger Taylor joined the encore, performing Taylor's "[[Say It's Not True]]" as a duo. Ben Elton also addressed the audience on this special occasion. The following week, tickets to the London show were sold from £19.46, Mercury's birth year.

On 14 May 2007, the London show celebrated its fifth anniversary with a special show featuring both May and Taylor playing in the final section of the show. Writer Ben Elton also made an appearance to present a special plaque to the cast, May and Taylor. During the portion of the show based in Pop's bar, the line "But the Pub Landlord has a Bike" was followed by a cameo appearance of British comedian [[Al Murray]], who came up through the stage on a motorcycle.&lt;ref name="FifthYear"&gt;[http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8821179224111 Queen's May &amp; Taylor Rock Fifth Birthday, by Terri Paddock, 15 May 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616054428/http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8821179224111 |date=16 June 2011 }} – WhatsOnStage.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The London show's sixth anniversary performance was held on 21 May 2008, a week after its actual anniversary due to the unavailability of Brian May. For the first time since the show opened, the Killer Queen character performed the entire song "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]", a musical number which is normally interrupted by the Khashoggi character. This unique performance is acknowledged by Killer Queen's dialogue: "No, you didn't let me finish, you never let me finish. For six long years, night after night, week after week, year after year. Well, tonight, I'm going to finish." To which Khashoggi replied: "It's not in the script!" The Killer Queen proceeded to yell "Screw the script!" before continuing the song. Additionally, May joined Killer Queen and the dancers on stage for the performance. After the encore, Elton made a thank you speech, after which the entire cast performed "[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]", accompanied by May on guitar.

The seventh anniversary of the London Show was celebrated on Monday 18 May 2009. The show contained a special appearance from Brian May and Ben Elton who emerged together in a cloud of smoke during the encore rendition of "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" with May playing guitar. As with the year before, Elton gave a thank you speech and the entire cast performed "[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]", accompanied by May on guitar.

On Saturday 12 September 2009 at the early matinee performance Brian May again emerged in a cloud of smoke playing the guitar in "Bohemian Rhapsody". What was the occasion for this appearance is not clear. He did the same again on Saturday 14 November 2009 at the matinee.

On Sunday 31 January 2010 in The O2 Dublin, Brian May once again played Bohemian Rhapsody with the company during the finale of both the matinee and evening shows to celebrate the end of their year-long tour.

On Saturday 5 September 2010 Brian also appeared though a cloud of smoke, again to play "Bohemian Rhapsody". This was due to the annual cast change, as well as a celebration of what would have been [[Freddie Mercury]]'s 64th birthday, and afterwards Brian gave a farewell speech to the cast that were leaving.

On Saturday 5 October 2013, Brian appeared through the cloud of smoke to play Bohemian Rhapsody once more.  This was because it was cast change and some of the cast were leaving.  Brian appeared to be very emotional when he was giving his speech.

==Shows with Queen==
Queen guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Meddows Taylor|Roger Taylor]] often perform at premieres and special events. Bassist [[John Deacon]] left [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1997, and hasn't performed with May or Taylor since.

When Bohemian Rhapsody is performed with Brian and Roger, Brian comes up from a trap in the stage with a lot of smoke (only at [[Dominion Theatre]]. Elsewhere he is walking from the Wembley gate in the back, to the front of stage.) He performs the solo right before the opera section. Then the opera section begins, he walks off stage. Doing the headbanging section Roger comes up on the Heartbreak Hotel platform and Brian runs back on stage (only at [[Dominion Theatre]]. Elsewhere Roger's drum kit is being pushed by stage crew and Brian runs on stage.) They perform the headbanging section with the cast and the low key section. They end it all with a big ending before the stage goes into blackout.

==Characters==
'''Galileo Figaro''' – The central character of the musical; a dreamer who hears strange words in his head. He is eventually revealed to be a reincarnation of Freddie Mercury. The character's name is a reference to the lyrics in the Queen song "Bohemian Rhapsody".

'''Scaramouche''' – A sarcastic, cynical character and Galileo's love interest. In the finale she shows talent playing the electric guitar, and Galileo declares that she is a reincarnation of Brian May, only this time "he's a babe". The character's name is a reference to the lyrics in the Queen song "Bohemian Rhapsody".

'''Killer Queen''' – The villain of the musical, she rules over iPlanet with an iron fist. The character's name is a reference to the Queen song "Killer Queen".

'''Brit''' (alternately '''Paris''', '''Duff''', '''Vic''' and '''J.B.''') – Brit, short for [[Britney Spears]], is the main male Bohemian rebel. In other productions, his name is either Paris (short for [[Paris Hilton]]), Duff (short for [[Hilary Duff]]), Vic (short for [[Victoria Beckham]]) or J.B. (short for [[Jeanette Biedermann]]).

'''Meat''' (alternately '''Oz''', '''Ozzy''') – Meat, short for [[Meat Loaf]], is the main female Bohemian. In some productions, the character is named Oz after [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

'''Commander Khashoggi''' – Killer Queen's second-in-command, he is head of Globalsoft's police and carries out Killer Queen's dirty work. The character's name is a reference to the Queen song "Khashoggi's Ship" (which is about the real life Saudi arms dealer [[Adnan Khashoggi]]).

'''Pop''' (alternately '''Polo''', '''Bap''', '''DJ''', '''Buddy''') – An elderly librarian trying to figure out the "exact date the music died", in some productions in love with Scaramouche, believed to be named after the creation of reality television talent shows (the example given varies depending on the production, but includes ''[[Popstars]]'', ''[[Pop Idol]]'', ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'', or the relevant regional variant). Probably named for [[Iggy Pop]] or simply a diminutive for "Grandfather". In the German production his full name is "Bap Niedecken". The name refers to the German band "Bap" (Cologne dialect for "Papa" = "Father") and the singer Wolfgang Niedecken. In the Brazillian production his name is "Toca Raul", a reference to [[Raul Seixas]], and to a popular expression associated with him (Toca Raul = Play Raul) but that is also said during many rock concerts in Brazil, regardless of the singer.

'''Other Bohemians''' – The other Bohemians have constantly changing names following media trends. These are usually music-related, and have included [[Paul McCartney]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Robbie Williams]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Bob the Builder]], [[Boy George]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Spice Girls]], [[Elton John]], [[Jackson Five]], [[Prince (singer)|Prince]], [[Burton Cummings]], [[John Farnham]], [[Charlotte Church]], [[Crazy Frog]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Lily Allen]], [[Kelly Osbourne]] and [[Clay Aiken]], [[Cheeky Girls]], [[Kurt Cobain]]  and recently [[Michael Jackson]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Gary Barlow]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Jay Z]] and [[Frankie Valli]].

Later in the London production, the "One Vision" sequence was changed to include Freddie Mercury's recorded vocals for the bridge. Previously, the bridge had been sung by the ensemble.

In the original London production, "Fat-Bottomed Girls" was a short instrumental interlude prior to "Another One Bites the Dust". Subsequent international productions expanded the song into a full song and dance sequence. Due to the positive response, the change was transferred back to the London production.

For the single-act Las Vegas production, "Who Wants to Live Forever" is replaced by "[[You're My Best Friend (Queen song)|You're My Best Friend]]". In the 2013-2014 North American tour, "You're My Best Friend" is added after "I Want It All." "Who Wants To Live Forever" is reinstated, after "Flash" and "Seven Seas of Rhye."

For the Australasian tour, Canadian production and the 2013-14 North American tour, "Play the Game" is replaced by "[[Now I'm Here]]".

For the revamped Canadian production and the 2013-14 North American tour, "One Vision" is removed. "Flash" and "Seven Seas Of Rhye" are repositioned to the start of Act Two.

On special occasions, "[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]" is added to the encore.&lt;ref name=MayAnniversary /&gt;&lt;ref name=FifthYear /&gt;

In 2004, Kerry Ellis, who was the original Meat in the London production, worked with Brian May to record an instrumental studio version of "No One but You (Only the Good Die Young)". This version is available through the official Queen website and in Ellis' limited-release CD single titled ''Wicked in Rock''.&lt;ref name="NoOneButYou"&gt;[http://queenonline.com/kerryellisdownload/ Kerry Ellis performs No-One But You] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033608/http://queenonline.com/kerryellisdownload/ |date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dresscircle.co.uk/product.asp?StockID=33943 Kerry Ellis' "Wicked in Rock" single] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124140622/http://www.dresscircle.co.uk/product.asp?StockID=33943 |date=24 January 2010 }} – Dress Circle website, exclusive distributor&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed film adaptation===
At the time of launching the musical, [[Robert De Niro]] referred to the possibility of a film version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8821017151572/Producer+De+Niro+Flies+In+to+Launch+We+Will+Rock+You.html Producer De Niro Flies In to Launch We Will Rock You] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020161449/http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8821017151572/Producer+De+Niro+Flies+In+to+Launch+We+Will+Rock+You.html |date=20 October 2012 }}, ''What's On Stage'', 26 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 interview with the [[BBC]], [[Brian May]] said that a film version was proposed, and that [[Ben Elton]] had written a full script with a "grittier" storyline. He emphasised that a lot more action can be included during the songs in a film than in a stage musical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bristol/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8261000/8261903.stm May talks about We Will Rock You], BBC Bristol, 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therockdose.com/queens-we-will-rock-you-musical-being-made-into-movie/|date=20 September 2009|title=Queen’s "We Will Rock You" Musical Being Made into Movie|work=The Rock Dose|accessdate=8 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925091110/http://www.therockdose.com/queens-we-will-rock-you-musical-being-made-into-movie/|archivedate=25 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queenzone.com/news/we-will-rock-you-movie-in-the-works-.aspx |title="We Will Rock You" movie in the works.... |date=20 September 2009 |work=Queen Zone |accessdate=8 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924232811/http://www.queenzone.com/news/we-will-rock-you-movie-in-the-works-.aspx |archivedate=24 September 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Üzemchin''' ([[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: Үзэмчин), also written '''Ujumchin''', '''Ujumucin''' or '''Ujimqin''', are a subgroup of [[Mongols]] in eastern [[Mongolia]] and [[Inner Mongolia]]. They settle mainly in [[Sergelen, Dornod|Sergelen]], [[Bayantümen, Dornod|Bayantu'men]], [[Choibalsan (city)|Choibalsan city]] of the [[Dornod Province]] and in [[Xilin Gol League]] of the [[Inner Mongolia]]. In Mongolia, Some Üzemchins migrated there from Xilin Gol immediately after China was freed from the Japanese in 1945.

The Üzemchin was included the [[Chahar Mongols|Chahar]] tumen of the six tumen eastern Mongols in [[Northern Yuan Dynasty]]. The land of Ongon-Dural, the third son of [[Bodi Alagh Khan]] of the [[Northern Yuan]] was called Üzemchin. The name probably originates from the Mongolian language word "uzem" meaning "[[raisin]]" as in "raisin pickers/collectors."

The Üzemchin language is a dialect of [[Chakhar Mongolian]].
