A former slave, she joined the [[People's Liberation Army]] and rose to prominence during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when she became Vice-Chairwoman of the [[Revolutionary committee (China)|Revolutionary Committee]] of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] (TAR). She was a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] for 14 years and was the only woman leader in the TAR government from 1979 to 2002.

==Biography==
Basang was born in March 1937 in [[Gonggar County|Gongkar]], [[Shannan, Tibet|Lhokha]], Tibet.&lt;ref name=nccu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cped.nccu.edu.tw/node/1140016 |title=Basang |publisher=[[National Chengchi University]] |date=2015-06-05 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GyatsoHavnevik2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gyatso |first1=Janet |last2=Havnevik |first2=Hanna |title=Women in Tibet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xHYA34GnfAAC&amp;pg=PA305 |year=2005 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-13098-1 |pages=305–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were slaves, and after her mother died in 1947, Basang worked as a slave for nine years for the landlord of Chika.&lt;ref name="BartkeSchier1985"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bartke |first1=Wolfgang |last2=Schier |first2=Peter |title=China's New Party Leadership: Biographies and Analysis of the Twelfth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsavCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |year=1985 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |isbn=978-1-349-07968-1 |pages=86–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The International Who's Who 2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sR4Ch1dMe8IC&amp;pg=PA119 |year=2003 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-1-85743-217-6 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Basang escaped from slavery and joined the Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]].&lt;ref name="BartkeSchier1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GyatsoHavnevik2005"/&gt; She was sent to study at the [[Tibet Public School]] (now Tibet Minzu University) in [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]] Province.&lt;ref name=nccu/&gt;&lt;ref name="GyatsoHavnevik2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BartkeSchier1985"/&gt; She joined the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) in May 1959, and became a cadre in [[Nêdong County]], and later [[Nang County]], both in Tibet. In July 1965 she was promoted to deputy [[county magistrate]] of Nang.&lt;ref name=nccu/&gt;

Basang rose to national prominence during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. In May 1966, her article praising [[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]] was published in the ''[[People's Daily]]'', the official CPC mouthpiece.&lt;ref name="BartkeSchier1985"/&gt; In September 1969, when the [[Revolutionary committee (China)|Revolutionary Committee]] of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) was established to replace regional government and Party organs, she was elected its Vice-Chairwoman.&lt;ref name="GyatsoHavnevik2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BartkeSchier1985"/&gt;

She was elected Secretary of the new CPC Secretariat of TAR in August 1971, and Chairwoman of the Tibet Women's Federation in July 1973.&lt;ref name="BartkeSchier1985"/&gt; In August 1973, she became a member of the [[10th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref name="GyatsoHavnevik2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BartkeSchier1985"/&gt; After [[Deng Xiaoping]] came to power, most leaders who rose to prominence during the Cultural Revolution lost their positions, but Basang was reelected to the [[11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|11th]] and [[12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|12th]] Central Committees, keeping her seat until 1987.&lt;ref name=nccu/&gt;&lt;ref name="GyatsoHavnevik2005"/&gt;

Starting in 1979, Basang successively served as Deputy Chairwoman of TAR, Deputy Party Chief of TAR, and Deputy Chairwoman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) of TAR. She was concurrently Vice-Chairwoman of the [[All-China Women's Federation]] from 1998 to 2003.&lt;ref name=nccu/&gt; By the time she retired in late 2002, she had served for 24 years as the only woman in the leadership of the Tibet Autonomous Region.&lt;ref name="Barnett2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnett |first=Robert |title=Lhasa: Streets with Memories |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2JNAYE7dWTYC&amp;pg=PA193 |year=2006 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-51011-0 |page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to be a member of the National CPPCC until 2013.&lt;ref name=nccu/&gt;

'''Blood Law''' (also called ''blood revenge'') is the practice in traditional [[American Indians in the United States|American Indian]] customary law where responsibility for seeing that homicide is punished falls on the [[clan]] of the victim. The responsibility for revenge fell to a close family member (usually the closest male relative). 

==Description==
In contrast to the Western notion of justice blood law was based on the belief that the soul/ghost of the victim would be forced to wander the earth, not allowed to go to the afterlife, unless harmony was restored. The death of the killer (or member of the killer's clan) restored the balance.

Since this was the widely accepted custom, blood revenge ''prevented'' feuding. The families and clans of victims and perpetrators were at peace once the balance was restored. It was not uncommon for the clan of the killer to carry out the execution. There was motivation for this - if the offending party evaded retribution, any member of the offended clan could assess the penalty against any member of the offender's clan.

The blood law worked without any government, since it was enforced by clans on a local level. Neither was there any formal trial. However, there were customary ways of getting a hearing. E.g. Cherokees had four towns of refuge, where people were not allowed to seek revenge. Also, an avenger could not touch an accused on a priest's property. The priest could arbitrate or call for a Council to examine evidence and witnesses.

{{quote|Blood revenge was a question of harmony, not necessarily of a vendetta. If a member from one clan killed the member of another, then balance must be restored. Blood revenge was considered very sacred and was carried out under the utmost sincerity. If a member of the clan a) should kill a member of the clan b), the clan b) would be owed one life, and the clan a) would pay with a life. Usually, the eldest brother or nearest male relative of a victim was expected to be the avenger of spilled blood. As far as the aggressor concerns, the entire clan was responsible for the crime of one of its members, and there were no exceptions. It was a system that worked well for the Cherokees, because relatives themselves would bring the fugitive to justice to avoid like punishment.|Cherokee by Blood Society|[https://web.archive.org/web/20070815005733/http://www.cherokeebyblood.com/justice.htm Justice]}}

The [[United States]] discouraged the Blood Law, but generally left to the tribes the enforcement of the prohibition unless the murdered victim was non-Indian. Also, the government sometimes stepped in when blood law threatened to lead to war between two different tribes.

Currently in the United States, only state and federal governments or military courts can impose the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]]. Justice under Blood Law would be considered revenge killing or summary [[murder]], and also could be an additional aggravating circumstance requiring the death penalty for the crime.

==Misuse of "Blood Law"==
The term "blood law" is sometimes used in a looser sense, to mean ''any'' form of capital punishment, or any form of collective revenge without a formal trial. In this broader sense, blood law was common in Western societies. It was called [[outlaw]]ing, and was practiced as a part of [[common law]] in England, Europe, and Iceland. A person could be declared an outlaw for refusing to submit to a legal system. Thereafter, such a person had no recourse to the legal system, and could legally be killed or robbed. The use of "blood law" to refer to outlawry may be considered ethnocentric.

The term has also been improperly used to refer to a law passed by the Cherokee General Council on October 24, 1829, which specified capital punishment for selling Cherokee lands to foreign governments, in particular the United States.

{{quote|Whereas; a law has been in existence for many years, but not committed to writing,  that if any citizen or citizens of this Nation should treat and dispose of any lands belonging to this Nation without special permission from the National authorities, he or they shall suffer death; 
Therefore;  resolved, by the Committee and Council, in General Council convened,  that any person or persons who shall, contrary to the will and consent of the legislative council of this Nation in general council convened, enter into a treaty with any commissioner or commissioners of the United States, or any officers instructed for that purpose, and agree to sell or dispose of any part or portion of the National lands defined in this Constitution of this Nation, he or they so offending, upon conviction before any of the circuit judges aforesaid are authorized to call a court for the trial of any such person or persons so transgressing. 
Be it Further Resolved;  that any person or persons, who shall violate the provisions of this act, and shall refuse, by resistance, to appear at the place designated for trial, or abscond, are hereby declared to be outlaws; and any person or persons, citizens of this Nation, may kill him or them so offending, in any manner most convenient, within the limits of this Nation, and shall not be held accountable for the same.|Cherokee General Council}}

Since this refers to Cherokee Government law rather than traditional clan enforced law, and does not pertain to homicide, this is not blood law as understood by historians and Cherokee tradition. In fact, Cherokee blood law had been reformed in 1808 and abolished in 1810, with the introduction of the "lighthorse" police force.

This and similar "blood laws" led to low-level civil war among several of the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] during and following their removal to the [[American West|West]]. The most noted were the friction between the Lower [[Creek (people)|Creek]]s and the Upper Creeks and the killings between the [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] and [[Major Ridge|Ridge]] factions of the [[Cherokee]] Nation; both of which lasted from the 1820s to the [[American Civil War]]. Among those who were executed under such laws were [[Major Ridge]], [[John Ridge]], and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]].

'''''Case v. Minot''''', 158 Mass. 577 (1893), was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of Massachusetts]] that was one of the first cases to hold that inaction by a [[landlord]] could establish a [[constructive eviction]].&lt;ref&gt;Casner, A.J. et al.  ''Cases and Text on Property, Fifth Edition.''  Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2004, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
The court held that the landlord was responsible for the constructive eviction of a tenant when the landlord allowed another lessee to obstruct the tenant's light and air.  Traditionally, constructive eviction was only found when the landlord had acted intentionally to interfere with the tenant's possession of their lease.&lt;ref&gt;Casner, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''charterparty''' (sometimes '''charter-party''') is a maritime contract between a [[shipowner]] and a  "charterer" for the hire of either a ship for the carriage of passengers or cargo, or a yacht for pleasure purposes.
 
The name "charterparty" is an [[anglicisation]] the [[French language|French]] ''charte partie'', or "split paper", i.e. a document written in duplicate so that each party retains half.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Charter-party|volume=5|pages=953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Latin]] term ''charta partita'' is a [[back-formation]], and not a true etymological source.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In a '''[[demise charter|demise]] (or bareboat) charter''', the charterer takes responsibility for the crewing and maintenance of the ship during the time of the charter. He assumes the legal responsibilities of the owner, and is known as a disponent owner.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
* In a '''[[time charter]]''', the vessel is hired for a specific amount of time. The shipowner manages the vessel but the charterer gives orders for the employment of the vessel, and may sub-charter the vessel on a time charter or voyage charter basis. 
* In a '''[[voyage charter]]''', the charterer hires the vessel for a single voyage, but the shipowner provides the master, crew, [[bunkers]] and supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maritimeknowhow.com/English/Know-How/Chartering/types_of_contracts_of_affreightment/voyage_charter.html Maritimeknowhow website: voyage charter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714034807/http://www.maritimeknowhow.com/English/Know-How/Chartering/types_of_contracts_of_affreightment/voyage_charter.html |date=July 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A demise charter operates as a long lease of the vessel, with the charterer completely in charge.  In time and voyage charters, the shipowner still runs the ship, but when in port the charterer becomes responsible for loading and unloading the ship within the agreed period of [[laytime]]. If the charterer exceeds the allowed laytime, [[demurrage]]&lt;ref&gt;"Demurrage" is a form of [[liquidated damages]], a penalty for exceeding laytime.&lt;/ref&gt; becomes payable.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armament SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale|Suisse Atlantique]]" case&lt;/ref&gt;

In a voyage charter, the route is pre-arranged and the charterer has little scope to interfere with the programme. By contrast, the time charter is almost a halfway-house between a demise charter and a voyage charter, in that the charterer decides on the voyages and the ports, and instructs the shipowner's crew to comply. This can lead to issues of [[indemnity]]: whereas the shipowner in a voyage charter takes responsibility for the ship, in a time charter the shipowner may need to be indemnified against losses or liabilities [[Proximate cause|proximately caused]] by the charterer.

==Legal aspects of charterparties==

Whereas a charterparty is the contract between a shipowner and a charterer, a contract of carriage lies between the shipper and the carrier. A carrier will issue a shipper with a [[bill of lading]], a receipt for cargo shipped which also serves as evidence of the contract of carriage. (In a demise charter, the charterer is the carrier; in a time or voyage charter the shipowner is the carrier).

The US  [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act]] (COGSA), and the UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] (which ratifies and incorporates the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]) do NOT apply to charterparties, but do apply to bills of lading (and similar documents such as ships delivery orders, or sea waybills).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a bill of lading is issued to a charterer by the shipowner, the question arises as to which is the dominant document.&lt;ref&gt;''The Draupner'' [1910] AC 450, HL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Henryk Sif'' [1982] 1 LL R 456&lt;/ref&gt; If a shipper returns a bill of lading to a carrier (perhaps as a [[Pledge (law)|pledge]]), the carrier will hold it only as a token of the pledge.

In both USA and the UK, the COGSA legislation provide a statement of the minimum duties that a carrier owes to the cargo-owner.  If the charterer has shipped cargo, charterparty document may incorporate the COGSA or the Harter Act, since the charter is also a cargo-owner. Such an incorporation is valid and enforceable even without the issuance of a bill of lading. In the reverse case, if a carrier issues a third-party shipper with a bill of lading that incorporates charterparty terms, the shipper/cargo-owner would not be liable for fees such as [[demurrage]], which are payable only by a charter.

Lawsuits brought for the breach of an obligation under a charterparty fall within admiralty jurisdiction. If a breach of charter terms creates a maritime lien, the suit may be ''in rem'' (i.e. against the vessel itself).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In pleasure boating, the most frequent charter arrangement is bareboat [[yacht charter]]. A voyage or time charter is used only for larger yachts and is uncommon. Yacht charter flotillas are mostly made up of boats belonging to individuals or companies who only use their boats on a part-time basis or as an investment. A recent innovation in recreational boating is "time-share chartering" whereby several charterers are assigned a certain number of days per month or season in a manner which resembles real-estate time-share.

==Typical clauses==

A charterparty may contain these clauses.

===Bunker clause===

A [[bunkers|bunker]] clause stipulates that the charterer shall accept and pay for all fuel oil in the vessel's bunkers at port of delivery and conversely, (owners) shall pay for all fuel oil in the vessel's bunkers at port of re-delivery at current price at the respective ports. It is customary to agree upon a certain minimum and maximum quantity in bunkers on re-delivery of the vessel. Since the [[OW Bunker]] test case, ship operators need to take care to ensure that bunker supply terms are suitable.

===Ship clause===

Under this clause, the owner of the ship writes clearly that the ship would be seaworthy at the start of the voyage in every respect, in other words, the ship would be appropriate to travel to the country for which it is taken.

===Ice clause===

An ice clause is inserted in a [[bill of lading]] or a charterparty when a vessel is bound for a port or ports which may be closed to shipping by ice when the vessel arrives or after the vessel's arrival.

===Lighterage clause===

A lighterage clause is inserted into charter-parties which show as port of discharge any safe port in a certain range, e.g. Havre/Hamburg range.

===Negligence clause===

A negligence clause tends to exclude shipowner's or carrier's liability for loss or damage resulting from an act, default or neglect of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the carrier in the navigation of manoeuvring of a ship, not resulting, however, from want of due diligence by the owners of the ship or any of them or by the ship's husband or manager.

===Ready berth clause===

A ready berth clause is inserted in a charterparty, ''i.e.'' a stipulation to the effect that [[layday]]s will begin to count as soon as the vessel has arrived at the port of loading or discharge "whether in berth or not". It protects shipowner's interests against delays which arise from ships having to wait for a [[berth (moorings)|berth]].

{{Family law}}
'''Child custody''' and ''[[legal guardian]]ship'' are [[Law|legal]] terms which are used to describe the legal and practical relationship between a [[parent]] or guardian and a child in that person's care, such as the right to make decisions on behalf of a child and the duty to care for and support the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changes in Custody|url=https://cssd.dc.gov/page/changes-custody|website=DC.gov - Child Support Services Division|publisher=Washington D.C.|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[ratification]] of the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in most countries, terms such as [[parental responsibility (access and custody)|parental responsibility]], "[[Residence in English family law|residence]]" and "[[contact (law)|contact]]" (also known as "visitation", "conservatorship" or "parenting time" in the [[United States]]) have superseded the concepts of "custody" and "access" in some member nations. Instead of a parent having "custody" of or "access" to a child, a child is now said to "reside" or have "contact" with a parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Detrick|first1=Sharon|title=A Commentary on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child|date=1999|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9041112294|page=176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QB6UB1SCxbsC|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
Residence and contact issues typically arise in proceedings involving [[divorce]] (dissolution of marriage), [[annulment]], and other legal proceedings where children may be involved. In most [[jurisdiction]]s the issue of which parent the child will reside with is determined in accordance with the [[best interests|best interests of the child]] standard.&lt;ref name="unhcr"/&gt;

===Parental conflict===
[[Family law]] proceedings that involve issues of residence and contact often generate the most acrimonious disputes. While most parents cooperate when it comes to sharing their children and resort to mediation to settle a dispute, not all do. For those that engage in litigation, there seem to be few limits. Court filings quickly fill with mutual accusations by one parent against the other, including [[sexual abuse|sexual]], [[physical abuse|physical]], and [[emotional abuse]], [[brainwashing|brain-washing]], [[sabotage]], and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]]. Custody battles are not in the child's best interest and are often used by an angry parent in order to control his/her former partner.

In some places, courts and legal professionals are beginning to use the term parenting schedule instead of custody and visitation.  The new terminology eliminates the distinction between custodial and noncustodial parents, and also attempts to build upon the best interests of the children by crafting schedules that meet the developmental needs of the children.  For example, younger children need shorter, more frequent time with parents, whereas older children and teenagers may demand less frequent shifts yet longer blocks of time with each parent.

===Jurisdiction===
A child custody case must be filed in a court that has jurisdiction over the child custody disputes. Jurisdiction normally arises from the presence of the children as legal residents of the nation or state where a custody case is filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Custody Orders Across State-Lines/Overseas |url=https://www.americanbar.org/portals/public_resources/aba_home_front/information_center/family_law/children/custody/custody_orders_across_state_lines_overseas.html |website=American Bar Association |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some nations may recognize jurisdiction based upon a child's citizenship even though the child resides in another country, or may allow a court to take jurisdiction over a child custody case either on a temporary or permanent basis based upon other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rush |first1=Sharon E. |title=Domestic Relations Law: Federal Jurisdiction a nd State Sovereignty in Perspective |journal=Notre Dame Law Review |date=1984 |volume=60 |issue=1 |page=438 |url=https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&amp;article=1463&amp;context=facultypub |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forum shopping]] may occur both between nations and, where laws and practices differ between areas, within a nation. If a plaintiff files a legal jurisdiction that the plaintiff believes to have more favorable laws than other possible jurisdictions, that plaintiff may be accused of forum shopping.

The [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction|Hague Convention]] seeks to avoid this,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crouch|first1=John|title=International Child Custody Cases|journal=GPSolo|date=October 1999|url=https://www.americanbar.org/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/oct99cro.html|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; also in the [[United States of America]], the [[Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act]] was adopted by all 50 states, family law courts were forced to defer jurisdiction to the home state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Barry J.|title=The Interstate Child: UCCJEA &amp; UIFSA|url=http://www.wicsec.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/W-31-The-Interstate-Child-Handout-Barry-Brooks-Jeff-Ball-Chris-Sorenson-CLE.pdf|website=WICSEC|publisher=Western Interstate Child Support Enforcement Council|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender ===
As the roles of children have changed over the past couple of centuries from economic assets to individuals, so has the role of mothers and fathers in who would provide the best care for the child. Many courts and judges lean more towards the maternal figure when there is a trial for custody of a child. According to Family Change and Time Allocation in American Families study done at UCLA, women allocate about 13.9 hours a week to child care while men allocate about 7 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bianchi|first=Suzanne|date=November 2010|title=Family Change and Time Allocation in American Families|url=http://workplaceflexibility.org/images/uploads/program_papers/bianchi_-_family_change_and_time_allocation_in_american_families.pdf|journal=Focus on Workplace Flexibility|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, according to the Current Population Survey, in 2013, custodial mothers were more likely to have child support agreements (52.3 percent) comparative to custodial fathers (31.4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-tps04.html|title=New Custodial Mothers and Fathers and Their Child Support Report|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women’s and father’s rights activists often become involved in matters of child custody since the issue of equal parenting is controversial, most of the time combining the interests of the child with those of the mothers or fathers. Women’s rights activists are concerned about “family violence, recognizing primary caregiving, and inequities associated with awarding legal joint custody without a corresponding responsibility for child care involvement”.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kruk|first=Edward|date=2011|title=A Model Equal Parental Responsibility Presumption in Contested Child Custody|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezp.slu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&amp;sid=3f7f9166-1c2e-4956-8da1-917558eb6257%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4110|journal=The American Journal of Family Therapy|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Father’s rights activists are more concerned about their “disenfranchisement from children’s lives, the importance of parent-child attachment, combating parental alienation, and access enforcement”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Courts cannot determine an individual child’s best interests with certainty, and judges are “forced to rely on their own interpretations of children’s interests, and idiosyncratic biases and subjective value-based judgments, including gender bias”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Judges are currently using the ‘best interest of the child’ standard that was made to consider the interests of the child before the mothers and fathers, including the child’s mental, emotional, physical, religious, and social needs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crowley|first=Joceplyn|date=Fall 2009|title=Taking Custody of Motherhood: Fathers' Rights Activists and the Politics of Parenting|jstor=27740591|journal=Women Studies Quarterly|volume=37|pages=223–240|doi=10.1353/wsq.0.0167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child poverty, lack of resources, and women’s economic dependence on men all remain pressing issues that are not effectively noted during the custody trials.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Physical==
'''Physical custody''' involves the day-to-day care of a child and establishes where a child will live.  If a parent has physical custody of a child, that parent's home will normally be the legal residence ([[domicile (law)|domicile]]) of the minor child. In custody cases, the schedule for which parent provides lodging and care for the child is defined by a court-ordered custody schedule (also known as a '''"[[parenting plan]]"''' or '''"parenting schedule"''').

===Forms===
Forms of physical custody include,
*'''[[Alternating custody]]''', an arrangement whereby the child or children live for an extended period of time with one parent and an alternate amount of time with the other parent. This type of arrangement is also referred to as Divided custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carol|first1=B.S.|title=Who owns the child? Divorce and child custody decisions in middle-class families|journal=Social Problems|date=1 April 1976|volume=23|issue=4|pages=505–515|url=https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/23/4/505/1708643|accessdate=3 October 2017|doi=10.2307/799859}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Shared custody]]''', an arrangement whereby the child/children live for an extended period of time with one parent, and then for a similar amount of time with the other parent. Opposite to [[alternating custody]], both parents retain authority over the child or children.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Determination of Child Custody in the USA'' [http://www.stanford.edu/group/psylawseminar/Child%20Custody%20in%20the%20USA%20%28Page%201%20of%205%29.htm] written by Joan B. Kelly, Ph.D. for [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Bird's nest custody]]''', an arrangement whereby the parents go back and forth from a residence in which the child/children reside, placing the burden of upheaval and movement on the parents rather than the child or children.
*'''[[Joint custody]]''', an arrangement whereby both parents share physical custody. (''la garde conjointe'' in French&lt;ref name=CANADA&gt;See the document published by the Canadian government [http://www.justice.gov.nt.ca/pdf/Family/Custody_Access_FR.pdf here]. The document is also available for download [https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B-iOqOKLc35PUFZJQi02Yy1TMkdzaDlOTXlmNDRCQQ here]&lt;/ref&gt;) 
*'''[[Sole custody]]''' (''la garde exclusive'' in French&lt;ref name="CANADA"/&gt;), an arrangement whereby only one parent has physical custody of the child or children.
*'''[[Split custody]]''' (''la garde divisée'' in French&lt;ref name="CANADA"/&gt;), an arrangement whereby one parent has full-time custody over some children, and the other parent has full custody over the other children.
*'''[[Third-party custody]]''', an arrangement whereby the children do not remain with either biological parent, and are placed under the custody of a third person.

===Joint===
''Joint physical custody'' involves a [[court order]] that awards custody of a child to both parties. In joint custody, both parents are ''custodial parents'' and neither parent is a non-custodial parent; in other words, the child has two custodial parents.

If a child has legal residence with both parents, the parents share '''"joint physical custody"''' and each parent is said to be a '''"custodial parent"'''. Thus, in joint physical custody, neither parent is said to be a "non-custodial parent."&lt;ref name="leginfo1"&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&amp;division=8.&amp;title=&amp;part=1.&amp;chapter=1.&amp;article=|title=California Family Code, Sec. 3000-3007|accessdate=19 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions the term "visitation" is no longer used in joint custody cases, but is instead used only for sole custody orders.

In some jurisdictions, "joint physical custody" creates a presumption of "equal shared parenting". However, in most states, joint physical custody only creates an obligation to provide each of the parents with "significant periods" of physical custody so as to assure the child of "frequent and continuing contact" with both parents.&lt;ref name="leginfo1"/&gt; Courts have not clearly defined what "significant periods" and "frequent and continuous contact" mean, which requires parents to litigate to find out.

Many jurisdictions recognize two forms of joint custody: joint physical custody, and joint legal custody. In joint legal custody, both parents share the ability to have access to educational, health, and other records, and have equal decision-making status where the welfare of the child is concerned.

In joint physical custody, which would include [[joint physical care]], actual lodging and care of the child is shared according to a court-ordered custody schedule (also known as a ''parenting plan'' or ''parenting schedule''). Other terms may be used instead of ''[[Contact (law)|visitation]]'', such as "time share" or "parenting time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basics of Custody &amp; Visitation Orders|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/17975.htm|website=California Courts|publisher=State of California|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some states joint physical custody creates a presumption of equal shared parenting, however in most states, joint physical custody creates an obligation to provide each of the parents with "significant periods" of physical custody so as to assure the child of "frequent and continuing contact" with both parents.&lt;ref name="leginfo1"/&gt; For example, U.S. states such as Alabama, California, and Texas do not necessarily require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time, whereas states such as Arizona, Georgia, and Louisiana do require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time where feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Presumptive Joint Physical Custody Group Report under House File 1262 (2008) Appendix B "State Definitions of Joint Physical Custody"&lt;/ref&gt;  Courts have not clearly defined what "significant periods" and "frequent and continuous contact" mean, which requires parents to litigate to find out.

It is important to note that joint physical custody and joint legal custody are different aspects of custody, and determination is often made separately in many states' divorce courts. E.g., it is possible to have joint legal custody, but for one parent to have sole physical custody In some states this is referred to as Custodial Parent and Non-Custodial Parent.

Also, where there is joint physical custody, terms of art such as "primary custodial parent" and "primary residence" have no legal meaning other than for determining tax status, and both parents are still custodial parents.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;See e.g., In re Marriage of Rose and Richardson (App. 2 Dist. 2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 941. Moreover, several courts have also stated, "The term `primary physical custody' has no legal meaning." (In re Marriage of Biallas (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 755, 759 citing Brody, Whealon, and Ruisi; see also In re Marriage of Richardson, 102 Cal.App.4th 941, 945, fn. 2; In re Marriage of Lasich (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 702, 714&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sole===
''Sole physical custody'' means that a child shall reside with and be under the supervision of one parent, subject to the power of the court to order visitation. Physical custody involves the day-to-day care of a child and establishes where a child will live. A parent with physical custody has the right to have his/her child live with him/her. If a child lives with only one parent, that parent has ''sole physical custody'' and is said to be the ''custodial parent''. The other parent is said to be the ''non-custodial parent'', and may have visitation rights or ''[[Contact (law)|visitation]]'' with his/her child.&lt;ref name="leginfo1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeofAlabama/1975/30-3-151.htm |title=Section 30-3-151 |publisher=Legislature.state.al.us |date= |accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS |title=Laws of New York |publisher=Public.leginfo.state.ny.us |date= |accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sole custody|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sole_custody|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually the parent who is believed to value child quality more than the other is the one granted sole custody, leaving the high-valuation parent with the best incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rasul|first=Imran|date=1 February 2006|title=The Economics of Child Custody|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0335.2006.00445.x/abstract|journal=Economica|language=en|volume=73|issue=289|pages=1–25|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2006.00445.x|issn=1468-0335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Custodial parents ===
A ''custodial parent'' is a parent who is given physical or legal custody of a child by court order.

A ''child-custody determination'' means a judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the legal custody, physical custody, or [[Contact (law)|visitation]] with respect to a child. The term includes a permanent, temporary, initial, and modification order. The term does not include an order relating to child support or other monetary obligation of an individual.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act(1997), Article 1, Section 102(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Where the child will live with both parents, joint physical custody is ordered, and both parents are custodial parents. Where the child will only live with one of the parents, sole physical custody is ordered, and the parent with which the child lives is the custodial parent, the other parent is the non-custodial parent.
&lt;!-- http://www.winchildcustodycase.com --&gt;

===Non-custodial parents===
A ''non-custodial parent'' is a parent who does not have physical and/or legal custody of his/her child by court order.

A ''child-custody determination'' means a judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the legal custody, physical custody, or [[Contact (law)|visitation]] with respect to a child. The term includes a permanent, temporary, initial, and modification order. The term does not include an order relating to child support or other monetary obligation of an individual.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt; Where the child will only live with one of the parents, sole physical custody is ordered, and the parent with which the child lives is the custodial parent, the other parent is the noncustodial parent. Note, however, where the child will live with both parents, joint physical custody is ordered, and both parent are custodial parents.

==Legal==
Legal custody involves the division of rights between the parents to make important life decisions relating to their minor children.&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Child Custody|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/family-law-and-divorce/what-child-custody|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such decisions may include choice of a child's school, choice of physician, whether the child should attend therapy and with what therapist, and decisions relating to medical and orthodontic treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dieringer|first1=Jennifer K.|last2=Elsen|first2=Susan R.|last3=Goldenhersh|first3=Stephanie E.|title=Child Custody|url=https://www.masslegalservices.org/system/files/library/Chapter+09+Final.pdf|website=Massachusetts Legal Services|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal custody may be joint, in which case both parents share decision-making rights, or sole, in which case one parent is vested with the rights to make those key decisions without regard to the contrary wishes of the other parent.&lt;ref name="el"/&gt;

== The "best interest" rule ==
In the context of cases regarding custody, the "best interest" rule suggests that all legal decisions made to accommodate the child are made with the goal of ensuring a child's happiness, security and overall well being. There are many different factors that go into the decision that is made in a child's best interest, which include: the child's health, environment and social interests,&lt;ref name="unhcr"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNHCR Guidelines on  Determining the Best  Interests of the Child|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4566b16b2.pdf|website=UNHCR|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the relationship each parent has with the child, and the ability of each parent to address the needs of the child.

=== Problems with the "best interest" rule ===
The “best interest” rule has been considered to be a standard in determining child custody for the most recent 40 years in history. Although it has been so widely favored amongst legal systems, there are some deficiencies to the concept. Robert Mnookin, an American lawyer, author, and a Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, claimed that the best interest rule is indeterminate. It is considered to be a broad and vague set of guidelines that only leads to increased conflict amongst the parents instead of promoting cooperation that would actually lead to the best interest of the child being met.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=E|last2=Emery|first2=R|date=January 2014|title=Gender Politics and Child Custody: The Puzzling Persistence of the Best-Interests Standard |url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol77/iss1/4/|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|doi=|pmid=|access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these problems specifically include:
* The current test for best interest generates high costs, which can impose on both the court and opposing parties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* The verifiability of the best interest standard is hard to achieve. The privacy of family life makes assessing the evidence provided difficult. The best interests standard only worsens the problem, in which both parties are encouraged to introduce evidence of the quality of their parenting (which also promotes trying to disprove the opposing party’s capabilities of taking the child into custody).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* In an example of divorce, both parties are experiencing high levels of stress, which could make for a poor basis for assessing family behaviors and relationships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
In order to better analyze the “best interest” of children, several experiments were conducted to observe the opinions of children themselves. Children of divorce were found to want equal time with both of their parents. Studies conducted by Wallerstein, Lewis and Blakeslee (2002) show that children from all age ranges indicate that equal or shared parenting is of their best interest 93 percent of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.|first=Wallerstein|last2=Lewis|first2=J|last3=Blakeslee|first3=S|date=2002|title=The unexpected legacy of divorce.

However, the decision is highly situational, for joint custody can only be achieved in the absence of certain exceptions. For example, history of domestic violence found from either parent can most certainly trump the possibility of joint custody for a child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Australia ==
Each parent has a responsibility under the Australian Family Law Act for their child/ren. In cases of separation or dysfunction between two parents the parental responsibility doesn't change.

In the case of divorce or separation of parents many hurdles can fall in the way regarding the custody of their children, deciding who will be the custodial parent and so forth. In Australia when parents can't come to an agreement which meets both of their needs when it comes to the custody of their child/ren cases are taken to court which happens in more  scenarios than expected. When parents can't agree on these arrangements and take matters to court, the court makes orders about parental responsibilities, they have the power to approve and make consent orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=If you can't agree on parenting arrangements|url=http://www.familycourt.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/fcoaweb/family-law-matters/parenting/if-you-cant-agree-on-arrangements|website=Family Court of Australia|accessdate=3 October 2017|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at the history of child custody demonstrates how the views of children and the relationship between husbands and wives have changed over time. The view of children has changed from economic assets to individuals with their own interests. Fathers were also once seen as the head of the household compared to today, when fathers and mothers have more equal standing in the care of their children.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to Child Custody: Opposing Viewpoints." ''Child Custody''. Ed. Dedria Bryfonski. Detroit: Greenhaven Press, 2011. Opposing Viewpoints. ''Opposing Viewpoints in Context''. Web. 5 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The colonial era and early republic: 1630-1830 ===
During this time period, custodial issues arose with occasions other than divorce such as the death of the father or both parents, inability of parents to care for the children, or with situations involving illegitimate children. Children at the time were seen as economic assets with labor value. In addition to this, the only other important consideration in determining custody was the ability of the adults to supervise and raise the child. Widows would lose their children because they would not be able to support them. These children would be taken from the mother and given to another family that would support the child in return for the child’s labor services. Otherwise, fathers were seen as the head of the household and had complete custody rights to children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;MASON, MARY ANN. "Divorce and Custody." ''Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood: In History and Society''. Ed. Paula S. Fass. Vol. 1. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2004. 276-279. ''Gale Virtual Reference Library''. Web. 5 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The nineteenth century ===
The view of children as servants to their fathers and economic assets began to change in the nineteenth century. Children were seen to have interests of their own that were often associated with the care of a nurturing mother. The women’s movement of the time also fought for women’s right to child custody in their campaign.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Judges eventually began to favor the “best interests of the child,” which, especially for young and female children, was associated with mothers. Maternal presumption was judicially developed through legislature such as the “Tender Years Doctrine” that presumed that children should be placed with their mothers in custody debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Best Interests of Children: An Evidence-based Approach|last=Millar|first=Paul|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|year=2009|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Granting custody to the father was seen “to hold nature in contempt, and snatch helpless, puling infancy from the bosom of an affectionate mother, and place it in the coarse hands of the father” when the mother was “the softest and safest nurse of infancy”.&lt;ref&gt;"Tender Years Doctrine." ''West's Encyclopedia of American Law''. Ed. Shirelle Phelps and Jeffrey Lehman. 2nd ed. Vol. 9. Detroit: Gale, 2005. 457-458. ''Gale Virtual Reference Library''. Web. 5 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This maternal presumption continued for over a hundred years. The only exception to maternal presumption was if the mother was considered to be “unfit.” Most often, this occurred when women had committed adultery or left their husband.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The early twentieth century ===
By the early twentieth century, divorce cases became more common, and custody disputed simultaneously became an issue that affected many families. With the changing attitudes of the Roaring 20’s, a woman’s sexual conduct no longer prevented her from receiving custody for her children. The double standard on sexual conduct of fathers and mothers was removed. The new rule according to Keezer on the Law of Marriage and Divorce stated that “Where the children are of tender years, other things being equal, the mother is preferred as their custodian, and this more especially in the case of female children, and this though she may have been guilty of delinquencies in the past but there is no evidence that she was delinquent at the time of determining the matter by the court.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries ===
In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, divorce rates increased dramatically. Due to the nature of divorce, the rules governing child custody became increasingly difficult to determine. It was at this time that the idea of mothers being favored to gain custody of children in the event of a divorce was challenged. “The simple fact of being a mother does not, by itself, indicate a capacity or willingness to render a quality of care different from that which the father can provide”, a New York court stated in 1973.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was at this time that the basis of the “best interest rule” was changed to address many aspects of the child’s care in order to promote gender neutrality in decisions regarding custody. These aspects include, but are not limited to, the child’s mental, emotional, physical, religious, and social needs. All children have the right to services that prevent them from physical or psychological harm. This means that when assessing the best interest of the child, it is not only important to assess the parents who are fighting for custody, but also the environments in which the child would be placed under the custody of either parent. In a situation where neither parent would be deemed an appropriate caretaker for a child, custody would be given to a foster care center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estrada|first=R|last2=Marksamer|first2=J|date=March 2006|title=The legal rights of LGBT youth in state custody: what child welfare and juvenile justice professionals need to know.|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=7&amp;sid=9623c5c5-f162-4e88-a2b2-0acd77fce9f3%40sessionmgr105&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#AN=106336537&amp;db=rzh|journal=Child Welfare|doi=|pmid=|access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=1659497&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=38&amp;Ses=1
 | house=House of Commons, Canada | date=2005-04-18 | page=1100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the ''Act'') was an act passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]], banning most forms of [[History of Chinese immigration to Canada|Chinese immigration to Canada]]. Immigration from most countries was controlled or restricted in some way, but only the [[China|Chinese]] were so completely prohibited from immigrating.

Before 1923, Chinese immigration was heavily controlled by the ''[[Chinese Immigration Act of 1885|Chinese Immigration Act]]'' of 1885, which imposed a hefty [[Head tax (Canada)|head tax]] on all immigrants from China. After various members of the federal and some provincial governments (especially [[British Columbia]]) put pressure on the federal government to discourage Chinese immigration, the ''Chinese Immigration Act'' was passed. It went into effect on July 1, 1923. The ''Act'' banned Chinese immigrants from entering Canada except those under the following titles:

* Diplomat
* Foreign student
* Under Article 9 of the ''Act'', "Special circumstance" granted by the Minister of Immigration (This is the class that former [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]]'s family fell under).

The ''Act'' did not only apply to Chinese from China, but to ethnic Chinese with British nationality as well. Since [[Dominion Day]] coincided with the enforcement of the ''Chinese Immigration Act'', Chinese-Canadians at the time referred to the anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] as "Humiliation Day" and refused to take any part in the celebration.

Because Canada became a signatory of the United Nations Charter of Human Rights following World War II and the ''Chinese Immigration Act'' was inconsistent with the UN charter, the Canadian Parliament repealed the act on May 14, 1947 (following the proclamation of the ''[[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946]]'' on January 1, 1947). However, independent Chinese immigration to Canada came only after the liberalization of Canadian immigration policy in the 1960s under the governments of John Dienfenbaker and Lester Pearson.

On June 22, 2006, former [[Prime Minister (Canada)|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] apologized in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. The first phrase of the apology was spoken in [[Cantonese Chinese]], the most frequently spoken Chinese language among Chinese immigrants. He announced that the survivors or their spouses will be paid approximately {{CAD|20,000}} in compensation for the head tax.

On May 15, 2014, former [[Premier of British Columbia]] [[Christy Clark]] apologized in the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|Legislative Assembly]]. The apology motion was unanimously passed and aims to make amends for historic wrongs. Unlike the federal apology, no individual compensation was provided. However, {{CAD|1 million}} was promised to be put into a legacy fund which would help legacy initiatives. The formal apology went through a three-month consultation period with various parties to help ensure that the apology was done properly.

The ''Act'' and its legacy have been the subject of at least three documentary films: Kenda Gee and Tom Radford's ''[[Lost Years: A People's Struggle for Justice]]'' (2011-2012), William Dere and Malcolm Guy's ''[[Moving the Mountain (1993 film)|Moving the Mountain]]'' (1993) and [[Karen Cho]]'s ''In the Shadow of Gold Mountain'' (2004).&lt;ref name="Shadow"&gt;{{cite video | url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/in_the_shadow_of_gold_mountain/ | title=In the Shadow of Gold Mountain | publisher=National Film Board of Canada | date=2004 | people=Karen Cho, writer/director | medium=Documentary film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10628">'''Common law copyright''' is the legal doctrine which grants copyright protection based on [[common law]] of various jurisdictions, rather than through protection of [[statutory law]].

In part, it is based on the contention that [[copyright]] is a [[natural and legal rights|natural right]] and creators are therefore entitled to the same protections anyone would be in regard to tangible and real property.  The proponents of this doctrine contended that creators had a perpetual right to control the publication of their work (also see [[perpetual copyright]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The "natural right" aspect of the doctrine was addressed by the courts in the [[United Kingdom]] (''[[Donaldson v. Beckett]]'', 1774) and the [[United States]] (''[[Wheaton v. Peters]]'', 1834). In both countries, the courts found that copyright is a limited right under statutes and subject to the conditions and terms the legislature sees fit to impose. The decision in the UK did not, however, directly rule on whether copyright was a common-law right.

In the United States, common law copyright also refers to state-level copyrights.  These are ordinarily [[Federal preemption|preempted]] by federal copyright law, but for some categories of works, common law (state) copyright may be available.  For instance, in the New York State 2005 case, ''[[Capitol Records v. Naxos of America]]'', the court held that pre-1972 sound recordings, which do not receive federal copyrights, may nevertheless receive state common law copyrights,&lt;ref name="courts.state.ny.us"&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2005/2005_02570.htm ''Capitol Records v. Naxos of America''], 2005 NY Slip Of 02570 (NY Ct App April 5, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; a ruling that was clarified and limited with 2016's ''Flo &amp; Eddie v. Sirius XM Radio''.

== Battle of the booksellers (UK) ==
Until the enactment of the [[Statute of Anne]] publishers could pass on their royal grants of copyright to their heirs in perpetuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McGreal | first = Rory| title =Stealing the Goose: Copyright and learning| publisher = The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning| year = 2004| url = http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/205/287}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the statutory [[copyright term]] provided for by the Statute of Anne began to expire in 1731 London booksellers thought to defend their dominant position by seeking [[injunctions]] from the [[Court of Chancery]] for works by authors that fell outside the statute's protection. At the same time the London booksellers lobbied parliament to extend the copyright term provided by the Statute of Anne. Eventually, in a case known as ''Midwinter v. Hamilton'' (1743–1748), the London booksellers turned to [[common law]] and starting a 30-year period known as the ''battle of the booksellers''. The battle of the booksellers saw London booksellers locking horns with the newly emerging Scottish book trade over the right to reprint works falling outside the protection of the Statute of Anne. The Scottish booksellers argued that no common law copyright existed in an author's work. The London booksellers argued that the Statute of Anne only supplemented and supported a pre-existing common law copyright. The dispute was argued out in a number of notable cases, including ''Millar v. Kincaid'' (1749–1751) and ''Tonson v. Collins'' (1761).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| page = 14| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''[[Donaldson v Beckett]]'' reached the [[House of Lords]] in 1774 only one Lord, [[Thomas Lyttelton, 2nd Baron Lyttelton|Thomas Lyttelton]], spoke in favour of common law copyright. But a majority of the judges spoke in favour of common law copyright. [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]] was most strident in his rejection of the common law copyright, warning the Lords that should they vote in favour of common law copyright, effectively a perpetual copyright, "all our learning will be locked up in the hands of the Tonsons and the Lintots of the age". Moreover, he warned that booksellers would then set upon books whatever price they pleased "till the public became as much their slaves, as their own hackney compilers are". He declared that "[t]his perpetuity now contended for is as odious and as selfish as any other, it deserves as much reprobation, and will become as intolerable. Knowledge and science are not things to be bound in such cobweb chains."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| page = 19| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Lords ultimately ruled that copyright in published works was subject to the durational limits of the statute. The reasoning behind the decision is disputed, though most scholars agree that the House did not rule against common-law copyright.

The Lords agreed that an author had a pre-existing right "to dispose of his manuscript ... until he parts with it" (Lord Chief Justice De Grey), but that prior to the Statute of Anne the right to copy was "founded on patents, privileges, [[Star Chamber]] Decrees and the bylaws of the Stationers' Company" (Lord Camden). In any event, they determined, the Statute of Anne superseded any common law rights of the author which may have existed prior to the statute. The previous entry here maintained that the Lords found that "parliament had limited these natural rights in order to strike a more appropriate balance between the interests of the author and the wider social good," quoting Ronan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ronan | first = Deazley| title = Rethinking copyright: history, theory, language| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing| year = 2006| page = 24| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=dMYXq9V1JBQC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-1-84542-282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the phrase "natural rights" is not justified by the historical record. Lord Chief Baron Smythe stated that the Statute of Anne was "a compromise between authors and printers contending for a perpetuity, and those who denied them any statute right," but the Lords in no way accepted that such a common law or 'natural' right of the author in perpetuity ever existed or developed. Lord Chief Justice De Grey saw no evidence of any such right in the courts in the 300 years since the invention of the printing press and charged that "the idea of a common-law right [of the author] in perpetuity was not taken up till after that failure in procuring a new statute for an enlargement of the term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyrighthistory.com/donaldson.html |title=The History of Copyright: Donaldson v. Beckett |publisher=Copyrighthistory.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Patterson and Livingston there remains confusion about the nature of copyright ever since the Donaldson case. Copyright has come to be viewed as a natural law right of the author as well as the statutory grant of a limited [[monopoly]]. One theory holds that copyright's origin occurs at the creation of a work, the other that it origin exists only through the copyright statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Jonathan| first = Rosenoer| title = Cyberlaw: the law of the internet| publisher = Springer| year = 1997| pages = 34–35| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=HlG2esMIm7kC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-387-94832-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Wheaton v. Peters'' (US) ==
{{main|Wheaton v. Peters}}
In 1834 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Wheaton v. Peters]]'', a case similar to the British ''[[Donaldson v Beckett]]'' of 1774, that although the author of an unpublished work had a [[common law]] right to control the first publication of that work, the author did not have a common law right to control reproduction following the first publication of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Peter K| first = Yu| title = Intellectual Property and Information Wealth: Copyright and related rights| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2007| page = 143| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=tgK9BzcF5WgC&amp;dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-275-98883-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== State law copyright claims ==
''Common law copyright'' is also the term used in the United States to refer to most state law copyright claims.  In 1978, Section 301 took effect, preempting all state common law copyright claims that fall under subject matter in Section 102 (Subject matter of copyright: In general) or Section 103 (Subject matter of copyright: Compilations and derivative works) except for sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|301}}(c)&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves a sizable amount of work that still falls under a mixture of state statutes and common law copyright.&lt;ref name="CLIR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub146/contents.html|title=Protection for Pre-1972 Sound Recordings|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most state-law copyright claims are [[Federal preemption|preempted]] by federal copyright law, but for some categories of works, common law (state) copyright may be available.  For instance, in the New York State 2005 case, ''[[Capitol Records v. Naxos of America]]'', the court held that pre-1972 sound recordings, which do not receive federal copyrights, may nevertheless receive state common law copyrights.&lt;ref name="courts.state.ny.us"/&gt; This precedent was partially overruled in 2016 in ''[[Flo &amp; Eddie Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio]]'', which determined that the extent of common law copyright in New York did not cover the performance of a sound recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Klepper|first=David|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_RECORDING_COPYRIGHT_RULING?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2016-12-20-16-50-38|title=OWNERS OF 1967 HIT SONG 'HAPPY TOGETHER' LOSE COPYRIGHT CASE|publisher=Associated Press|date=December 20, 2016|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012'''  (c.6)&lt;ref&gt;The Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012 (c.6)&lt;/ref&gt; is a UK Act of Parliament that makes important reforms to insurance law. 

The Act was a consequence of the [[Law Commission]]'s millennium review of the law of insurance that has been ongoing since 2006.  The review examined insurance in general, and of [[marine insurance]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://insurance.dwf.co.uk/news-updates/2015/02/the-insurance-act-2015-is-here…or-almost-here/&lt;/ref&gt;  The new legislation is a response to a consensus that the [[Marine Insurance Act 1906]] is old-fashioned, it no longer represents current practice, and it undermines the continuing dominant position of English Insurance in the global market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cii.co.uk/knowledge/policy-and-public-affairs/articles/cii-briefing-insurance-act-2015/35287&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Act has since been complemented by the [[Insurance Act 2015]]; and both of these modern Acts have significantly amended the Marine Insurance Act 1906, particularly in the area of misrepresentation and disclosure.

==The Act's provisions==
The Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012 makes provisions as follows:  
*  Section 1 creates the concept of "consumer" and "non-consumer" insurance contracts..
* Section 2 covers Pre-contractual disclosures and representations to the insurer.  The Act imposes a duty upon the insured to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to the insurer. 
* Section 3 declares that the Standard of Care is to be determined in the light of all the relevant circumstances.
* Sections 4 defines "qualifying misrepresentations: definitions and remedies".
* Sections 5 defines "qualifying misrepresentations: classification and presumptions".
* Section 6 covers warranties and representations
* Schedule 1 makes provision for Insurers' remedies for qualifying misrepresentations.
* Schedule 2 makes provision for rules determining the status of agents

'''''Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co.''''', 448 U.S. 176 (1980),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co.|volume=448|page=176|year=1980}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1980 5-4 decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] limiting the [[patent misuse]] doctrine and explaining the scope of the 1952 amendment of the patent laws that resurrected the contributory infringement doctrine in the wake of the [[The Mercoid Cases|''Mercoid'' cases]].&lt;ref name=Mercoid&gt;{{ussc|name=Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co.|link=|volume=320|page=661|pin=|year=1944}} (''Mercoid I''), and {{ussc|name=Mercoid Corp. v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co.|link=|volume=320|page=680|pin=|year=1944}} (''Mercoid II'').&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mercoid''  cases and a few predecessor cases had denied relief against patent infringement to patentees who were deriving revenue from the sale of unpatented products used as supplies for patented combinations or as components of patented combinations, even when the unpatented products were specially adapted for use with the patented combinations and even when they lacked any utility other than that use. The patentees used contributory infringement suits or threats of such suits to enforce their business model, which the ''Mercoid'' cases outlawed.

In the ''Mercoid'' cases the Court had stated: "The result of this decision, together with those which have preceded it, is to limit substantially the doctrine of contributory infringement. What residuum may be left we need not stop to consider."&lt;ref name=Mercoid669&gt;''See Mercoid I'', 320 U.S. at 669.&lt;/ref&gt; This caused "some consternation among patent lawyers," and some  "segments of the patent bar eventually decided to ask Congress for corrective legislation that would restore some scope to the contributory infringement doctrine. With great perseverance, they advanced their proposal in three successive Congresses before it eventually was enacted in 1952."&lt;ref&gt;''Dawson'', 448 U.S. at 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dawson'' interpreted the 1952 amendments to re-establish contributory infringement as a possible claim for relief and held that supplying an unpatented product especially adapted for use in practicing a patented process and without any substantial non-infringing use was unlawful contributory infringement.

==Background==

===Factual setting===

This case is part of the aftermath of ''[[Monsanto Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co.]]'', in which Rohm &amp; Haas succeeded in invalidating Monsanto's patent on [[propanil]], a selective herbicide, by showing that Monsanto deceived the Patent Office in procuring the patent. Propanil thus became an unpatented product.&lt;ref&gt;After the courts found that Monsanto had committed fraudulent procurement of the patent, Monsanto dedicated the patent to the public. 448 U.S. at 182.&lt;/ref&gt; With an estimated use of about 8 million pounds in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.epa.gov/oppbead1/pestsales/01pestsales/usage2001_2.htm 2000-2001 Pesticide Market Estimates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207095013/http://www.epa.gov/oppbead1/pestsales/01pestsales/usage2001_2.htm |date=2009-02-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; propanil was one of the more widely used herbicides in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;If applied in the proper quantities, propanil kills weeds normally found in rice crops without adversely affecting the crops themselves. It thus permits spraying of general areas where the crops are already growing, and eliminates the necessity for hand weeding or flooding of the rice fields. 448 U.S. at 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Monsanto had obtained the product patent on propanil on the basis of its selective herbicidal property, Rohm &amp; Haas was able in 1974 to obtain U.S, Patent No. 3,816,092 (the Wilson patent) on a process for applying propanil to inhibit the growth of undesirable plants in areas containing established crops. Claims 1 and 2 are illustrative for purposes of this case:

:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1. A method for selectively inhibiting growth of undesirable plants in an area containing growing undesirable plants in an established crop, which comprises applying to said area [propanil] at a rate of application which inhibits growth of said undesirable plants and which does not adversely affect the growth of said established crop.
:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2. The method according to claim 1 wherein the [propanil] is applied in a composition comprising [propanil] and an inert dilutent therefor at a rate of between 0.5 and 6 pounds of [propanil] per acre.

The claims describe the only substantial use for propanil.
 
Rohm &amp; Haas exploits the process patent by manufacturing propanil and selling it to farmers. Rohm &amp; Haas does not license the patent to the farmers but they acquire an implied license to practice the process by operation of law when they buy propanil from Rohm &amp; Haas, the owner of the process patent. Rohm &amp; Haas does not license the patent to other manufacturers of agricultural chemicals, such as Dawson, which had been making and selling propanil for herbicidal use before Rohm &amp; Haas received its patent. Dawson did not stop engaging in this business after the patent issued, and it sold propanil in packages labeled with instructions to use it as described in the patent. Accordingly, Rohm &amp; Haas sued Dawson for contributory infringement and active inducement of infringement under 35 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;271(c)–(d). Dawson then requested a patent license but Rohm &amp; Haas refused.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proceedings in district court===

When Rohm &amp; Haas refused to grant it a license, Dawson raised a defense of patent misuse and counterclaimed for alleged antitrust violations. The parties stipulated the facts and Dawson moved for summary judgment of patent misuse, on the grounds that Rohm &amp; Haas misused its patent by allowing the use of the patented method only to purchasers of its own propanil. The district court agreed and dismissed the complaint. In concluding that patent misuse occurred the district court stressed several points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Rohm &amp; Haas Co. v. Dawson Chem. Co. |vol=1976 |reporter=U.S. Dist. LEXIS |opinion=13707 |pinpoint= |court=[[S.D. Tex.]] |date=1976 |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, Rohm &amp; Haas refused to grant licenses when requested, which Mercoid had offered to do in the ''Mercoid'' cases. Therefore, Rohm &amp; Haas "by seeking to monopolize the sale of an unpatented component of its protected method without even attempting to license other manufacturers, is exploiting its patent in a manner which is less legitimate than the exploitation condemned by the Supreme Court in ''Mercoid''."&lt;ref&gt;1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13707, at *19.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the court pointed to the court of appeals opinion in ''[[B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis]]'', in which the misuse was based on the patentee's selling "unpatented component products specially made for use in a patented process for reinforcing shoe insoles; [and] the component had no other substantial commercial use."&lt;ref&gt;1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13707, at *12.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the facts of ''Mercoid'' involved a non-staple switch specially designed for use to practice the patent. The court concluded that the enactment of §&amp;nbsp;271(d) was intended to overrule the dicta in ''Mercoid'' against there being any residuum of contributory infringement but was not intended to overturn the ruling as to the specific facts, which the court considered equivalent to those of the case before it.&lt;ref&gt;1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13707, at *28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruling of Fifth Circuit===

Rohm &amp; Haas appealed to the Fifth Circuit, which reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Rohm &amp; Haas Co. v. Dawson Chem. Co. |vol=599 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=685 |pinpoint= |court=[[5th Cir.]] |date=1979 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/599/685/114381/ |accessdate=2018-07-02 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that §&amp;nbsp;271(d) was intended to "provide for a patentee's right to exclude others and reserve to itself, if it chooses, the right to sell nonstaples used substantially only in its invention."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Detail_of_Harry_Blackmun_official.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Justice Harry A. Blackmun]]

==Ruling of Supreme Court==

Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] delivered the opinion of a 5-4 Court in which Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] and Justices [[Potter Stewart]], [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]], and [[William Rehnquist]] joined. Justice [[Byron R. White]] filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices [[William J. Brennan]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], and [[John Paul Stevens]] joined. Justice Stevens also filed a separate dissent.

===Majority opinion===

====Importance of case====

Justice Blackmun began by describing the case and its importance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[This case] presents an important question of statutory interpretation arising under the patent laws. The issue before us is whether the owner of a patent on a chemical process is guilty of patent misuse, and therefore is barred from seeking relief against contributory infringement of its patent rights, if it exploits the patent only in conjunction with the sale of an unpatented article that constitutes a material part of the invention and is not suited for commercial use outside the scope of the patent claims.

The answer will determine whether respondent, the owner of a process patent on a chemical herbicide, may maintain an action for contributory infringement against other manufacturers of the chemical used in the process.

To resolve this issue, we must construe the various provisions of 35 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;271, which Congress enacted in 1952 to codify certain aspects of the doctrines of contributory infringement and patent misuse that previously had been developed by the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Contributory infringement ''versus'' patent misuse====

The Court traced the doctrines of contributory infringement and patent misuse back respectively to '' Wallace v. Holmes'',&lt;ref&gt;29 F. Cas. 74 (No. 17,100) (C.C.D. Conn. 1871).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.]]''&lt;ref name=Motion&gt;{{ussc|name=Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.|link=|volume=243|page=502|pin=|year=1917}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Both doctrines originally were developed by the courts" and "both concern the relationship between a patented invention and unpatented articles or elements that are needed for the invention to be practiced." But since 1952 when Congress enacted 35 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;271, they are governed by statute rather than judge-made rules.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawson'', 448 U.S. at 179-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Of particular import to the present controversy are subsections (c) and (d). The former defines conduct that constitutes contributory infringement; the latter specifies conduct of the patentee that is not to be deemed misuse." &lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 181.&lt;/ref&gt; They provide:

{{quote|(c) Whoever sells a component of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or composition, or a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.

(d) No patent owner otherwise entitled to relief for infringement or contributory infringement of a patent shall be denied relief or deemed guilty of misuse or illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his having done one or more of the following: (1) derived revenue from acts which if performed by another without his consent would constitute contributory infringement of the patent; (2) licensed or authorized another to perform acts which if performed without his consent would constitute contributory infringement of the patent; (3) sought to enforce his patent rights against infringement or contributory infringement.}}

The Court explained the reason for the doctrine of contributory infringement:

&lt;blockquote&gt; It exists to protect patent rights from subversion by those who, without directly infringing the patent themselves, engage in acts designed to facilitate infringement by others. This protection is of particular importance in situations .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. where enforcement against direct infringers would be difficult, and where the technicalities of patent law make it relatively easy to profit from another's invention without risking a charge of direct infringement.&lt;ref name=Dawson189&gt;448 U.S. at 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But the doctrine has encountered difficulties because of "concern for potential anticompetitive tendencies inherent in actions for contributory infringement." Thus, the "judicial history of contributory infringement thus may be said to be marked by a period of ascendancy, in which the doctrine was expanded to the point where it became subject to abuse, followed by a somewhat longer period of decline, in which the concept of patent misuse was developed as an increasingly stringent antidote to the perceived excesses of the earlier period."&lt;ref name=Dawson189/&gt;

An example of ascendency was the decision in ''Leeds &amp; Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Leeds &amp; Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co.|link=|volume=213|page=325|pin=|year=1909}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Court upheld an injunction against contributory infringement by a manufacturer of phonograph discs specially designed for use in a patented disc-and-stylus phonograph-player combination. Although the disc itself was not patented, the Court noted that it was essential to the functioning of the patented combination, and that its method of interaction with the stylus was what "mark[ed] the advance upon the prior art." &lt;ref&gt;''Leeds &amp; Catlin'', 213 U.S. at 330.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the disc was useful only when used with the stylus of the patent. The contributory infringement doctrine then "achieved its high-water mark with the decision in ''[[Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.|link=|volume=224|page=1|pin=|year=1912}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, a divided Court extended contributory infringement principles to permit a post-sale restriction by which a manufacturer of a patented mimeograph machine required purchasers to buy from the patentee all supplies used in connection with the patented machine (for example, such staple items as paper and ink). The Court reasoned that the market for these supplies was created by the invention, and that sale of a license to use the could be therefore properly be limited by whatever conditions the patent owner wished to impose.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 224 U.S. at 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''A.B. Dick'' decision and its progeny in the lower courts led to a vast expansion in tie-in conditions in the licensing of patented goods and processes, and control of markets for staple and nonstaple goods alike.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawson'', 448 U.S. at 190-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to "an inevitable judicial reaction" and the overruling of the ''A.B. Dick'' case. In ''[[Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.]]'',&lt;ref name=Motion/&gt; the Court "signalled a new trend that was to continue for years thereafter." In that case, the owner of a patent on film projection equipment attempted to prevent competitors from selling film for use in the patented equipment by attaching to the projectors it sold a notice purporting to condition use of the machine on exclusive use of its unpatented film. Relying upon the rule that the scope of a patent "must be limited to the invention described in the claims,''Motion Picture Patents'',&lt;ref&gt;''Motion Picture Patents'', 243 U.S. at 511.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court held that the attempted restriction on use of unpatented supplies was improper because it expanded the patent monopoly beyond the scope of the claims and the patent law.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Dawson'', 448 U.S. at 191-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of cases followed in which the Court condemned various tie-ins. In ''[[Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Dev. Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Dev. Corp.|link=|volume=283|page=27|pin=|year=1931}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court denied relief to a patentee that tied use of a patented shipping package to the purchase of unpatented, staple dry ice. ''[[Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co.|link=|volume=302|page=458|pin=|year=1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt; found patent misuse in an attempt to exploit a process patent for the curing of cement through tying to the use of the process the purchase of bituminous emulsion, an unpatented staple article of commerce used in the process. The ''Leitch'' Court refused to limit the rule of ''Carbice'' and ''Motion Picture Patents'' to cases involving explicit tie-in agreements extending the patent monopoly, and it stated the broad proposition that "every use of a patent as a means of obtaining a limited monopoly of unpatented material is prohibited."''Leitch'',&lt;ref&gt;''Leitch'', 302 U.S. at 463.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.|link=|volume=314|page=488|pin=492-94|year=1942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; involved an attempt by tie-in to control the market for salt tablets used in a patented dispenser; the Court explicitly linked the doctrine of patent misuse to the "unclean hands" doctrine traditionally applied by courts of equity. Its companion case, ''[[B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis|link=|volume=314|page=495|pin=495-98|year=1942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; held that patent misuse barred relief even where infringement had been actively induced, and that practical difficulties in profitably marketing a patented invention could not justify patent misuse.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Dawson'', 448 U.S. at 192-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the Court's decisions up to this point had explicitly addressed how the doctrines of contributory infringement and patent misuse applied in the case of a tie-in restriction on a nonstaple article capable of use only for infringing a patent. "[S]ome courts and commentators apparently took the view that control of nonstaple items capable only of infringing use might not bar patent protection against contributory infringement. This view soon received a serious, if not fatal, blow from the Court's controversial decisions" in ''[[The Mercoid Cases]]''.&lt;ref name=Mercoid/&gt; In these cases, "the Court definitely held that any attempt to control the market for unpatented goods would constitute patent misuse, even if those goods had no use outside a patented invention."&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 448 U.S. at 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Court's analysis of the ''Mercoid'' cases====

Both ''Mercoid'' cases involved a single patent that claimed a combination of elements for a furnace heating system. Mid-Continent was the owner of the patent, and Honeywell was its only licensee. Although neither company made or installed the furnace system, Honeywell manufactured and sold stoker switches especially made for and essential to the system's operation, and the switches had no other substantial use. The right to build and use the patented furnace system was granted to purchasers of the stoker switches, and royalties owed the patentee were calculated on the number of stoker switches sold. Mercoid manufactured and marketed a competing stoker switch that was designed to be used only in the patented combination. Mercoid had been offered a sublicense but had refused to take one. Mid-Continent and Honeywell separately sued Mercoid for contributory infringement and it raised tie-in patent misuse as a defense.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 195-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mercoid I'', the Court held the licensing arrangement to be an unlawful attempt to extend the patent monopoly. The ''Dawson'' Court said that the ''Mercoid I'' opinion "painted with a very broad brush." Prior patent misuse decisions had involved attempts "to secure a partial monopoly in supplies consumed .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. or unpatented materials employed" in connection with the practice of the invention. None of them, however, had involved an integral component necessary to the functioning of the patented system.&lt;ref&gt;''See Mercoid I'', 320 U.S. at 665.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the ''Mercoid'' Court refused to infer any "difference in principle" from this distinction in the facts.  Instead, it stated an expansive legal rule that apparently admitted no exception:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The necessities or convenience of the patentee do not justify any use of the monopoly of the patent to create another monopoly. The fact that the patentee has the power to refuse a license does not enable him to enlarge the monopoly of the patent by the expedient of attaching conditions to its use. . . . The method by which the monopoly is sought to be extended is immaterial. . . . When the patentee ties something else to his invention, he acts only by virtue of his right as the owner of property to make contracts concerning it, and not otherwise. He then is subject to all the limitations upon that right which the general law imposes upon such contracts. The contract is not saved by anything in the patent laws because it relates to the invention. If it were, the mere act of the patentee could make the distinctive claim of the patent attach to something which does not possess the quality of invention. Then the patent would be diverted from its statutory purpose and become a ready instrument for economic control in domains where the anti-trust acts or other laws, not the patent statutes, define the public policy.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawson'', 448 U.S. at 196 (quoting ''Mercoid'', 329 U.S. at 666).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Mercoid'' Court "recognized that its reasoning directly conflicted with ''Leeds &amp; Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co''." and it "registered disapproval, if not outright rejection, of that case."&lt;ref&gt;''See Mercoid I'', 320 U.S. at 668.&lt;/ref&gt; It also recognized that "[t]he result of this decision, together with those which have preceded it, is to limit substantially the doctrine of contributory infringement."&lt;ref name=Mercoid669/&gt; Then the ''Mercoid'' "Court commented, rather cryptically, that it would not 'stop to consider' what 'residuum' of the contributory infringement doctrine 'may be left.'&amp;#8203;"&lt;ref name=Mercoid669/&gt;

As for ''Mercoid II'' the ''Dawson'' Court said that it "did not add much to the breathtaking sweep of its companion decision," but it nonetheless commented: "However worthy it may be, however essential to the patent, an unpatented part of a combination patent is no more entitled to monopolistic protection than any other unpatented device."&lt;ref&gt;''Dawson'', 448 U.S. at 197 quoting ''Mercoid'' 320 U.S. at 684.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Court's conclusions about caselaw ====

The Court drew two principal conclusions from its review of the case law up to the ''Mercoid'' cases. It saw "a fairly complicated picture in which the rights and obligations of patentees as against contributory infringers have varied over time." It drew these inferences pertinent to the case before it:

{{quote|First, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the concepts of contributory infringement and patent misuse "rest on antithetical underpinnings." .&amp;nbsp;. &amp;nbsp;. And an inevitable concomitant of the right to enjoin another from contributory infringement is the capacity to suppress competition in an unpatented article of commerce. Proponents of contributory infringement defend this result on the grounds that it is necessary for the protection of the patent right, and that the market for the unpatented article flows from the patentee's invention. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Yet suppression of competition in unpatented goods is precisely what the opponents of patent misuse decry. If both the patent misuse and contributory infringement doctrines are to coexist, then each must have some separate sphere of operation with which the other does not interfere.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 198.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Second, we find that the majority of cases in which the patent misuse doctrine was developed involved undoing the damage thought to have been done by ''A.B. Dick''. The desire to extend patent protection to control of staple articles of commerce died slowly, and the ghost of the expansive contributory infringement era continued to haunt the courts. As a result, among the historical precedents in this Court, only the ''Leeds &amp; Catlin'' and ''Mercoid'' cases bear significant factual similarity to the present controversy. Those cases involved questions of control over unpatented articles that were essential to the patented inventions, and that were unsuited for any commercial noninfringing use. In this case, we face similar questions in connection with a chemical propanil, the herbicidal properties of which are essential to the advance on prior art disclosed by respondent's patented process. Like the record disc in ''Leeds &amp; Catlin'' or the stoker switch in the ''Mercoid'' cases, and unlike the dry ice in ''Carbice'' or the bituminous emulsion in ''Leitch'', propanil is a nonstaple commodity which has no use except through practice of the patented method. Accordingly, had the present case arisen prior to ''Mercoid'', we believe it fair to say that it would have fallen close to the wavering line between legitimate protection against contributory infringement and illegitimate patent misuse.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 198-99.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====How §&amp;nbsp;271 affected ''Mercoid''====

"The ''Mercoid'' decisions left in their wake some consternation among patent lawyers [Footnote 15] and a degree of confusion in the lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 199.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result: "Certain segments of the patent bar eventually decided to ask Congress for corrective legislation that would restore some scope to the contributory infringement doctrine. With great perseverance, they advanced their proposal in three successive Congresses before it eventually was enacted in 1952 as 35 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;271."&lt;ref name=Dawson200&gt;448 U.S. at 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority agreed with Rohm &amp; Hass that "§ 271(d) immunizes its conduct from the charge of patent misuse," and therefore "it should not be barred from seeking relief."&lt;ref name=Dawson200/&gt; In summary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The approach that Congress took toward the codification of contributory infringement and patent misuse reveals a compromise between those two doctrines and their competing policies that permits patentees to exercise control over non-staple articles used in their inventions. Section 271(c) identifies the basic dividing line between contributory infringement and patent misuse. It adopts a restrictive definition of contributory infringement that distinguishes between staple and nonstaple articles of commerce... As a result, it is no longer necessary to resort to the doctrine of patent misuse in order to deny patentees control over staple goods used in their inventions.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 200-01.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, §&amp;nbsp;271(d) rolled back ''Mercoid''&amp;#8239;'s expansion of misuse to nonstaples:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In our view, the provisions of §&amp;nbsp;271(d) effectively confer upon the patentee, as a lawful adjunct of his patent rights, a limited power to exclude others from competition in nonstaple goods. A patentee may sell a nonstaple article himself while enjoining others from marketing that same good without his authorization. By doing so, he is able to eliminate competitors, and thereby to control the market for that product. Moreover, his power to demand royalties from others for the privilege of selling the nonstaple item itself implies that the patentee may control the market for the nonstaple good; otherwise, his "right" to sell licenses for the marketing of the nonstaple good would be meaningless, since no one would be willing to pay him for a superfluous authorization.  271(d) effectively confer upon the patentee, as a lawful adjunct of his patent rights, a limited power to exclude others from competition in nonstaple goods.

Since all of what Rohm &amp; Hass did here is immunized under §&amp;nbsp;271(d), it is entitled to prevail against Dawson in its contributory infringement suit.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority found that the legislative history confirmed its view. Even though Senator McCarran, a spokesman for the legislation, commented on the floor of the Senate that the Act just "codif[ies] the patent laws," he also submitted a statement "which explained that, although the general purpose of the Act was to clarify existing law, it also included several changes taken '[i]n view of decisions of the Supreme Court and others.'&amp;#8202;" The legislative reports also said that §&amp;nbsp;271 was intended "to codify in statutory form the principles of contributory infringement and, at the same time, [to] eliminate... doubt and confusion" that had resulted from "decisions of the courts in recent years."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 203-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there was testimony in the 1948 hearings on the legislation from the "New York Patent Law Association, which had supervised drafting of the legislation... that candidly declared that the purpose of the proposal was to reverse the trend of Supreme Court decisions that indirectly had cut back on the contributory infringement doctrine." This group "criticized several decisions, including ''Leitch'' and ''Carbice'' as well as the two ''Mercoids''... [and] went on to explain that the proposed legislation was designed to counteract this effect by providing that... enforcement of the right to be protected against contributory infringement... shall not be regarded as misuse of the patent." Giles Rich, then a prominent New York patent lawyer, testified that the proper distinction was that between the ''Carbice'' and ''Mercoid'' cases, stressing the staple-nonstaple distinction between dry ice and the special stoker switch without any noninfringing use was critical. Because proposed §&amp;nbsp;271 "incorporated a staple-nonstaple distinction in the definition of contributory infringement," Rich argued, the bill would "correct [the] situation left by ''Mercoid'' without giving sanction to practices such as those in the ''Carbice'' case."&lt;ref&gt;338 U.S. at 205-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich spoke out similarly in the 1949 hearings, the majority noted. "To restore the doctrine of contributory infringement where it was most needed, Rich argued, it was essential to restrict ''pro tanto'' the judicially created doctrine of patent misuse":

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e are dealing with a problem which involves a conflict between two doctrines, contributory infringement and misuse... [T]he only way you can make contributory infringement operative again as a doctrine is to make some exceptions to the misuse doctrine and say that certain acts shall not be misuse... Contributory infringement has been destroyed by the misuse doctrine...&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 207-08.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The majority opinion summarized the meaning of §&amp;nbsp;271(d) as disclosed by the hearings as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt; It is the consistent theme of the legislative history that the statute was designed to accomplish a good deal more than mere clarification. It significantly changed existing law, and the change moved in the direction of expanding the statutory protection enjoyed by patentees. The responsible congressional Committees were told again and again that contributory infringement would wither away if the misuse rationale of the ''Mercoid'' decisions remained as a barrier to enforcement of the patentee's rights. They were told that this was an undesirable result that would deprive many patent holders of effective protection for their patent rights. They were told that Congress could strike a sensible compromise between the competing doctrines of contributory infringement and patent misuse if it eliminated the result of the ''Mercoid'' decisions, yet preserved the result in ''Carbice''. And they were told that the proposed legislation would achieve this effect by restricting contributory infringement to the sphere of nonstaple goods, while exempting the control of such goods from the scope of patent misuse. These signals cannot be ignored. They fully support the conclusion that, by enacting §§&amp;nbsp;271(c) and (d), Congress granted to patent holders a statutory right to control nonstaple goods that are capable only of infringing use in a patented invention, and that are essential to that invention's advance over prior art.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Post-1952 Supreme Court decisions====

Dawson argued that post-1952 decisions of the Supreme Court such as the two ''Aro'' decisions, continued to follow ''Mercoid'' and rejected the majority's interpretation of §&amp;nbsp;271(d). In ''[[Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.]]'' (''Aro I''),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.|link=|volume=365|page=336|pin=|year=1961}} (''Aro I'').&lt;/ref&gt; the Court had considered whether Aro's supplying to GM car owners a piece of common fabric cut to fit the contours of a patented convertible top combination, where the owners wanted to replace a worn top, was contributory infringement. Because contributory infringement cannot exist without underlying direct infringement, and the car owners had a right to keep their cars in good repair, there was no direct infringement and thus no contributory infringement. In so ruling, the ''Aro'' Court had quoted passages in ''Mercoid'' that said no part of a patented combination, such as the unpatented fabric top of the convertible top combination. was essential or the heart or gist of the invention and therefore separately protectable. The ''Dawson'' majority said this ruling was not inconsistent with its interpretation of §&amp;nbsp;271(d). In ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'' (''Aro II''),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.|link=|volume=377|page=476|pin=|year=1964}} (''Aro II'').&lt;/ref&gt;  the same controversy turned to Ford cars that used the convertible top invention but had not been licensed. This time the ''Aro II'' majority held that repairing unlicensed cars by supplying new fabric tops was contributory infringement under §&amp;nbsp;271(c). That, too, the ''Dawson'' majority said, was consistent with its interpretation of §&amp;nbsp;271. Moreover, the Court said, the ''Aro II'' majority rejected attempted reliance on ''Mercoid'' because "§&amp;nbsp;271 was enacted for the express purpose .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. of overruling any blanket invalidation of the [contributory infringement] doctrine that could be found in the ''Mercoid'' opinions." Finally, the Court said, the ''Aro'' cases involved repair versus reconstruction, for which the staple-nonstaple distinction is not relevant, the case at bar involved "the primary-use market for a chemical process," in which the staple-nonstaple distinction "supplies the controlling benchmark."&lt;ref&gt;''Dawson'', 448 U.S. at 217-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting opinion by Justice White===
[[Image:Justice White Official.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Justice Byron White]]

Writing for a four-justice minority, Justice White strongly criticized the majority because it "recognizes, as it must, that §&amp;nbsp;271 does not, on its face, exempt the broad category of nonstaple materials from the misuse doctrine, yet construes it to do so based on what it has gleaned from the testimony of private patent lawyers given in hearings before congressional Committees and from the testimony of Department of Justice attorneys opposing the bill." Despite the fact that nothing in support of the Court's construction could be "found in the Committee Reports or in the statements of those Congressmen or Senators sponsoring the bill," he added, the majority chose to rely "only on the opposing positions of nonlegislators .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. to extend the patent monopoly beyond preexisting standards." &lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 223-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

White reviewed the prior patent misuse cases from ''Motion Picture Patents'' to ''Mercoid'' and found they uniformly prohibited "every use of a patent as a means of obtaining a limited monopoly of unpatented material," and did so regardless of "the nature of the device by which the owner of a patent seeks to effect such unauthorized extension of the monopoly."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 227.&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that the lower courts in the ''B.B. Chemical'' case "had rejected the patent owner's attempt to distinguish previous patent misuse cases as involving efforts to control the use of staple materials with substantial noninfringing uses."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 227. In that case, the patent covered a process in which an unpatented strip of fabric was coated with an unpatented rubber cement composition. The accused infringer supplied similarly coated strips, which were unpatented but specially adapted for use in the patented method. The patentee unsuccessfully sued for contributory infringement. This was held patent misuse. ''[[B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court then unanimously affirmed them, which White said "necessarily reject[ed]ing petitioner's position that patent misuse was limited to staple products, and did not apply when the alleged infringer went beyond selling an unpatented staple material and manufactured and sold materials useful only in the patented construct."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 227. White pointed out that there had been a conflict of circuits on the issue and it had been briefed by the parties and the United States as ''amicus curiae''. ''Id''. n.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to White, the line of cases since ''Motion Picture Patents'' "established, even before this Court's decisions in the ''Mercoid'' cases, .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that the patent misuse doctrine would bar recovery by a patent holder who refused to license others to use a patented process unless they purchased from him an unpatented product for use in the process."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 229.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that Rohm &amp; Haas's "conduct in this clearly constitutes patent misuse under these pre-''Mercoid'' decisions because [it] refuses to license others to use its patented process unless they purchase from it unpatented propanil." He dismissed as irrelevant the fact that propanil was a non-staple. Indeed the fact that propanil lacked non-infringing use further made the conduct misuse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, the fact that propanil is a nonstaple product having no substantial use except in the patented process has been without significance at least since ''B.B. Chemical'', and only serves to reinforce the conclusion that respondent is attempting to extend the patent monopoly to unpatented materials. Because propanil has no substantial noninfringing use, it cannot be sold without incurring liability for contributory infringement unless the vendor has a license to sell propanil or its vendee has an unconditional license to use the patented process. Respondent's refusal to license those who do not purchase propanil from it thus effectively subjects all competing sellers of propanil to liability for contributory infringement.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 230-31. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. This would permit an even more complete extension of the patent monopoly to a market for unpatented materials than would result from a patentee's attempts to control sales of staples that have substantial alternative uses outside of the patented process.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 271(d) should not be interpreted to immunize this conduct without a clear signal from Congress that it desires that result, he said, and that signal is lacking. 271(d) "does not state that respondent may exclude all competitors from the propanil market by refusing to license all those who do not purchase propanil from it. This is the very conduct that constitutes patent misuse under the traditional doctrine."&lt;ref name=Dawson233&gt;448 U.S. at 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

He turned to the opinion of the court of appeals, which chose to give Rohm &amp; Haas a monopoly over unpatented propanil because "the rights to license another to sell [nonstaple] unpatented items would be rendered worthless if the only right conferred by (d)(1) were the right to sell the item as one competitor among many freely competing." That was wrong for two reasons. First, Rohm &amp; Haas could collect royalties from its licensed competitors, who would need licenses to avoid contributory infringement liability. Second, "it also is fundamentally inconsistent with the congressional policy 'to preserve and foster competition' in the sale of unpatented materials, a policy that, as we have recognized, survived enactment of § 271."&lt;ref name=Dawson233/&gt;

The majority "acknowledges that respondent refused to license others to sell propanil, but it observes that 'nothing on the face of the statute requires it to do so.'&amp;#8202;" White says that is so, but that does not "absolve" Rohm &amp; Haas from misuse: "Section 271(d) does not define conduct that constitutes patent misuse; rather, it simply outlines certain conduct that is not patent misuse. Because the terms of the statute are terms of exception, the absence of any express mention of a licensing requirement does not indicate that respondent's refusal to license others is protected by §&amp;nbsp;271(d). This much seems elementary."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislative history indicates only an intention by Congress "of reinstating the doctrine of contributory infringement as it had been developed by decisions prior to ''Mercoid'', and of overruling any blanket invalidation of the doctrine that could be found in the ''Mercoid'' opinions." The majority can find nothing in the debates or Committee Reports to support its position, or anything said by legislators, so it turns to "the opinions of private patent attorneys as to the meaning of the proposed legislation."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 236-37.&lt;/ref&gt; White then says it is contrary to precedent to do that. Moreover, not even the patent attorneys went as far as the majority in overturning misuse law. The patent attorneys only argued that knowingly selling a non-staple specially adapted for infringement should be made unlawful, as it was in §&amp;nbsp;271(c). That testimony does "not support the Court's broad holding that Congress intended to give patent holders complete control over nonstaple materials that otherwise would be in the public domain." The majority, White protested, was extending contributory infringement "far beyond what the Committees were told § 271(d) would effect. Indeed, the representations were that, aside from the exemptions spelled out in § 271(d), a patentee's control of nonstaples would be subject to the doctrine of patent misuse."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent by Justice Stevens===
[[File:Detail_of_photo_of_Justice_J.P._Stevens.jpg|thumb|right|Justice John Paul Stevens]]
Justice Stevens joined in the White dissent but added further remarks to criticize the majority's approach. He called Rohm &amp; Haas's conduct "a classic case of patent misuse" that "nothing in 35 U.S.C. § 271(d) excludes .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. from the well-established misuse doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 240.&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that the majority was led into reaching its result by the fact that it would not have been "profitable to exploit this patent by granting express licenses for fixed terms to users of propanil or by granting licenses to competing sellers." and that the patent would have little value "unless the patentee is permitted to engage in patent misuse." That was not a sound basis for the majority's decision: "For the logic of the Court's holding would seem to justify the extension of the patent monopoly to unpatented nonstaples even in cases in which the patent could be profitably exploited without misuse."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==

===Hodgeman===

Roger Hodgeman sees the problems encountered in ''Dawson Chemical'' as "engendered by conflict between lawmaking authorities." Law occurs in legislation and in judicial opinions dealing with the subject matter of the legislation. " Ideally, these two sources of law should not be at odds with each other and should reflect the same policies on subject matter governed by federal law." But in the case of §§&amp;nbsp;271(c) and (d) that did not happen, largely because the legislative history was ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Hodgeman, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ucinlr50&amp;div=28&amp;start_page=314&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=13&amp;men_tab=srchresults '' Resolution of the Conflict between Contributory Infringement and Patent Misuse: Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm &amp; (and) Haas Co.''], 50 U. {{smallcaps|Cin. L. Rev.}} 314, 336 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue presented in ''Dawson Chemical'' was "whether Rohm &amp; Haas' method of selling unpatented propanil, coupled with a refusal to license competitors to sell that item, constituted patent misuse," and therefore "that Rohm &amp; Haas should have been required to grant express licenses to competing producers of propanil before it could claim and recover for contributory infringement. Both parties and the majority and dissent made strong arguments for their respective positions. Hodgeman maintains that the majority correctly rejected the proposal to impose compulsory licensing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the Court had required that Rohm &amp; Haas grant licenses to its competitors before suing for infringement under section 271(c), especially in light of the differing interpretations of pre-''Mercoid'' case law, then the Court necessarily would have engaged in a great deal of judicial legislation reaching far into uncharted waters that cannot be reached by interpretation of existing law. Without a clear signal from Congress and with no clear reconciliation of the pre-''Mercoid'' contributory infringement and patent misuse decisions, the Court was wise not to read any additional requirement into section 271.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgeman, ''supra'' at 338–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He sees the result of the decision "not as inherently unjustifiable as the dissent suggests." To be sure, Rohm &amp; Haas may choose to monopolize the sale of all propanil in the United States for the life of the patent, but propanil is not in widespread noninfringing use—it has no noninfringing use. Unless someone discovers another use, the monopoly and commercial value will coincide with the patented invention.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgeman, ''supra'' at 339.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the invention, propanil was worthless nec it had no commercial use. On the other hand, Hodgeman says the compromise made here may give Rohm &amp; Haas too long an exclusive right:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Congress might consider enacting legislation that would limit a patent owner's right to sue contributory infringers to a period of seven years, when the patent owner (1) sells the patented invention's material, nonpatented, nonstaple component, which has no substantial noninfringing use, and at the same time (2) expressly refuses to license any competitors to sell the component.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgeman, ''supra'' at 340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kobak===

James Kobak observes, "Watershed event though it was, the ''Rohm and Haas'' case does not appear to have led to many changes in patent licensing practices or to extensive practical reliance on Sections 271(c) and (d)." He attributes this to the risks of a misstep, which "have clearly counseled caution and conservatism in interpreting five to four Supreme Court decisions," and the fact that "fundamentally, a licensor could not at the time of licensing necessarily know with assurance whether an item would be held to be a non-staple – or whether it would remain that way for the life of the patent."&lt;ref&gt;James B. Kobak. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jpatos71&amp;div=118&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals ''The New Patent Misuse Law''], 71 J. {{smallcaps|Pat. &amp; Trademark Off. Soc'y}} 859, 870–71 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1988 passage of §&amp;nbsp;271(d), however, may have significantly changed things by establishing that "a patentee may explicitly tie in either a license or sale transaction without being found guilty of misuse as long as its patent does not confer 'market power.'&amp;#8202;" Moreover, patentees are free to do this irrespective of "whether what is tied is ultimately determined to be a staple or non-staple." Accordingly, "if the patentee is confident that a non-staple is involved," then it can "also license (but not sell) under Section 271(d)(3) with a tie-in condition even if it fears that the patent may be found to confer market power."&lt;ref&gt;''Kobak'', ''supra'' at 873.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sherry===

Stephen Sherry argues that the majority should have "balanced the policy objectives embodied in the contributory infringement and patent misuse doctrines" against one another rather than expanding patent monopoly privileges. He states, "A balanced approach to the decision would have protected the patentee's privilege to derive economic benefit from the patent by permitting the use of tying arrangements" while preserving competition among suppliers of nonstaples and not imposing extra costs on consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen F. Sherry, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/deplr30&amp;div=50&amp;start_page=875&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults ''Extending The Patent Monopoly to Unpatented Nonstaple Goods—Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co.''], 30 {{smallcaps|DePaul L. Rev}}. 875, 897–98 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Congress had not spoken one way or the other about tying nonstaples, Sherry argues, the Court should have looked to the patent law policy that disfavors contributory infringement, to the misuse policy disfavoring tie-ins, and considered each. Had it done so, "it might have opted for a more cautious and reasonable resolution to the ''Dawson'' conflict." Sherry maintains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A tying scheme can enhance the economic reward received by a patent owner making the legal monopoly more profitable to the inventor. Increasing the remunerative aspects of the patent monopoly promotes the policy objectives of the patent law. Conversely, requiring the patent owner to license competitors that supply the tied product fosters competition favored by the antitrust laws. Permitting the use of a tying arrangement only when competition in the unpatented nonstaple component is maintained represents a balanced approach toward resolving the policy conflict present in ''Dawson.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sherry insists that "Congress did not intend section 271(d) to endorse or reject tying arrangements per se." Rather, "Congress was apparently trying to
modify the [''Mercoid''] Court's view that some conduct was patent misuse per se irrespective of the actual effect it might have had on competition." Therefore, the ''Dawson'' Court should have effectuated this compromise to realize that "the logical result would have been to permit the use of tying arrangements only under circumstances where competition in the market supplying the nonstaple component would not be eliminated." The Court should not have ignored the testimony by some proponents of the amendment who "characterized section 271(d) as a remedial measure aimed at protecting those patent owners, like the one in ''Mercoid'', who were willing to license others to supply the unpatented nonstaple components of the invention."

===Morris===

Ann Morris finds the majority's interpretation of §§&amp;nbsp;271(c) and (d) correct – "The statutory language seems capable of no other interpretation." She finds the ''Dawson'' Court's position "consistent with its recent willingness to allow flexibility in matters concerning protection for intellectual property," as shown in such then recent pro-IP cases as ''Diamond v. Chakrabarty'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Diamond v. Chakrabarty|link=|volume=447|page=303|pin=|year=1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aronson v. Quick Point Pencil Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Aronson v. Quick Point Pencil Co.|link=|volume=440|page=257|pin=|year=1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.|link=|volume=433|page=562|pin=|year=1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kewanee Oil v. Bicron Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Kewanee Oil v. Bicron Corp.|link=|volume=416|page=470|pin=|year=1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Goldstein v. California'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Goldstein v. California|link=|volume=412|page=546|pin=|year=1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris insists:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A patentee of a combination or process [should] retain the rights of his patent monopoly, without relinquishing any of the control inherent in the right, even though part of his complex invention is not
patentable. The Court has seen that in today's industrial world, a nonstaple item (as defined by section 271(c)) should not dictate any narrowing of the patent privilege, for by definition it is used solely with the patented invention. More importantly, infringers of the patent should not be permitted to rely on thequirks of patentability to escape liability for their acts.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Morris, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umem11&amp;div=29&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals ''Patents - Restraining Sales of Nonstaple Components of Patented Process Is Not Patent Misuse'']'',  11 {{smallcaps|Mem.

{{canon law}}
A  '''Doctor of Canon and Civil Law''', from the Latin ''doctor utriusque juris'', or ''juris utriusque doctor'', or ''doctor juris utriusque'' ("doctor of both laws") (abbreviations include: JUD, IUD, DUJ, JUDr., DUI, DJU, Dr.iur.utr., Dr.jur.utr., DIU, UJD and UID) is a [[scholar]] who has acquired a [[doctorate]] in both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Canon law|church law]]. The degree was common among [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and German scholars&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Leibniz held the degree. Armgardt, Matthias. [http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1021-545X2014000100003 Leibniz as a legal scholar]. Fundamina (Pretoria) vol.20 n.1 Pretoria Jan. 2014. Accessed 7 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Middle Ages and early modern times. Today the degree is awarded by the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] after a period of six years of study, by the [[University of Würzburg]], and by the [[University of Fribourg]].

Prior to ca. 1800, people who studied law in Europe, studied canon law, Roman law, and feudal law. These laws were the constituent parts of the ''Ius commune''. The ''Ius commune'' was a pan-European legal system that held sway over Europe from approximately the twelfth through the eighteenth century. Graduates earned the decree of Doctor of both laws, because they had to study both canon law and civil law, in order to master the ''Ius commune''.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, Kenneth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2679">In Ontario, Canada '''Duty Counsel''' refers to a [[lawyer]] paid by [[Legal Aid Ontario]], an agency of the provincial government, who provides limited legal services in criminal, family law and child protection matters to people who are currently under arrest, or who arrive at court without representation, mainly in the Ontario Court of Justice.

The Duty Counsel lawyer is often the first point of contact for legal advice provided to a detained or arrested individual. People arrested by police services across the province of Ontario, as well as by [[Canada Border Services Agency]] officers at land, air, and sea ports of entry in Ontario also have the right to contact Duty Counsel. Any person arrested or detained in Canada has the right to speak to a lawyer without delay (with very narrow exceptions), and the police are required to inform them of that right, and facilitate access to a lawyer. The Duty Counsel system is the way in which these rights are implemented in Ontario.

Duty Counsel lawyers may serve as the arrested person's representative to the court on an ad-hoc basis, unless the accused has secured other legal advice.

Legal Aid Ontario employs both staff, and per diem lawyers (private bar members who work part-time) as duty counsel. Most lawyers providing telephone duty counsel services to arrestees and detainees are private bar lawyers contracted by a private firm to provide service on behalf of Legal Aid Ontario. Some of these private contractor lawyers work a few shifts a month in addition to their own work in private practice in order to serve the community. Others work on a full-time basis with the company under contract to Legal Aid Ontario.

Duty counsel is also available in [[family law]] and [[child protection]] cases. Duty counsel will advise clients and sometimes speak for them in court, but will not take on cases in the long-term. They can also assist with paperwork and, depending on the court, attend [[case conference]]s with clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legal Aid Ontario Duty Counsel Services |publisher=Legal Aid Ontario |url=http://www.legalaid.on.ca/en/getting/help.asp |accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Provincial Court family duty counsel |work=Legal Advice |publisher=Legal Services Society, British Columbia, Canada |url=http://www.lss.bc.ca/legal_aid/legalAdvice.asp |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Elrod v. Burns''''', 427 U.S. 347 (1976), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision regarding political speech of public employees.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#351|title=Elrod v. Burns 427 U.S. 347 (1976)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled in this case that federal employees may be active members in a political party, but cannot allow patronage to be a deciding factor in work related decisions. The court upheld the decision by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruling in favor of the respondent.

== Background ==

Richard J. Elrod was elected [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County, Ill.]] Sheriff. As a Democrat, he dismissed four non-civil service employees. John Burns and the other dismissed employees claimed it was on the grounds that they were members of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The previous sheriff, a Republican, had hired them all. Burns and other former employees claimed discrimination due to their affiliation, or lack of affiliation, to a particular political party. The Cook County Sheriff's Office had a tradition of operating under the partisan [[spoils system]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uscivilliberties.org/cases/3740-elrod-v-burns-427-us-347-1976.html|title=Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976)|work=Civil liberties in the United States|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutional Question ==

The constitutional question is if the firing of Burns and the other respondents was in violation of the [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]] and within the jurisdiction of [[List of United States Supreme Court cases involving the First Amendment|first amendment]] accepted free speech by a public employee.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The court was deciding whether these statues should apply to public, non-federal employees.

== Decision ==

Justice Brennan wrote the decision affirming the 7th Circuit Court decision. The opinion stated that the republican employees were denied a civil liberty by losing jobs due to political affiliation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

“Patronage dismissals severely restrict political belief and association, which constitute the core of those activities protected by the First Amendment, and government may not, without seriously inhibiting First Amendment rights, force a public employee to relinquish his right to political association as the price of holding a public job” – Justice Brennan &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Justice Stewart wrote a concurring decision, highlighting that non-policymaking officials cannot be fired on the basis of political affiliation or belief.

The decision upheld the belief that the ‘spoils system’ is unconstitutional through first amendment freedoms.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/waslee34&amp;div=18&amp;id=&amp;page|title=Elrod v. Burns: Chipping at the Iceberg of Political Patronage Notes &amp; Comments   34 Washington and Lee Law Review 1977|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court protected the rights of employees by giving further allowance of free speech by public employees. The decision deemed that the firing of non-policymaking, public employees was unconstitutional, it did not touch on the topic of hiring or promotion.

The decision built off ''[[Keyishian v. Board of Regents]]'' (1967) that deemed it illegal for public employees to be fired for being members of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/385/589/case.html|title=Keyishian v. Board of Regents 385 U.S. 589 (1967)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dissent ==

Justice Powell wrote a dissent claiming that half of the employees in the Cook County, Ill. Sheriff’s Office are merit based and are protected from being fired by a new administration. The other half of employees, which Burns was a part of, were hired based on principles decided by the previous sheriff, a Republican. The non-merit employees were hired on basis of patronage and there should be able to be fired on the basis of patronage. The dissent claims that partisan politics at the state level are necessary for the political system to evolve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

“The Court holds unconstitutional a practice as old as the Republic, a practice which has contributed significantly to the democratization of American politics.” – Justice Powell &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Justice Powell goes on to cite the removal of political opponents from roles by founding fathers, such as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and their successors.

== The Hatch Act ==

Congress passed the [[Hatch Act of 1939|Hatch Act]], or the Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities, in 1939. It prevents many federal employees from participating in certain partisan activities.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7323|title=5 U.S. Code § 7323 - Political activity authorized; prohibitions|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically it prohibits campaign activities by federal employees. In an earlier Supreme Court ruling Justices Marshall and Brennan signed on to an opinion in 1973 stating.

"It is no concern of government what an employee does in his or her spare time, whether religion, recreation, social work or politics is his hobby, unless what he or she does impairs efficiency or other facets of the merits of his job." – [[William O. Douglas|Mr. Justice Douglas]] &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/constitutional-law/constitutional-law-keyed-to-cohen/protection-of-penumbral-first-amendment-rights/united-states-civil-service-commission-v-national-association-of-letter-carriers-alf-cio/|title=United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers ALF-CIO {{!}} Casebriefs|website=www.casebriefs.com|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court had deemed this as a balance between not restricting speech and making sure that public employees do not over step the boundaries of the office due to political affiliation. The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] states that all constitutional rights and laws are to be enforced at the state level.

== Subsequent Cases ==

In [[Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois|Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois 497 U.S. 62]] (1990), the state of Illinois put a hiring freeze on public employees without permission from the governor. The new employees being hired were all members of the Republican Party. The court decided in favor of the petitioner adding the Elrod v. Burns ruling that nonpolicymaking government employees cannot be hired based off political patronage.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html|title=Rutan v. Republican Party 497 U.S. 62 (1990)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heffernan v. City of Paterson|Heffernan v. City of Paterson 587 U.S. ___]] (2016) was a similar case that took into consideration partisan acts but a member of the [[Paterson, NJ]] police force. Jeffery Heffernan was seen carrying a campaign sign to a sick parent. As a result of being seen with the sign, he was demoted for public engagement of political activities. The court overturned that decision claiming that he was acting under protected speech.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/14-1280|title=Heffernan v. City of Paterson |publisher=Oyez |access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Elrod v. Burns decision, the court has stayed with the sentiment that the free speech rights of government employees is protected when they are in non-policymaking or traditionally partisan roles.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/19/narrow-but-unanimous-supreme-court-decision-supporting-government-employee-speech-rights/|title=Narrow (but unanimous) Supreme Court decision supporting government employee speech rights|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Essential Commodities Act''' is an [[Act of Parliament|act]] of [[Parliament of India]] which was established to ensure the delivery of certain commodities or products, the supply of which if obstructed owing to [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding or blackmarketing]] would affect the normal life of the people. This includes foodstuff, drugs, fuel (petroleum products) etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fcamin.nic.in/Events/EventDetails.asp?EventId=1507&amp;Section=Annual%20Report&amp;ParentID=0&amp;child_continue=1&amp;child_check=0 Ministry of Consumer Affairs of the Government of India. Official Website. Annual Report 2005 - 2006, Chapter IV, 'Essential Commodities Act 1955'.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECA, 1955"&gt;{{cite web|title=ECA, 1955|url=http://haryanafood.nic.in/Acts_1_Brown.html|accessdate=10 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925053555/http://haryanafood.nic.in/Acts_1_Brown.html|archivedate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECA was enacted way back in 1955. It has since been used by the Government to regulate the production, supply and distribution of a whole host of commodities it declares ‘essential’ in order to make them available to consumers at fair prices.

The list of items under the Act include drugs, fertilisers, pulses and edible oils, and petroleum and petroleum products. The Centre can include new commodities as and when the need arises, and take them off the list once the situation improves.

Here’s how it works. If the Centre finds that a certain commodity is in short supply and its price is spiking, it can notify stock-holding limits on it for a specified period. The States act on this notification to specify limits and take steps to ensure that these are adhered to. Anybody trading or dealing in the commodity, be it wholesalers, retailers or even importers are prevented from stockpiling it beyond a certain quantity.

A State can, however, choose not to impose any restrictions. But once it does, traders have to immediately sell into the market any stocks held beyond the mandated quantity. This improves supplies and brings down prices. As not all shopkeepers and traders comply, State agencies conduct raids to get everyone to toe the line and the errant are punished. The excess stocks are auctioned or sold through fair price shops.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7800">'''The Franchise Rule''' defines acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive in the franchise industry in the [[United States]]. The Franchise Rule is published by the [[Federal Trade Commission]].
The Franchise Rule seeks to facilitate informed decisions and to prevent deception in the sale of franchises by requiring franchisors to provide prospective franchisees with essential information prior to the sale. It does not, however, regulate the substance of the terms that control the relationship between franchisors and franchisees.
Also, while The Franchise Rule removed the regulation of the sale of franchises from the purview of the states under the authority of the FTC to regulate interstate commerce,  The FTC Franchise Rule does not require franchisors to disclose the unit performance statistics of the franchised system to new buyers of franchises as would be necessary and material under state and federal Securities and Exchange law.

==Franchise Law==
In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] has oversight of [[franchising]], rather than the US [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. 
The FTC administrates oversight via the FTC Franchise Rule.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/os/fedreg/2007/march/070330franchiserulefrnotice.pdf#page=102&lt;/ref&gt; 
The FTC announced an update to the franchise Rule on January 23, 2007, becoming effective July 1, 2007.&lt;ref name="ftc.gov"&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/01/franchiserule.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent version of the FTC ''Franchise Rule'' was in 2007, is printed in {{harvnb|FR|2007a|pp=15544–15575}}.

After July 2008, all franchisors in the United States are to use the [[Franchise Disclosure Document]] with potential franchisees.

==Franchise Law background==
The Federal Trade Commission began examining practices in franchising in 1970. In 1971 the FTC began a formal rule making proceeding, to possibly develop a regulation requiring disclosure and prohibiting unfair practices in offering and selling franchises. These developments resulted in promulgation of the FTC Franchise Rule in 1979. The FTC enforces the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] ("FTC Act"), which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.

The FTC Act also empowers the Commission to prescribe rules that define with specificity acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive. One such rule is the Commission's Franchise Rule.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/os/2002/06/020625bealesfranruletest.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission focuses much of its Franchise Rule enforcement and consumer educational resources on combating business opportunity fraud.

The Franchise Rule requires franchisors to make material disclosures in five categories: 
*(1)	the nature of the franchisor and the franchise system;
*(2)	the franchisor's financial viability;
*(3)	the costs involved in purchasing and operating a franchised outlet;
*(4)	the terms and conditions that govern the franchise relationship; and
*(5)	the names and addresses of current franchisees who can share their experiences within the franchise system, thus helping the prospective franchisee to verify independently the franchisor's claims.

In addition, franchisors must have a reasonable basis and substantiation for any earnings claims made to prospective franchisees, as well as disclose the basis and assumptions underlying any such earnings claims.  Earnings Claims are not required to be provided to prospective franchisees  under the FTC Rule and the majority of franchisors do not make earnings claims and do not disclose the unit performance statics of their franchisees to prospective franchisees.

The Franchise Rule generally covers two different types of business arrangements: franchises and business opportunity ventures.

==Franchise Agreements==
Franchise agreements typically involve retail outlets that bear the franchisor's trademark and follow the franchisor's business operations model, such as fast-food restaurants, hotels, and automotive repair shops. These are commonly known as "business-format" franchises.

==Franchise business opportunities rip offs==
Franchise business opportunities rip offs often do not entail a trademark or detailed business plan. 
The franchise business opportunity typically promises to provide the buyer with equipment that is used to sell products or services to the public, such as vending machines, rack displays, pay phones, or medical billing software, and frequently promises to find the buyer a market for the products or services.
Many business opportunities are outright scams that disappear shortly after taking consumers' money. Compliance with The Franchise Rule by business opportunity sellers is low.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;

==UFOC Franchise Disclosure Laws==
In addition to the FTC, fifteen states require pre-sale disclosure in franchise sales in the form of a [[Uniform Franchise Offering Circular]] ("UFOC").  
Because a UFOC is accepted by both the states and the FTC, the UFOC Guidelines have effectively become the national franchise disclosure standard.

==Franchise Rule Enforcement==
The Franchise Rule has the force and effect of law, and it may be enforced through civil penalty actions in federal courts.(10) The FTC Act authorizes courts to impose civil penalties of not more than $11,000 per compliance violation.

==Franchise Disclosure Document==
The Franchise Rule requires franchisors to provide all potential franchisees with a disclosure document containing 23 specific items of information about the offered franchise, its officers, and other franchisees.

Required Franchise Disclosure Document topics include: the franchise’s litigation history, past and current franchisees and their contact information, any exclusive territory that comes with the franchise, assistance the franchisor provides franchisees, and the cost of purchasing and starting up a franchise. If a franchisor makes representations about the financial performance of the franchise, this topic also must be covered, as well as the material basis backing up those representations."

==Franchise termination==
Franchise termination is covered in the franchise agreement between the franchiser and franchisee. In the 2007 Franchise Rule, comments from former franchisees were listed concerning confidentiality agreements and [[Franchise fraud]].

'''''Google Spain SL, Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, Mario Costeja González ''''' (2014) is a decision by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] (CJEU). It held that an [[Internet search engine]] operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal information which appears on web pages published by third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27388289 |title=EU court backs 'right to be forgotten' in Google case |work=[[BBC News]] |date=13 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EUpressrelease&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release No 70/14 (Judgment in Case C-131/12)|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-05/cp140070en.pdf|publisher=[[CJEU]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/technology/google-should-erase-web-links-to-some-personal-data-europes-highest-court-says.html |title=European Court Lets Users Erase Records on Web |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=13 May 2014|accessdate= 14 August 2014|author=David Streitfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-05/15/google-vs-spain | title=What we can salvage from 'right to be forgotten' ruling | publisher=Wired.co.uk | date=15 May 2014 | accessdate=16 May 2014 | author=Julia Powles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of the ruling is that an Internet search engine must consider requests from individuals to remove links to freely accessible web pages resulting from a search on their name. Grounds for removal include cases where the search result(s) "appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in the light of the time that had elapsed."&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|92}} If the search engine rejects the request, the individual may ask relevant authorities to consider the case. Under certain conditions, the search engine may be ordered to remove the links from search results.

The decision was claimed as a so-called ''[[right to be forgotten]]'',  although the Court did not explicitly grant such a right, depending instead on the data subject's rights deriving from [[:wikisource:Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union#Article 7 .E2.80.93 Respect for private and family life|Article 7]] (respect for private and family life) and [[:wikisource:Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union#Article 8 .E2.80.93 Protection of personal data|Article 8]] (protection of personal data) of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].&lt;ref name= "1 Essex Court"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baldry|first1=Tony|authorlink=Tony Baldry|last2=Hyams|first2=Oliver|title=The Right to Be Forgotten|url=http://1essexcourt.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/the-right-to-be-forgotten/|publisher=1 Essex Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[General Data Protection Regulation]] was mooted to include a right to be forgotten, but between the draft and the final version this was changed to a right to request erasure for a set of specific reasons.

==Facts==
In 1998 the Spanish newspaper ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' published two announcements in its printed edition regarding the forced sale of properties arising from social security debts. The announcements were published on the order of the [[Ministry of Employment and Social Security (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs]] and their purpose was to attract as many bidders as possible. A version of the edition was later made available on the [[World Wide Web|web]].&lt;ref&gt;The announcements in question: {{cite news |url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1998/01/19/pagina-23/33842001/pdf.html |title=Subhasta d'Immobles |newspaper=[[La Vanguardia]] |date=19 January 1998 |page=23 }} (in [[Catalan (language)|Catalan]]), accessed 16 May 2014. Translation: "Property auctions....the two undivided halves of a house at 8 Montseny St., owned by Mario Costeja González and Alicia Vargas Cots....."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Factsheet"/&gt;

One of the properties described in the newspaper announcements belonged to Mario Costeja González, who was named in the announcements. In November 2009, Costeja contacted the newspaper to complain that when his name was entered in the Google search engine it led to the announcements. He asked that the data relating to him be removed, arguing that the forced sale had been concluded years before and was no longer relevant. The newspaper replied that erasing his data was not appropriate since the publication had been on the order of the Spanish Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.&lt;ref name= GV-A/&gt;&lt;ref name= Toobin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toobin|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Solace of Oblivion|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/29/solace-oblivion|website=newyorker.com|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frantziou&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frantziou|first1=Eleni|title=Further Developments in the Right to be Forgotten: The European Court of Justice's Judgment in Case C-131/12, ''Google Spain, SL, Google Inc v Agencia Espanola de Proteccion de Datos''|url=http://hrlr.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/4/761.full|website=hrlr.oxfordjournals.org|publisher=Human Rights Law Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costeja then contacted [[Google]] Spain in February 2010, asking that the links to the announcements be removed. Google Spain forwarded the request to Google Inc., whose registered office is in California, United States, taking the view that this was the responsible body. Costeja subsequently lodged a complaint with the [[Spanish Data Protection Agency]] (''Agencia Española de Protección de Datos'', AEPD) asking both that the newspaper be required to remove the data, and that Google Spain or Google Inc. be required to remove the links to the data. On 30 July 2010, the Director of AEPD rejected the complaint against the newspaper but upheld the complaint against Google Spain and Google Inc., calling on them to remove the links complained of and make access to the data impossible.&lt;ref name="Hunton &amp; Williams LLP"/&gt;

Google Spain and Google Inc. subsequently brought separate actions against the decision before the ''[[Audiencia Nacional (Spain)|Audiencia Nacional]]'' (National High Court of Spain). Their appeal was based on:&lt;ref name="Hunton &amp; Williams LLP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jay |first1=Rosemary |title=EU Court of Justice Advocate-General Issues Opinion in Google Search Case |url=https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2013/07/articles/eu-court-of-justice-advocate-general-issues-opinion-in-google-search-case/ |publisher=[[Hunton &amp; Williams LLP]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XhgQSrij?url=https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2013/07/16/eu-court-of-justice-advocate-general-issues-opinion-in-google-search-case/ |archivedate=11 April 2015 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Google Inc. was not within the scope of the EU [[Data Protection Directive|Directive 95/46/EC]] (''Data Protection Directive'') and its subsidiary Google Spain was not responsible for the search engine
# there was no processing of personal data within the search function
# even were there processing, neither Google Inc. nor Google Spain could be regarded as a [[Directive 95/46/EC#Scope|data controller]]
# in any event, the data subject (Costeja) did not have the right to erasure of lawfully published material

The Audiencia Nacional joined the actions and stayed the proceedings pending a preliminary ruling from the CJEU on a number of questions regarding the interpretation of the ''Data Protection Directive''. These questions fell into three groups. In essence they concerned:&lt;ref name="Factsheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name= GV-A/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frantziou/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunton &amp; Williams LLP"/&gt;

# the territorial scope of the Directive
# the legal position of an Internet search engine service provider under the Directive, especially in terms of the Directive's [[subject-matter jurisdiction|material scope]] and as to whether the search engine could be regarded as a data controller
# whether the Directive establishes a so-called ''[[right to be forgotten]]''

All of these questions, also raising important points of fundamental rights protection, were new to the court. Because new points of law were involved, the opinion of an [[European Court of Justice#Advocates-General|advocate general]] was sought by the court.&lt;ref name="Hunton &amp; Williams LLP"/&gt;

===Procedure===
Written proceedings followed by an oral hearing were held on 26 February 2013, at which, besides the parties, the governments of Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain and Poland and the European Commission gave their opinion. Advocate General [[Niilo Jääskinen]] gave his opinion on 25 June 2013, after which judgment was given on 13 May 2014.

===Advocate general's opinion===
The purpose of an advocate general's opinion is to advise the court on new points of law. It is not binding on the court. In this case the advocate general was Niilo Jääskinen from Finland.&lt;ref name="Hunton &amp; Williams LLP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release No 77/13 (Advocate General's Opinion in Case C-131/12)|url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2013-06/cp130077en.pdf|publisher=[[CJEU]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocate General Jääskinen made frequent reference in his opinion to the fact that the ''Data Protection Directive'' predates the Google era (it dates from 1995 and is due to be replaced in May 2018 by the ''[[General Data Protection Regulation]]''). On the first set of questions, the advocate general found that Google's business model brought Google Inc. and Google Spain within the scope of the Directive.&lt;ref name = "Opinion"/&gt;{{rp|64–68}} On the second set of questions concerning the material scope of the Directive, the advocate general held that Google could not be regarded as a data controller: Google's search activities involve the processing of personal data, but Google does not thereby become a data controller for the content of the material when the processing is carried out in a haphazard, indiscriminate and random manner. In the advocate general's view the sense of the Directive was that "the controller is aware of the existence of a certain defined category of information amounting to personal data and the controller processes this data with some intention which relates to their processing as personal data".&lt;ref name = "Opinion"/&gt;{{rp|B 76–83}}

In the event that the court did not agree with his finding that Google was not a data controller, the advocate general considered the third set of questions relating to a ''right to be forgotten''. He held that the rights of freedom of information and expression took precedence over any such right to erasure, and urged the court not to allow case-by-case resolution of such conflicts as that would likely lead to the "automatic withdrawal of links to any objected contents or to an unmanageable number of requests handled by the most popular and important Internet search engine service providers."&lt;ref name = "Opinion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion of Advocate General Niilo Jääskinen delivered on 25 June 2013 – Case C‑131/12|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?doclang=EN&amp;text=&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;part=1&amp;mode=lst&amp;docid=138782&amp;occ=first&amp;dir=&amp;cid=45442|publisher=[[CJEU]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}}

==Judgment==
The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that an Internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties, upholding a right of erasure.&lt;ref name=EUpressrelease/&gt;&lt;ref name="Factsheet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Court of Justice Upholds Right to Erasure in Google Search Case|url=https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2014/05/articles/eu-court-justice-upholds-right-erasure-google-search-case/|publisher=[[Hunton &amp; Williams LLP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court considered the material scope of the Directive first. The court rejected Google's submission, supported by the Advocate General, that it could not be regarded as a data controller within the scope of the ''Data Protection Directive'', adopting a literal interpretation of article 2(b), giving definitions and relying on ''[[Bodil Lindqvist v Åklagarkammaren i Jönköping|Lindqvist]]''.&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|21–41}}&lt;ref name = "Lindqvist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judgment of the Court in Case C-101/01 (''Lindqvist'')|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=48382&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=211991|publisher=[[CJEU]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

Regarding the territorial scope of the Directive, the court observed that Google Spain is a subsidiary of Google Inc. on Spanish territory and, therefore, an 'establishment' within the meaning of the directive.&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|48–49}} The court rejected Google Inc.'s argument that it was not carrying out its data processing in Spain, holding that the promotion and selling of advertising space by its subsidiary Google Spain was sufficient to constitute processing within the meaning of the directive.&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|50–57}} To have ruled otherwise would have been to undermine the effectiveness of the directive and the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals that the directive seeks to ensure.&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|58}} The court thus endorsed the Advocate General's view that Google Inc. and Google Spain should be treated as a single economic unit.&lt;ref name = "Opinion"/&gt;{{rp|66–67}}

Concerning the obligations and duties of the operator of a search engine, the court held that in the present case Article 7(f) of the directive, relating to legitimacy of processing, requires a balancing of the opposing rights and interests of the data subject (González) and the data controller (Google), taking into account the data subject's rights deriving from articles 7 (respect for private and family life) and 8 (protection of personal data) of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]].&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|73–74}} Article 14(a) of the Directive, relating to the data subject's rights, allows the data subject, at least in the cases covered by articles 7(e) and 7(f), to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing of data relating to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation.&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|76}} Article 12(b) of the directive, relating to the data subject's right of access to the data, allows the data subject to request erasure of the data. Such request may be made directly of the controller, who must then duly examine the merits of the request. If the request is not granted, the data subject may then direct the request to a supervisory authority or the judicial authority so that it carries out the necessary checks and orders the controller to take specific measures accordingly.&lt;ref name="Judgment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judgment of the Court in Case C‑131/12 (''Costeja'')|url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?doclang=EN&amp;text=&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;part=1&amp;mode=DOC&amp;docid=152065&amp;occ=first&amp;dir=&amp;cid=667631|publisher=[[CJEU]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}}

Regarding the question relating to the so-called ''right to be forgotten'', the court noted that Google Spain, Google Inc., the Greek, Austrian and Polish governments and the [[European Commission]] considered that this question should be answered in the negative.&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|90}} The court held, however, that the processing of data which is "inadequate, irrelevant or excessive" (i.e. not merely inaccurate) might also be incompatible with the directive.&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|92}} In such cases, where the data is incompatible with the provisions of article 6(1)(e) to (f) of the directive, relating to data quality, the information and links in the list of the results must be erased.&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|94}} It is not necessary that the information is prejudicial to the data subject.&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|96}}

==Significance==
The ruling balances the right to privacy and data protection in [[European law]] with the legitimate interest of the public to access such information, and it does not mandate that information is instantly removed upon request. It distinguishes between public figures and private persons. The Court stressed that Internet search engines profile individuals in modern society in an ubiquitous manner, in a way that could not otherwise have been obtained formerly save only with the greatest difficulty.&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|80}} The data subject's rights must therefore in general override "as a rule, not only the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in finding that information upon a search relating to the data subject's name", but that would not be the case if the role played by the data subject in public life is such "that the interference with his fundamental rights is justified by the preponderant interest of the general public in having, on account of inclusion in the list of results, access to the information in question".&lt;ref name="Judgment"/&gt;{{rp|97}}

Google subsequently published an online form which can be used by [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]] or [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA nationals]] to request the removal of links from its search results if the data linked is "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27631001 Google sets up 'right to be forgotten' form after EU ruling] ''BBC News'', 30 May 2014.

On 19 June 2015, Google announced it would remove links to [[nonconsensual pornography]] ("revenge porn") on request. Commentators noted that this was not the same thing as implementing a "right to be forgotten" as the company already has policies in place dealing with sensitive personal data such as social security numbers and credit card numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golbeck|first1=Jennifer|title=Google to Remove Revenge Porn from Search Results|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/06/19/google_announces_plan_to_remove_revenge_porn_from_search_results.html|website=slate.com|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the consumer advocacy group [[Consumer Watchdog]] subsequently called on Google to extend the right to be forgotten to US users, filing a complaint with the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eng|first1=James|title=Consumer Watchdog: Google Should Extend 'Right To Be Forgotten' to U.S.|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/consumer-watchdog-google-should-extend-right-be-forgotten-u-s-n388131|website=nbcnews.com|publisher=[[NBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook is an extremely valuable resource for freedom of expression and information sharing, but most of the "personal data" published there be it banal or wacky would not avail itself of any specific public interest defence.

|A piece on TheUndisciplined.com drew attention to the fact that Google's classification as a "data controller" could be appropriate regarding Google's collection and use of aggregated and personal data for advertising and other commercial purposes, but that the information presented by an automated service in the form of results from a search engine might not be as easily designated as "controlled" or "processed" data;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNamee|first1=Shane|title=Europe and The Right to Be Forgotten: A Memorable Victory for Privacy or Defeat for Free Speech?|url=http://theundisciplined.com/2014/05/17/europe-and-the-right-to-be-forgotten-a-memorable-victory-for-privacy-or-defeat-for-free-speech/|website=TheUndisciplined.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote| [...]the problems which really result from the court's ruling stem from the designation of Google and other search engines as "data controllers", as this is setting the threshold for "processing" or "controlling" of information rather low.

It is also very important to keep in mind that Google's formula for generating search results is a totally different topic from Google Adwords and Google's processing of actual personal data for advertising reasons. That sort of data processing is only used for targeted ads and the like, and it is not this "data controlling" about which we talk when we discuss search results from Google's search engine. Popular dissatisfaction with companies like Google who collect and benefit from the use of personal data and preferences might have led some to confuse Google's data gathering for advertising practices with the workings of the algorithms used to automatically generate search results.}}
|The ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' (HLR) examines criticism that the court got it wrong.

== Implementation ==
The EU's [[Article 29 Working Party|Article 29 Data Protection Working Party]] issued its guidelines on how the ruling should be implemented on 26 November 2014.&lt;ref name="Article 29 Working Party"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines on the implementation of the Court of Justice of the European Union judgment on "Google Spain SL and Google Inc. v Agencia Española de Protección de Datos (AEPD) and Mario Costeja González" C – 131/12|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp225_en.pdf|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=[[European Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LSE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementing the "right to be forgotten": the Article 29 Working Party speaks up|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2014/12/03/implementing-the-right-to-be-forgotten-the-article-29-working-party-speaks-up/|website=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Google published its advisory committee's report on how the ruling should be implemented on 5 February 2015. Their advisory committee includes [[Luciano Floridi]], Professor of Philosophy and Ethics of Information at the [[University of Oxford]], [[Frank La Rue]], who served as [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, from August 2008 to August 2014, and [[Jimmy Wales]], a founder of Wikipedia. The committee recommended that only national links, not global links, should be removed, and that publishers should be notified of the removals and have the right to challenge them.&lt;ref name="Google Advisory Committee"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Advisory Committee to Google on the Right to be Forgotten (report)|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1UgZshetMd4cEI3SjlvV0hNbDA/view|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Floridi&gt;{{cite news|last1=Floridi|first1=Luciano|title=Should You Have The Right To Be Forgotten on Google?

On 7 February 2015, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that the chairwoman of the Article 29 Working Party, {{Interlanguage link multi|Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin|fr}}, has warned Google that it faces legal action if it fails to heed its warnings over the way Google is policing the ruling.

==Details==
===Modus of scam===
After [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]] (CAG) in 2013 had blamed the Hooda government for flouting the rules to lease Ulhawas gram panchayat land to Rajiv Gandhi the trust in violation of rules, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had questioned Hood government for not handing case over to CBI. Hooda government in turn challenged the High Court decision of CBI inquiry in the Supreme Court. Supreme Court asked Haryana's new government of Chief Minister [[Manohar Lal Khattar]] to hand over the case to CBI for inquiry. Subsequently, Haryana government handed this case over to CBI.&lt;ref name=chor10&gt;[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/leasing-of-land-to-rajiv-gandhi-charitable-trust-to-come-under-cbi-lens/articleshow/61472968.cms Leasing of land to Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust to come under CBI]. [[The Economic Times|Economic Times]], 2 Nov 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; New government of Haryana, has also initiated the process to recover this land from the trust.&lt;ref name=chor9&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/haryana-moves-to-recover-land-from-rajiv-gandhi-trust/720982/ Haryana moves to recover land from Rajiv Gandhi Trust], Financial Express, 15 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=take1&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/high-court-stays-order-halting-construction-at-rajiv-gandhi-trusts-eye-hospital-site-in-gurgaon-4725193/ High Court stays order halting construction at Rajiv Gandhi Trust's land], [[Indian Express]], 27 Jun 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=take2&gt;[https://medicaldialogues.in/haryana-govt-refuses-occupation-certificate-to-rgct-hospital-project/ Haryana govt refuses occupation certificate to RGCT hospital project], Medical Dialogues, 17 Jun 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heresy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛr|ə|s|i}}) is any belief or theory that is strongly at variance with established beliefs or customs, in particular the accepted beliefs of a church or religious organization. A heretic is a proponent of such claims or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/heresy?s=t |title=Heresy &amp;#124; Define Heresy at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heresy is distinct from both [[apostasy]], which is the explicit renunciation of one's religion, principles or cause,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/Apostasy |title=Apostasy &amp;#124; Learn everything there is to know about Apostasy at |publisher=Reference.com |accessdate=2013-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717065224/http://www.reference.com/browse/apostasy |archivedate=2013-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[blasphemy]], which is an impious utterance or action concerning God or sacred things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/blasphemy |title=Definitions of "blasphemy" at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is usually used to refer to violations of important [[religious law|religious]] teachings, but is used also of views strongly opposed to any generally accepted ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/heresy|title=heresy - definition of heresy in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in particular in reference to [[Heresy in Christianity|Christianity]], [[Heresy in Judaism|Judaism]], and [[Bid‘ah|Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MwuUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22heretics+rather+than+critics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bA-QU87KLdKg7Aa9qoCgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heretics%20rather%20than%20critics%22&amp;f=false Daryl Glaser, David M. Walker (editors), ''Twentieth-Century Marxism'' (Routledge 2007] {{ISBN|978-1-13597974-4}}), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain historical Christian, Islamic and Jewish cultures, among others, espousing ideas deemed heretical has been and in some cases still is subjected not merely to punishments such as [[excommunication]], but even the death penalty.

==Etymology==
The term ''heresy'', from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἵρεσις}}, originally meant "choice" or "thing chosen",&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F.L.; Livingstone, E.A., eds. (1974). "Heresy". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (2 ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but it came to mean the "party or school of a man's choice"&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, F.F. ''The Spreading Flame'', Exeter: Paternoster 1964, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; and also referred to that process whereby a young person would examine various philosophies to determine how to live. The word "heresy" is usually used within a Christian, Jewish, or Islamic context, and implies slightly different meanings in each. The founder or leader of a heretical movement is called a [[heresiarch]], while individuals who espouse heresy or commit heresy are known as heretics. [[Heresiology]] is the study of heresy.

==Christianity==
[[File:Portrait of Martin Luther as an Augustinian Monk.jpg|thumb|Former German Catholic [[friar]] [[Martin Luther]] was famously excommunicated as a heretic by [[Pope Leo X]] by his [[Papal bull]] ''[[Decet Romanum Pontificem]]'' in 1520. To this day, the Papal decree has not been rescinded.]]
{{Main article|Heresy in Christianity|List of Christian heresies}}
According to Titus 3:10 a divisive person should be warned twice before separating from him.

The [[Church Fathers]] identified [[Jews]] and [[Judaism]] with heresy. They saw deviations from orthodox Christianity as heresies that were essentially Jewish in spirit.&lt;ref name=RobertM1/&gt; [[Tertullian]] implied that it was the Jews who most inspired heresy in Christianity: "From the Jew the heretic has accepted guidance in this discussion [that [[Judaism's view of Jesus|Jesus was not the Christ]].]"

The use of the word "heresy" was given wide currency by [[Irenaeus]] in his 2nd century tract ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Contra Haereses]]'' (''Against Heresies'') to describe and discredit his opponents during the early centuries of the Christian community. He described the community's beliefs and doctrines as [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] (from {{lang|grc|ὀρθός}}, ''orthos'' "straight" + {{lang|grc|δόξα}}, ''doxa'' "belief") and the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]' teachings as heretical.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} He also pointed out the concept of [[apostolic succession]] to support his arguments.&lt;ref name="Frend"&gt;

|author=Charles Freeman |year=2008}} As Christianity placed its stamp upon the Empire, the Emperor shaped the church for political purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; which made Christianity the [[state church of the Roman Empire]]. Prior to the issuance of this edict, the Church had no state-sponsored support for any particular legal mechanism to counter what it perceived as "heresy". By this edict the state's authority and that of the Church became somewhat overlapping. One of the outcomes of this blurring of Church and state was the sharing of state powers of legal enforcement with church authorities. This reinforcement of the Church's authority gave church leaders the power to, in effect, pronounce the death sentence upon those whom the church considered heretical.

Within six years of the official criminalization of heresy by the Emperor, the first Christian heretic to be executed, [[Priscillian]], was condemned in 386 by Roman secular officials for sorcery, and put to death with four or five followers.&lt;ref name=EEC&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oUFFAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA950&amp;dq=Chadwick+Early+Church+Priscillian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z1J4U4OXGrHB7AavyYCwBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Chadwick%20Early%20Church%20Priscillian&amp;f=false Everett Ferguson (editor), ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'' (Routledge 2013] {{ISBN|978-1-13661158-2}}), p. 950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u4i8jv0b7IkC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=Chadwick+Early+Church+Priscillian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6E54U42xC7Ku7AbP5YDoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Chadwick%20Early%20Church%20Priscillian&amp;f=false John Anthony McGuckin, ''The Westminister Handbook to Patristic Theology'' (Westminster John Knox Press 2004] {{ISBN|978-0-66422396-0}}), p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/477170/Priscillian|title=Priscillian|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his accusers were excommunicated both by Ambrose of Milan and Pope Siricius,&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, Henry.

The Catholic Church by no means had a monopoly on the execution of heretics.  The charge of heresy was a weapon that could fit many hands.

[[File:Massacre of the Vaudois of Merindol.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Massacre of the [[Waldensians]] of [[Massacre of Mérindol|Mérindol]] in 1545.]]

In the [[Catholic Church]], obstinate and willful manifest heresy is considered to spiritually cut one off from the Church, even before [[excommunication]] is incurred. The ''[[Codex Justinianus]]'' (1:5:12) defines "everyone who is not devoted to the Catholic Church and to our Orthodox holy Faith" a heretic.&lt;ref name=RobertM2/&gt; The Church had always dealt harshly with strands of Christianity that it considered heretical, but before the 11th century these tended to centre on individual preachers or small localised sects, like [[Arianism]], [[Pelagianism]], [[Donatism]], [[Marcionism]] and [[Montanism]]. The diffusion of the almost [[Manichaean]] sect of [[Paulician]]s westwards gave birth to the famous 11th and 12th century heresies of Western Europe. The first one was that of [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] in modern-day Bosnia, a sort of sanctuary between Eastern and Western Christianity. By the 11th century, more organised groups such as the [[Pataria|Patarini]], the [[Dulcinian]]s, the [[Waldensians]] and the [[Cathars]] were beginning to appear in the towns and cities of northern Italy, southern France and Flanders.

In France the Cathars grew to represent a popular mass movement and the belief was spreading to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897752-1,00.html Massacre of the Pure]."

[[File:Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Cristiano Banti]]'s 1857 painting ''Galileo facing the [[Roman Inquisition]].'']]
[[Galileo Galilei]] was [[Galileo affair|brought before the Inquisition]] for heresy, but [[Abjuration|abjured]] his views and was sentenced to [[house arrest]], under which he spent the rest of his life. Galileo was found "vehemently suspect of heresy", namely of having held the opinions that the [[heliocentrism#Publication of de Revolutionibus (1543)|Sun lies motionless at the centre of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves]], and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture. He was required to "abjure, curse and detest" those opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288–293).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory I]] stigmatized Judaism and the Jewish people in many of his writings. He described Jews as enemies of Christ: "The more the [[Holy Spirit]] fills the world, the more perverse hatred dominates the souls of the Jews." He labeled all heresy as "Jewish", claiming that Judaism would "pollute [Catholics and] deceive them with sacrilegious seduction."&lt;ref name=RobertM76&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michael|first1=Robert|title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism : The Dark Side of the Church|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0230111318|pages=76|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZnFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=antisemitism+jews+jewish+heretics+heresy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wc7_FQaTAj&amp;sig=CzUEubnkVNbs8SedIKEa3US63yg&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l7_YVMjmKYX5yQO_m4LIBw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=heretic&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of Jews and heretics in particular occurred several times in [[Medieval Roman law|Roman-Christian law]].&lt;ref name=RobertM2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michael|first1=Robert|title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism : The Dark Side of the Church|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0230111318|pages=219|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZnFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=anti-semitism+jews+jewish+heretics+heresy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wc7_FQaTAj&amp;sig=CzUEubnkVNbs8SedIKEa3US63yg&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l7_YVMjmKYX5yQO_m4LIBw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=heretic&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Constitutio Sirmondiana'', 6 + 14; ''Theodosius II - Novella'' 3; ''Codex Theodosianus'' 16:5:44, 16:8:27, 16:8:27; ''Codex Justinianus'' 1:3:54, 1:5:12+21, 1:10:2; ''Justinian, Novellae'' 37 + 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Orthodox Church===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
In [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] heresy most commonly refers to those beliefs declared heretical by the [[first seven Ecumenical Councils]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Since the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]], various Christian churches have also used the concept in proceedings against individuals and groups those churches deemed heretical. The [[Orthodox Church]] also rejects the early Christian heresies such as [[Arianism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Origenism]], [[Montanism]], [[Judaizers]], [[Marcionism]], [[Docetism]], [[Adoptionism]], [[Nestorianism]], [[Monophysitism]], [[Monothelitism]] and [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]].

===Protestantism===
In his work "[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]" (1543), German [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] leader [[Martin Luther and antisemitism|Martin Luther]] claims that Jewish history was "assailed by much heresy", and that Christ the ''[[Logos (Christianity)|logos]]'' swept away the Jewish heresy and goes on to do so, "as it still does daily before our eyes." He stigmatizes [[Jewish prayer]] as being "blasphemous" and a lie, and vilifies Jews in general as being spiritually "blind" and "surely possessed by all devils." Luther calls the members of the Catholic Church "papists" and heretics, and has a special spiritual problem with Jewish [[circumcision]].&lt;ref name=Luther-AntiSemitism&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luther|first1=Martin|last2=Rydie|first2=Coleman, ed.|title=On The Jews and Their Lies|date=February 18, 2009|publisher=lulu.com|isbn=978-0557050239|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uEGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=On+The+Jews+and+Their+Lies&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7_DYVJaRN8T8ygPQhIKwCA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=On%20The%20Jews%20and%20Their%20Lies&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the 16th-century European Reformation resulted in a number of executions on charges of heresy. During the thirty-eight years of [[Henry VIII]]'s reign, about sixty heretics, mainly Protestants, were executed and a rather greater number of Catholics lost their lives on grounds of political offences such as treason, notably [[Sir Thomas More]] and Cardinal [[John Fisher]], for refusing to accept the king's supremacy over the Church in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUCY3otvttEC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=More+refusal+accept+royal+supremacy+church&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0NglU8WWGMeShQfup4HgDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=More%20refusal%20accept%20royal%20supremacy%20church&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Tudor England|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wBdOvs2THGEC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=More+refusal+accept+royal+supremacy+church&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0NglU8WWGMeShQfup4HgDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=More%20refusal%20accept%20royal%20supremacy%20church&amp;f=false Ron Christenson, ''Political Trials in History'' (Transaction Publishers 1991] {{ISBN|978-0-88738406-6}}), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pwoTGSsiqa4C&amp;pg=PA558&amp;dq=More+refusal+accept+royal+supremacy+church&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6t4lU6myMdGGhQeB3IHgAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=More%20refusal%20accept%20royal%20supremacy%20church&amp;f=false Oliver O'Donovan, Joan Lockwood O'Donovan, ''From Irenaeus to Grotius'' (Eerdmans 1999] {{ISBN|978-0-80284209-1}}), p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]; even so two radicals were executed in Edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation, the other for denying Christ's divinity).&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;Dickens, A.G. ''The English Reformation'' Fontana/Collins 1967, p.327/p.364&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Mary, around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt; When [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] came to the throne, the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 [[Act of Supremacy]] and the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of "...a subversive [[fifth column]]."&lt;ref name="Neill"&gt;Neill, Stephen. ''Anglicanism'' Pelican, pp.96,7&lt;/ref&gt;  The last execution of a "heretic" in England occurred under [[James VI and I]] in 1612.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid. ''Thomas Cranmer'' Yale 1996, p.477&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the charge was technically one of "blasphemy" there was one later execution in Scotland (still at that date an entirely independent kingdom) when in 1697 [[Thomas Aikenhead]] was accused, among other things, of denying the doctrine of the Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid. ''The Reformation'' Penguin 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;679&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the persecution of heretics under Protestant rule was the execution of the [[Boston martyrs]] in 1659, 1660, and 1661. These executions resulted from the actions of the [[Anglican]] [[Puritans]], who at that time wielded political as well as ecclesiastic control in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. At the time, the colony leaders were apparently hoping to achieve their vision of a "purer absolute theocracy" within their colony .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} As such, they perceived the teachings and practices of the rival Quaker sect as heretical, even to the point where laws were passed and executions were performed with the aim of ridding their colony of such perceived "heresies". {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}    It should be noticed that the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] communions generally regard the Puritans themselves as having been heterodox or heretical.

===Modern era===
{{See also|Christian heresy in the modern era}}
The era of mass persecution and execution of heretics under the banner of Christianity came to an end in 1826 with the last execution of a "heretic", [[Cayetano Ripoll]], by the [[Spanish Inquisition]].

Although less common than in earlier periods, in modern times, formal charges of heresy within Christian churches still occur. Issues in the Protestant churches have included modern biblical criticism and the nature of God. In the Catholic Church, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] criticizes writings for "ambiguities and errors" without using the word "heresy".&lt;ref&gt;An example is the [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010515_vidal_en.html Notification regarding certain writings of Fr. Marciano Vidal, C.Ss.R.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps due to the many modern negative connotations associated with the term ''heretic'', such as the Spanish inquisition, the term is used less often today. The subject of Christian heresy opens up broader questions as to who has a monopoly on spiritual truth, as explored by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in the short story "[[The Theologians]]" within the compilation ''[[Labyrinths]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Labyrinths |first=Jorge Luis |last=Borges |year=1962 |pages=119–126 |isbn=978-0-8112-0012-7 |publisher=New Directions Publishing Corporation |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2007, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stated&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the documents [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.html "Responses to Some Questions"] and [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_commento-responsa_en.html "Commentary"] from the Congregation on the Doctrine of the Faith.&lt;/ref&gt; that all non-Catholic churches are "ecclesial communities." The members of these churches accuse the Vatican of effectively calling them heretics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jul/11/catholicism.religion Dismay and anger as Pope declares Protestants cannot have churches], [[The Guardian]], 11 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progressivetheology.org/essays/2007.07.11-Pope-Ecumenism.html Will the Pope's Pronouncement Set Ecumenism Back a Hundred Years?], Progressivetheology.org, 11 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In some modern day nations and regions, heresy remains an offense punishable by death.

In addition, the more right-wing groups within Orthodox Judaism hold that all Jews who reject the simple meaning of [[Maimonides]]'s 13 principles of Jewish faith are heretics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised'', by Marc B. Shapiro, {{ISBN|1-874774-90-0}}, A book written as a contentious rebuttal to an article written in the ''[[Torah u'Maddah Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, most of Orthodox Judaism considers [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] heretical movements, and regards most of [[Conservative Judaism]] as heretical. The liberal wing of [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodoxy]] is more tolerant of Conservative Judaism, particularly its right wing, as there is some theological and practical overlap between these groups.

==Other religions==
The act of using [[Church of Scientology]] techniques in a form different than originally described by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] is referred to within Scientology as "[[squirreling]]" and is said by Scientologists to be ''high treason''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert W. | last = Welkos |author2=Sappell, Joel | title = When the Doctrine Leaves the Church | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062990b,0,4204659.story | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 29 June 1990 | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religious Technology Center]] has prosecuted breakaway groups that have practiced Scientology [[Free Zone (Scientology)|outside the official Church]] without authorization.

Although [[Zoroastrianism]] has had an historical tolerance for other religions, it also held sects like [[Zurvanism]] and [[Mazdakism]] heretical to its main dogma and has violently persecuted them, such as burying Mazdakians with their feet upright as "human gardens". In later periods Zoroastrians cooperated with Muslims to kill other Zoroastrians deemed as heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Houtsma, Martijn Theodoor (1936), First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913-1936: E.J.Brill's, BRILL, {{ISBN|90-04-09796-1}}, 9789004097964&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neo-Confucian]] heresy has been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The construction of orthodoxy and heresy: Neo-Confucian, Islamic, Jewish, and early Christian patterns |author= John B. Henderson|year= 1998 |isbn= 978-0-7914-3760-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-religious usage==
In other contexts the term does not necessarily have [[pejorative]] overtones and may even be complimentary when used, in areas where innovation is welcome, of ideas that are in fundamental disagreement with the ''[[status quo]]'' in any practice and branch of knowledge. Scientist/author [[Isaac Asimov]] considered heresy as an abstraction,&lt;ref name=Goldsmith&gt;{{cite book
|title=Scientists Confront Velikovsky
|author=Donald Goldsmith |year=1977
|isbn=0-8014-0961-6}} Asimov's views
are in "Forward: The Role of the Heretic".&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning religious, political, socioeconomic and scientific heresies. He divided scientific heretics into [[Scientist#Endoheretics|endoheretics]] (those from within the [[scientific community]]) and [[Scientist#Exoheretics|exoheretics]] (those from without). Characteristics were ascribed to both and [[Scientists#Heretics|examples]] of both kinds were offered. Asimov concluded that science orthodoxy defends itself well against endoheretics (by control of science education, grants and publication as examples), but is nearly powerless against exoheretics. He acknowledged by examples that heresy has repeatedly become orthodoxy.

The revisionist [[paleontologist]] [[Robert T. Bakker]], who published his findings as ''[[The Dinosaur Heresies]]'', treated the mainstream view of dinosaurs as [[dogma]].&lt;ref
name="Bakker"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dinosaur Heresies
|author=Robert T. Bakker |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-8065-2260-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"I have enormous respect for dinosaur paleontologists past and present. But on average, for the last fifty years, the field hasn't tested dinosaur orthodoxy severely enough." page 27  "Most taxonomists, however, have viewed such new terminology as dangerously destabilizing to the traditional and well-known scheme..." page 462. The illustrations by the author show dinosaurs in very active poses, in contrast to the traditional perception of lethargy. He is an example of a recent scientific endoheretic.

[[Immanuel Velikovsky]] is an example of a recent scientific exoheretic; he did not have appropriate [[Credential#Academic and professional credentials|scientific credentials]] or did not publish in [[scientific journal]]s. While the details of his work are in scientific disrepute, the concept of [[Catastrophism|catastrophic change]] ([[extinction event]] and [[punctuated equilibrium]]) has gained acceptance in recent decades.

The term "heresy" is used not only with regard to religion but also in the context of political theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763942,00.html|title=Religion: Anti-Religion|date=6 May 1940|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1060&amp;chapter=104181&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 Ludwig von Mises, ''Trotsky's Heresy - Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isreview.org/issue/91/exploring-high-moments-and-small-mountain-roads-marxism|title=Exploring the high moments and small mountain roads of Marxism|work=isreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term heresy is also used as an ideological [[Pigeonholing|pigeonhole]] for contemporary writers because, by definition, heresy depends on contrasts with an established [[orthodoxy]]. For example, the tongue-in-cheek contemporary usage of heresy, such as to categorize a "[[Wall Street]] heresy" a "[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] heresy" or a "[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] heresy," are [[metaphor]]s that invariably retain a [[subtext]] that links orthodoxies in [[geology]] or [[biology]] or any other field to religion. These expanded metaphoric senses allude to both the difference between the person's views and the mainstream and the boldness of such a person in propounding these views.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8859">'''Immaterial labor''' is a [[Marxist]], [[Autonomism|Autonomist]] framework to describe how value is produced from affective and [[Cognition|cognitive]] activities, which, in various ways, are [[commodification|commodified]] in [[capitalism|capitalist]] economies. The concept of immaterial labor was coined by Italian sociologist and philosopher [[Maurizio Lazzarato]] in his 1996 essay "Immaterial Labor", published as a contribution to ''Radical Thought in Italy'' and edited by Virno and Hardt.&lt;ref name="VirnoHardt1996"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Lazzarato|first = Maurizio|contribution=Immaterial labor|year=1996|title=Radical Thought in Italy : A Potential Politics|editor-last=Virno|editor-first=Paolo|editor2-last=Hardt|editor2-first=Michael|pages=142-157|publisher=University of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was re-published in 1997 as: ''Lavoro immateriale. Forme di vita e produzione di soggettività.'' (Ombre corte).&lt;ref&gt;Lazzarato, Maurizio, [http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcimmateriallabour3.htm "Immaterial Labor."]  Generation Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Lazzarato was a participant in the [[Autonomia Operaia]] group as a student in Padua in the 1970s, and is a member of the editorial group of the journal Multitudes. Post-Marxist scholars including [[Franco Berardi]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Michael Hardt]], [[Judith Revel]], and [[Paolo Virno]], among others have also employed the concept.

==Areas of Application==
===Digital Capitalism===
Studies of immaterial labor have included analysis of high-technology industries, although immaterial labor is understood as a concept far pre-dating digital technologies, specifically in the performance of gender and domestic roles, and other aspects of [[Affective labor|affective]] and [[Cognition|cognitive]] work.&lt;ref name=Terranova&gt;Terranova, Tiziana. [http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/technocapitalism/voluntary "Free Labor: Producing Culture for the Digital Economy."] Electronic Book Review. June 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes commonly associated with immaterial labor in the context of the internet include: [[digital labor]], [[commons-based peer production]], and [[user-generated content]] production, which might include [[open source]], [[free software]], [[crowdsourcing]], and flexible licensing agreements, as well as the collapse of copyright amidst the ambiguities of sharing creative works in the digital age, digital care work, and other conditions produced by participation in social environments within the digital, [[knowledge economy]].&lt;ref name=Terranova /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogost, Ian. [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/hyperemployment-or-the-exhausting-work-of-the-technology-user/281149/ "Hyperemployment or the exhausting work of the technology user."] The Atlantic. November 08, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===
Feminism adopted discussions of immaterial labor to describe the alienating conditions and labors pertaining to care work, the performance of gender and domestic labor. The social-wage campaign, [[Wages for housework]], co-founded in 1972 in Italy, by [[Selma James]] called for a wage for domestic work amidst the uneven and gendered privatization of the labor of social production, where traditionally feminine roles like [[care work]] are undervalued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nplusonemag.com/issue-17/reviews/more-smiles-more-money/ "More Smiles? More Money."] N+1 Magazine. Issue 17, Fall 2013. Dayna Tortorici.&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-colonial feminist writer Lisa Nakamura, and others have described immaterial labor in the performance of online identity, and racial identity and identity performance, or "avatarization of the self".&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Lisa. 2002. Cybertypes: race, ethnicity, and identity on the Internet. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Lisa. 2008. Digitizing race visual cultures of the Internet. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nakamura concerns herself with the role of women of color integrated, and often undermined, into the circuit of production. In "Indigenous Circuits: Navajo Women and the Racialization of Early Electronic Manufacture" Nakamura draws upon feminist theorist Donna Haraway's ''Cyborg Manifesto'' to understand the role of the production chain and a commodification of Navajo women textile work. This relationship between craft and industrial labor ties into larger concepts of gender stereotypes, surveillance, and the identity politics of globalization. Her historical research lends itself to this broader discussion, "They were cited as evidence that digital work—the work of the hand and its digits—could be painlessly transferred from the indigenous cultural context into the world of technological commercial innovation, benefiting both in the process." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=Lisa|date=2014-12-15|title=Indigenous Circuits: Navajo Women and the Racialization of Early Electronic Manufacture|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/563663|journal=American Quarterly|language=en|volume=66|issue=4|pages=919–941|doi=10.1353/aq.2014.0070|issn=1080-6490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consent agreements or contracts between social media and [[user-generated content]] platforms and their users have been proposed as a way of minimizing immaterial labor by allowing users to have more control over the use and circulation of the content, [[data]], and [[metadata]] they produce.

===Creative works===
The idea of "creative labor" has been analyzed in the context of immaterial labor.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Brouillette [http://www.mediationsjournal.org/articles/creative-labor "Creative Labor."] "Marxism and Literature Revisited." Vol. 24. No. 2., Spring, 2009. mediationsjournal.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Bratich, [http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/digital-touch-craft-work-immaterial-labour-and-ontological-accumulation The digital touch: Craft-work as immaterial labour and ontological accumulation.] Ephemera: theory and politics in organization. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that the ubiquitous sharing enabled by the [[Information Age|digital age]] has made it harder for artists and creators to claim authorship of their works, creating an inevitable situation of immaterial labor in the participation in many online platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Gill, and Andy Pratt. 2008. "In the Social Factory? : Immaterial Labour, Precariousness and Cultural Work". Theory, Culture &amp; Society. 25 (7-8): 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immeasurability===
As one cannot weigh or measure in any other way the effect of prayer, a smile, praise, compliment or pat on the shoulder - nor disdain - we are prone to discard any such effect.

Similarly (although teachers receive payment) education. (As one Harvard man once said: "If you think education is expensive - then try ignorance") Although affect may be immediate; effect could remain immeasurable.

Sharing a loaf of bread reduces the amount available for each; sharing knowledge only increases it.

==Criticism==

===Material vs. immaterial labor debate===
The [[materialism|material]] effects of what immaterial labor claims are [[cognitive]] and [[affective]] activities, has been consistently used to discredit the idea of immaterial labor.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Networks and the Materiality of Immaterial Labor" p. 50-121 in: Wilkie, Robert. 2011. The digital condition: class and culture in the information network. New York: Fordham University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the term have argued that, although labor might produce affective and cognitive commodities that can be defined as immaterial labors, it nonetheless is always embodied, maintaining correlates in the physical, material world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2013/11/29/femininity-as-technology/ "Femininity as Technology."] The Society Pages, Cyborgology. November 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomist feminists have also taken issue with the use of the word "immaterial" to describe affective and [[care work]], which necessarily maintains an [[Affective labor|affective]] and embodied component.&lt;ref&gt;Lanoix, Monique. 2013. "Labor as Embodied Practice: The Lessons of Care Work". Hypatia. 28 (1): 85-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Inner Temple Library''' is a private [[law library]] in [[London]], England, serving [[barrister]]s, judges, and students on the [[Bar Professional Training Course]]. Its parent body is the [[Honourable Society of the Inner Temple]], one of the four [[Inns of Court]].

Its law collections cover the legal systems of the [[British Isles]] ([[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]]) and also [[Commonwealth countries]]. There are, in addition, extensive non-law collections covering such subjects as history, [[topography]], biography and [[heraldry]], and an important collection of legal and historical manuscripts.

==History==
{{See also|Inner Temple#Library|l1=Inner Temple}}

The Library is first mentioned in 1440,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqwOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA234 ''Inner Temple Papers''], p. 234, [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 1948, MacKinnon, Sir Frank Douglas, accessed 25 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; then in the Inn’s records in 1506.  The Library refused to accept [[John Selden]]'s manuscripts in 1654, most likely because the size of the collection would have necessitated a new building, but it has been described as "the greatest loss which the Library of the Inner Temple ever sustained".&lt;ref name="lhist1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innertemplelibrary.org.uk/library-history/library-history-17th-century.htm|title=Library History|publisher=[[Inner Temple]]|accessdate=25 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102205400/http://www.innertemplelibrary.org.uk/library-history/library-history-17th-century.htm|archivedate=2 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1707 the Inner Temple was offered the Petyt Manuscripts ([[William Petyt]] had been [[Keeper of the Records in the Tower]], and a well-known writer of constitutional law)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9M4LAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227 |title=Great Britain Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, '&amp;#39;Report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, Volume 11, Part 7, The Manuscripts of the Duke of Leeds, the Bridgewater Trust, Reading Corporation, the Inner Temple, &amp;c, James Joel Cartwright'&amp;#39;, H.M.

A Librarian was appointed immediately, and the practice continues to this day.&lt;ref name="lhist2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innertemplelibrary.org.uk/library-history/library-history-18th-century.htm|title=Library History – 18th century|publisher=Inner Temple|accessdate=4 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001219142300/http://www.innertemplelibrary.org.uk/library-history/library-history-18th-century.htm|archivedate=19 December 2000|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Development Law Organization''' ('''IDLO''') is an [[intergovernmental organization]] dedicated to the promotion of the [[rule of law]].

With a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development, it works to empower people and communities to claim their rights, and provides governments with the know-how to realize them.&lt;ref name="IDLO - What we Do"&gt;{{cite web|title=IDLO - What We Do|url=http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do|website=idlo.int|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports emerging economies and middle-income countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/strategic-plan IDLO Strategic Plan]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in dozens of countries around the world.&lt;ref name="mission-and-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/mission-and-history|title=IDLO Mission and History|website=idlo.int}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

IDLO is headquartered in [[Rome]], Italy and has a branch office in The Hague and is one of a number of entities that are [[United Nations General Assembly observers]].

The only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law, IDLO has operated in dozens of [[sovereign state]]s, focusing on institution-building and legal empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idlo.int/about-idlo About IDLO]&lt;/ref&gt; Its alumni network includes more than 20,000 legal professionals in 175 countries and 46 independent alumni associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Villarino|first1=Eliza|title=Top global development groups in Rome: A primer|url=https://www.devex.com/news/top-global-development-groups-in-rome-a-primer-77004|website=Devex|accessdate=2 February 2015|date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
IDLO has signed [[MoU]]s with [[United Nations]] agencies, governments, universities, and other entities. Major financial contributions to IDLO have come from the [[Australian Agency for International Development]], [[Gates Foundation]], [[Center for International Forestry Research]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[European Union]], [[Ford Foundation]], [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]], [[Institute of Medicine]], [[Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development]], [[OPEC Fund for International Development]], [[United Nations Development Programme]], and [[UNICEF]] as well as numerous countries, namely Canada, China, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, [[Netherlands]], Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States.

[[Irene Khan]] is the Director-General of IDLO.

==History==
IDLO began in 1983 as a non-governmental organization (then called IDLI) founded by three young lawyers: L. Michael Hager (USA), William T. Loris (USA) and Gilles Blanchi (France). They were soon joined by an administration manager, Pasquale Ferraro (Italy). The Governments of the United States and Italy provided the start-up seed money. The Institute changed to an intergovernmental organization in 1988 and was renamed the International Development Law Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usunrome.usmission.gov/resources/un-partner/idlo.html|title=Resources – UN Partner Organizations – IDLO|publisher=United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215205211/http://usunrome.usmission.gov/resources/un-partner/idlo.html|archive-date=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2017|reason=No France, no renamed to IDLO}} In 2001 IDLO was granted Permanent Observer Status at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=ourhistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/mission-and-history/our-history|title=About IDLO – Our History|website=idlo.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, IDLO opened a branch office in The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idlo.int/about-idlo/mission-and-history/our-history|title=Our History {{!}} IDLO|website=www.idlo.int|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Internationale juridische organisatie IDLO naar Den|url=http://denhaagfm.nl/2013/11/04/internationale-juridische-organisatie-idlo-naar-den-haag/|website=denhaagfm.nl|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

IDLO has worked in dozens of countries around the world,&lt;ref name="mission-and-history"/&gt; working with the belief that justice means ensuring fair outcomes in concrete, local terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Irene Khan|title=Of Law and Chickens|url=https://agenda.weforum.org/2012/12/of-law-and-chickens/|publisher=World Economic Forum|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somalia===
IDLO has been working in [[Somalia]] for the last thirty years, providing training to Somali legal professionals and technical assistance to the judiciary. Somali Prime Minister, Dr. [[Abdiweli Mohamed Ali]] has called IDLO "a premiere institution that is supporting Somalia on its journey to peace and stability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Somali PM visits IDLO to discuss constitution|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somali-pm-visits-idlo-discuss-constitution|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=Relief Web|publisher=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)|date=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, IDLO has worked on supporting the development of a Somali constitution and in the integration of customary justice. In 2011 IDLO created an assessment of traditional and customary justice, arguing that linking customary and traditional justice in a bottom up approach would be most effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joesph|first1=Nicholas|title=Serving the Justice Needs of the People: Adopting an Access to Justice Approach in Somalia’s Rule of Law Reform|journal=The World Bank Legal Review|date=November 2013|volume= 5: Fostering Development Through Opportunity, Inclusion, and Equity|pages=263–275|publisher=The World Bank|isbn=978-1-4648-0037-5|doi=10.1596/978-1-4648-0037-5_ch13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financed by the Italian government, IDLO worked with local experts on the country's provisional [[Constitution]], holding consultative sessions with [[Mogadishu]] residents, refugees, and the Somali diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: IDLO in Somalia - Still There, and Together Moving Forward|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201301161402.html|accessdate=6 February 2015|work=AllAfrica|publisher=International Development Law Organization|date=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the adoption of the Constitution, IDLO helped produce a comparative analysis of the new draft Constitution, the Constitution of 1960 and the Transitional Federal Charter of 2004 and supported the Constitutional Affairs and Reconciliation Ministry in hosting a conference on fundamental rights and transitional justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=19 April 2013 |title=2012 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - Somalia |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/517e6dd61c.html |publisher=US Department of State |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the adoption of the constitution by the National Constitution Assembly on 1 August 2012 IDLO drafted a report on providing analysis and suggestions for Justice and Security development under the new constitutional order. The report provides a description of steps to be taken during the implementation phase of the constitution, including the establishment of institutions, development and revision of legislative frameworks, and capacity building. It also sketches out dispute resolution mechanisms of the three legal systems in Somalia: [[xeer]], [[Shari’ah]], and the statutory judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Supporting the Peaceful Implementation of the New Constitution in Somalia: A Preliminary Report |publisher=International Development Law Organization |date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the draft constitution to those from 53 of the 56 member states of the [[Organization of the Islamic Cooperation]], as well as the constitutions of Italy and the United States of America, IDLO found that it contained 36 of the 45 fundamental rights - placing it in the top five of the countries surveyed. The organization also stated that the Somali draft constitution contained 15 more than the [[Constitution of the United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Abdi Guled|author2=Jason Straziuso|title=Somalia constitution allows abortion to save mom, and|url=http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/somalia-constitution-allows-abortion-save-mom|agency=Associated Press|date=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
IDLO has been active in [[Afghanistan]] since 2002, stating their intent has been to restore rule of law in the country and develop a new idea of justice, while respecting the principles of Islam.&lt;ref name="L'Occidentale"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Leonardo Guzzo|title=Ecco come le ONG vogliono rafforzare il sistema giudiziario in Afghanistan|url=http://www.loccidentale.it/node/88656|work=L'Occidentale|date=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily Afghan staff have been used to train legal professionals in the country.

Following a survey taken by the IDLO in 2013 which found that women made up just over 8 percent of the country’s judges, 6 percent of prosecutors and less than one fifth of lawyers, IDLO’s Director General Irene Khan called for greater participation of women in the Afghanistan’s justice sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Maria Caspani|title=Afghan women need more female judges and prosecutors to get justice - report|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20140319112526-w75mh/|accessdate=8 February 2015|agency=Reuters|publisher=Thompson Reuters Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women’s Rights====

Whilst the [[Constitution of Afghanistan]] offers protection to women, domestic and sexual violence are common and considered a family matter, dealt through informal justice systems composed of male elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | authors= Erica Gaston and Tim Luccaro |title=Women's Access to Justice in Afghanistan | url=http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/PW98_Women's-Access-to-Justice-in-Afghanistan.pdf|publisher=United States Institute of Peace |date=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, IDLO launched Afghanistan’s first Violence against Women Unit, with support from the office of the Attorney General of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="L'Occidentale"/&gt;  IDLO reports that in 2010 the unit handled more than 300 cases.&lt;ref name=ourhistory/&gt;

In December 2010 The U.S. Department of State's [[Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] (INL) contributed $12.1 million to expand and improve legal aid services to the poor and disempowered, increase public awareness of legal issues, rights and services, and improve the investigation and prosecution of crimes against women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The U.S. Contributes $12.1 Million to IDLO to Improve Legal Services in Afghanistan|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/12/153390.htm|website=US Department of State|accessdate=8 February 2015|date=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 April 2013 INL announced it would provide IDLO a further $59 million for programmes in Afghanistan: $47 million to fund IDLO implement training programmes for the Afghan justice sector – the Justice Training Transition Program (JTTP) – and another $12 million for a separate IDLO program to provide support and training for prosecution of crimes against women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/article/2013/04/20130412145712.html Department of State Press Release U.S. Supports Justice Reform in Afghanistan, South Sudan, Phillip Kurata, US Department of State, 12 April 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allegations of Lack of Oversight====
In January 2014 the [[Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction]] (SIGAR) released a report highlighting it believed there to be a lack of oversight requirements in INL’s 2013 contract with IDLO in relation to JTTP . SIGAR had previously warned of a lack of monitoring in an ‘alert-letter’ to the State Department sent to the State Department on July 22, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Kellan Howel|title=Oversight lacking for Afghan training funds|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/24/oversight-lacking-afghan-training-funds/|work=Washington Times|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also accused IDLO of refusing to provide SIGAR with information regarding its budget, organizational structure and financial relationship with the US government.

In response to SIGAR’s 2013 statement, State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said that there were no allegations or evidence of fraud, waste or mismanagement in the program and that oversight was provided through daily contact on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State Department spent $50 mln on virtually invisible project in Afghanistan|url=http://rt.com/usa/state-department-project-afghanistan-647/|work=RT|date=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter responding to SIGAR’s claims, INL highlighted mechanisms of accountability and stated their confidence in the IDLO program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/p/sca/rls/214289.htm Letter Regarding the SIGAR Inspection of INL Justice Training Transition Program, US Department of State September 11, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement posted on their website IDLO called their monitoring and evaluation mechanisms ‘robust and extensive’.  IDLO also refuted SIGAR’s statement that it had refused to provide information writing that they had met with SIGAR staff in April and May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/news/highlights/sigars-letter-secretary-john-kerry-incorrect IDLO - SIGAR's Letter to Secretary John Kerry incorrect]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Sudan===
IDLO provided the newly established country of [[South Sudan]] with technical legal assistance; training the judiciary in both the fundamentals of common law and, during the process of transition away from a Shari’ah based legal system, in ‘legal’ English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/news/highlights/south-sudan-law-fragile-state South Sudan: Law in a Fragile State - IDLO]&lt;/ref&gt;

With funding from the [[European Union]] in 2014, IDLO scaled up their work in South Sudan, delivering a series of context-specific training courses to 150 newly appointed judges and judicial support staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/news/highlights/strengthening-justice-institutions-south-sudan Strengthening Justice Institutions in South Sudan]&lt;/ref&gt;

IDLO also stated it was providing technical assistance in drafting a permanent Constitution for South Sudan.

===Kenya===
Working with constitutional scholars Zachary Elkins and Tom Ginsberg, IDLO sponsored a group of constitutional scholars from universities in America to review drafts of the Kenyan constitution and provide feedback to the Kenyan Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government Professor Advises Drafters of Proposed Kenyan Constitution|url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2010/08/02/elkins_kenya_constitution/|website=University of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[USAID]] partnered with IDLO to assist the Government of Kenya develop the comprehensive laws and policies required under the new Constitution, assisting the Kenyan Parliament in reviewing, analysing and passing 55 laws, including 16 required by the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/kenya/fact-sheets/supporting-kenya-constitutional-implementation-process USAID Factsheet: Supporting the Kenya Constitutional Implementation Process]&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators in the project used data and analyzed from over 3000 constitutions in the world to share with Kenya’s Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution (CIC) an analysis of the constitutional implementation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cickenya.org/index.php/newsroom/item/149-cic-meets-international-constitution-experts-on-safeguarding-the-implementation-process CIC meets international constitution experts on safeguarding the implementation process]&lt;/ref&gt; IDLO also implemented projects to strengthen the capacity of the judiciary and engage the public in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Securing Kenya's Constitutional Development|website=IDLO}}&lt;/ref&gt; IDLO has also stated that they are working with the government of Kenya to advance gender equality across the country and enact gender provisions contained in the Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Reforms in Kenya's Public Service|url=http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do/initiatives/gender-reforms-kenyas-public-service|website=IDLO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent report found that its work in Kenya had provided support and services were delivered to fulfil identified needs COE and ensured the delivery trainings to educate Kenyans on the proposed Constitution before it was put to a national referendum. Despite some challenges, the report notes, IDLO consultants produced and delivered high quality technical reports and services which eventually contributed to the final version of the Constitution of Kenya{{Cite report |author=Rolene Guilland |date=17 November 2009 |title= Supporting the Committee of Experts on cCnstitutional Review |url=http://www.idlo.org/DOCCalendar/KENYA_FULL%20REPORT_%20Evaluation%20of%20IDLO's%20Technical%20Assistance%20to%20%20Kenya%20Constitutional%20Review%20Process%202010.pdf |accessdate=25 January 2011}}.

A permanent IDLO regional office was set up in Kenya in 2011.

===Women and Girls===

In a speech at the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in Geneva, Director-General Irene Khan highlighted the importance of law in empowering women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A core principle of the rule of law is that we are all equal - equally protected by the law and equally accountable to it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/sites/default/files/Irene%20Khan%20at%20The%20Graduate%20Institute%20Geneva%20-%2015%20September%202014_1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The organization’s website states that across all of its programs, IDLO works to empower women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idlo.int/what-we-do/women-and-girls IDLO - Women and Girls]&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2013 IDLO released a report on women’s access to justice, with a focus on improving customary justice for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why we need to make customary laws work for women|author1=Mark Tran|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/feb/06/make-customary-laws-work-for-women|work=The Guardian|date=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Director General of IDLO Irene Khan was hired by IDLO after having been forced out of the position of Secretary-General at Amnesty International. As Khan refused to leave the position amicably after having received notification from Amnesty International's Board of Directors known as the International Executive Committee (IEC), the IEC was forced to pay Khan to remove her from office. The amount of payment was £533,103 (which was US$879,619.95 at the then prevailing exchange rate). IEC Chairman Peter Pack stated that paying off Khan was "the least worst option" available to IEC to get her to leave.[43] The amount of the payout was quadruple Khan's annual salary of £132,490 ($218,608.5). The amount paid out to Khan and her deputy (who was also removed by IEC) amounted to 4% of Amnesty International's budget that year.[44] Amnesty International, in part, receives its funding from "money-raising campaigns among young people and in schools".[45] Internal disclosure of this amount caused "anger and puzzlement" among Amnesty International staff. The public disclosure of the amount of payoff made to Khan caused a popular outcry,[45] with a number of individual donors canceling their donations to Amnesty International. The organization was hurt by this scandal and by choosing to pay Khan to leave, with Chairman Pack promising to make amends and move the organization forward following Khan's departure.[43] Naftali Balanson of NGO-Monitor said that the highly usually large payouts caused Amnesty "great damage".[46] An independent and confidential report by Dame Anne Owers criticized both the settlements reached with Kahn and her deputy and Amnesty International's management, with Owers finding that the amounts paid were higher than what had been reported by Amnesty, and that Amnesty paid Kahn's legal fees. Owers called the payouts "seriously excessive" and "wholly inappropriate" stating that only half of the amount could be explained as a contractual obligation.[47] Tory MP Philip Davis called the payout "ludicrous," stating the following: "I am sure people making donations to Amnesty, in the belief they are alleviating poverty, never dreamed they are subsidizing a fat cat payout".[48] An anonymous Amnesty donor interviewed by the British daily Express had the following to say on the subject: "I won't be giving any more money. How can this woman lecture the world about abuses and then walk off with this staggering amount of cash?".[48] Seeking to save the organization's donor base IEC Chairman rushed to assure the donor that there would be no repetition of the Kahn payout stating the following: "the new secretary general, with the full support of the IEC, has initiated a process to review our employment policies and procedures to ensure that such a situation does not happen again," adding that Amnesty was "fully committed to applying all the resources that we receive from our millions of supporters to the fight for human rights".{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In 2003, Irene Khan wrote a piece titled Security for Whom? in which she, inter alia, accused the occupying force in Afghanistan (US and its allies) of "mass killings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/aboutUs/articlesAndTranscripts/101203_Irene_Khan.pdf |title=Security for Whom? |website=London School of Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Irene Khan penned the introduction to that year's Amnesty International report in which she, inter alia, referred to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay as "the gulag of our time," accusing the United States of "thumb[ing] its nose at the rule of law and human rights [as] it grants a licence to others to commit abuse with impunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 May 2005 |title=Guantánamo is gulag of our time, says Amnesty |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/26/usa.guantanamo |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much backlash followed in the media. [[Michael Totten]] of ''World Affairs'' called her a "hysterical heavy-breather".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Totten |author-link=Michael Totten |date=24 May 2005 |title=The Gulag of Our Times |url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/michael-j-totten/gulag-our-times |journal=World Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial opinion in the ''Washington Post'' referred to it as "[i]t is ALWAYS SAD when a solid, trustworthy institution loses its bearings and joins in the partisan fracas that nowadays passes for political discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='American Gulag' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/25/AR2005052501838.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |type=Editorial |date=26 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Podhoretz]] of the ''New York Post'' said that "[t]he case of Amnesty International proves that well-meaning people can make morality their life's work and still be little more than moral idiots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Podhoretz |author-link=John Podhoretz |date=27 May 2005 |title=Amnesty's Idiocy – Absurd Talk on Detainees |url=https://nypost.com/2005/05/27/amnestys-idiocy-absurd-talk-on-detainees/ |newspaper=New York Post |type=Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''The United Nations, Peace and Security'', Ramesh Thakur called Khan's likening of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to a gulag a "hyperbole" that is "wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ramesh Thakur |date=2006 |title=The United Nations, Peace and Security: From Collective Security to the Responsibility to Protect |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CAoAordhNBUC&amp;pg=PA107 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=107– |isbn=978-1-139-45694-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentary on Europe's Ariel Cohen said that Khan's statement was a product of being "blinded by a hatred of U.S. policies," "deception or deep[] ignoran[ce]," stating to that statement Khan, reportedly, added "[i]ronic that this should happen as we mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2005/06/gitmo-is-no-gulag |title=Gitmo is No Gulag |author=Ariel Cohen |author-link=Ariel Cohen |date=16 June 2005 |website=The Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen stated that he is "incensed at Amnesty's gall in trivializing [the suffering of prisoners in Soviet gulags that included his grandfather] for political purposes. A former Soviet prisoner of conscience, [[Pavel Litvinov]], told the Amnesty International staffer, who called him to inquire on behalf of Khan whether it would be appropriate to use the word 'gulag' in an Amnesty report and in relation in the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, that there was "an enormous difference" between the gulags and the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pavel Litvinov |author-link=Pavel Litvinov |date=25 June 2005 |title=Amnesty's gulag idiocy |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/amnestys-gulag-idiocy/2005/06/26/1119724522654.html |newspaper=The Age |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Kimball]] of Arma Virumque called it "a preposterous remark".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Roger Kimball |author-link=Roger Kimball |date=7 June 2005 |title=’The gulag of our times’? |url=http://www.newcriterion.com/posts.cfm/gulag-of-our-times-3959 |newspaper=The New Criterion}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the editor of ''The New York Times'', Margers Pinnis demanded that Khan issue "an apology to the peoples of all nations who suffered under the inhuman conditions of the Soviet Union's notorious prison system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Margers Pinnis |date=31 May 2005 |title=The Real Gulag |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E4DC1F39F932A05756C0A9639C8B63 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bush Administration responded to it in the following manner: President Bush called it "an absurd allegation;" Vice President Cheney said he was "offended by it;" Defense Secretary Rumsfeld called it "reprehensible" and "those who make such outlandish charges los[ing] any claim to objectivity or seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rumsfeld rejects Amnesty's 'gulag' label |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/US/06/01/us.gitmo/index.html?iref=newssearch |work=CNN |date=1 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Myers called it "absolutely irresponsible"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 June 2005 |title=An American Gulag? |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/an-american-gulag/ |work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White House spokesman Scott McClellan called the characterization "ridiculous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 May 2005 |title=Guantánamo denounced as a "gulag" |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/guantnamo-denounced-as-a-gulag/ |newspaper=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Applebaum]], the author of ''Gulag: A History'', found this characterization "infuriating," stating that "Amnesty misus[ed] language [and] discard[ed] its former neutrality" and that it "attack[ed] the American government for the satisfaction of [the Amnesty's] own political faction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Anne Applebaum |author-link=Anne Applebaum |date=8 June 2005 |title=Amnesty's Amnesia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/07/AR2005060701497.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |type=Op-Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everyone rallied against Khan's 'gulag' characterization. Retired US State Department officer Edmund McWilliams who monitored prisoner abuse committed in the Soviet Union and Vietnam stated the following in support of Khan's characterization: "I note that abuses that I reported on in those inhumane systems parallel abuses reported in Guantanamo, at the Bagram air base in Afghanistan and at the Abu Ghriab prison: prisoners suspended from the ceiling and beaten to death; widespread "waterboarding;" prisoners "disappeared" to preclude monitoring by the International Committee of the Red Cross—and all with almost no senior-level accountability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 June 2005 |title=A U.S. Gulag by Any Name |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060101674.html |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having received virtually no support for her characterization of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility Khan did not retract it and continued insisting on its propriety and correctness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=22 March 2007 |title=Many rights, some wrong |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8888792 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The workplace information aggregator Glassdoor lists 16 reviews of IDLO made by current and former employees.[49] All but 2 of them are negative, with titles such as "Terrible Working Experience" and "Stay Far Away from This Organization" interspersed with ones of less intense disapproval. The vast majority of the disapproval notes poor management, with the current Director General's approval rating being at 21%, according to Glassdoor. Some of the most intense criticism of IDLO includes but is not limited to the following: (1) "poor direction and management;" (2) "staff hiring process completely opaque and steeped in nepotism;" (3) "well-known and well-documented cases of mobbing and victimization yet nothing is done;" (4) "poor management of program finance [sic]" and "inefficient use of [...] funds;" (5) "promotion and salary negotiation lacks any kind of established procedure;" (6) "most staff are unhappy and there is always a high turnover;" (7) "there are no internal staff regulations and no proper HR;" (8) "no transparency;" (9) "low staff moral [sic] (should be 'morale'); (10) "top management creates a climate of fear and nepotism which is the "rule of laW;" and (11) "top management competence level is that low that it is questionable if they are able to rescue and turn this important organization in the right direction."{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The US government's Office of Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) investigated IDLO's program in Afghanistan titled 'Justice Training Transition Program' (JTTP) funded with $47.8 million of US taxpayer's money. The investigation was conducted by SIGAR at the request of Senator Claire McCaskill who has maintained a long-standing position that she "ha[s] serious concerns about the effectiveness of the [Justice Sector Support Program] (that was transitioned to IDLO under the name 'JTTP' but without any changes in substance)".[50] JTTP was funded by the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) of the United States Department of State. It was and remains to-day the State Department's largest justice program in the world. On July 22, 2013, SIGAR issued an alert letter to Secretary of State John Kerry alerting Secretary Kerry to the following: (1) JTTP was granted to IDLO as a sole source award (absent any competitive process); (2) there were very few oversight provisions in the State Department's contract with IDLO; (3) State Department told SIGAR that "they d[id] not have the authority to demand basic organizational and project information from IDLO because it is an international organization;" (4) State Department violated its own contracting policy when it issued the JTTP contract to IDLO; (5) SIGAR found that "IDLO is ill-prepared to manage and account for how U.S.-taxpayer funds will be spent on the JTTP; (6) in the years leading up to JTTP IDLO's funding had decreased; (7) IDLO lacks proper international financial certifications; and (8) IDLO refused to fully comply with SIGAR's repeated requests for information. SIGAR concluded that "it was ill-considered for [the State Department] to have awarded almost $50 million to an organization that may not have the ability to account for the use of those funds, under an agreement in which [the State Department] failed to require proper provisions for oversight".[51] SIGAR stated that in light of IDLO's refusal to provide information "it may [...] be necessary to subpoena IDLO to compel the production of any and all records IDLO possesses related to its operations in Afghanistan".[51] IDLO responded by calling the SIGAR assessment contained in the alert letter of July 22, 2013 "incorrect".[52] State Department sought to defend its position by justifying his sole-source award to IDLO by stating that "they are the best positioned to do this work, period, as they are the only not-for-profit intergovermental organization that is exclusively dedicated to working with governments to promote the rule of law",[53] without elaborating on this assertion in any manner that could reasonably allay SIGAR's substantive and detailed concerns. In January 2014, SIGAR issued a full report entitled 'Support for Afghanistan's Justice Sector: State Department Programs Need Better Management and Stronger Oversight'.[54] In that report SIGAR found the following in relation to IDLO: (1) JTTP was transferred to IDLO despite the management and financial challenges IDLO was facing at the time; (2) IDLO's high leadership turnover and budgetary shortfalls, by IDLO's own admission, raised serious questions about the future sustainability of the organization; (3) State Department has limited authority to oversee IDLO's work; and (4) State failed to secure contractual provisions to oversee IDLO. Despite this report JTTP was allowed to proceed without changes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

SIGAR launched a fresh investigation into IDLO in December, 2015.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In 2016, the US Department of Justice launched an investigation of certain individuals associated with IDLO's Justice Training Transition Program.

Describing the early days of IDLO in Afghanistan, some have summed up its key achievements as follows: (1) "rent[ing]" one of the largest NGO offices in Kabul;" and (2) "creati[ng] a digital compilation of Afghan laws that it declined to share" (Deena Hurwitz et al, Human Rights Stories). A former Interior Minister of Afghanistan describes Italy's efforts, that were largely conducted through IDLO, in the following manner: "Italian-sponsored justice sector reform suffers from a very low level of human resources and infrastructure capacity" (''id'').

'''LGBT parenting''' refers to [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people raising one or more children as [[parent]]s or [[foster care]] parents. This includes: children raised by [[same-sex couple]]s ('''same-sex parenting'''), children raised by single LGBT parents, and children raised by an opposite-sex couple where at least one partner is LGBT.

LGBT people can become parents through various means including current or former relationships, [[coparenting]], [[LGBT adoption|adoption]], [[donor insemination]], [[reciprocal IVF]], and [[Surrogate pregnancy|surrogacy]].

Scientific research indicates that the children of same-sex couples fare just as well or even better than the children of opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref name="Pediatrics.aappublications.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/1/349.full|title=The Effects of Marriage, Civil Union, and Domestic Partnership Laws on the Health and Well-being of Children|publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]]|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ama-assn.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page|title=AMA Policy Regarding Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Medical Association]]|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2005_SameSexMarriage.pdf|title=Position Statement on Support of Legal Recognition of Same-Sex Civil Marriage|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/Statement-on-Marriage-and-the-family.cfm?renderforprint=1|title=Statement on Marriage and the Family|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|date=|accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2002_Adoption.pdf|title=Position Statement on Adoption and Co-parenting of Children by Same-sex Couples |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|year=2002|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="San Diego Gay and Lesbian News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdgln.com/news/2010/08/11/apa-reaffirms-support-same-sex-marriage|title=The APA reaffirms support for same-sex marriage|publisher=[[San Diego Gay and Lesbian News]]|date=|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aannet.org/assets/docs/marriage%20equality_7-26%2012f.pdf|title=Support for Marriage Equality|publisher=[[American Academy of Nursing]]|date=July 2012|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cpa2006&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20(1).pdf|title=Marriage of Same-Sex Couples – 2006 Position Statement Canadian Psychological Association|year=2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419195945/http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20%281%29.pdf|archivedate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apsp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/LGBT-Families-Lit-Review.pdf |title=Elizabeth Short, Damien W.

Some children do not know they have an LGBT parent; [[coming out]] issues vary and some parents may never reveal to their children that they identify as LGBT. Accordingly, how children respond to their LGBT parent(s) coming out has little to do with their sexual orientation or gender identification of choice, but rather with how either parent responds to acts of coming out; i.e. whether there is dissolution of parental partnerships or rather if parents maintain a healthy, open, and communicative relationship after coming out or during transition in the case of trans parents.&lt;ref name="Dunne EJ 1987 213–22"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dunne EJ |title=Helping gay fathers come out to their children |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=14 |issue=1–2 |pages=213–22 |year=1987 |pmid=3655343 |doi=10.1300/J082v14n01_16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haworthpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?sid=3Q4EE45JK40W8L1DN0HJVF3U8WFT5DSC&amp;ID=55278|title=A Family Matter: When a Spouse Comes Out as Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual |publisher=Haworth Press |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faccio, Elena 2013"&gt;Faccio, Elena, Bordin, Elena, &amp; Cipolletta, Sabina (2013).

Many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people are parents. In the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. Census]], for example, 33 percent of female same-sex couple households and 22 percent of male same-sex couple households reported at least one child under the age of 18 living in the home.&lt;ref name=apa&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/parents.html APA Policy Statement on Sexual Orientation, Parents &amp; Children], [[American Psychological Association]], July 28 &amp; 30, 2004.

=== Adoption ===
{{Main|LGBT adoption}}
Joint adoption by same-sex couples is legal in 27 countries and in some sub-national territories. Furthermore, 5 countries have legalized some form of step-child adoption.

==== Judgements ====

In January 2008, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that an otherwise legally qualified and suitable candidate must not be excluded from  [[LGBT adoption|adopting]] based on her sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-84571 Judgment in the case of E.B. v. France]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a Florida court declared that "reports and studies find that there are no differences in the parenting of homosexuals or the adjustment of their children", therefore the ''Court is satisfied that the issue is so far beyond dispute that it would be irrational to hold otherwise''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3dca.flcourts.org/Opinions/3D08-3044.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010214522/http://www.3dca.flcourts.org/opinions/3D08-3044.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surrogacy ===
{{Main|Surrogacy}}
Some gay couples decide to have a surrogate pregnancy. A surrogate is a woman carrying an egg fertilised by sperm of one of the men. Some women become surrogates for money, others for humanitarian reasons or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihr.com/infertility/surrogacy/gay-parent-through-surrogacy.html|title=For Gay Men: Becoming a Parent through Surrogacy|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents who use surrogacy services can be stigmatised.&lt;ref&gt;Gahan, Luke (2017) "Separated Same-Sex Parents' Experiences and Views of Services and Service Providers," Journal of Family Strengths: Vol. 17 : Iss. 2 , Article 2.

[[File:Blausen 0058 ArtificialInsemination.png|thumb|Schematic illustration of an AI procedure]]

=== Insemination ===
{{Main|Artificial Insemination}}
Insemination is a method used mostly by lesbian couples. It is when a partner is fertilised with donor sperm injected through a syringe. Some men donate sperm for humanitarian reasons, others for money or both. In some countries the donor can choose to be anonymous (for example in Spain) and in others he cannot have his identity withheld (United Kingdom).

=== Reciprocal IVF ===
{{Main|Reciprocal IVF}}
Reciprocal IVF is used by couples who both possess female reproductive organs. Using in vitro fertilization, eggs are removed from one partner to be used to make embryos that the other partner will hopefully carry in a successful pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Developing methods ===
Currently scientists conduct research on alternative types of human parenthood which can aid same-sex couples to have children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/possibility-of-genetic-children-from-same-sex-couples/17228/|title=Breakthrough raises possibility of genetic children for same-sex couples|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the possibilities is obtaining sperm from skin stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorestemcells.co.uk/stem-cells-same-sex-reproduction.html|title=Stem Cells and Same Sex Reproduction|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
According to US Census Snapshot published in December 2007, same-sex couples with children have significantly fewer economic resources and significantly lower rates of home ownership than heterosexual married couples.&lt;ref name="censussnapshot"/&gt;

According to a 2013-2014 survey conducted in Poland by the Institute of Psychology of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (IP PAN) on 3000 LGBT people in same-sex relationships living in the country, 9% (11.7% of women and 4.6% of men) of coupled LGBT people were parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rodzinyzwyboru.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Raport_Rodziny-z-wyboru-w-Polsce.-%C5%BBycie-rodzinne-os%C3%B3b-nieheteroseksualnych.pdf |work=rodzinyzwyboru.pl | author = Joanna Mizielińska, Marta Abramowicz, Agata Stasińska |title=Rodziny z wyboru w Polsce.

In the United States, studies on the effect of gay and lesbian parenting on children were first conducted in the 1970s, and expanded through the 1980s in the context of increasing numbers of gay and lesbian parents seeking legal custody of their biological children.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;Bridget Fitzgerald, "Children of lesbian and gay parents: A review of the literature," Marriage and Family Review, 1999, Volume 29, Number 1, pages 57–75.&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread pattern of children being raised from infancy in two-parent gay or lesbian homes is relatively recent.{{when|reason=WP:RELTIME|date=September 2018}}

===Methodology===
Studies of LGBT parenting have sometimes suffered from small and/or non-random samples and inability to implement all possible controls, due to the small LGBT parenting population and to cultural and social obstacles to identifying as an LGBT parent.

A 1993 review published in the ''Journal of Divorce &amp; Remarriage'' identified fourteen studies addressing the effects of LGBT parenting on children. The review concluded that all of the studies lacked [[external validity]] and that therefore: "The conclusion that there are no significant differences in children reared by lesbian mothers versus heterosexual mothers is not supported by the published research data base."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Belcastro| year = 1993 | title = A Review of Data Based Studies Addressing the Affects of Homosexual Parenting on Children's Sexual and Social Functioning | doi = 10.1300/J087v20n01_06 | journal = Journal of Divorce &amp; Remarriage | volume = 20 | issue = 1–2| pages = 105–122 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitzgerald's 1999 analysis explained some methodological difficulties:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many of these studies suffer from similar limitations and weaknesses, with the main obstacle being the difficulty in acquiring representative, random samples on a virtually invisible population. Many lesbian and gay parents are not open about their sexual orientation due to real fears of discrimination, homophobia, and threats of losing custody of their children. Those who do participate in this type of research are usually relatively open about their homosexuality and, therefore, may bias the research towards a particular group of gay and lesbian parents.

Because of the inevitable use of convenience samples, sample sizes are usually very small and the majority of the research participants end up looking quite homogeneous—e.g. white, middle-class, urban, and well-educated. Another pattern is the wide discrepancy between the number of studies conducted with children of gay fathers and those with lesbian mothers...

Another potential factor of importance is the possibility of social desirability bias when research subjects respond in ways that present themselves and their families in the most desirable light possible. Such a phenomenon does seem possible due to the desire of this population to offset and reverse negative images and discrimination. Consequently, the findings of these studies may be patterned by self-presentation bias.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a 2001 review of 21 studies by Stacey and Biblarz published in ''[[American Sociological Review]]'': "[R]esearchers lack reliable data on the number and location of lesbigay parents with children in the general population, there are no studies of child development based on random, representative samples of such families. Most studies rely on small-scale, snowball and convenience samples drawn primarily from personal and community networks or agencies. Most research to date has been conducted on white lesbian mothers who are comparatively educated, mature, and reside in relatively progressive urban centers, most often in California or the Northeastern states."&lt;ref name="Stacey_Biblarz"/&gt;

In more recent studies,{{when|reason=WP:RELTIME|date=September 2018}} many of these issues have been resolved due to factors such as the changing social climate for LGBT people.

Herek's 2006 paper in ''American Psychologist'' stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The overall methodological sophistication and quality of studies in this domain have increased over the years, as would be expected for any new area of empirical inquiry. More recent research has reported data from probability and community-based convenience samples, has used more rigorous assessment techniques, and has been published in highly respected and widely cited developmental psychology journals, including ''Child Development and Developmental Psychology''. Data are increasingly available from prospective studies. In addition, whereas early study samples consisted mainly of children originally born into heterosexual relationships that subsequently dissolved when one parent came out as gay or lesbian, recent samples are more likely to include children conceived within a same-sex relationship or adopted in infancy by a same-sex couple. Thus, they are less likely to confound the effects of having a sexual minority parent with the consequences of divorce.&lt;ref name="herek2006"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2002 review of the literature identified 20 studies examining outcomes among children raised by gay or lesbian parents and found that these children did not systematically differ from those raised by heterosexual parents on any of the studied outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderssen|first1=Norman|last2=Amlie|first2=Christine|last3=Ytteroy|first3=Erling Andre|title=Outcomes for children with lesbian or gay parents.

In a 2009 affidavit filed in the case ''[[Gill v. Office of Personnel Management]]'', [[Michael Lamb (psychologist)|Michael Lamb]], a professor of [[psychology]] and head of Department of [[Social psychology|Social]] and [[Developmental psychology|Developmental Psychology]] at [[Cambridge University]], stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The methodologies used in the major studies of same-sex parenting meet the standards for research in the field of developmental psychology and psychology generally. The studies specific to same-sex parenting were published in leading journals in the field of child and adolescent development, such as Child Development, published by the Society for Research in Child Development, [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]], published by the American Psychological Association, and The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, the flagship peer-review journals in the field of child development. Most of the studies appeared in these (or similar) rigorously peer-reviewed and highly selective journals, whose standards represent expert consensus on generally accepted social scientific standards for research on child and adolescent development. Prior to publication in these journals, these studies were required to go through a rigorous peer-review process, and as a result, they constitute the type of research that members of the respective professions consider reliable. The body of research on same-sex families is consistent with standards in the relevant fields and produces reliable conclusions."&lt;ref name="lamb" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gartrell and Bos's 25-year longitudinal study, published 2010, was limited to mothers who sought donor insemination and who may have been more motivated than mothers in other circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Discover magazine "Same-Sex Parents Do No Harm". January 2, 2011 edition, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;  Gartrell and Bos note that the study's limitations included utilizing a non-random sample, and the lesbian group and control group were not matched for race or area of residence. The study was supported by grants from the [[Gill Foundation]], the Lesbian Health Fund of the [[Gay and Lesbian Medical Association]], Horizons Foundation, and the Roy Scrivner Fund of the [[American Psychological Association|American Psychological Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Gartrell /&gt;

Michael J. Rosenfeld, associate professor of sociology at [[Stanford University]], wrote in a 2010 study published in ''Demography'' that "[A] critique of the literature—that the sample sizes of the studies are too small to allow for [[Statistical power|statistically powerful]] tests—continues to be relevant." Rosenfeld's study, "the first to use large-sample nationally representative data," found that children of same-sex couples demonstrated normal outcomes in school. "The core finding here," reports the study," offers a measure of validation for the prior, and much-debated, small-sample studies."&lt;ref name=rosen&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Michael J.

According to a 2005 brief by the American Psychological Association:
{{quote|In summary, research on diversity among families with lesbian and gay parents and on the potential effects of such diversity on children is still sparse (Martin, 1993, 1998; Patterson, 1995b, 2000, 2001, 2004; Perrin, 2002; Stacey &amp; Biblarz, 2001; Tasker, 1999). Data on children of parents who identify as bisexual are still not available, and information about children of non-White lesbian or gay parents is hard to find (but see Wainright et al., 2004, for a racially diverse sample)... However, the existing data are still limited, and any conclusions must be seen as tentative... It should be acknowledged that research on lesbian and gay parents and their children, though no longer new, is still limited in extent. Although studies of gay fathers and their children have been conducted (Patterson, 2004), less is known about children of gay fathers than about children of lesbian mothers. Although studies of adolescent and young adult offspring of lesbian and gay parents are available (e.g., Gershon et al., 1999; Tasker &amp; Golombok, 1997; Wainright et al., 2004), relatively few studies have focused on the offspring of lesbian or gay parents during adolescence or adulthood.&lt;ref name="APAreport"&gt;American Psychological Association [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/parenting-full.pdf Lesbian &amp; Gay Parenting]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2010 American Psychological Association, The California Psychological Association, The American Psychiatric Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy stated:
{{quote|Relatively few studies have directly examined gay fathers, but those that exist find that gay men are similarly fit and able parents, as compared to heterosexual men. Available empirical data do not provide a basis for assuming gay men are unsuited for parenthood. If gay parents were inherently unfit, even small studies with convenience samples would readily detect it.  This has not  been the case.  Being raised by a single father does not appear to inherently disadvantage children's psychological wellbeing more than being raised by a single mother. Homosexuality does not constitute a pathology or deficit, and there is no theoretical reason to expect gay fathers to cause harm to their children. Thus, although more research is needed, available data place the burden of empirical proof on those who argue that having a gay father is harmful.&lt;ref name="amici2010" /&gt;}}

=== Consensus ===
Scientific research that has directly compared outcomes for children with gay and lesbian parents with outcomes for children with heterosexual parents has found that children raised by same-sex couples are as physically or psychologically healthy, capable, and successful as those raised by opposite-sex couples,&lt;ref name="cpa2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="apsp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amici2010"/&gt; despite the reality that considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain significant challenges for these families.&lt;ref name="apsp"/&gt; Major associations of mental health professionals in the U.S., Canada, and Australia, have not identified credible empirical research that suggests otherwise.&lt;ref name="amici2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pediatrics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="herek2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stacey2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cpa2005" /&gt; Sociologist Wendy Manning echoes their conclusion that "[The] studies reveal that children raised in same-sex parent families fare just as well as children raised in different-sex parent families across a wide spectrum of child well-being measures: academic performance, cognitive development, social development, psychological health, early sexual activity, and substance abuse."&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Wendy D., Marshal Neal Fettro, and Esther Lamidi.

&lt;/ref&gt; The range of these studies allows for conclusions to be drawn beyond any narrow spectrum of a child's well being, and the literature further indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union.&lt;ref name="amici2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pediatrics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cpa&gt;Canadian Psychological Association: [http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20%281%29.pdf Marriage of Same-Sex Couples – 2006 Position Statement Canadian Psychological Association]&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that nuclear families with homosexual parents are more egalitarian in their distribution of home and childcare activities, and thus less likely to embrace traditional gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Escobar|first=Samantha|title=Children of Gay Couples Impacted By Parents' Relationship But Not Sexual Orientation: Study|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/27/children-of-gay-couples-_n_3660310.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] reports that there are no differences in the interests and hobbies between children with homosexual versus heterosexual parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay and Lesbian Parents|url=http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/family-dynamics/types-of-families/pages/Gay-and-Lesbian-Parents.aspx?nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3A+No+local+token&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token|publisher=American Academy Of Pediatrics|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, it has become increasingly clear that it is family processes (such as the quality of parenting, the psychosocial well-being of parents, the quality of and satisfaction with relationships within the family, and the level of co-operation and harmony between parents) that contribute to determining children's well-being and outcomes rather than family structures, per se, such as the number, gender, sexuality and cohabitation status of parents.&lt;ref name=apsp/&gt;&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;[[Michael Lamb (psychologist)|Michael Lamb]], [http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf Affidavit – United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225193923/http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf |date=2010-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the 1980s, as a result, it has been well established that children and adolescents can be as well-adjusted in nontraditional settings as in traditional settings.&lt;ref name="lamb" /&gt; Furthermore, whereas factors such as the number and cohabitation status of parents can and do influence relationship quality in aggregate, the same has not been demonstrated for sexuality. According to sociologist [[Judith Stacey]] of [[New York University]], "Rarely is there as much consensus in any area of social science as in the case of gay parenting, which is why the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] and all of the major professional organizations with expertise in child welfare have issued reports and resolutions in support of gay and lesbian parental rights".&lt;ref&gt;cited in Cooper &amp; Cates, 2006, p. 36; citation available on http://www.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/LGBT-Families-Lit-Review.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations include the American Academy of Pediatrics,&lt;ref name="pediatrics"/&gt; the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]],&lt;ref name="aacap"&gt;[http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/children_with_lesbian_gay_bisexual_and_transgender_parents Children with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Parents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615053143/http://aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/children_with_lesbian_gay_bisexual_and_transgender_parents |date=2010-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Psychiatric Association]],&lt;ref name="psych.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090823142855/http://archive.psych.org/edu/other_res/lib_archives/archives/200214.pdf Adoption and Co-parenting of Children by Same-sex Couples] (archived from [http://www.psych.org/Departments/EDU/Library/APAOfficialDocumentsandRelated/PositionStatements/200214.aspx])&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Psychological Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/parenting.aspx Sexual Orientation, Parents, &amp; Children]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamft.org/iMIS15/AAMFT/MFT_Resources/MFT_Resources/Content/Resources/Position_On_Couples.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926173852/http://www.aamft.org/iMIS15/AAMFT/MFT_Resources/MFT_Resources/Content/Resources/Position_On_Couples.aspx|date=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsa.org/About_APsaA/POSITION_STATEMENTS/GAY_AND_LESBIAN_PARENTING.aspx Position Statement on Gay and Lesbian Parenting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928025729/http://www.apsa.org/About_APsaA/POSITION_STATEMENTS/GAY_AND_LESBIAN_PARENTING.aspx |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Association of Social Workers]],&lt;ref name=amici&gt;[http://www.courts.ca.gov/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf Case No. S147999 in the Supreme Court of the State of California, In re Marriage Cases Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 4365, Application for leave to file brief amici curiae in support of the parties challenging the marriage exclusion, and brief amici curiae of the American Psychological Association, California Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, National Association of Social Workers, and National Association of Social Workers, California Chapter in support of the parties challenging the marriage exclusion]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Child Welfare League of America]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cwla.org/programs/culture/glbtqposition.htm Position Statement on Parenting of Children by Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613072557/http://cwla.org/programs/culture/glbtqposition.htm |date=2010-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the North American Council on Adoptable Children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacac.org/policy/positions.html#Gay|title=NACAC - Public Policy|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canadian Psychological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20%281%29.pdf|title=Canadian Psychological Association|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, [[Gregory M. Herek]] stated in ''[[American Psychologist]]'': "If gay, lesbian, or bisexual parents were inherently less capable than otherwise comparable heterosexual parents, their children would evidence problems regardless of the type of sample. This pattern clearly has not been observed. Given the consistent failures in this research literature to disprove the [[null hypothesis]], the burden of empirical proof is on those who argue that the children of sexual minority parents fare worse than the children of heterosexual parents."&lt;ref name="herek2006" /&gt;

Studies and analyses include Bridget Fitzgerald's 1999 analysis of the research on gay and lesbian parenting, published in ''Marriage and Family Review'', which found that the available studies generally concluded that "the sexual orientation of parents is not an effective or important predictor of successful childhood development"&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt; and [[Gregory M. Herek]]'s 2006 analysis in ''[[American Psychologist]]'', which said: "Despite considerable variation in the quality of their samples, research design, measurement methods, and data analysis techniques, the findings to date have been remarkably consistent. Empirical studies comparing children raised by sexual minority parents with those raised by otherwise comparable heterosexual parents have not found reliable disparities in mental health or social adjustment. Differences have not been found in parenting ability between lesbian mothers and heterosexual mothers. Studies examining gay fathers are fewer in number but do not show that gay men are any less fit or able as parents than heterosexual men."&lt;ref name="herek2006" /&gt; Additionally, some fear that children will inherit their parent's gender dysphoria or alternate mental health issues in the case of trans parent, yet there is research that suggests "an absence of evidence that children raised by transgendered parents have a greater chance of experiencing […] development issues than raised by non-transgender parents" and further clinical research shows that "children of gender-variant parents do not develop gender dysphoria or mental diseases" due to their parents' diagnosis with gender identity disorder &lt;ref name="Faccio, Elena 2013"/&gt; A 1996 meta-analysis found "no differences on any measures between the heterosexual and homosexual parents regarding parenting styles, emotional adjustment, and sexual orientation of the child(ren)";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=M|last2=Burrell|first2=N|title=Comparing the impact of homosexual and heterosexual parents on children: meta-analysis of existing research.|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=1996|volume=32|issue=2|pages=19–35|pmid=9010824|doi=10.1300/j082v32n02_02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2008 meta-analysis reached similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crowl|first1=Alicia|last2=Ahn|first2=Soyeon|last3=Baker|first3=Jean|title=A Meta-Analysis of Developmental Outcomes for Children of Same-Sex and Heterosexual Parents|journal=Journal of GLBT Family Studies|date=12 August 2008|volume=4|issue=3|pages=385–407|doi=10.1080/15504280802177615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the results of a 25-year ongoing longitudinal study by [[Nanette Gartrell]] of the [[University of California]] and Henny Bos of the [[University of Amsterdam]] were released. Gartrell and Bos studied 78 children conceived through donor [[insemination]] and raised by lesbian mothers. Mothers were interviewed and given clinical questionnaires during pregnancy and when their children were 2, 5, 10, and 17 years of age. In the abstract of the report, the authors stated: "According to their mothers' reports, the 17-year-old daughters and sons of lesbian mothers were rated significantly higher in social, school/academic, and total competence and significantly lower in social problems, rule-breaking, aggressive, and externalizing problem behavior than their age-matched counterparts in Achenbach's normative sample of American youth."&lt;ref name=Gartrell&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gartrell N, Bos H | year = 2010 | title = US National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study: Psychological Adjustment of 17-Year-Old Adolescents | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/126/1/28.full | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 126 | issue = 1| pages = 28–36 | doi=10.1542/peds.2009-3153| pmid = 20530080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of extensive [[social science]] literature into the question of children's psychological outcomes of being raised by same-sex parents by the [[Australian Institute of Family Studies]] in 2013 concluded that "there is now strong evidence that same-sex parented families constitute supportive environments in which to raise children" and that with regard to lesbian parenting "...clear benefits appear to exist with regard to: the quality of parenting children experience in comparison to their peers parented in heterosexual couple families; children's and young adults' greater tolerance of sexual and gender diversity; and gender flexibility displayed by children, particularly sons."&lt;ref name=AIFS&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dempsey, Deborah (Dr) | year = 2013 | title = Same-sex parented families in Australia | url = http://www.aifs.gov.au/cfca/pubs/papers/a145197/cfca18.pdf | journal = CFCA Paper | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual orientation and gender role ===
A number of studies have examined whether the children of lesbian and gay parents are themselves more likely to identify as lesbian and gay. In a 2001 review of 21 studies, [[Judith Stacey]] and Timothy Biblarz found that researchers frequently downplay findings indicating difference regarding children's gender, sexual preferences and behavior, suggesting that an environment of [[heterosexism]]  has  hampered scientific inquiry in the area. Their findings indicate that the children with lesbian or gay parents appear less traditionally gender-typed and are more likely to be open to homoerotic relationships, which may be partly due to genetic or family socialization processes or "contextual effects," even though children raised by same-sex couples are not more likely to self-identify as bisexual, lesbian, or gay and most of them identify as heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Stacey_Biblarz"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stacey J, Biblarz TJ |year=2001 |title=(How) Does the Sexual Orientation of Parents Matter? |url=http://faculty.law.miami.edu/mcoombs/documents/Stacey_Biblarz.pdf |format=PDF |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=159–183 |quote=If these young adults raised by lesbian mothers were more open to a broad range of sexual possibilities, they were not statistically more likely to self-identify as bisexual, lesbian, or gay.....Children raised by lesbian co-parents should and do seem to grow up more open to homoerotic relationships. This may be partly due to genetic and family socialization processes, but what sociologists refer to as "contextual effects" not yet investigated by psychologists may also be important...even though children of lesbian and gay parents appear to express a significant increase in homoeroticism, the majority of all children nonetheless identify as heterosexual, as most theories across the essentialistt" to "social constructionist" spectrum seem (perhaps too hastily) to expect. |doi=10.2307/2657413 |jstor=2657413 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928195415/http://faculty.law.miami.edu/mcoombs/documents/Stacey_Biblarz.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to US Census, 80% of the children being raised by same-sex couples in US are their biological children.&lt;ref name=ABCNews&gt;{{cite news |title=Census 2010: One-Quarter of Gay Couples Raising Children |first= SUSAN |last=DONALDSON JAMES |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/sex-couples-census-data-trickles-quarter-raising-children/story?id=13850332 |newspaper=ABC News |date=June 23, 2011 |accessdate=July 11, 2013|quote="Still, more than 80 percent of the children being raised by gay couples are not adopted, according to Gates."}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to family socialization processes and "contextual effects," Stacey and Biblarz point out that children with such parents are disproportionately more likely to grow up in relatively more tolerant school, neighborhood, and social contexts, which are less heterosexist.&lt;ref name="Stacey_Biblarz"/&gt;

A 2005 review by [[Charlotte J. Patterson]] for the American Psychological Association found that the available data did not suggest higher rates of homosexuality among the children of lesbian or gay parents.&lt;ref name="APAreport"/&gt; Herek's 2006 review describes the available data on the point as limited.&lt;ref name="herek2006" /&gt; Stacey and Biblarz and Herek stress that the sexual orientation and gender identification of children is of limited relevance to discussions of parental fitness or policies based on the same. In a 2010 review comparing single-father families with other family types, Stacey and Biblarz state, "We know very little yet about how parents influence the development of their children's sexual identities or how these intersect with gender."&lt;ref name="stacey2010"/&gt;

Children of LGBT parents do not have any differences in their gender role behaviors in comparison to those observed in heterosexual family structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|title=Children with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Parents|journal=Facts for Families|date=August 2013|volume=No. 92.|url=http://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/facts_for_families/92_children_with_lesbian_gay_bisexual_transgender_parents.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, a study by Bos and Sandfort (2009) also revealed that children raised by same-sex couples felt less pressured to follow gender stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Children's Gender Identity in Lesbian and Heterosexual Two-Parent Families|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-009-9704-7|journal = Sex Roles|date = 2009-10-15|issn = 0360-0025|pmc = 2807026|pmid = 20098512|pages = 114–126|volume = 62|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1007/s11199-009-9704-7|language = en|first = Henny|last = Bos|first2 = Theo G.

=== Homophobia and transphobia ===

{{quote|Instead of asking whether gay parenting is bad for kids, I think we should ask how contemporary discourses of sexuality maintain the very idea that lesbian and gay families are essentially different and, indeed, deficient.

More work of this sort will help us to ask more complex questions about forms of parenting that continue to offer some novel and challenging approaches to family life.&lt;ref name = "Hicks" /&gt;}}

=== Misrepresentation by opponents ===
In a 2006 statement the Canadian Psychological Association released an updated statement on their 2003 and 2005 conclusions, saying, "The CPA recognizes and appreciates that persons and institutions are entitled to their opinions and positions on this issue. However, CPA is concerned that some persons and institutions are mis-interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values."&lt;ref name="cpa2006"/&gt; Several professional organizations have noted that studies which opponents of LGBT parenting claim as evidence that same-sex couples are unfit parents do not in fact address same-sex parenting, however, and therefore do not permit any conclusions to be drawn about the effects of the sexes or sexual orientations of parents. Rather, these studies, which only sampled heterosexual parents, found that it was better for children to be raised by two parents instead of one, and/or that the divorce or death of a parent had a negative effect on children.&lt;ref name="cpa2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=S14799&gt;[http://www.courts.ca.gov/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf Case No. S147999 in the Supreme Court of the State of California, In re Marriage Cases Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 4365, Application for leave to file brief [[Amicus curiae|amici curiae]] in support of the parties challenging the marriage exclusion, and brief amici curiae of the American Psychological Association, California Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, National Association of Social Workers, and National Association of Social Workers, California Chapter in support of the parties challenging the marriage exclusion].  Date (see page 49): September 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Perry v. Brown]], in which Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] found that the available studies on stepchildren, which opponents of same-sex marriage cited to support their position that it is best for a child to be raised by its biological mother and father, do not isolate "the genetic relationship between a parent and a child as a variable to be tested" and only compare "children raised by married, biological parents with children raised by single parents, unmarried mothers, step families and cohabiting parents," and thus "compare various family structures and do not emphasize biology."&lt;ref name=Perry10&gt;Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, [https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/files/09cv2292-ORDER.pdf Ruling in ''Perry v. Brown''], accessed May 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Perry'' also cited studies showing that "adopted children or children conceived using sperm or egg donors are just as likely to be well-adjusted as children raised by their biological parents."&lt;ref name=Perry10/&gt;

[[Gregory M. Herek]] noted in 2006 that "empirical research can't reconcile disputes about core values, but it is very good at addressing questions of fact. Policy debates will be impoverished if this important source of knowledge is simply dismissed as a 'he said, she said' squabble."&lt;ref name=hereklat&gt;[http://www.beyondhomophobia.com/blog/2006/11/03/la-times-on-lesbiangay-parents-he-saidshe-said/ LA Times on Lesbian/Gay Parents: He Said/She Said?] date:2006/11/03&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other aspects==

===Marriage===
{{Main|Same-sex marriage|Same-sex marriage and the family}}
Same-sex parenting is often raised as an issue in debates about the recognition of same-sex marriage by law.

===Trans parenting===
There is little to no visibility or public support through pregnancy and parenting resources directed towards trans parents.&lt;ref name="Faccio, Elena 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, J. "The Manly Art of Pregnancy," in Bornstein, Kate, and Bergman, S. Bear (2010). Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation. Berkeley: Seal Press&lt;/ref&gt;

While "once gay and lesbian parents attain parenthood status[…] they almost never lose it" this is not the case for trans parents, as seen with the cases of Suzanne Daly (1983) and Martha Boyd (2007), two trans women who both had their parental rights, with regard to biological children, terminated on the basis of their diagnosis of gender identity disorder and their trans status. They were perceived to have abandoned their role as "fathers" through their MTF transition, and were perceived to have acted selfishly in putting their own sexual/identity needs before the wellbeing of their children. These cases are amongst many legal custody battles fought by trans parents whereby U.S. courts have completely overlooked defendants suitability as "parents" as opposed to "mothers" or "fathers," roles that are heavily gendered and come with strict societal understandings of normative parental behaviour.&lt;ref name="Ball, Carlos A. 2012"&gt;Ball, Carlos A. (2012). The Right to Be Parents: LGBT families and the transformation of parenthood. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of trans individuals who desire to become parents and to be legally recognized as mothers or fathers of their children, courts often refuse to legally acknowledge such roles because of biological discrimination. An example of this is the X, Y and Z vs. U.K case, whereby X, a trans man who had been in a stable relationship with Y, a biological woman  who gave birth to Z through artificial insemination through which X was always present, was denied the right to be listed as Z's father on their birth certificate due to the fact that they did not directly inseminate Y.&lt;ref&gt;European Court of Human Rights (1997). Case of X, Y and Z v. The United Kingdom, Judgment, retrieved from: http://www.globalhealthrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ECtHR-1997-X-Y-and-Z-v-United-Kingdom.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,{{when|reason=WP:RELTIME|date=September 2018}} Canada has started acknowledging trans parental rights in terms of custody arrangements and of legal recognition of parental status. In 2001, Leslie (formerly Howard) Forester was permitted to retain custody of her daughter after her ex-partner filed for sole custody on the basis of Leslie's transition. The courts ruled that  "the applicant's transsexuality, in itself, without further evidence, would not constitute a material change in circumstances, nor would it be considered a negative factor in custody determination," marking a landmark case in family law whereby "a person's transsexuality is irrelevant on its own as a factor in his or her ability to be a good parent"&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Anne Marie. "Father's Sex Change Does Not Alter Custody, Court Says: Girl, 6, Calls Mommy and Daddy; Cautious in Public." The National Post, 2 February 2001. Retrieved March 23rd 2014 from: http://search.proquest.com/docview/329903587&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Jay Wallace, a resident trans-man from Toronto, Canada, "was permitted to identify as Stanley's father on the province of Ontario's Statement of Live Birth Form," marking a decoupling of genetics and bio-sex in relation to parental roles.&lt;ref&gt;Karaian, Lara (2013).

A '''lease''' is a [[contract]]ual arrangement calling for the [[wikt:lessee|lessee]] (user) to pay the [[Lessor (leasing)|lessor]] (owner) for use of an asset.&lt;ref&gt;Stickney and Weil 2007 p. 791  (Glossary of Financial Accounting: An Intro. to Concepts, Methods, and Use 12e).&lt;/ref&gt; Property, buildings and vehicles are common assets that are leased. Industrial or business equipment is also leased.

Broadly put, a lease agreement is a contract between two parties, the lessor and the lessee. The lessor is the legal owner of the asset; the lessee obtains the right to use the asset in return for regular rental payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/sg/en/student/acca-qual-student-journey/qual-resource/acca-qualification/f7/technical-articles/accounting-for-leases.html|title=Accounting for leases {{!}} F7 Financial Reporting {{!}} ACCA Qualification {{!}} Students {{!}} ACCA Global|last=http://www.accaglobal.com|first=ACCA -|website=www.accaglobal.com|language=en-SG|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lessee also agrees to abide by various conditions regarding their use of the property or equipment. For example, a person leasing a car may agree that the car will only be used for personal use.

The narrower term '''rental agreement''' can be used to describe a lease in which the asset is [[tangible property]].&lt;ref&gt;34 Am. Jur. 2d Federal Taxation ¶ 16762 Section 467 rental agreements defined: “A rental agreement includes any written or oral agreement that provides for the use of tangible property and is treated as a lease for federal income tax purposes."&lt;/ref&gt;  Language used is that the user ''rents'' the land or goods ''let out'' or ''rented out'' by the owner.  The verb ''to lease'' is less precise because it can refer to either of these actions.&lt;ref&gt;It is possible to rent in such a way many things such as domestic animals, electrical appliances, handbags and jewelry.[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/jan/04/renting-luxury-goods "If you want it, rent it ... from a 'must have' handbag to an Aston Martin"], ''[[The Observer]]'', 2009-01-04. Retrieved on 2009-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of a lease for [[intangible property]] are use of a computer program (similar to a license, but with different provisions), or use of a radio frequency (such as a contract with a cell-phone provider).

The term '''rental agreement''' is also sometimes used to describe a periodic lease agreement (most often a month-to-month lease) internationally and in some [[region]]s of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/before-rent.shtml|title=California Tenants - California Department of Consumer Affairs|last=California|first=Department of Consumer Affairs, State of|website=www.dca.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General terms ==
A lease is a legal [[contract]], and thus enforceable by all parties under the [[contract law]] of the applicable jurisdiction.

In the [[United States]], since it also represents a conveyance of possessory rights to real estate, it is a hybrid sort of contract that involves qualities of a [[deed]].

Some specific kinds of leases may have specific clauses required by statute depending upon the property being leased, and/or the jurisdiction in which the agreement was signed or the residence of the parties.

Common elements of a lease agreement include:
* Names of the parties of the agreement.
* The starting date and duration of the agreement.
* Identifies the specific object (by street address, VIN, or make/model,serial number) being leased.
* Provides conditions for renewal or non-renewal.
* Has a specific consideration (a lump sum, or periodic payments) for granting the use of this object.
* Has provisions for a security deposit and terms for its return.
* May have a specific list of conditions which are therein described as Default Conditions and specific Remedies.
* May have other specific conditions placed upon the parties such as:
** Need to provide insurance for loss.
** Restrictive use.
** Which party is responsible for maintenance.
* Termination clause (describing what will happen if the contract is ended early or cancelled, stating the rights of parties to terminate the lease, and their obligations)

All kinds of personal property (e.g. cars and furniture) or real property (e.g. raw land, apartments, single family homes, and business property (including wholesale and retail)) may be leased.  As a result of the lease, the owner (lessor) grants the use of the stated property to the lessee.

== Leases of land ==
The narrower term 'tenancy' describes a lease in which the [[tangible property]] is land (including at any vertical section such as airspace, [[Storey|storey]] of building or [[mining|mine]]).  A premium is an amount paid by the tenant for the lease to be granted or to secure the former tenant's lease, often in order to secure a low rent, in long leases termed a ''ground rent''.  For parts of buildings it is most common for users to pay also by collateral contract, or by the same contract, a [[service charge]] which is normally an express list of services in a lease to minimize disputes over service charges.  A [[gross lease|gross lease or tenancy]] stipulates a rent that is for the global amount due including all service charges.

A cancelable lease ([[United Kingdom|UK]]: determinable/breakable lease) is a lease that may be terminated (formally ''determined'') solely by the lessee or solely by the lessor without penalty.  A mutually determinable lease can be determined by either.  A non-cancelable lease is a lease that cannot be so terminated.  Commonly, “lease” may imply a non-cancelable lease, whereas “rental agreement” may connote a cancelable lease.

Influenced by [[land registration]], commonly tenancies initially granted for more than a year are referred to more simply as leases.&lt;ref&gt;For land in the UK, a tenancy or lease granted for more than 7 years must be registered at the land registry and a tenancy or lease for more than 3 years must be granted and witnessed by using a [[deed]].  [http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/professional/guides/practice-guide-25 HM Land Registry Practice Guide 25. Retrieved 2012-07-08] and s52(1) ([[Law of Property Act 1925|LPA 1925]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The lease will either provide specific provisions regarding the responsibilities and rights of the lessee and lessor, or there will be automatic provisions as a result of local law.  In general, by paying the negotiated fee to the lessor, the lessee (also called a '''[[leasehold estate|tenant]]''') has possession and use (the '''rental''') of the leased property  to the exclusion of the lessor and all others except with the invitation of the tenant. The most common form of real property lease is a residential rental agreement between landlord and tenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The right to possession by the tenant is sometimes called a '''leasehold interest'''. A lease can be for a fixed period of time (called the '''[[Time|term]]''' of the lease). 
A lease may be terminated sooner than its end date by:
* Break/cancellation (this depends upon the terms of the lease)
* A negotiated deed of [[Surrender (law)|surrender]] or yielding-up.
* [[Forfeiture (law)|Forfeiture]]
* By operation of statute (rare)

A lease should be contrasted with a '''[[license]]''', which may entitle a person (called a '''licensee''') to use property, but which is subject to termination at the will of the owner of the property (called the '''licensor''').  An example of a licensor/licensee relationship is a parking lot owner and a person who parks a vehicle in the parking lot.  A license may be seen in the form of a ticket to a baseball game or a verbal permission to sleep a few days on a sofa.  The difference is that if there is a term (end time), a degree of privacy suggestive of exclusive possession of a clearly defined part, practised ongoing, recurrent payments, a lack of right to terminate save for misconduct or nonpayment, these factors tend toward a lease; by contrast, a one-time entrance onto someone else's property is probably a license.  The seminal difference between a lease and a license is that a lease generally provides for regular periodic payments during its term and a specific ending date. If a contract has no ending date then it may be in the form of a ''perpetual license'' and still not be a lease.

Under normal circumstances, owners of property are at liberty to do what they want with their property (for a lawful purpose), including dealing with it or handing over '''possession''' of the property to a tenant for a limited period of time.  If an owner has granted possession to another (i.e., the tenant) then any interference with the quiet enjoyment of the property by the tenant in lawful possession is itself unlawful.

Similar principles apply to [[real property]] as well as to [[personal property]], though the terminology differs. The right to sub-lease may or may not be permitted to a tenant. Where it is permitted, the lease granted directly by the owner is called a "headlease", or sometimes a "master lease". Headlease tenants and their tenants who may in turn also sublet are termed ''mesne {{IPAc-en|m|iː|n}} landlords'' from the old French for middle. The headlease tenant has no right to grant a sublease which extends beyond the end of the headlease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizoptions.com/glossary/h.asp |title=Real Estate Glossary Business Dictionary Definition Head Lease |publisher=www.bizoptions.com |accessdate=2010-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To circumvent [[privity of estate]] which is the general principle flowing from [[privity of contract]], laws exist in several jurisdictions to bind subtenants to some of the restrictive covenants (terms) of the headlease, for instance in England and Wales those which have been held by courts to touch and concern the land.&lt;ref&gt;City of London Corporation v Fell [1994] 1 A.C. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

A transfer of a remaining interest in a lease, '''assignment''', is a type of (''alienation'') is often possible and an implied rights to assign exist by compulsory law or as a default position in some jurisdictions.  Sharing or parting with possession can be a breach of certain leases resulting in action for forfeiture.

'''Enfranchisement''' is the obtaining of the landlord's title and is most commonly negotiated with the landlord where a tenant pays only a ''ground rent''.  '''Merger''' is where the landlord and tenant happen to be the same and can terminate a lease where there are no subtenants in certain jurisdictions.

== History of leases of land ==
Over the centuries, leases have served many purposes and the nature of legal regulation has varied according to those purposes and the social and economic conditions of the times. Leases, for example, were mainly used for [[agricultural]] purposes until the late 18th century and early 19th century when the growth of cities in industrialized countries made leases an important form of landholding in [[urban area]]s.

The modern law of [[landlord]] and [[leasehold estate|tenant]] in common law jurisdictions retains the influence of the common law and, particularly, the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' philosophy that dominated the law of [[contract]] and [[property law]] in the 19th century. With the growth of [[consumerism]], [[consumer protection]] legislation recognised that common law principles, which assume equal bargaining power between the contracting parties, create hardships when that assumption is inaccurate. Consequently, reformers have emphasised the need to assess residential tenancy laws in terms of protection they provide to tenants. Legislation to protect tenants is now common.

== Types of tenancies ==

=== Fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years ===
A fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years lasts for some fixed period of time. It has a definite beginning date and a definite ending date. Despite the name "tenancy for years", such a tenancy can last for any period of time—even a tenancy for one week may be called a tenancy for years. At [[common law]] the duration did not need to be certain, but could be conditioned upon the happening of some event, (e.g., "until the crops are ready for harvest" or "until the war is over"). In many jurisdictions that possibility has been partially or totally abolished.

A fixed term tenancy comes to an end automatically when the fixed term runs out or, in the case of a tenancy that ends on the happening of an event, when the event occurs. If a holdover tenant remains on the property after the termination of the lease, s/he may become a tenant at sufferance because the lessor/landlord has suffered (or allowed) the tenant to remain as a tenant instead of evicting him or her.  Such a tenancy is generally "at will," meaning the tenant or the landlord may terminate it at any time, upon the providing of proper statutory notice.

=== Periodic tenancy ===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
A periodic tenancy, also known as a tenancy from year to year, month to month, or week to week, is an estate that exists for some period of time determined by the term of the payment of rent. An oral lease for a tenancy of years that violates the [[Statute of Frauds]] (by committing to a lease of more than — depending on the jurisdiction — one year without being in writing) may actually create a periodic tenancy, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where the leased premises are located. In many jurisdictions the "default" tenancy, where the parties have not explicitly specified a different arrangement, and where none is presumed under local or business custom, is a month-to-month tenancy.

Either the landlord or the tenant may terminate a periodic tenancy when the period or term is nearing completion, by giving notice to the other party as required by statute or case law in the jurisdiction. Neither landlord nor tenant may terminate a periodic tenancy before the period has ended, without incurring an obligation to pay for the months remaining on the lease.  Either party must give notice if it intends to terminate a tenancy from year to year, and the amount of notice is either specified by the lease or by state statute.  Notice is usually, but not always, at least one month, especially for the year-to-year periodic tenancy.  Durations of less than a year must typically receive notice equal to the period of the tenancy - for example, the landlord must give a month's notice to terminate a tenancy from month to month. However, many jurisdictions have increased these required notice periods, and some have reduced the capacity of a landlord to use them drastically. For jurisdictions that have local rent control laws, a landlord's ability to terminate a residential tenancy is substantially reduced.  For example, in California, the cities of Los Angeles, Santa Monica, West Hollywood, San Francisco, and Oakland have "rent stabilization ordinances" that limit a landlord's ability to terminate a periodic tenancy, among other restrictions.

The notice must also state the effective date of termination, which, in some jurisdictions, ''must'' be on the ''last day'' of the payment period. In other words, if a month-to-month tenancy began on the 15th of the month, in a jurisdiction with a ''last day'' requirement the termination could not be effective on the 20th of the following month, even though this would give the tenant more than the required one month's notice.

=== Tenancy at will ===
A ''tenancy at will'' is a tenancy which either the landlord or the tenant may terminate at any time by giving reasonable [[notice]].  Unlike a periodic tenancy, it isn't associated with a time period.  It may last for many years, but it could be ended at any time by either the lessor or the lessee for any reason, or for no reason at all.  Proper notice, as always with landlord/tenant law, must be given, as set forth in the state's statutes.  If there is no formal lease, the tenancy at will is the one that usually exists.  In rare cases it may occur where the tenancy is not for [[consideration]].  Under the modern [[common law]], a tenancy at will without compensation is very rare, partly because it comes about only if the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is for no rent, commonly where a family member is allowed to live in a home (a nominal consideration may be required) without any formal arrangements. In most residential tenancies for a fixed term, for consideration, the tenant may not be removed except for [[causation (law)|cause]], even if there is no written lease. (However, an oral lease for more than 12 months is not enforceable if the statute of frauds in the jurisdiction includes leases of more than 12 months.) Many residential leases convert to "at will" tenancy subject to 30-days notice.  Alternatively, a tenancy at will (without a specific time limit) may exist for a temporary period where a tenant wishes to take possession of a property and the landlord agrees, but there is insufficient time in which to negotiate and complete a new lease. In this case, the tenancy at will is terminated as soon as a new lease is negotiated and signed.  The parties may also agree on the basis that if the parties fail to enter into a new lease within a reasonable time period, then the tenant must vacate the premises.

If a lease exists at the sole discretion of the landlord, the law of the jurisdiction may imply that the tenant is granted, by [[operation of law]], a reciprocal right to terminate the lease at will. However, a lease that explicitly exists at the will of the tenant (e.g. "for as long as the tenant desires to live on this land") generally does not imply that the landlord may terminate the lease; rather, such language may be interpreted as granting the tenant a [[life estate]] or even a [[fee simple]].

A tenancy at will is broken, again by [[operation of law]], if the:
* Tenant commits [[waste (law)|waste]] against the property;
* Tenant attempts to [[assignment (law)|assign]] the tenancy;
* Tenant uses the property to operate a criminal enterprise;
* Landlord transfers his/her interest in the property;
* Landlord leases the property to another person;
* Tenant or landlord dies.

The specifics of these rules differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Subject to any notice required by law, a tenancy at will also comes to an end when either the landlord or the tenant acts inconsistently with a tenancy. For example, the changing of locks by the landlord is an indication of the end of the tenancy, as is the vacation of the premises by the tenant.  However, in some jurisdictions, such as California, a landlord is prohibited from using a "self help" remedy, such as changing the locks, to terminate a tenancy, particularly a residential tenancy.  Doing so may constitute a "constructive eviction" and expose the landlord to civil and criminal liability.

=== Tenancy at sufferance ===
A ''tenancy at sufferance'' (sometimes called a ''holdover tenancy'') exists when a tenant remains in possession of a property after the expiration of a lease, and until the landlord acts to eject the tenant from the property. Although the tenant is technically a [[trespasser]] at this point, and possession of this type is not a true estate in land, authorities recognize the condition in order to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may [[eviction|evict]] such a tenant at any time, and without notice.

The landlord may also impose a new lease on the holdover tenant. For a residential tenancy, this new tenancy is month to month. For a commercial tenancy of more than a year, the new tenancy is year to year; otherwise it is the same period as the period before the original lease expired. In either case, the landlord can raise the rent, so long as the landlord has told the tenant of the higher rent before the expiration of the original lease.

== Formalities ==
Formal requirements for a lease are determined by the law and custom of the jurisdiction in which real property is located. In the case of personal property, it is determined by the law and custom of the jurisdiction in which the rental agreement is made.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A tenancy for a duration greater than one year must be in writing in order to satisfy the [[Statute of frauds|Statute of Frauds]].

=== Term ===
The [[Term (time)|term]] of the lease may be fixed, periodic or of indefinite duration. If it is for a [[tenancy for years|specified period]] of time, the term ends automatically when the period expires, and no notice needs to be given, in the absence of legal requirements. The term's duration may be conditional, in which case it lasts until a specified event occurs, such as the death of a specified individual. A periodic tenancy is one which is renewed automatically, usually on a monthly or weekly basis. A tenancy at will lasts only as long as the parties wish it to, and may be terminated by either party without penalty.

It is common for a lease to be extended on a "holding over" basis, which normally converts the tenancy to a periodic tenancy on a month by month basis. It is also possible for a tenant, either expressly or impliedly, to give up the tenancy to the landlord. This process is known as a "surrender" of the lease.

=== Transparency and fine print ===
[[File:Contract 20160994.jpg|thumb|Before signing any contract, read and understand the fine print.]]
As stated by the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), 2013, a lack of transparency regarding a term in a standard-form consumer contract may cause a significant imbalance in the parties’ rights and obligations.&lt;ref name="Aus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/Rental%20cars%20-%20an%20industry%20guide%20to%20the%20Australian%20Consumer%20Law.pdf|title=Rental cars: An industry guide to the Australian Consumer Law|date=2013|website=Australian Consumer Laws|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=9 May 2016}} [[File:CC-BY_icon.svg|50x50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia license.&lt;/ref&gt;

A term is considered transparent if it is:
* expressed in reasonably plain language
* legible
* presented clearly
* readily available to any party affected by the term

Terms that may not be considered transparent include terms that are hidden in fine print or schedules or phrased in complex or technical language.&lt;ref name="Aus"/&gt;

=== Rent ===
Rent is a requirement of leases in some common law jurisdictions, but not in civil law jurisdictions. In England and Wales it was held in the case of ''[[Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold]]'' that rent was not a requirement for there to be a lease, however the court will more often construe a licence where no rent is paid as it is seen as evidence for no intention to create legal relations. There is no requirement for the rent to be a commercial amount; a [[Peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]] or rent of some nominal amount is sufficient for this requirement.

=== Exclusive possession ===
A sharing arrangement with much of a landlord's property or, for no specific room of a building for instance, may defeat a finding of a lease, however this common requirement of a lease is interpreted differently in many jurisdictions.

== Provisions specific to car rental ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

In addition to the above, a car rental agreement may include various restrictions on the way a renter can use a car, and the condition in which it must be returned.  For example, some rentals cannot be driven off-road, or out of the country, or towing a trailer, without specific permission.  In New Zealand you may have to specifically endorse a promise that the car will not be driven onto [[Ninety Mile Beach, New Zealand|Ninety-Mile Beach]] (because of the hazardous tides).

There will certainly be a requirement to show a [[driver's license]], and only those drivers appearing on the contract may be authorized to drive. It may include an option to purchase [[auto insurance]] (UK: motor insurance), if the renter does not already have a policy to cover rentals—another important consideration for multiple drivers.  Some agencies may even require a [[Surety bond|bond]] payable if the car is not returned in order, often held in the form of a credit-card authorization—voided if the car is returned per agreement.  A renter should be advised that he or she will be responsible for any tolls, parking or traffic violations incurred upon the vehicle during the rental period.  There should also be advice on handling thefts, accidents, break-downs, and towing.

Further terms may include added fees for late returns, drop-off at a different location, or failure to top up the petrol immediately before the return.

Finally, there may be provisions for making a non-refundable deposit with a booking, terms for payment of the initial period (with discounts, vouchers, etc.), extended periods, and any damages or other fees that accrue prior to the return.

== Leasing property ==
A rental agreement is often called a lease, especially when [[real estate]] is rented.  Real estate rentals are initiated by a rental application which is used to build the terms of the lease. In addition to the basics of a rental (who, what, when, how much), a real estate rental may go into much more detail on these and other issues.  The real estate may be rented for [[Housing tenure|housing]], [[parking]] a vehicle(s), storage, business, agricultural, institutional, or government use, or other reasons.
* Who: The parties involved in the contract, the lessor (sometimes called the owner or [[landlord]]) and the lessee (sometimes called the renter or [[leasehold estate|tenant]]) are identified in the contract.  A housing lease may specify whether the renter is living alone, with family, children, roommate, visitors.  A rental may delineate the rights and obligations of each of these.  For example, a "sub-let" to a stranger might not be permitted without permission of the landlord.  This also applies to whether or not [[pet]]s may be kept by the renter.  On the other hand, the renter may also have specific rights against intrusions by the landlord (or other tenants), except under emergency circumstances.  A renter is in possession of the property, and a landlord would be trespassing upon the renter's rights if entry is made without proper notice and authority (e.g., 24 hours' notice, daytime, knock first, except for emergency repairs, in case of fire, flood, etc.).
* What: Rented real estate may include all or part of almost any [[real property]], such as an [[apartment]], [[house]], [[building]], business office(s) or suite, land, farm, or merely an inside or outside space to [[Parking|park]] a vehicle, or store things.  The premises rented may include not only specific rooms, but also access to other common areas such as off-street parking, basement or attic storage, laundry facility, pool, roof-deck, balconies, etc. The agreement may specify how and when these places may be used, and by whom.  There may be detailed description of the current condition of the premises, for comparison with the condition at the time the premises are surrendered.
* When: the term of the rental may be for a night (e.g., a hotel room), weeks, months, or years.  There may be statutory provisions requiring registration of any rental that could extend for more than a specified number of years (e.g., seven) in order to be enforceable against a new landlord.

:A typical rental is either annual or month-to-month, and the amount of rent may be different for long-term renters (because of lower turnover costs). Leaving a long-term lease before its expiration could result in penalties, or even the cost of the entire agreed period (if the landlord is unable to find a suitable replacement tenant, after diligent pursuit). If a tenant stays beyond the end of a lease for a term of years (one or more), then the parties may agree that the lease will be automatically renewed, or it may simply convert to a tenancy at will (month-to-month) at the pro-rated monthly cost of the previous annual lease. If a tenant at will is given notice to quit the premises, and refuses to do so, the landlord then begins eviction proceedings. In many places it is completely illegal to change locks on doors, or remove personal belongings, let alone forcibly eject a person, without a court order of eviction.  There may be strict rules of procedure, and stiff penalties (triple damages, plus attorneys' fees) for violations.
* How much: Rent may be payable monthly, annually, or in advance, or as otherwise agreed. A typical arrangement for tenancy at will is "first and last month's rent" plus a [[security deposit]]. The "last month's rent" is rent that has yet to be earned by the landlord.

=== Deposit ===
{{See also|Security deposit|Damage deposit|Key money}}

The security deposit is often handled as an [[escrow]] deposit, owned by the tenant, but held by the landlord until the premises are surrendered in good condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted).  In some states, the landlord must provide the tenant with the name and account number of the bank where the security deposit is held, and pay annual interest to the tenant.  Other regulations may require the landlord to submit a list of pre-existing damage to the property, or forfeit the security deposit immediately (because there is no way to determine whether a prior tenant was responsible). In UK the government has introduced deposit protection scheme leading to several property inventory services which can optionally be used to carry out an inventory.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Insurance ===
In order to rent (alternatively called lease) in many apartment buildings, a renter ([[lessee]]) is often required to provide proof of renters [[insurance]] before signing the rental agreement. There is a special type of the [[homeowners insurance]] in the [[United States]] specifically for renters — '''[[Home insurance#HO4 .E2.80.93 Contents Broad Form|HO-4]]'''. This is commonly referred to as renter’s [[insurance]] or renter's coverage. Similar to [[condominium]] coverage, referred to as a '''[[Home insurance#HO6 .E2.80.93 Unit-Owners Form|HO-6]]''' policy, a renter's insurance policy covers those aspects of the [[apartment]] and its contents not specifically covered in the [[blanket policy]] written for the complex. This [[policy]] can also cover liabilities arising from accidents and intentional injuries for guests as well as passers-by up to 150' of the domicile. Renter’s policies provide "named peril" coverage, meaning the policy states specifically what you are insured against. Common coverage areas are:
* Accidental discharge of water{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
* [[Fire]] or [[lightning]]
* [[Smoke]]
* [[Theft]]
* [[Vandalism]] or malicious mischief
* [[Windstorm]]

Additional events including riot, aircraft, explosion, hail, falling objects, [[volcanic eruption]], snow, sleet, and weight of ice may also be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{note label|PI|2002: 5.3–5.4|none}}{{cite book

== Sublease ==
In [[real estate law]], sublease (or, less formally, sublet) is the name given to an arrangement in which the lessee (e.g. tenant) in a lease assigns the lease to a third party, thereby making the old lessee the sublessor, and the new lessee the sublessee, or subtenant. This means they are not only leasing the property, but also subleasing it simultaneously. For example, if a company leases an office space directly from a landlord, the lessor, and subsequently outgrows the office, then the company can sublease the smaller office space to another company, the subtenant, and enter into a new lease for a larger office space, thereby hedging their real estate exposure.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The sublessor remains liable to the original lessor in accordance with the initial lease, including all remaining rent payments, including operating expenses and all other original lease terms. In a down-market, the original lessee may require a lower rent payment from the sublessee than what he or she may have originally paid, leaving the remaining rent owed to the lessor to be paid by the original lessee. However, if market prices have increased since the original lease was signed, the sublessor might be able to secure a higher rent price than what is owed the original lessor. However, many commercial leases stipulate that any overages in rent be shared with the landlord, the lessor.

In residential real estate, it is sometimes illegal to charge the subtenant more than the original amount in the sublessee's contract (for instance, in a [[rent control]] situation where the rental amount is controlled by law). Subletting of [[social housing]] is generally illegal, whatever the rent charged to the subtenant; in the UK it is officially described as a category of housing fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', BBC, 4 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A sublease can also apply to vehicles as an alternate type of car rental. In a vehicle sublease, a lessee or vehicle owner can assign a lease to a third party and by way of contractual agreement for specific dates. Although this arrangement is not popular, it is a growing trend in the travel industry as a less expensive alternative for travelers and locals.

==Equipment leasing==
Leasing is also used as a form of financing to acquire equipment for use and purchase.&lt;ref name="ELFA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.elfaonline.org/About/?fa=overview |title=Industry Overview |publisher=Equipment Leasing and Finance Association |accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many organizations and companies use lease financing for the acquisition and use of many types of equipment, including manufacturing and mining machinery, vessels and containers, construction and off-road equipment, medical technology and equipment, agricultural equipment, aircraft, rail cars and rolling stock, trucks and transportation equipment, business, retail and office equipment, IT equipment and software.&lt;ref name="ELFA"/&gt;

Lease financing for equipment is generally provided by banks, captives and independent finance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.elfaonline.org/news/IndNews/news_report.cfm?id=21488 |title= Industry News: Around the Industry |accessdate= 21 September 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141013163443/https://www.elfaonline.org/news/IndNews/news_report.cfm?id=21488 |archivedate= 13 October 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elfaonline.org/Research/IMAGES/SEFAInfographicFINAL.png |title=Equipment Financing On The Rise |accessdate=21 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013163531/http://www.elfaonline.org/Research/IMAGES/SEFAInfographicFINAL.png |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], leases of goods are generally governed by Article 2A of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC) as [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption|adopted]] by the various jurisdictions.

{{Property law}}
A '''license''' (American English) or '''licence''' (British English)&lt;ref name=cam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/licence?a=british|title=licence Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an official permission or permit to do, use, or own something (as well as the document of that permission or permit).&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

A license can be granted by a party to another party as an element of an agreement between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is "an authorization to use licensed material".

In particular, a license may be issued by authorities, to allow an activity that would otherwise be forbidden. It may require paying a fee or proving a capability. The requirement may also serve to keep the authorities informed on a type of activity, and to give them the opportunity to set conditions and limitations.

A licensor may grant a '''license''' under [[intellectual property]] laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a ([[patent]]ed) invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from a claim of infringement brought by the licensor.&lt;ref&gt;Intellectual Property Licensing:  Forms and Analysis, by [[Richard Raysman]], Edward A. Pisacreta and Kenneth A. Adler. Law Journal Press, 1999-2008. {{ISBN|978-1-58852-086-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a '''term''', '''territory''', '''renewal''' provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the licensor.

'''Term:''' many licenses are valid for a particular length of time. This protects the licensor should the value of the license increase, or market conditions change. It also preserves enforceability by ensuring that no license extends beyond the term of the agreement.

'''Territory:''' a license may stipulate what territory the rights pertain to. For example, a license with a territory limited to "North America" (Mexico/United States/Canada) would not permit a licensee any protection from actions for use in Japan.

A shorthand definition of license is "a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee". That means without a license any use or exploitation of intellectual property by a third party would amount to copying or infringement. Such copying would be improper and could, by using the legal system, be stopped if the intellectual property owner wanted to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Licensing Intellectual Property: Law &amp; Management, by [[Raman Mittal]]. Satyam Law International, New Delhi, India, 2011. {{ISBN|978-81-902883-4-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual property licensing plays a major role in business, academia and broadcasting. Business practices such as franchising, technology transfer, publication and character merchandising entirely depend on the licensing of intellectual property. Land licensing (proprietary licensing) and IP licensing form sub-branches of law born out of the interplay of general laws of contract and specific principles and statutory laws relating to these respective assets.

== Mass licensing of software ==

{{Main|Software license agreement}}

Mass distributed software is used by individuals on personal computers under license from the developer of that software. Such license is typically included in a more extensive end-user license agreement (EULA){{Clarify|date=January 2018|reason=Difference between license and EULA is unclear.}} entered into upon the installation of that software on a computer.
Typically, a license is associated with a unique code, that when approved grants the end user access to the software in question.

Under a typical end-user license agreement, the user may install the software on a limited number of computers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The enforceability of end-user license agreements is sometimes [[Software license agreement#Enforceability of EULAs in the United States|questioned]].

== Patent licensing ==
A licensor may grant permission to a licensee to conduct activities which would otherwise be within the licensor's [[patent]]ed exclusive rights.  Under U.S. patent law, those activities are to make, use, sell, offer for sale, or import a patented product, or to perform a patented process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title35/html/USCODE-2011-title35-partIII-chap28-sec271.htm|title=U.S.C. Title 35 - PATENTS|author=|date=|website=www.gpo.gov|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term of a [[patent]] license may be a "fixed" (i.e., specified) term, such as 5 years, or may be for the life of the [[patent]] (i.e., until the [[patent]] expires).  A patent is by its nature limited in territorial scope; it only covers activity within the borders of the country issuing the patent.  Accordingly, a [[patent]] license does not require a territory provision.

The consideration provided by the licensee in return for the patent license grant is called a [[patent]] [[royalty payment]].  In a "paid-up" license, the "lump sum" royalty payment is a specified monetary amount, typically due shortly after the effective date of the patent (e.g., within 15 business days of the effective date), and no further payments are required.  Otherwise, the royalty payment is a "running royalty," typically payable on an annual basis.  The annual royalty may be a specified amount (e.g., one million dollars each year), or an amount proportional to the volume of licensed activity conducted by the licensee (e.g., one dollar per unit of licensed product sold by the licensee that year, or one percent of the net sales amount of the licensed products sold by the licensee that year).

A '''Licensing agreement''' is an arrangement whereby a licensor grants the right to intangible property to another entity for a specified period, and in return, the licensor receives a royalty fee from the licensee. Intangible property includes patents, inventions, formulas, processes, designs, copyrights, and trademarks.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Charles W.L.|title=International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace|date=2015|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811277-5|pages=455–456|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advantages of a Licensing Agreement:''' 
* A primary advantage of a licensing agreement, the firm does not have to bear the development and risks associated with opening a foreign market. It is very attractive for firms lacking the capital to develop operations overseas. Licensing can be attractive when a firm is unwilling to commit substantial financial resources to an unfamiliar or politically volatile foreign market.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt; Licensing is primarily used with a firm wants to participate in a foreign market but is prohibited because of barriers to investment.

'''Disadvantages of a Licensing Agreement'''
* First, it does not give a firm the tight control over manufacturing, marketing, and strategy that is required for realizing experience curve and location economies.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt;
* Second, competing in a global market may require a firm to coordinate strategic moves across countries by using profits earned in one country to support competitive attacks in another. Licensing limits a firms ability to do this.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt;
* Lastly, a third problem with licensing is the relationship of the economic theory of FDI. This is associated with licensing technological know-how foreign companies. Technological know-how constitutes the basis of many multi-national firms' competitive advantages. Most firms wish to control how their know-how is used, because they can lose control easily. Many firms make the mistake of thinking they could maintain control over their know-how within the licensing agreement.&lt;ref name="McGraw Hill"/&gt;

== Trademark and brand licensing ==

A licensor may grant permission to a licensee to distribute products under a [[trademark]]. With such a license, the licensee may use the trademark without fear of a claim of trademark infringement by the licensor.
The assignment of a license often depends on specific [[contractual terms]]. The most common terms are, that a license is only applicable for a particular geographic region, just for a certain period of time or merely for a stage in the [[value chain]].
Moreover, there are different types of fees within the trademark and brand licensing. The first form demands a fee independent of [[sales]] and [[profit (accounting)|profits]], the second type of license fee is dependent on the productivity of the licensee.

When a licensor grants permission to a licensee to not only distribute, but manufacture a patented product, it is known as [[licensed production]].

==Artwork and character licensing==

A licensor may grant a permission to a licensee to copy and distribute [[copyright]]ed works such as "art" (e.g., [[Thomas Kinkade]]'s painting "Dawn in Los Gatos") and characters (e.g., [[Mickey Mouse]]). With such license, a licensee need not fear a claim of copyright infringement brought by the copyright owner.

[[Artistic license]] is, however, not related to the aforementioned license. It is a [[euphemism]] that denotes freedom of expression, the ability to make the subject appear more engaging or attractive, by [[fiction]]alising part of the subject.

==Academia== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ecclesiastical court]] --&gt;
:''National examples of the licentiate are listed at [[licentiate (degree)]]''

A [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] is an [[academic degree]] that traditionally conferred the license to teach at a university or to practice a particular profession. The term survived despite the fact that nowadays a [[doctorate]] is typically needed in order to teach at a university. The term is also used for a person who holds a licentiate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/licentiate?region=uk&amp;q=Licentiate Oxford Living Dictionaries] Accessed September 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/licentiate|title=Definition of LICENTIATE|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In English, the degree has never been called a license. In French-speaking countries, the bachelor's degree is called a ''licence''.

In [[Education in Sweden|Sweden]], [[Education in Finland|Finland]], and in some other European university systems, a 'licentiate' is a postgraduate degree between the master's degree and the doctorate.  The licentiate is a popular choice in those countries where a full [[doctorate|doctoral degree]] would take five or more years to achieve.

==Vehicle licensing==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
{{see also|Driver's license}}
A license to driving certain vehicles has been applied to many countries around the world. Being allowed to drive a certain vehicle requires a specific driving license, the type of license depending on the type of vehicle.

==Criminal law==
{{Main|Parole#United Kingdom|Temporary licence}}
In the United Kingdom prisoners may be released prior to the completion of their full sentence "on licence".  Basically, the licence is the prisoner's agreement to maintain certain conditions, such as periodic reporting in to a probation officer and maintaining fixed address, in exchange for his freedom.&lt;ref name="NOMS"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Licence conditions, licences and licence and supervision notices |date=23 March 2015 |publisher=National Offender Management Service |url=https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/offenders/psipso/psi-2015/psi-12-2015-licences-conditions-supervision.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70FRY3UOT?url=https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/offenders/psipso/psi-2015/psi-12-2015-licences-conditions-supervision.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Gianquitto |first1=Lisa |last2=Rule |first2=Philip |date=1 February 2012 |title=Licences and Licence conditions |newspaper=InsideTime |url=https://insidetime.org/licences-and-licence-conditions/ |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70FSHvnGT?url=https://insidetime.org/licences-and-licence-conditions/ |archive-date=17 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parole]] and [[release on licence]] are the same procedure by another name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Parole and release on licence |publisher=The  Scottish Government |url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/parole-release-on-licence |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617223119/http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/parole-release-on-licence |archive-date=17 June 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The provision of licenses and the agencies that mandate them are often criticised by libertarians, like [[Milton Friedman]], for creating an anticompetitive environment for occupations, which creates a [[barrier to entry]] for more qualified and skilled individuals who may not have the resources to obtain the necessary licences. According to Friedman, licenses and permits have become so burdensome due to legislation that favors the current  establishment of wealthy occupants that they decrease the supply of such occupations, which raises prices for the average consumer. Libertarians and the anti-authoritarian left ([[anarcho-communists]]) view competing guilds and other voluntary communes as being more beneficial for disseminating the skills and education required to perform a specified career.

'''''Mauldin v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.''''' was a [[sexual discrimination]] [[class action]] lawsuit filed on October 16, 2001, in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia]], seeking back pay and an injunction. The suit challenged [[Walmart]]'s denial of health insurance coverage for prescription contraceptives.&lt;ref name=nwlc&gt;{{cite press release |title=Wal-Mart Sued For Excluding Prescription Contraceptives From Employee Health Plans |url=http://www.nwlc.org/details.cfm?id=3132&amp;section=newsroom |publisher=National Women's Law Center |date=October 17, 2001 |accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was granted class action status with an estimated 400,000 women eligible for participation in the lawsuit. 

In September 2006, Walmart added prescription contraceptives to its health insurance coverage. In November 2006, the court ordered an investigation into whether illegal [[bribery|kickback]]s were paid by [[Milberg Weiss]] to the lead plaintiff. The plaintiffs agreed to dismiss the case rather than permit discovery into the payments.

==Lawsuit==
The lawsuit was filed by Lisa Smith Mauldin, a 23-year-old customer service manager at a Walmart store in [[Hiram, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=nation&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Liza Featherstone of ''[[The Nation]]'' described this financial weight as "a significant burden for [Mauldin] (and certainly a prohibitive one for many fellow employees, who earn significantly lower wages)."&lt;ref name=nation/&gt;

Mauldin sued Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., her employer, claiming that the [[defendant]]'s health plan was in violation of Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] because its provisions did not provide coverage for prescription contraceptives. Mauldin sought to amend Walmart's health plan to include coverage for contraceptives and to receive reimbursement for the cost of contraceptives, pre-judgment interest, and attorneys' fees.&lt;ref name=sec&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/104169/000010416905000019/wmt10q_q3fy2006.htm |title=Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended October 31, 2005 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maudlin was represented by a legal team consisting of the law firm of [[Milberg|Milberg Weiss]] as lead class counsel, George Stein as local counsel, Judy Applebaum of the [[National Women's Law Center]], and the law firm of Heller, Horowitz &amp; Feit.&lt;ref name=nwlc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/women/2002-05-08-contraceptives.htm |date=May 7, 2002|title=Battle over contraceptive coverage heats up |first=Rita |last=Rubin |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2002, U.S. District Judge Julie Carnes granted the case class action status, allowing all women who had been covered by Walmart's Associates Health and Welfare Plan since March 2001 and who had been using prescription contraceptives to join the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=rankin/&gt;&lt;ref name=consumer/&gt; Attorney George Stein estimated the number of eligible women as 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wal-Mart’s Women Employees Allege Gender Discrimination; Health Plans Face Growing Pressure to Cover Contraceptives|url=http://www.feminist.org/news/newsbyte/uswirestory.asp?id=6847|date=September 3, 2002|work=Feminist Daily News Wire|publisher=Feminist Majority Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Walmart requested that the court reconsider the granting of class action status but on September 30, 2003, the court denied its request without prejudice.&lt;ref name=sec/&gt;  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, but the court did not rule on those motions.

==Improper payments==
In 2006, the court found that Lisa Mauldin had received payments from her local counsel, George Stein, that the court called "highly irregular, and at the very least create an appearance of impropriety."&lt;ref name=mauldin321&gt;''See Mauldin v. Wal-Mart, Inc.'', Case No. 1:01-CV-2755-JEC (Mar. 21, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Stein admitted to paying Mauldin checks totaling US$2250, but denied that it was to induce her to sue Walmart. According to Stein, the payments were loans for personal matters and a sponsorship for Mauldin's daughter to attend cheerleading camp. Lead counsel [[Milberg Weiss]] claimed they had no knowledge of the payments and indicated in their response to the court that Stein and Mauldin intended to withdraw from the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=mauldin321/&gt;  The court at first denied Walmart's request to take discovery on Milberg Weiss.&lt;ref name=mauldin321/&gt;  However, in a November 22, 2006 order, the court decided to allow discovery, noting that, "Given the evidence of suspicious payments to Mauldin, and the recent indictment of Milberg Weiss for recruiting plaintiffs to participate in class action lawsuits, discovery is warranted to ensure that Mauldin's EEOC charge was not fraudulently procured."&lt;ref name=irregular/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/18/us/18cnd-legal.html?ex=1305604800&amp;en=b01b688a560ca3d5&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss|title=Milberg Weiss Is Charged With Bribery and Fraud |last=Creswell|first=Julie|date=May 18, 2006|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dismissal==
In September 2006, Walmart decided to change its health care policy to include coverage of prescription contraceptives as part of a larger overhaul of its health-care plans.  According to Walmart, this decision had nothing to do with the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=irregular&gt;{{cite news|title=Payments to plaintiff called "irregular"|work=Fulton County Daily Report|date=February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Affidavit of Mark Casciari, December 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2006, just a couple of weeks after the court's discovery order, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the case voluntarily, stating that the central purpose of the lawsuit had been achieved.&lt;ref name=irregular/&gt; Even though Milberg Weiss claimed that it had been successful, it did not request attorneys' fees for its five years of legal work; the dismissal prevented Walmart from investigating whether Milberg Weiss had broken the law, and also ended the plaintiffs' claim for back pay.&lt;ref name=irregular/&gt;  On December 20, 2006, the court dismissed the case. Walmart's new health care policy went into effect on January 1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wal-Mart To Include Birth Control In Employee Health Insurance Coverage Plan Beginning Jan. 1|work=Medical News Today|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/59723.php|date=January 2, 2007 |accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micha Popper''' is a [[professor emeritus]] in the department of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Haifa]], [[Israel]].  He was the commander of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) Leadership Development School (LDS), co-founder and director of the Institute for Quality Leadership in Israel, and, from 1995 he was a faculty member and head of the [[Organizational Psychology]] program at the University of Haifa.  

==Biography==
Popper received his BA in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and his MA and PhD in [[Tel Aviv University]]. 

==Research areas== 
At the beginning of his research career Popper focused on exploring the origins of leadership in early childhood. Most knowledge in this field is inferred from biographies and studies (based mostly on psycho-dynamic analyses) of well-known people. His  work in this field led him to formulate a conceptual framework dealing with three components relevant to being and functioning as a leader: (1) the psychological potential to lead (P); (2) the motivation to be in a leadership position (M); (3) the environment (e.g. role models, accessibility to leadership experiences...), namely the developmental component (D). Popper and his colleagues have contributed to the identification, definition, evaluation and measurement of each of these components&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Popper, M., Amit, K., Gal, R., Sinai, M. &amp; Lissak, A. (2004). The capacity to lead: Major psychological differences between “leaders” and “non-leaders”. Military Psychology 16, 4, 245-263).&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In his later career, Popper observed that in the Western world, particularly the US, leadership was usually perceived as a positive phenomenon and leaders were socially respected, often even admired. However, history also points to dark manifestations of leadership. This aspect has been discussed by historians but largely neglected in psychological research on leadership. Popper’s work sheds light on the psychological foundations of the dark side of leadership&lt;ref&gt;see e.g., Popper, M. (2001). Hypnotic Leadership. Westport, CT: Prager.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
The continuation of Popper’s professional development led him to realize that psychological research on leadership was excessively preoccupied with leaders and there were not enough theoretical and empirical attempts to decipher the phenomenon of followership, without which the phenomenon of leadership cannot be fully understood. 

In recent years Popper’s work has focused on  primary foundations of followership,  both the phylogenetic elements and  the cultural components that “color” differently leaders’ perceptions and images in various cultures. &lt;ref&gt;Examples of this approach are Popper, M. (2012). Fact and fantasy about leadership. London: Edward Elgar; Popper, M., Castelnovo, O. (2017).The function of great leaders in human culture: A cultural-evolutionary perspective. Leadership, on line, of August, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.
In addition to his work in the domain of leadership, for many years Popper has also studied the field of “[[organizational learning]].” His work in this area has focused mostly on two questions:.How do people learn from their own experiences?  and, how do lessons learned on a personal level become organizational knowledge? 

The first question involves the development of concepts and methodologies for identifying “tacit knowledge” – knowledge created out of experience without awareness. Such knowledge is at the disposal of people when solving problems (as Polanyi puts it:” We know more than we can tell”). 
The second question led Popper and his colleagues to study the structural and cultural aspects that characterize effective learning in organizations. These studies focused on organizational learning mechanisms such as debriefing of air force pilots or debriefing of medical staff performing operatrions&lt;ref&gt;The structural-cultural approach to organizational learning is presented in Lipshitz, R., Friedman, V. &amp; Popper, M. (2007). Demystifying Organizational Learning. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Michael Wayne Godwin''' (born October 26, 1956) is an American attorney and author.

==Early life and education==
Godwin was educated at [[Lamar High School (Houston)|Lamar High School]] in Houston,&lt;ref name="LamarTXM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LamarHC"/&gt; before graduating in 1980 from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] with a Bachelor of Arts degree in the [[Plan II Honors]] program. Godwin later attended the [[University of Texas School of Law]], graduating with a [[Juris Doctor]] degree in 1990. While in law school, Godwin was the editor of ''[[The Daily Texan]]'', the student newspaper, from 1988 to 1989.&lt;ref name="DailyTexan"/&gt;

In his last semester of law school, early in 1990, Godwin, who knew [[Steve Jackson (US)|Steve Jackson]] through the Austin [[bulletin board system]] community, helped publicize the [[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service|Secret Service raid on Steve Jackson Games]]. His involvement is later documented in the non-fiction book ''[[The Hacker Crackdown]]: Law and Disorder on the Electronic Frontier'' (1992) by [[Bruce Sterling]].&lt;ref name="hackercrackdown"/&gt;

==Career==

===Internet law===
Godwin's early involvement in the Steve Jackson Games affair led to his being hired by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) in November 1990, when the organization was new. Shortly afterwards, as the first EFF in-house lawyer, he supervised its sponsorship of the ''[[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service]]'' case. Steve Jackson Games won the case in 1993.&lt;ref name="SJGamesWired"/&gt;

As a lawyer for EFF, Godwin was one of the counsel of record for the plaintiffs in the case challenging the [[Communications Decency Act]] in 1996. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decided the case for the plaintiffs on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds in 1997 in ''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]]''. Godwin's work on this and other First Amendment cases in the 1990s is documented in his book ''[[Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age]]'' (1998), which was reissued in a revised, expanded edition by [[MIT Press]] in 2003.

Godwin has also served as a staff attorney and policy fellow for the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]], as Chief Correspondent at ''IP Worldwide'', a publication of [[American Lawyer Media]], and as a columnist for ''[[The American Lawyer]]'' magazine. He is a Contributing Editor at ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name="Reason"/&gt; where he has published interviews of several science-fiction writers.&lt;ref name="SciFi"/&gt;

From 2003 to 2005, Godwin was staff attorney and later legal director of [[Public Knowledge]], a non-governmental organization based in Washington, D.C., concerned with [[intellectual property law]]. In recent years, Godwin has worked on copyright and technology policy, including the relationship between [[digital rights management]] and American copyright law. While at Public Knowledge, he supervised litigation that successfully challenged the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s [[broadcast flag]] regulation that would have imposed [[Digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions on television.

Established in 1963, the Ministry of Justice of Yemen seeks to develop an independent judiciary by overseeing operations such as fiscal and administrative services. Additionally, the ministry is responsible for tasks such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moj-yemen.net/minideutys.aspx|title=وزارة العدل اليمنية|website=www.moj-yemen.net|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Drafting laws that not only affect the judicial system but also the ministry as a whole
* Facilitating a professional relationship amongst the judiciary, authorities, and legal practitioners
* Representing Yemen in regional and international seminars that pertain to the judiciary and law-related matters

Although the names sound similar, the Ministry of Justice differs from the Ministry of Legal Affairs in that the latter focuses on human rights and civic freedom for Yemeni citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icnl.org/research/monitor/yemen.html|title=Yemen - Civic Freedom Monitor - Research Center - ICNL|website=www.icnl.org|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nottebohm case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala)''''' [1955] ICJ 1&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/1955/1.html&lt;/ref&gt; is the proper name for the 1955 case adjudicated by the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). [[Liechtenstein]] sought a ruling to force [[Guatemala]] to recognize Friedrich Nottebohm as a Liechtenstein national.&lt;ref name="CaseCite"&gt;1955 I.C.J. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has been cited in many definitions of nationality.

==Background==
Friedrich Nottebohm was born September 16, 1881, in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. In 1905, he moved to [[Guatemala]], where he went into business in trade, banking, and plantations with his brothers. The business prospered, and Nottebohm became its head in 1937. Nottebohm would live in Guatemala until 1943 as a permanent resident without ever acquiring Guatemalan citizenship. He would sometimes visit Germany on business, and had friends and relatives in both countries. He also paid a few visits to Liechtenstein to see his brother Hermann, who had moved there in 1931 and became a citizen. 

In 1939, Nottebohm again visited Liechtenstein, and on October 9, 1939, shortly after [[World War II]] began, he applied for citizenship. His application was approved and he became a citizen. Under German law, he lost his German citizenship. In January 1940, he returned to Guatemala on a Liechtenstein passport and informed the local government of his change of nationality. 

Although originally neutral, Guatemala soon sided with the Allies and formally declared war on Germany on December 11, 1941. In spite of his Liechtenstein citizenship, the Guatemalan government treated Nottebohm as a German citizen. As part of a massive program in which the US co-operated with various Latin American countries to intern in the US over 4,000 persons of German ancestry or citizenship, Nottebohm was arrested by the Guatemalan government as an enemy alien in 1943, handed over to a US military base, and transferred to the US, where he was interned until 1946. The Guatemalan government confiscated all his property in the country, and the US government also seized his company's assets in the US. In 1950, the US government returned to the Nottenbohm family about half the value of what it had seized. The Guatemalan government held on to his property and returned 16 coffee plantations to his family only in 1962, after he had died.&lt;ref&gt;Wojcikiewicz Almeida, Paula and Sorel, Jean-Marc: ''Latin America and the International Court of Justice: Contributions to International Law''&lt;/ref&gt; After his release, he returned to Liechtenstein, where he lived for the rest of his life.

In 1951, the Liechtenstein government, acting on behalf of Nottebohm, brought suit against Guatemala in the International Court of Justice for what it argued was unjust treatment of him and the illegal confiscation of his property. However, the government of Guatemala argued that Nottebohm did not gain Liechtenstein citizenship for the purposes of international law. The court agreed and so stopped the case from continuing.

==Judgment==
Although the Court stated that it is the sovereign right of all states to determine its own citizens and criteria for becoming one in municipal law, such a process would have to be internationally scrutinized if the question is of diplomatic protection. The Court upheld the principle of effective nationality (the ''Nottebohm'' principle): the national must prove a meaningful connection to the state in question. That principle had previously been applied only in cases of dual nationality to determine the nationality that should be used in a given case. The court ruled that Nottebohm's naturalization as a citizen of Liechtenstein had not been based on any genuine link with that country, but for the sole purpose of enabling him to replace his status as the national of a belligerent state with that of a neutral state in a time of war. The Court held that Liechtenstein was not entitled to take up his case and put forward an international claim on his behalf against Guatemala:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/18|title=Cour internationale de Justice - International Court of Justice - Cour internationale de Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/cases,ICJ,3ae6b7248.html|title=Refworld - Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Naturalization was asked for not so much for the purpose of obtaining a legal recognition of Nottebohm's membership in fact in the population of Liechtenstein, as it was to enable him to substitute for his status as a national of a belligerent State that of a national of a neutral State, with the sole aim of thus coming within the protection of Liechtenstein but not of becoming wedded to its traditions, it interests, its way of life or of assuming the obligations-other than fiscal obligations-and exercising the rights pertaining to the status thus acquired.

Guatemala is under no obligation to recognize a nationality granted in such circumstances. Liechtenstein consequently is not entitled to extend its protection to Nottebohm vis-à-vis Guatemala and its claim must, for this reason, be held to be inadmissible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
The ruling came under scrutiny due to the implication that a person could be left without any effective nationality. While applying such a standard in cases of dual nationality would still leave a person eligible for diplomatic protection from one state, Nottebohm was not a citizen of any country other than Liechtenstein at the time, and the ruling implied he may not have been an effective national of any country, though it's unclear if Nottebohm was treated as a dual national due to his long-term residence in Guatemala or previous links to Germany. The [[International Law Commission]] noted that in an age of globalization and large-scale migration, this standard has the potential of creating an underclass of millions of people lacking any diplomatic protection, as "there are millions of persons who have drifted away from their state of nationality and made their lives in states whose nationality they never acquire, or have acquired from birth and descent from states with which they have a tenuous connection."&lt;ref&gt;Boll, Alfred Michael: ''Multiple Nationality And International Law'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4092">'''Open Range Communications''' was a [[Colorado]]-based [[telecommunication]] company providing [[wireless broadband]] [[infrastructure]] for [[rural]] communities. The company developed and marketed [[WiMAX]] (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) network products. In 2008 it was awarded a $267 million loan from the [[Rural Utilities Service]]’s broadband program to supply [[broadband]] services (of which $73.5 million was provided to the company) in addition to $100 million in finance from [[JP Morgan Chase]]. The company filed for [[bankruptcy]] on October 6, 2012.&lt;ref name=politico&gt;[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1111/68522.html ''Open Range’s network to nowhere draws fire''] by Eliza Krigman, [[Politico.com]] (16 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadband provision==
The company was incorporated in 2004 and was [[headquarters|headquartered]] in [[Greenwood Village, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=38328142 Business Week:] ''Open Range Communications''&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January 2009, the company announced an investment of $100 million from [[One Equity Partners]] (OEP), the private equity arm of [[JP Morgan Chase]].

In March 2008, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Rural Utilities Service|Rural Development Utilities Program]] (RDUP) approved a $267 million ''Broadband Access Loan'' for Open Range, with the prerequisite that private financing also be secured. The OEP investment satisfied the RDUP's loan terms, making the funds available to Open Range.

==Bankruptcy==
Open Range Communications voluntarily filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|''Chapter 11'' bankruptcy protection]] on 6 October 2011 in the [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] for the District of [[Delaware]]. In court filings, the company stated that it intended to use the bankruptcy process to ''"effectuate either (i) a section 363 sale of substantially all of its assets as a going concern or sales for select assets; or, (ii) a wind-down of its business operations through a liquidation in chapter 11."'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ch11cases.com/2011/10/open-range-communications-inc-of.html] Open Range Communications Inc. of Greenwood Village, Colo. Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection&lt;/ref&gt; The company ceased operation soon after.

The company later asked the court to transfer the case to [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|''Chapter 7'']] of the [[United States Code|code]] saying it had, ''"no realistic chance to rehabilitate the business"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/boosters_bits/2012/02/open-range-communications-moves-to.html ''Open Range Communications moves to shift bankruptcy case to Ch. 7''] by  Greg Avery, [[Denver Business Journal]] (7 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; after a bankruptcy bidder (which had showed interest in buying the company's assets) withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_19344452 ''Bankruptcy bidder backs out; Open Range Communications will be liquidated''] by Ann Schrader, ''[[The Denver Post]]'' (6 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's bankruptcy left the [[US Government]] with liabilities for $73.5 million in unpaid loans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_19724436 ''Open Range telecom equipment sold at auction''] by Ann Schrader, ''[[The Denver Post]]'' (12 January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/broadband/openrange-bankruptcy-will-leave-taxpayers-on-the-hook/ ''OpenRange bankruptcy will leave taxpayers on the hook''] by Stacey Higgenbotham, [[GigaOM]] (7 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Energy and Commerce Committee]] has since launched an investigation into the company's collapse.&lt;ref name=politico/&gt;

'''Parsik Hill''' is a hill in the [[Mumbai metropolitan area]], in the [[Thane]] district of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].
It has a rail tunnel called Parsik tunnel. It is one of the longest and oldest tunnels in India and Asia.

==Geography==
The hill has {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide ridge that runs {{convert|7|km|miles}} north and south, paralleling the railway lines. The hill is

approximately 15 square kilometers area of [[Reserved forests and protected forests of India|reserved forests]], crossing into sections of both [[Thane]] and the north side of [[Navi Mumbai]], where quarrying has removed the trees from the hill.&lt;ref name="TOI"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-03/mumbai/33562482_1_parsik-hill-forest-department-encroachment | title=Encroachment, quarrying take a toll on Parsik Hill | date=3 September 2012 | agency=Times of India | accessdate=6 April 2013 | author=Clara Lewis, TNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Making of Navi Mumbai | publisher=Orient Blackswan | author=Annapurna Shaw | year=2004 | pages=91, 116 | isbn=8125026002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the highest peak rose to {{convert|235|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Making of Navi Mumbai | publisher=Orient Blackswan | author=Annapurna Shaw | year=2004 | pages=92 | isbn=8125026002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapadia p. 51"&gt;{{cite book | title=Trek the Sahyadris (fifth edition) | publisher=Indus Publishing | author=Harish Kapadia | year=2004 | pages=51 | isbn=8173871515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the top of hill stands the official residence of the Mayor of [[Navi Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Parsik's steep, [[Shrubland|scrub]] [[grassland]] hills have featured in some [[Bollywood movies]].&lt;ref name=Shaw /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohli" /&gt;

==Ecological factors==
Due to the impact of quarrying and [[illegal housing]], there is concern about the extent to which the reserved forest will remain in years to come. An ecological activist comments: "The hill has a huge potential for [[eco-tourism]], given that it runs through the municipal limits of Thane and Navi Mumbai and is about 30 minutes from [[Mumbai]]. Besides trekking trails, there is also a rock-climbing centre in Mumbra." The ecological balances is also being unsettled by the number of people building and living in [[shanty town|shanties]] in the forest, which could result in reduction or disappearance of species of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], including more than 100 bird species.&lt;ref name="TOI" /&gt;

==Uses==

===Parsik Tunnel===
{{see|Parsik tunnel}}
The famous Parsik tunnel on {{rws|Mumbai CST}}-{{rws|Kalyan}} mainline lies in this hill. This tunnel is between {{rws|Thane}} and {{rws|Mumbra}}. Double [[Indian gauge|Broad gauge]] track electrified passes though this tunnel. This reduced the distance between Thane and Diva to {{convert|7|km|abbr=on}} from formal {{convert|9.6|km|abbr=on}}. This tunnel is {{convert|1.3|km|abbr=on}} in length. This tunnel is one of the oldest tunnel in Asia.

===Recreational area===
It has been a favorite area for [[hiker]]s and, since the 1960s, for [[rock climber]]s.&lt;ref name="TOI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohli"&gt;{{cite book | title=Mountains of India: Tourism, Adventure and Pilgrimage | publisher=Indus Publishing | author=M.S. Kohli | year=2004 | pages=259 | isbn=8173871353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses began to be conducted at Parsik Hills, having had a reputation as "some of the most interesting and convenient area for rock climbing", from the 1960s to 1980s by [[Darjeeling]] [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] instructors. One of the noted instructors was [[Nawang Gombu]]. Rock climbers can complete advanced climbs in one half to one day. The area, most enjoyable in the winter or monsoon season, must be accessed by cutting through groups of illegal shanties, or [[shanty town|hutments]], that occupy the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Trek the Sahyadris (fifth edition) | publisher=Indus Publishing | author=Harish Kapadia | year=2004 | pages=15, 51 | isbn=8173871515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quarrying===
The area is losing its recreational appeal. About 9% of the top of the hill has been leveled due to [[quarry]]ing, which is contracted to continue until about 2017. Material for general and road construction is created by blasting rock from the hill. It is estimated that at the present rate of excavation, 30% of the hill will have been removed or destroyed within that time.&lt;ref name="TOI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Making of Navi Mumbai | publisher=Orient Blackswan | author=Annapurna Shaw | year=2004 | pages=119 | isbn=8125026002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegal housing===
Thousands of shanties, especially along [[Shil Phata, India|Shil Phata]] Road, have been built to shelter otherwise homeless families; Forest officials were reported in 2012 to estimate 11,000 shelters were built in the forested land. About 100 unauthorized temples have also been built on the hill. Chief Conservator of the Forests, R K Pole, stated that there are periodic campaigns to remove the shanties in accordance with high court orders, but the net result is that there is little effort, whether through "lack of administrative will and indulgence from political parties", to properly protect the forest land. Deputy Conservator of the Forests, G T Chavan said that there were plans to better police and protect the land; "We will build a 50-km-long wall. We are working towards evicting the squatters."&lt;ref name="TOI" /&gt;

The '''raising of school leaving age''' (shortened to '''ROSLA''') is the name given by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|government]] to refer to changes regarding the legal age a child is permitted to leave [[compulsory education]] in [[England and Wales]] as specified under an [[Education Act]]. As in most countries, the [[school leaving age]] often reflects when young people are seen to be mature enough within their society, but not necessarily when they are old enough to be regarded as an adult.

In England and Wales this age has been raised numerous times since the introduction of compulsory education in 1870. On 1 September 1972, the age was raised from 15 to 16, following preparations which began eight years earlier in 1964. This left a gap year of school leavers who, by law, had to complete an additional year of education from 1973 onwards. Many of the age raisings in the 19th and 20th centuries were aimed at generating more skilled labour by providing additional time for students to gain additional skills and qualifications. In recent years, government statistics showed that 11% of 16 to 18 year-olds were neither continuing their education after completion of their [[GCSE]]s, nor in full-time employment or an apprenticeship, thus increasing the overall [[unemployment]] rate given many are unable to find work.&lt;ref name=2013confirm&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6254833.stm "School leaving age set to be 18"]. BBC News. 12 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Government hoped that by making education compulsory up to the age of seventeen years by 2013 and eighteen years by 2015,&lt;ref name=bbc-n.d.&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/parents/education_after_16/ What happens after the age of 16?] BBC.co.uk, 19 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; it could change this.&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071223141431/http://www.politics.co.uk/issuebrief/education/schools/school-leaving-age/education-leaving-age-$474737.htm Education leaving age brief] Politics.co.uk, 12 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century==
[[Image:William Edward Forster - Project Gutenberg eText 13789.jpg|135px|thumb|'''William Edward Forster''' drafted the first Education Act in 1870]]
Prior to the 19th century, there were very few schools. Most of those that existed were run by the [[Church of England|church]], for the church, stressing [[religious education]]. In the latter part of the 19th Century, compulsory attendance at school ceased to be a matter for local option, with the introduction of the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] a milestone in the British school education system.&lt;ref name=genuki&gt;[http://www.genuki.org.uk:8080/big/eng/LIN/schools.html Lincolnshire School Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830043848/http://www.genuki.org.uk:8080/big/eng/LIN/schools.html |date=30 August 2008 }} Genuki.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Children had to attend between the ages of 5 and 10 though with some local discretion such as early leaving in [[Agriculture|agricultural]] areas.&lt;ref name=2013proposal1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6135516.stm School leaving age may be raised] news.bbc.co.uk, 10 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] (applying to '''England and Wales'''), commonly known as ''Forster's Education Act'' having been drawn up by [[William Edward Forster]], created the concept of '''compulsory education''' for children under thirteen, although the decision to make education compulsory was at the discretion of school boards; education was compulsory in approximately 40% of schools by 1873.&lt;ref name="edu_act_1870_compulsory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing-history.com/education-acts-of-tough-on-poor-families/|title=Education Acts 1870 1873 1876|work=Intriguing History |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where education was considered a problem, elected [[School board (England &amp; Wales)|school boards]] could be set up. These boards could, at their discretion, create local by-laws, confirmed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], to require attendance and fine the parents of children who did not attend.&lt;ref name=genuki/&gt; There were exemptions for illness, living more than a certain distance (typically one mile) from a school, or certification of having reached the required standard (which varied by board) which were made mandatory across England and Wales by the 1880 Act.

The [[Elementary Education Act 1880]] insisted on '''compulsory attendance''' from 5–10 years.&lt;ref name=genuki/&gt; For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, as it was more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an extra income was available. '''Attendance Officers''' often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children under the age of 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the ''educational standard''; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised.&lt;ref name="crucial_events_historical"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oxford-royale.co.uk/articles/crucial-events-history-english-schools.html |title=15 Crucial Events in the History of English Schools |work=Oxford Royale |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the '''Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893''', which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.&lt;ref name=crucial_events_historical/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepotteries.org/dates/education.htm Key dates in British Education (1000-1899)] ThePotteries.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
In 1900 education was made compulsory between the ages of 5 and 14, with some exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Connell |first1=William |title=The Educational Thought and Influence of Matthew Arnold |date=1950 |publisher=Routledge |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; School boards were abolished in 1902 and replaced with [[local education authority|local education authorities]], which are still in use to the present day.&lt;ref name=genuki/&gt;

===The ''Fisher Act'' of 1918===
The year 1918 saw the introduction of the [[Education Act 1918]], commonly also known as the '''Fisher Act''' as it was devised by [[H. A. L. Fisher|Herbert Fisher]]. The act enforced compulsory education from 5–14 years, but also included provision for compulsory part-time education for all 14-to-18-year-olds. There were also plans for expansion in [[tertiary education]], by raising the participation age to 18 though cuts in public spending after [[World War I]] made this impractical. This is the first act which starting planning provisions for young people to remain in education until the age of 18.&lt;ref name="education_until_18"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/nov/29/schools.uk3 |title=

===Butler's post-war education changes===
[[File:Machanhill Primary School HORSA Huts - geograph.org.uk - 1281710.jpg|right|thumb|HORSA Huts, constructed circa 1947 to handle the increased student numbers as a result of the leaving age increase]]
In 1944, [[Rab Butler]] introduced the [[Education Act 1944]] which amongst other changes, including the introduction of the [[Tripartite System]], included raising the school leaving age to 15. Although the act should have been brought into effect as from September 1939, it was not implemented because of the effects of [[World War II]], but was eventually enforced from April 1947.&lt;ref name=crucial_events_historical/&gt;&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607/&gt; The [[comprehensive school]] system has since replaced the [[Tripartite System of education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland|Tripartite System]] brought in by this act across most of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sociologytwynham.com/2008/12/21/tripartite-to-comprehensive-schools/ |title=From tripartite to comprehensive schools and the New Right |work=Sociology Twynham |date=21 December 2008 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act also recommended compulsory part-time education for all children until the age of 18, but was dropped, in  similar fashion to the 1918 Act, to cut spending after World War II.&lt;ref name=education_until_18/&gt;

====Reasons====
Changes in government approaches towards education meant that it was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when [[adolescence]] was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education.&lt;ref name="bbc_1994act_2014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schoolreport/25751787 |title=Rab Butler's 1944 act brings free secondary education for all |work=BBC News |date=17 January 2014 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.&lt;ref name=schoolreview1947&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1082674|title=Raising the School-Leaving Age in Britain|first=H. C.|last=Dent|date=1 January 1947|publisher=|journal=The School Review|volume=55|issue=9|pages=523–525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effects====
This act introduced the [[Eleven plus exam|11+ examination]] to determine if a child should be eligible for a [[Grammar schools in the United Kingdom|grammar school]], [[secondary modern]] or technical college, under the [[Tripartite System]],&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607/&gt; but has since been phased out across the majority of the United Kingdom, with just several boroughs in England&lt;ref name="11+_explained"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.relocatemagazine.com/articles/grammar-school-and-the-11plus-explained |title=Grammar school and the 11+ explained |work=Relocate Global |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Northern Ireland]]&lt;ref name="scotland_11+_phasedout"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13073520.11__exam__put_people_off_study_/ |title=11+ exam 'put people off study' |work=The Herald Scotland |date=18 September 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; still using it. League tables published in March 2007 showed grammar schools throughout the country were outperforming comprehensive schools;&lt;ref name=telegraph-020307&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1544211/Grammars-still-dominate-league-tables.html |title=Grammars still dominate league tables |work=The Telegraph |date=2 March 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; data published ten years later in 2017 suggested a similar clear division between student attainment in grammar schools compared to comprehensive schools.&lt;ref name="telegraph_grammar_jan17"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/01/19/secondary-school-league-tables-2017-1500-schools-failing-figures/ |title=Grammar school children excel while comprehensives fall behind, figures show |work=The Telegraph |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in society and approaches towards education, including [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]], has meant that it is now recognised that all children deserve to have the same educational opportunities without singling out those who learn at a slower rate than others, thus every child has the opportunity to gain secondary school level qualifications or similar, regardless of background or intelligence.

===Leaving age raised to 16===
In 1964, preparations began to raise the school leaving age to 16.&lt;ref name="politics_eduleaveage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/education-leaving-age |title=Education leaving age |work=politics.co.uk |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper age limit be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards.&lt;ref name=crucial_events_historical/&gt; As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw the introduction of the '''Education (Work Experience) Act''', allowing LEAs to organise [[work experience]] for the additional final year school students.&lt;ref name="education_timeline"&gt;[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/timeline.html Education in England - Timeline] educationengland.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; In some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of [[Middle Schools in England|middle school]]s in 1968,&lt;ref name="education_timeline"/&gt; where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the number of students in secondary schools within these areas remained virtually constant through the change.&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607/&gt; In others, more radical changes led to middle schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary school buildings, with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="msuk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/middleschools/ |title=Middle Schools in the UK |work=UK Middle Schools |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607 /&gt;

====ROSLA Buildings====
For many secondary schools around England and Wales in areas without a Middle School, accommodating for the new 5th year students would be a struggle. A popular solution was to provide those schools with a [[pre-fabricated]] building (often referred to as ''ROSLA Buildings'' or ''ROSLA Blocks'') that were in need of additional capacity,&lt;ref name="politicsbrief-120607"/&gt; providing them with the resources to cope with the new [[generation]] of 5th year students. This solution proved popular with many schools across the country, not least due to the low cost involved for materials and construction, but also the speed which these buildings could be erected.  Many were supplied by [[F. Pratten and Co Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-320000-135000/page/3|title=Spaxton V.C.Primary School.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getschool.php?id=1030|title=Wiltshire Community History|work=Wiltshire Council|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationandtraining.org.uk/schools/school/pratten-hut-st-dunstan-school/|title=Pratten Hut – St Dunstan School, Calne, Wiltshire - UK Schools|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmyschool.co.uk/schooldetails.aspx?id=79918|title=School website for The Rainbow Pre-School Learning Centre Warminster with Ofsted inspection report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ROSLA Buildings were delivered to schools in [[self assembly]] packs, being assembled by a team often within days, regardless of weather conditions.  Consequently, they were not intended to stand long-term, though some have proven to have stood much longer than was initially planned.&lt;ref name="politicsbrief-120607"/&gt; Many ROSLA Buildings shared similar exterior attributes such as their design, with the only difference being the separation of rooms within the building. The room separation within the building was decided upon by senior school management, hence many walls are false from being added in after construction.

Although the majority of schools around England and Wales have since replaced the ROSLA Building at their site, there are still numerous schools around the country which are still actively using these buildings.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Education Act 1996===
Between 1976 and 1997, the minimum school leaving arrangements were:
* A child whose sixteenth birthday falls in the period 1 September to 31 January inclusive, may leave compulsory schooling at the end of the Spring term (the following [[Easter]]).
* A child whose sixteenth birthday falls in the period 1 February to 31 August, may leave on the Friday before the last Monday in May.

Under the Education Act 1996, a new single school leaving date was set for 1998 and all subsequent years thereafter. This was set as the last Friday in June in the school year which the child reaches the age of 16.&lt;ref name="school_attendance_nov16"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/564599/school_attendance.pdf |title=Guidance for maintained schools, academies, independent schools and local authorities |publisher=Gov.uk |date=November 2016 |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
===Education and Skills Act 2008===
[[Image:Employment graph 16-18.png|thumb|right|260px| Graph showing the percentage of young people in employment or training, at ages 16 and 18 respectively.&lt;ref name=economistref1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/8559710 | work=The Economist | title=Staying on - The best days of their lives will soon drag on a bit longer | date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Reports published in November 2006 suggested that [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Education Secretary]] [[Alan Johnson]] was exploring ways to raise the school leaving age in '''England''' to 18, just over 40 years later than the last rise in 1972, pointing to the decline in unskilled jobs and the need for young people to be equipped for modern day employment.&lt;ref name=politicsbrief-120607/&gt;

====Participation Age====
A year later, on 6 November 2007, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] unveiled the government's plans in his [[Queen's Speech]]. The plans included the duty for parents to assist their children in education or training participation until the date of their 18th birthday, as well as detailing proposed moves to reform the apprenticeship system and to improve achievement for children in care. The [[Education and Skills Act 2008]], when it came into force in the 2013 academic year, initially required participation in some form of education or training until the school year in which the child turned 17, followed by the age being raised to the young person's 18th birthday in 2015.&lt;ref name="rpa_timeline"&gt;[http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/r/rpa%20timeline.pdf Raising the Participation Age - Timeline] HMSO, 24 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This was referred to as raising the "participation age"&lt;ref name="rpa_myth_buster"&gt;[http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/r/130729%20mythbuster.pdf Participation Age Myth Buster] HMSO, 29 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from the school leaving age which remains at 16.&lt;ref name="know-when-you-can-leave-school"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school School leaving age] HMSO, 19 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify as participation the young person must be in education or training for the equivalent of one day a week (at a minimum). The local council is responsible for ensuring that a suitable place is available.&lt;ref name="rpa_myth_buster" /&gt; The Act makes similar powers available to the National Assembly for Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Assembly indicated that it would want to encourage more young people to stay in education, but without compulsion,&lt;ref name="2013plans_unveiled"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7080699.stm School leaving age plans unveiled] BBC News, 6 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; so school leavers there are not required to continue with any education or training.&lt;ref name="know-when-you-can-leave-school" /&gt;

====Reasons====
Figures were published in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% of young people who may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in [[sixth form]], [[college]] or work based training.&lt;ref name=2013proposal1/&gt;&lt;ref name=2013proposal2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/nov/10/schools.uk |title=Brown backs idea of raising school-leaving age |work=The Guardian |date=10 November 2006 |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around 80% of 16-year-olds stay in full-time academic or vocational education, or go on a government-financed training course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sponsored by |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8559710?story_id=8559710 |title=School-leaving age: Staying on |publisher=The Economist |date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of 859 people, 9/10 supported the plans for the age increase.&lt;ref name=crimeprevention_guardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1544799/Education-until-18-will-prevent-life-of-crime.html |title=Education until 18 will prevent life of crime |work=The Telegraph |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NEET graph.png|thumb|left|250px| Proportion of 16-18 year olds in Education &amp; training, employment and [[NEET]].&lt;ref name=neet-oct06&gt;http://readingroom.lsc.gov.uk/lsc/National/45_-_2006_NEET.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Reports published by the DfES showed that although there are around 70% of 16 year olds who remain in full-time education, this declines to less than 50% by the time they reach 18, with the majority finding unskilled employment and even fewer going into employment where their training has relevance. There is also a small increase in those who become unemployed by the time they reach 18, which the government hoped to reduce with the act.&lt;ref name=economistref1/&gt; It is these cases of unemployment which the government believes to be the toughest, whom it classifies as [[NEET]] ('''N'''ot in '''E'''ducation, '''E'''mployment or '''T'''raining). In 2006 an additional 7% of 16 year olds fell into this category and the proportion rose to 13% among 18 year olds.&lt;ref name=economistref1/&gt;  In practice, only 1% of young people are classified as NEET during their time aged 16–18, due to [[Churn rate|churn]] between training, employment and NEET classification.&lt;ref name=neet-oct06/&gt; In 2015 the percentage of 16-18 classified as NEET fell to 7.5%, the lowest figure since 2000.&lt;ref name=2015-figures&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/454401/Quarterly_Brief_NEET_Q2_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The government believed that the changes were needed because of the collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school leavers at 16 years of age are finding it increasingly more difficult to find [[employment]]. The number of unskilled jobs available fell from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to the increasing demand for skilled labour.

====Opposition====
Whilst the government is eager to implement the changes, many oppose the proposal,&lt;ref name=rosla18truancy&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-508001/Plan-raise-school-leaving-age-18-leave-thousands-worthless-qualifications.html |title=Plan to raise school leaving age to 18 'will leave thousands with worthless qualifications' |work=Daily Mail |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; some on civil liberties grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/minette_marrin/article1564029.ece Sentenced to rot in their failed schools] Sunday Times, 25 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory school attendance is usually justified by reference to the argument that [[Minor (law)|minors]] are incapable of making sufficiently reasoned choices. However, the 16-18 age group falls into a grey area, being regarded as effectively adult in a number of contexts. Indeed, in some jurisdictions (e.g. [[Scots law|Scotland]]), individuals are considered to reach full maturity at 16.

The proposal of using [[Criminal justice|criminal sanctions]] to enforce attendance under this new system was opposed by MPs from both the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who believed compulsion and threats were the wrong approach to increasing participation.&lt;ref name=education_until_18/&gt; A spokesperson for the [[DfES]] said the proposals were not about "forcing young people to do something they don't want to", and that "we are letting young people down if we allow them to leave education and training without skills at the age of 16."&lt;ref name=2013opposition1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6740701.stm Staying on 'must not be forced'] news.bbc.co.uk, 11 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Prime Minister's [[Queen's Speech]] in November 2007, which discussed the raise in school leaving age, suggested that pupils who failed to comply with new laws are to be expected to face [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s or [[community service]], rather than [[prison|custodial sentencing]] which had previously been proposed. Local Authorities will also be expected to ensure pupils are participating up to 18 years of age.&lt;ref name="2013plans_unveiled"/&gt;

====Effects====
The downward trend in the number of unskilled jobs available throughout the country is continuing. The government believes that the extension of compulsory education until the age of 18 will mean many more young people will leave education in a much better position to find [[Skilled worker|skilled employment]]. Speaking in March 2007, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]] stated that around 50,000 teenagers would be paid a [[Education Maintenance Allowance|training allowance]] to sign up to college-based courses, with estimates on the available number of [[apprenticeship]]s available to double to around 500,000 by 2020,&lt;ref name=apprenticeships&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1546322/School-leaving-age-will-be-raised-to-18.html |title=School leaving age will be raised to 18 |work=Telegraph.co.uk |date=23 March 2007 |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 80% being available in England, which will be an increase from the current 250,000 apprenticeships available, offered by 130,000 employers.&lt;ref name="2013plans_unveiled"/&gt;

A skills commission report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP [[Barry Sheerman]], suggests that young people were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/barry-sheerman-backs-skills-commission-6356061 |title=Barry Sheerman backs Skills Commission report that says young people are being let down the education system |work=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner |date=1 November 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government were hopeful that the changes would have an effect on preventing the increase in [[Crime prevention|crime levels]], as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of skills and qualifications.&lt;ref name=crimeprevention_guardian/&gt;

'''''Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War''''', 418 U.S. 208 (1974), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] which ruled that citizens do not have the right to challenge the constitutionality of [[members of Congress]] holding reserve commissions in the armed forces.

==Background==

Article I, Section 6, clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the [[Ineligibility Clause]], states that "no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office." The Reservists Committee and several of its members brought suit to challenge the legality of members of Congress holding [[Commissioned officer|officer's commission]]s in the [[Reserve components of the United States armed forces|reserve components]] of the armed forces. The Committee alleged that such officers might be subject to undue influence by the executive and might not faithfully execute their legislative duties. 

The district court found [[Standing (law)|standing to sue]], holding that the hypothetical injury at issue was exactly the type of harm that the constitutional provision at issue was designed to address. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] affirmed.

==Decision==

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court, in an opinion by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren E. Burger]], held that standing to sue may not be predicated upon an interest held in common by all members of the public. Rather, a concrete injury, whether actual or threatened, is necessary. The Court specifically rejected the idea - first embraced by the district court - that the lack of an alternative plaintiff could justify relaxation of the standing requirement. The Court stated: "The assumption that if respondents have no standing to sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to find standing."

In [[United States antitrust law]], a '''second request''' is a [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] procedure by which the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] investigate [[mergers and acquisitions]] which may have [[Competition (economics)|anticompetitive]] consequences.

==Legal basis==
Under the [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act]], before certain [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], [[tender offer]]s or other acquisition transactions can close, both parties to the deal must file a "Notification and Report Form" with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) and the [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] in charge of the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]].

If either the FTC or the Antitrust Division has reason to believe the merger will impede competition in a [[relevant market]], they may request more information by way of '''"Request for Additional Information and Documentary Materials"''', more commonly referred to as a "Second Request".

==Substance of request==
A typical second request asks to gather information about the sales, facilities, assets, and structure of the businesses which are party to the transaction.&lt;ref name=Modelrequest&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/merger-review/guide3.pdf Model Request for Additional Information and Documentary Materials]&lt;/ref&gt;  This frequently requires a large number of documents to be produced, and [[law firm]]s representing parties to a transaction in which a second request has been issued often must hire [[contract attorney]]s to [[Document review|review all the documents involved]].

Parties to a transaction who feel that the second request is unnecessary or needlessly duplicative of information discovered earlier may appeal to either the FTC or the Antitrust Division (whichever agency issued the request).&lt;ref name=Modelrequest/&gt;

'''Section 171 of the Criminal Code of Cyprus''' was a section of the [[Cyprus]] Criminal Code, which was enacted in 1929, that criminalized [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts between consenting male adults. Until 1998, the section read:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any person who (a) has [[carnal knowledge]] of any person against the order of nature, or (b) permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him against the order of nature is guilty of a [[felony]] and is liable to '''imprisonment for five years'''".&lt;ref name="Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom"&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom |pinpoint = 45 |court = [[European Court of Human Rights]] |date=1981-10-22 |url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=695350&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Court challenge==
Section 171 did not apply to women and did not criminalize [[lesbian]] sex. Although rarely enforced, it was challenged in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] by a Cypriot man named Alecos Modinos. The Court handed down its judgment in ''[[Modinos v. Cyprus]]'' on April 22, 1993, and overwhelmingly ruled by eight votes to one that Section 171 violated [[European convention on human rights#Article 8 - right to respect for private life|Article 8]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which protected people's right to privacy. The judgment followed the opinion reached by the Court in two other similar cases: ''[[Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom]]'' (1981) and ''[[Norris v. Ireland]]'' (1988). Ironically, Section 171 had been cited by [[Turkish Cypriot]] Judge [[Mehmet Zeka]] in his dissenting opinion in the ''Dudgeon'' case to oppose the Court's invalidation of [[Northern Ireland]]'s anti-[[buggery]] laws. Judge Zeka had argued that, as a Cypriot, he was in a "better position in forecasting the public outcry and the turmoil which would ensue if such laws are repealed or amended in favour of homosexuals either in Cyprus or in Northern Ireland. Both countries are religious-minded and adhere to moral standards which are centuries' old".&lt;ref name="Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom"/&gt;

==Opposition to repeal==
Nonetheless, it was only five years after ''Modinos v. Cyprus'' was decided that the anti-sodomy provisions of Section 171 were effectively repealed. The slowness of the reform was due to the deep divisions created by such a morally charged issue. The repeal of Section 171 was openly supported by the liberal [[United Democrats]], and openly opposed by the center-right [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]]. Former [[President of Cyprus|President]] [[George Vassiliou]] came out in support of the repeal, as did Foreign Minister [[Ioannis Kasoulides]], who argued that Cyprus "cannot ask Turkey to comply with the decisions of the Council [of Europe] regarding human rights violations [while] at the same time [refusing] to conform to such decisions."&lt;ref name="Cyprus Can't Have It Both Ways"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cyprus Can't Have It Both Ways |publisher=[[PlanetOut]] |date=1997-05-16 |url=http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?1997/05/16/2 |accessdate=2008-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031104053452/http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?1997%2F05%2F16%2F2 |archivedate=November 4, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Judge Zeka had predicted 17 years earlier, the proposed repeal of Section 171 sparked a huge public backlash. Nearly a thousand people protested outside the [[House of Representatives of Cyprus|House of Representatives]] in [[Nicosia]] on May 15, 1997. Known as the Committee for the Fight Against the Decriminalization of Homosexuality, the protest was led by [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]] priests, monks and nuns, and featured signs reading "No to [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] in Cyprus" and "Cyprus is the island of [[saint]]s, not homosexuals."&lt;ref name="Cyprus Can't Have It Both Ways"/&gt; [[Archbishop Chrysostomos I]] actively campaigned against the repeal of Section 171, and the [[Pancyprian Christian Orthodox Movement]] collected 40,000 signatures (representing nearly 5% of the island's total population) on a petition opposing the reform, and even went as far as promising to compile a "blacklist" of all MPs voting for the repeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cyprus Repeals Sodomy Law |publisher=[[PlanetOut]] |date=1998-05-21 |url=http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?1998/05/21/1 |accessdate=2008-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030712083343/http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?1998%2F05%2F21%2F1 |archivedate=July 12, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repeal==
The [[Council of Europe]] made repeated warnings to Cyprus that it could face expulsion or other political sanctions if it delayed any further in complying with the Court's decision in ''Modinos v. Cyprus''. As a result, the bill decriminalizing private homosexual acts between consenting adults was passed by the House of Representatives on May 21, 1998, just eight days prior to the May 29 deadline set by the Council. It was passed with 11 of the House's 56 members intentionally absent. 36 MPs voted for the bill, eight voted against it, and one MP chose to abstain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Homosexuality decriminalised |publisher=[[Cyprus News Agency]] |date=1998-05-21 |url=http://www.hellenic.org/news/cyprus/cna/1998/98-05-21_1.cna.html#07 |accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Posen''' ({{lang-de|[[Provinziallandtag]] des Großherzogthums Posen}}, {{lang-pl|Sejm Wielkiego Księstwa Poznańskiego}}) was the [[parliament]] in the 19th century [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] and the [[Province of Posen]], seated in [[Poznań|Poznań/Posen]]. It existed from 1823 to 1918. In the history of the Polish parliament, it succeeded the [[general sejm]] and local [[sejmik]] on part of the territories of the [[Prussian partition]]. Originally retaining a Polish character, it acquired a more [[Germany|German]] character in the second half of the 19th century.

==History==
The province of [[Greater Poland]] was acquired by [[Kingdom of Prussia]] following the [[Congress of Vienna]], when it was detached from the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and [[Prussian partition|given to Prussia]], where it became reorganized as the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-230"/&gt; The [[King of Prussia]] gave the Grand Duchy the right to call a [[parliament]] in 1823, with specific decrees defining its competences in 1826.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-230"/&gt; The parliament carried the traditions of the [[sejmik|General Sejmik]] of Greater Poland, and insisted on using the Polish word ''sejm'' in its name.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-233"/&gt; The Sejm met for the first time on 24 December 1827.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-230"/&gt; The second sejm session begun on 30 January 1830.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-233"/&gt;

Following the suppression of the [[Sejm of the Congress Poland]] in the aftermath of the [[November Uprising]], the Sejm of the Grand Duchy was the last vestige of the Polish parliamentary tradition on Polish soil.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-233"/&gt; Only Christian men owning landed property for at least ten years were enfranchised to vote.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski 2009"&gt;Jerzy Kozłowski, [http://www.polen-didaktik.de/Fachaufsaetze/Polenfacetten/Grossherzogtum_posen.htm „Die Einführung der preußischen Verwaltung im Großherzogtum Posen 1815-1830“] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130217071358/http://www.polen-didaktik.de/Fachaufsaetze/Polenfacetten/Grossherzogtum_posen.htm |date=2013-02-17 }} (2009), on: [http://www.polen-didaktik.de ''Polen Didaktik: Wissenschaft und Praxis''], retrieved on 4 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1869 Jews generally remained excluded, unlike in Prussia proper.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski 2009"/&gt;

So immigrants who had newly acquired land were not enfranchised; neither were most of the rural ethnically Polish farmers, who still held land by way of lease or feudal fief only like serfs or vassals of their landlords, unlike Prussia proper where serfdom had been abolished in 1807 and 1810.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski 2009"/&gt; Immigrant farmers from the Holy Roman Empire (such as the [[Bambrzy]]) or later from member states of the German Confederation, had usually remained free peasants, causing their stronger representation within the eight members elected by peasants, of a total of 48. With regard to ethnicity, most of the nobility representatives were Polish, peasantry representatives were balanced, and the townsfolk representatives were mostly German.&lt;ref name=pozn/&gt; The first sejm included 22 Poles and 26 Germans, and most of the subsequent elections produced an almost even split between the Poles and the Germans.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-230"/&gt; A major issue of the Sejm was the [[Abolition of serfdom in Poland|abolition of serfdom]],&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-231"/&gt; which would enlarge the number of Polish speaking landowners and after ten years allow their participation in Sejm elections.

The Grand Duchy's population was 65% Polish but with its exclusion of serfs and underrepresentation of landless rural commoners the electoral law was designed to favor the German inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-230"/&gt; The proportion of Polish representatives diminished further after the events of 1848, and [[Jacek Jędruch]] notes that due to growing discrimination against Polish representatives that date marks the end of the period in which this legislative body can be seen as continuing the Polish parliamentary tradition.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-235"/&gt; Also, while the proceedings of the first sejms were published in Polish, since 1877 they were published in German.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-235"/&gt;

The political factions of the sejm were divided between liberals, supporting the German constitutional movement, and conservatives, like [[Edward Raczyński (1786–1845)|Edward Raczyński]], who predicted that this movement would abolish the Grand Duchy's autonomy.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-234"/&gt; During the two or so decades of its existence, the major issues of concern of the Sejm were the abolition of serfdom and relations between the inhabitants of Polish and German ethnicity, particularly the discrimination against the Poles by the Prussian government, which increasingly excluded the Polish majority from administration and judiciary.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-231"/&gt; The last petition issued by the Sejm in 1841 demanded equal rights for the Poles and stopping of the [[Germanization]] campaign.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-233"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-234"/&gt; As most of the Sejm petitions were simply ignored by the King of Prussia, this contributed to dissent in the province, which eventually resulted in [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|an uprising in 1848]] in the midst of the [[revolutions of 1848 in the German states]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-234"/&gt; The Sejm met the total of seven times before the revolutions of 1848 (in 1827, 1830, 1834, 1837, 1841, 1843 and 1845).&lt;ref name=pozn/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-430"/&gt; Following the revolutions, the Sejm of the Grand Duchy, like other provincial Prussian assemblies, gained the right to elect deputies to the [[Prussian Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-235"/&gt; The Sejm continued its sessions till 1918, with a total of 49 Sejms being held.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-235"/&gt;

In the [[aftermath of World War I]], popular protests against the electoral law discriminating against Poles led to new elections in 1918, in which 521 deputies were elected in the Grand Duchy; that Sejm would support the integration of the Grand Duchy territories to the newly formed [[Second Polish Republic]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-236"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-237"/&gt;

==Composition==
The sejm was [[unicameral]].&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-238"/&gt; Only Christian men subject to no other monarch but the king in [[personal union]] the grand duke and of at least 30 years of age were enfranchised to vote.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pozn/&gt; For the nobility deputies, initially two, later four deputies held their seats due to privileges tied with other aristocratic status (heads of Grand Duchy [[magnate]] families), the rest were elected by landholders.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-230"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pozn/&gt; 

The sejm had 48 deputies. The representatives were grouped into three [[Bench (metonymy)|benches]], with 24 men to represent the landed nobility (nobles not holding a feudal fief manor were excluded, if they owned private land or urban real estate, they would qualify for the election of one of the two other benches), 16 being elected by the cities' burghers, if they owned real estate, and eight by landed free peasants.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pozn/&gt; Similarly, certain levels of wealth were required for election of the peasantry representatives. 

Deputies term of office was set for 6 years, with elections for the half of the deputies held every three years.&lt;ref name=pozn/&gt; For the first renewal election the to-be-replaced or reelected members had been chosen by lot.&lt;ref name="Kozłowski 2009"/&gt; The Sejm was to meet every two years, but in reality the gatherings happened less often, between every two and three years.&lt;ref name=pozn/&gt; Sessions lasted two months.&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-238"/&gt;

===Marshals of the Sejm===
One of the noble representatives held the position of the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] (speaker; {{lang-de|Landtags-Marschall}}).&lt;ref name=pozn/&gt; Marshals of the Sejm of the Grand Duchy included [[Antoni Paweł Sułkowski]]&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982-230"/&gt; (the speaker of the first sejm) and {{ill|Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst|de}}, marshall as of 1874, further [[Rudolf Hiller von Gaertringen (1801–1866)]], {{ill|Stephan von Dziembowski-Bomst|de}}, {{ill|Józef Ignacy Grabowski|lt=Józef Ignacy Grabowski Goetzendorf|pl}}, {{ill|Stanisław Poniński|pl}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1276">In '''''Smith v Parsons''''', an important case in [[South African succession law]], Smith was the partner of the deceased who sought an order to accept the deceased’s [[suicide]] note as an amendment to the deceased's [[will and testament|will]].

The deceased had validly executed a will in 2003 making his son, Jeremy, his sole [[heir]]. The [[suicide note]] said that Smith could have the house they had lived in; that she had access to a [[bank account]] holding about R600,000; and that the residue of his [[estate (law)|estate]] was to go to his son. The question before the court was whether the suicide note could constitute a [[codicil (will)|codicil]] (amendment). The court held that the crucial question was whether the deceased intended the suicide note to be a codicil. It was held that the deceased’s intention was for the document to be a suicide note and not an amendment to his will, as the onus of proving an express intention to amend was not met.

The '''Soviet–Finnish Non-Aggression Pact'''  was a [[Non-aggression pact|non-aggression treaty]] signed in 1932 by representatives of [[Finland]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The pact was unilaterally renounced by the Soviet Union in 1939, after it had committed the deception operation [[Shelling of Mainila]], where it shelled its own village and claimed Finland to be responsible.

The Soviet Union had started non-aggression pact negotiations with its neighbouring countries in Europe during the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Invasion of Manchuria]], due to which the Soviet Union wanted to secure its borders.  Although Finland was the last to sign the pact on January 21, 1932, after [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Poland]], it was the first to ratify it in July 1932. Both parties guaranteed to respect the borders between the countries, and agreed to stay neutral. Disputes were promised to be solved peacefully and neutrally.

The pact was extended to December 31, 1945 in [[Moscow]] on April 7, 1934. It was signed by the Finnish foreign minister Aarno Yrjö-Koskinen and the Soviet foreign minister [[Maxim Litvinov]].

The pact was renounced by the Soviet Union on 28 November 1939, two days before its [[Winter War|invasion of Finland]], claiming Finland had shelled a Soviet village. According to the Article Five,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histdoc.net/history/nonagen1.html Treaty of Non-Aggression and Pacific Settlement of Disputes between the Soviet Union and Finland, concluded on January 21, 1932] (translation)&lt;/ref&gt; parties should have called for a joint commission to examine the incident, which Finland tried to call but the Soviet Union refused.

'''Substantial similarity''', in [[US copyright law]], is the standard used to determine whether a defendant has infringed the reproduction right of a copyright. The standard arises out of the recognition that the exclusive right to make copies of a work would be meaningless if [[copyright infringement]] were limited to making only exact and complete reproductions of a work.&lt;ref name="Patry"&gt;{{cite book |last= Patry |first= William |authorlink= William Patry |title= Patry on Copyright |url=http://store.westlaw.com/patry-on-copyright/139343/40449295/productdetail? |edition=September 2009 |volume= 3|publisher= Thomson West|section= §9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2011}} Many courts also use "substantial similarity" in place of "probative" or "striking similarity" to describe the level of similarity necessary to prove that copying has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, Howard B. ''2 Law of Copyright §14:5''&lt;/ref&gt; A number of tests have been devised by courts to determine substantial similarity. They may rely on expert or lay observation or both and may subjectively judge the feel of a work or critically analyze its elements.

==Substantial similarity in copyright infringement==
{{See also|Copyright infringement}}
To win a claim of copyright infringement in civil or criminal court, a plaintiff must show he or she '''owns a valid copyright''', the defendant '''actually copied''' the work, and the level of copying amounts to [[misappropriation]].&lt;ref name="Patry" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite book | last = McCarthy | first = J. Thomas |author2=Roger E. Schecter |author3=David J. Franklyn  | title = McCarthy's Desk Encyclopedia of Intellectual Property | edition = 3 | publisher = BNA Books | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-57018-401-1 | pages = 576–577}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the doctrine of substantial similarity, a work can be found to infringe copyright even if the wording of text has been changed or visual or audible elements are altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Substantial similarity in copyright law | first = Eric C. | last = Osterberg | publisher = Practising Law Institute | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-4024-0341-0 | page = §1:1, 1–2 | quote =With respect to the copying of individual elements, a defendant need not copy the entirety of the plaintiff's copyrighted work to infringe, and he need not copy verbatim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion arises because some courts use "substantial similarity" in two different contexts during a copyright infringement case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Latman | first = Alan | title = "Probative Similarity" as proof of copying: toward dispelling some myths in copyright infringement | journal = [[Columbia Law Review]] | volume = 90 | issue = 5 |date=June 1990 | pages = 1187–1214 | doi = 10.2307/1122876 | publisher = Columbia Law Review Association, Inc. | ref = harv | jstor = 1122876}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first context, it refers to that level of similarity sufficient to prove that copying has occurred, once access has been demonstrated. In the second context, it is used after it has been shown that a defendant had copied to determine if what had been copied is legally actionable or amounts to misappropriation. Some courts use "striking" or "probative" instead of "substantial" to describe the level of similarity needed in the first context to avoid confusion.&lt;ref name="Patry" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2011}} The second meaning, which Justice [[Jon O. Newman]] referred to in 1997 as the more proper use, defines "the threshold for determining that the degree of similarity suffices to demonstrate actionable infringement" exists, "after the fact of copying has been established." &lt;ref&gt;''Ringgold v. Black Entertainment Television, Inc.'' ([http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/126/70/497885/ 126 F.3d 70] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2nd Cir.]], 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Striking similarity===

Direct evidence of actual copying by a defendant rarely exists, so plaintiffs must often resort to indirectly proving copying.&lt;ref name="Patry" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2011}} Typically, this is done by first showing that the defendant had access to the plaintiff's work and that the degree of similarity between the two works is so striking or substantial that the similarity could only have been caused by copying, and not, for example, through "coincidence, independent creation, or a prior common source".&lt;ref&gt;''Midway Mfg. Co. v. Dirkschneider'', 543 F. Supp. 466, 482 n.10, 214 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 417 (D. Neb. 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Some courts also use "probative similarity" to describe this standard. This inquiry is a question of fact determined by a [[jury]].

Courts have relied on several factors to aid in a striking similarity analysis. Among these are:
#Uniqueness, intricacy, or complexity of the similar sections.
#If the plaintiff's work contains an unexpected or idiosyncratic element that is repeated in the alleged infringing work.
#The appearance of the same errors or mistakes in both works.
#[[Fictitious entry|Fictitious entries]] placed by the plaintiff that appear in the defendant's work. For example, fake names or places are often inserted in factual works like maps or directories to serve as proof of copying in a later infringement case since their appearance in a defendant's work cannot be explained away by innocent causes.
#Obvious or crude attempts to give the appearance of dissimilarity.&lt;ref name="Patry" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}

Generally, copying cannot be proven without some evidence of access; however, in the seminal case on striking similarity, ''[[Arnstein v. Porter]]'', the [[Second Circuit]] stated that even absent a finding of access, copying can be established when the similarities between two works are "so striking as to preclude the possibility that the plaintiff and defendant independently arrived at the same result."&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/154/464/1478575/ ''Arnstein v. Porter'', 154 F.2d 464 (2nd Circuit 1946)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misappropriation===

Substantial similarity is the term used by all courts to describe, once copying has been established, the threshold where that copying wrongfully appropriates the plaintiff's protected expression. It is found when similarity between the copyrightable elements of two works rises above the ''[[de minimis]]'' exception, reaching a threshold that is "substantial" both qualitatively and quantitatively.&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Law and business of the entertainment industries | first = Donald E. | last = Biederman |author2=Edward P. Pierson |author3=Martin E. Silfen |author4=Janna Glasser  |edition = 5 | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-275-99205-5 | page = 688}}&lt;/ref&gt; While actionable infringement is more likely to be found where greater levels of similarity exist, substantial similarity has also been found where the portion copied was small but constituted the "heart" of the work.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises]]'', 471 U.S. 539, 105 S. Ct. 2218, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stim220"&gt;{{harvnb|Stim|2007|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In determining whether use is substantial, courts look not only at the proportion of duplication in comparison to the relative size of the works, but also to such considerations as the creativity of the copied material, its use in both works and its centrality to either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Who speaks Latin anymore? Translating de minimis use for application to music copyright infringement and sampling. | first = David S. | last = Blessing | work = William and Mary Law Review | date = 2004-04-01 | accessdate = 2009-04-06 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118495887.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.cinahl.com/library/cinahlnews/Cnews173.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319065246/http://www.cinahl.com/library/cinahlnews/Cnews173.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-19 | title = Tweedledum and Tweedledee: Plagiarism and copyright | last = Levy | first = Neil A. | journal= CINAHL Information Systems | date = Fall–Winter 1998 | volume = 17 | issue = 3/4 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only when a work rises to a level of "substantial similarity" does it infringe to the point of being legally actionable.&lt;ref&gt;Osterberg, §1:1, 1-1.&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no clear line on how much duplication is necessary to reach "substantial similarity", the question is determined on a case-by-case evaluation.&lt;ref name="Merryman457"&gt;{{harvnb|Merryman|Elsen|Urice|2002|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; A showing that features of the two works are ''not'' similar does not bar a finding of substantial similarity, if such similarity as does exist clears the ''de minimis'' threshold.&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt;

The substantial similarity standard is used for all kinds of copyrighted subject matter: books, photographs, plays, music, software, etc. It may also cross disciplines, as in ''[[Rogers v. Koons]]'', where a sculptor was found to have infringed on a photograph.&lt;ref name="Patry" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}

Substantial similarity is a question of fact that is decided by a [[jury]].&lt;ref name="Patry" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2011}} In situations where "reasonable minds could not differ" in the opinion that substantial similarity of expression does not exist, a court may make [[summary judgment]] for the defendant, closing a case without finding infringement.&lt;ref name=LvS&gt;''Litchfield v. Spielberg'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20080905102441/http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/448237 736 F.2d 1352] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Cir.]], 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Since "substantial similarity" can require careful evaluation, however, infringement cases usually lead to full inquiry with appropriate tests developed by the courts.&lt;ref name=LvS/&gt;

==Tests==

A number of tests have been devised to determine substantial similarity. These may rely one or both of expert or lay observation and may subjectively judge the feel of a work or critically analyze its elements.

Noted copyright authority [[Melville Nimmer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/guides/copyright.cfm |title=Georgetown Law Library: Copyright Law Research Guide |date=May 2007 |publisher=Georgetown University Law Library |quote=''Nimmer on Copyright'' is a 10-volume treatise that is considered the leading secondary source on American copyright law. |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes two different tests for substantial similarity, "fragmented literal similarity" and "comprehensive non-literal similarity", which have been widely adopted and utilized by U.S. courts.&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt; Either test may result in a finding of infringement.&lt;ref&gt;''Bateman v. Mnemonics'', [http://www.law.emory.edu/11circuit/dec95/93-3234.man.html 79 F.3d 1532] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|11th Cir.]], 1995.) " {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204130954/http://www.law.emory.edu/11circuit/dec95/93-3234.man.html |date=December 4, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragmented literal similarity occurs when fragmented copyrightable elements are copied from a protected work in a manner not allowed by [[fair use]]. It is more limited than comprehensive copying, involving briefer elements such as a stanza of a song or an image.&lt;ref name="Albert233" /&gt; Comprehensive non-literal similarity may occur even in the absence of verbatim duplication of copyrighted elements when, in the words of [[J. Thomas McCarthy]]'s ''McCarthy's Desk Encyclopedia of Intellectual Property'', one work appropriates "the fundamental structure or pattern" of another.&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt; Justice [[John M. Walker, Jr.]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] noted in ''Arica v. Palmer'' that a court may find copyright infringement under the doctrine of "comprehensive non-literal similarity" if "the pattern or sequence of the two works is similar".&lt;ref&gt;''Arica v. Palmer'', [http://floridalawfirm.com/arica.html 970 F.2d 106  ] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir.]], 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

The various other tests devised to determine substantial similarity can essentially be broken down into two categories: those that rely on the impressions of ordinary observers and those that rely on "dissection" by experts.&lt;ref name="Keller11-31"&gt;{{harvnb|Keller|Cunard|2001|loc=§11–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tests combine elements of both.&lt;ref name="Keller11-34"&gt;{{harvnb|Keller|Cunard|2001|loc=§11–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary observer tests rely on the subjective response that an ordinary person forms on comparing two works as to whether substantial similarity exists. These have been criticized as unreliable in that ordinary observers may not have enough familiarity with copyright concepts to recognize those elements not copyrightable, such as idea, and might also not recognize where superficial alterations fail to efface infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = ASCAP Copyright Law Symposium | author = American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers | publisher = [[Columbia University Press]] | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-231-11060-X | page = 215}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, dissection tests seek infringement only in those specific copyrightable elements within a work.&lt;ref name="Keller11-31" /&gt; The tester in these cases considers factors like the [[idea-expression divide]] and the [[scènes à faire]] doctrine.&lt;ref name="Keller11-31" /&gt;

===Total concept and feel test===
The total concept and feel test relies on the subjective evaluation of observers who consider the question of whether the total concept and feel of one work is substantially similar to another. The idea of "total concept and feel" was introduced in ''[[Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co]]'' (1970).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv
 |last=Lehman|first=Bruce A. |page=104
 |title=Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure: The Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1vERuaJxIgC&amp;pg=PA104
 |accessdate=2012-06-23|date=1995-10-01|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-7881-2415-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The test is subdivided into the "extrinsic test", wherein a complex analysis is conducted of the concepts underlying the work, and the "intrinsic test", wherein within the judgment of an ordinary person the expression of the works are compared. The differences between the two were defined in 1977 by [[United States federal judge]] [[James Marshall Carter]] in ''[[Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.]]'':&lt;ref&gt;''Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions, Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/562/562.F2d.1157.75-1202.75-1203.html 970 F.2d 106  ] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Cir.]], 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[The extrinsic test] is extrinsic because it depends not on the responses of the trier of fact, but on specific criteria that can be listed and analyzed. Such criteria include the type of artwork involved, the materials used, the subject matter, and the setting for the subject. Since it is an extrinsic test, analytic dissection and expert testimony are appropriate. Moreover, this question may often be decided as a matter of law. The determination of when there is substantial similarity between the forms of expression is necessarily more subtle and complex. As Judge Hand candidly observed, "Obviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the 'idea,' and has borrowed its 'expression.' Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc." Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487, 489 (2 Cir. 1960). If there is substantial similarity in ideas, then the trier of fact must decide whether there is substantial similarity in the expressions of the ideas so as to constitute infringement. The test to be applied in determining whether there is substantial similarity in expressions shall be labeled an intrinsic one depending on the response of the ordinary reasonable person. See International Luggage Registry v. Avery Products Corp., supra, 541 F.2d at 831; Harold Lloyd Corp. v. Witwer, 65 F.2d 1, 18–19 (9 Cir. 1933). See generally [[Nimmer on Copyright|Nimmer]] § 143.5. It is intrinsic because it does not depend on the type of external criteria and analysis that marks the extrinsic test.... Because this is an intrinsic test, analytic dissection and expert testimony are not appropriate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This test was utilized in ''BSS Studio, Inc. v. Kmart Corporation'' in 1999 in determining that a line of [[Halloween mask]]s produced by [[Kmart]] infringed in "total concept and feel" on a line of masks produced by BSS.&lt;ref name="Keller11-33"&gt;{{harvnb|Keller|Cunard|2001|loc=§11–33, 34. Cf. ''BSS Studio, Inc. v. Kmart Corporation'', 53 U.S.P.Q.2d 1509 (N.D. Ill. 1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly the intrinsic test has met criticism as extending copyright beyond the protection of expression into the protection of ideas.&lt;ref name="Albert232"&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|Laff|Whitesel|Saret|1999|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Brown Bag Software v. Symantec Corp]]'', the Ninth Circuit expanded the extrinsic test to include the analysis expression as well as ideas.&lt;ref name="Pudget"&gt;University of Puget Sound Law Review, Vol. 16, Issue 1 (Fall 1992), pp. 319-372 Bierman, Ellen M. 16 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 319 (1992-1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found that analytical dissection of expression was necessary to identify expressions for comparison in the intrinsic test.

===Pattern test===
The pattern test created by [[Columbia University]] professor [[Zechariah Chafee]] is primarily utilized to test fiction, comparing elements of plot and character between two works to see if substantial similarity exists.&lt;ref name="Albert232" /&gt; The more similarities exist between the two, the more likely the court will determine infringement.

===Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test===
{{main|Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test}}

The primary test utilized in comparing computer programs, the "abstraction-filtration-comparison test" is also called more simply the "filtration test".&lt;ref name="Albert233"&gt;{{harvnb|Albert|Laff|Whitesel|Saret|1999|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stim211"&gt;{{harvnb|Stim|2007|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test, which was devised by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] for ''[[Computer Associates International, Inc. v. Altai, Inc.]]'', compares the elements of software at increasing levels of abstraction, from machine instructions to program function, excluding those elements not copyrightable, such as those approaches dictated by efficiency or the fundamental operation of computers, to evaluate similarity.&lt;ref name="Albert233" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stim211" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2773">In {{USCFR|40|156|62}}, the [[EPA]] established four '''Toxicity Categories''' for acute hazards of [[pesticide]] products, with "Category I" being the highest toxicity category ([[toxicity class]]). Most human hazard, precautionary statements, and human [[personal protective equipment]] statements are based upon the Toxicity Category of the pesticide product as sold or distributed. In addition, toxicity categories may be used for regulatory purposes other than [[labeling]], such as classification for restricted use and requirements for [[child-resistant packaging]]. 

In certain cases, statements based upon the Toxicity Category of the product as [[:wikt:dilute|dilute]]d for use are also permitted. A Toxicity Category is assigned for each of five types of acute exposure, as specified in the table below.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Overview==

The four toxicity categories, from one to four are:

*Toxicity category I is Highly toxic and Severely irritating,
*Toxicity category II is Moderately toxic and Moderately irritating,
*Toxicity category III is Slightly toxic and Slightly irritating,
*Toxicity category IV is Practically non-toxic and not an irritant.

Arts and media [[industry trade group]]s, such as the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) and [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), strongly oppose and attempt to prevent [[copyright infringement]] through [[file sharing]]. The organizations particularly target the distribution of files via the Internet using [[peer-to-peer]] software.  Efforts by trade groups to curb such infringement have been unsuccessful with chronic, widespread and rampant infringement continuing largely unabated.

==Rationale==
{{Main|File sharing#Effects of file sharing|l1=Effects of file sharing}}

The trade groups also claim that widespread copyright infringement on the Internet hurts sales, in turn affecting the artists who depend on royalties. Various economic studies support these claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 503518|doi = 10.1086/503518|title = File Sharing: Creative Destruction or Just Plain Destruction?|journal = The Journal of Law and Economics|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 1–28|year = 2006|last1 = Liebowitz|first1 = Stan J|citeseerx = 10.1.1.320.601}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not always to the degree the trade groups report.&lt;ref name="HigherEdu"&gt;Glenn, David. Dispute Over the Economics of File Sharing Intensifies, Chronicle.com, July 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies show mixed effects,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/37406039/Thesis-Bjerkoe-Sorbo "Thesis, Bjerkøe and Sørbo"]. Norwegian School of Management. scribd.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes overall net social "welfare" benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivir.nl/publicaties/vaneijk/Ups_And_Downs_authorised_translation.pdf "Ups And Downs (authorised translation)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815095214/http://www.ivir.nl/publicaties/vaneijk/Ups_And_Downs_authorised_translation.pdf |date=2011-08-15 }}.  IVIR.nl. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions against Internet service providers==
In March 2007, [[Irish Recorded Music Association]] (IRMA) members sued [[eircom]], the largest broadband provider in Ireland, over alleged illegal file sharing by subscribers.  IRMA had previously demanded that eircom install content filters or take other steps to block IRMA's copyrighted music from being shared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0421/eircom-business.html Eircom rejects record firms' claims], [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], April 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, a group of 34 film and television studios (including [[Village Roadshow]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[Sony Pictures]], [[Disney]] and the [[Seven Network]]), represented by the [[AFACT|Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft]] (AFACT) [[AFACT v iiNet|launched action]] in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] against [[iiNet]], Australia's third-largest internet service provider. AFACT alleged that iiNet customers had breached its members' copyright by using peer-to-peer software to share and download films and television programs, and that iiNet had not acted against the alleged file-sharers despite 18 notifications of copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Foo, Fran: [http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24700723-15306,00.html Film giants pursue file sharers], ''[[The Australian]]'', 25 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Court found that this was not the case.  The case was taken on appeal to the [[High Court of Australia]] where it was dismissed unanimously, finding that iiNet "had no direct technical power" to stop users from downloading copyrighted material illegally.&lt;ref name="prb"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/piracy-ruling-blow-to-film-industry-giants-20120420-1xcri.html |title=Piracy ruling blow to film industry giants |author=Ben Grubb, Asher Moses |accessdate=23 April 2012 |date=21 April 2012 |work=Canberra Times |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions against file sharing services==

===Litigation===
{{See also|A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.|MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.}}

The RIAA first noticed that Internet sites were offering unauthorized recordings in early 1997,&lt;ref name=Billboard19970621&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Billboard|date=June 21, 1997|last=Jeffrey|first=Don|title=Downloading Songs Subject Of RIAA Suit|pages=3, 83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the organization began sending cease-and-desist letters to the operators of such sites, leading to voluntary shutdowns of some.&lt;ref name=Billboard19970621/&gt;&lt;ref name=Billboard19970517&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Billboard|date=May 17, 1997|title=Bits 'n Bytes|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pA8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RIAA_yearend&gt;[http://riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_month_filter=&amp;news_year_filter=&amp;resultpage=141&amp;id=89A95D73-257D-1CA0-3C67-623FAFBE54EF RIAA Releases Yearend Anti-Piracy Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1997, the RIAA took the recording industry's first collective legal action against online file-sharing of music, filing copyright infringement claims against the operators of three U.S.-based MP3 file-sharing sites.&lt;ref name=Billboard19970621/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20001215221500/http://www.bna.com/e-law/docs/amkutz.html A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Internet Site Known as Fresh Kutz], Case No. 97-CV-1099 H (JFS) (S.D. Cal., filed June 9, 1997, order to show cause issued June 10, 1997) (settled January 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sony Music Entertainment v. Internet Site Known as &lt;nowiki&gt;FTP://208.197.0.28/&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Civil Action No. 97 Civ. 4245 (S.D.N.Y., case filed June 12, 1997) (settled January 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MCA Records, Inc. v. Internet Site Known as &lt;nowiki&gt;FTP://Parsoft.com/MP3s&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Case No. 97-CV-1360-T (N.D. Tex., case filed June 9, 1997) (settled January 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Each case could have resulted in a [[statutory damages|statutory damage]] award of over $1 million, but all three were settled out-of-court with permanent injunctions in January 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://riaa.com/newsitem.php?content_selector=newsandviews&amp;news_month_filter=1&amp;news_year_filter=1998&amp;id=6D6A8816-9DDE-C85C-B997-8D1E70B5C8D8 Three Internet Copyright Infringement Cases Settled]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the RIAA sued the operators of two more sites, resulting in permanent injunctions and monetary damage awards against the defendants, who were also required to perform community service.&lt;ref name=RIAA_yearend/&gt;

In late 1999, RIAA labels sued [[Napster]] for providing a peer-to-peer file sharing network for MP3 files. The plaintiffs claimed that Napster "facilitate[d] [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]] of music on an unprecedented scale."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.riaa.com/news/filings/napster_faq.asp#action "Frequently Asked Questions — Napster and Digital Music"]. RIAA Website.&lt;/ref&gt; Napster became [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] during the case; and has since been taken over by [[Roxio]] and provides a download service which is sanctioned by the RIAA.

In 2002, the RIAA sued [[Aimster]], which provided a similar service.

In 2003, MPAA studios sued [[Grokster]] and other file sharing services in a case that would eventually go to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].  The court held that producers of technology could be held liable for intent to induce infringement.

In 2006, RIAA labels sued the developers of [[LimeWire]], a client for the [[Gnutella]] file sharing network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandoval|first=Greg|title=RIAA Wins Big in LimeWire Lawsuit|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20004811-261.html|accessdate=17 Apr 2012|newspaper=CNET|date=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support of police actions===
{{See also|The Pirate Bay raid}}

In a controversial May 2006 raid, [[Swedish National Bureau of Investigation]] and local police seized the servers of [[BitTorrent tracker]] [[The Pirate Bay]], causing a three-day outage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Technology/Swedish-police-shut-down-major-piracy-site/2006/06/01/1148956444707.html Swedish police shut down major piracy site], AFP. June 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The raid appeared to be motivated by pressure from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), a group that filed police complaints in Stockholm and Gothenborg in 2004 and 2005 against The Pirate Bay and sent a letter to Sweden's state secretary requesting action.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, Louis. [http://www.thelocal.se/3969/20060602/ "US government behind Pirate Bay raid"], ''The Local''. June 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doctorow, Cory. [http://boingboing.net/2006/06/20/mpaas-piratebay-lett.html MPAA's PirateBay letter to Swedish Sec'ty of State], ''Boing Boing'', June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The raid was publicized as a success by the MPAA, but ridiculed by The Pirate Bay's operators. The 2006 raid was detailed in the documentary [[Steal This Film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ernesto|title=The Pirate Bay: One Year After the Raid|url=http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-one-year-after-the-raid/|accessdate=17 Apr 2012|newspaper=TorrentFreak|date=31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the Hong Kong-based file sharing website [[Megaupload]] was discovered to be hosted on servers in the state of Virginia, allowing the US government to take action against it. On January 19, the website was shut down and its founder, [[Kim Dotcom]], along with four others involved in the website, were arrested. The indictment issued claims that Megaupload has cost copyright holders $500 million due to its facilitation of illegal downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Freeman|first=Kate|title=Megaupload Is Back, Without a Domain Name|url=https://news.yahoo.com/megaupload-back-without-domain-name-153133858.html|accessdate=17 Apr 2012|newspaper=Yahoo! News|date=20 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPAA requested Carpathia, Megaupload's server host, to retain Megaupload's 25 petabytes of data in case the MPAA decided to sue Megaupload for copyright infringement. While this data includes information on 66.6 million Megaupload users, the MPAA stated that it is not interested in the identities of individual users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kravets|first=David|title=MPAA Wants Megaupload User Data Retained for Lawsuits|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/mpaa-megaupload-user-litigatio/|accessdate=17 Apr 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=21 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peer-to-peer spoofing===
{{main|Torrent poisoning}}

The RIAA has apparently in the past been revealed to and may have admitted to the practice of [[Spoofing (anti-piracy measure)|spoofing]], deliberately flooding P2P networks with "junk music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/01/17/i_poisoned_p2p_networks/ |title="I poisoned P2P networks for the RIAA" – whistleblower |author=[[The Register]] |accessdate=2009-04-23 |date=January 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/03/18/riaa_chief_invokes_martin_luther/ |title=RIAA chief invokes Martin Luther King in pigopoly defense: P2P poisoning, ISP clampdown justified |author=[[The Register]] |accessdate=2009-04-23 |date=March 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A further reference to such activity was discovered when computer software and source code along with emails were stolen from US Company "Media Defender";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://arstechnica.com/software/news/2007/09/leaked-media-defender-e-mails-reveal-secret-government-project.ars |title=Leaked Media Defender e-mails reveal secret government project|author=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=2010-06-23 |date=September 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; their software was designed to facilitate "interdiction" on all the then known peer-to-peer file sharing networks. The contents of the emails made it clear that both P2P network monitoring and interdiction were undertaken by Media Defender.

===Denial-of-service attacks===
[[Aiplex Software]], an India-based technology company, revealed in 2010 that it has made [[denial-of-service attack]]s on torrent hosting websites on behalf of movie studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/movie-industry-launching-cyber-attacks-on-pirate-websites-715149|title=Movie industry 'launching cyber attacks' on pirate websites|last=Chacksfield|first=Mark|work=[[TechRadar]]|date=|accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internet activists retaliated against Aiplex and industry trade groups with denial-of-service attacks of their own, coordinated through [[Operation Payback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=4chan launches DDoS against entertainment industry |first=John |last=Leyden |newspaper=[[The Register]] |date=September 22, 2010 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/20/4chan_ddos_mpaa_riaa/ |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits against individuals==

From 2005 through 2008, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) saw lawsuits against individual consumers as a way to combat the problem of Internet-based copyright infringement. RIAA President [[Cary Sherman]] claimed that the large number of lawsuits filed has "arrested the growth of a runaway solution that would have grown worse and worse."&lt;ref&gt;[http://insight.zdnet.co.uk/business/legal/0,39020487,39271312-2,00.htm "RIAA's next moves in Washington"]. [[ZDNet]]. May 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2006, the RIAA had brought lawsuits against more than 20,000 people in the United States suspected of distributing copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/wp/how-not-get-sued-file-sharing |title=How To Not Get Sued for File Sharing |accessdate=2014-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, through 2008, album sales continued to decline from their 1999 peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/technology/articles/2012/05/24/3510494.htm |title=The real reason why the music industry collapsed |accessdate=2014-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participating plaintiffs===

* [[Univision Communications, Inc.|Univision]] labels: [[Fonovisa Records]]
* [[Warner Music Group]] labels: [[Atlantic Records]], [[Elektra Records]], [[Lava Records]], [[London-Sire Records]], [[Maverick Records]], [[Warner Bros. Records]]

The MPAA has brought file sharing lawsuits against individuals naming the following plaintiffs.
* [[Lions Gate Entertainment]]
* [[News Corporation]] studios: [[20th Century Fox]]
* [[Paramount Pictures]]
* [[Sony Pictures]] studios: [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Screen Gems]]
* [[Time Warner]] studios: [[New Line Cinema]], [[Warner Bros.]]
* [[Universal Studios]]
* [[The Walt Disney Company]]

===Scope of distribution rights===
A critical case, which may not only determine the fate of the RIAA's litigation campaign, but also impact the scope of copyright across the internet, is ''Elektra v. Barker''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com#Elektra_v_Barker "Elektra v. Barker"]. Recording Industry vs. The People blog.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Tenise Barker, a 29-year-old nursing student in the Bronx, moved to dismiss the RIAA's complaint for lack of specificity, and on the ground that merely "making available" does not constitute a copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporteresq.com/thresq/spotlight/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003535810 "Is 'Making Available' Copyright Infringement?"]. Hollywood Reporter ESQ.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposing Ms. Barker's motion, the RIAA argued that "making available" is indeed a copyright infringement. Upon learning of the RIAA's argument, which sought to expand copyright law, the [[Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association]], the U.S. Internet Industry Association, and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) submitted ''[[amicus curiae]]'' briefs supporting Ms. Barker's motion and rebutting the RIAA's argument. The Motion Picture Association of America, in turn, submitted a brief supporting the RIAA. The U.S. Department of Justice submitted a "Statement of Interest" refuting one argument made by the EFF, but taking no position on the "making available" issue; the DOJ stated that it has never prosecuted anyone for "making available".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilrweb.com/viewILRPDF.asp?filename=elektra_barker_usstatement "Statement of Interest of US Government in Elektra Barker"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118183028/http://www.ilrweb.com/viewILRPDF.asp?filename=elektra_barker_usstatement |date=2010-01-18 }}, page 5, footnote 3. ILRweb.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was argued before Judge [[Kenneth M. Karas]] in Manhattan federal court on January 26, 2007. The same issue has been briefed in a more recent case, ''Warner v. Cassin''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/01/index-of-litigation-documents.html#Warner_v_Cassin "Warner v. Cassin"] Recording Industry vs. The People blog. January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, Judge Karas ruled in "Barker" that simply "making available" (such as dropping a file in a shared folder) did not constitute copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Elektra Entertainment et al. v. Denise Barker  |court= United States District Court, Southern District of New York|date=31 March 2008 |url=http://www.ilrweb.com/viewILRPDFfull.asp?filename=elektra_barker_080331Decision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amnesty programs===
Between September 2003 and April 2004, the RIAA, through its [[Clean Slate Program (RIAA)|Clean Slate Program]], offered individual file sharers [[amnesty]] for past infringements, "on the condition that they refrain from future infringement,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.riaa.com/issues/cleanSlate.asp "Clean Slate Program"]. RIAA Website.&lt;/ref&gt; and delete the infringing material.  Individuals were no longer eligible for amnesty once they had been sued.  The program is now discontinued.

The RIAA states this was an educational initiative about illegal file sharing, and was stopped due to increased public awareness in the issues. The program may also have been stopped due to the low number of takers.&lt;ref&gt;1,108 people signed up to the Clean Slate program, according to [http://digital-lifestyles.info/display_page.asp?section=business&amp;id=1152 "RIAA Drops 'Clean Slate'"]. Fraser Lovatt, Digital-Lifestyles.org, April 21, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some doubt about whether the RIAA can offer this protection, with some attorneys claiming the offer of amnesty was misleading, and legal documents provided by the RIAA "provides ... no promise not to sue you."&lt;ref name="Consumers Strike Back, Sue RIAA"&gt;Ira Rothken (September 11, 2003). [http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,112428,00.asp "Consumers Strike Back, Sue RIAA"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628215328/http://pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,112428,00.asp |date=2006-06-28 }}. PCWorld.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawsuit brought in California state court, ''Parke v. RIAA'', alleged the RIAA had committed fraudulent business practices by offering the program.&lt;ref name="Consumers Strike Back, Sue RIAA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/Parke_v_RIAA/Parke_RIAA_Complaint.pdf "''Parke v. RIAA'', Complaint"]. September 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection of evidence===
The RIAA and MPAA contracted [[MediaSentry]], on behalf of plaintiff labels and studios, to collect information about IP addresses sharing potentially infringing files on via peer-to-peer networks.  Collected information included lists of potentially infringing files an IP address reports as available for downloading, files actually downloaded by MediaSentry from an IP address, and dates and times of the observations.

In the United States, MediaSentry is not licensed as a private investigator in some of the states in which observed files are physically located.  Because of this, beginning in February 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slyck.com/story1657_RIAA_Not_Impressed_with_Legal_Concerns_Surrounding_MediaSentry|title=RIAA Not Impressed with Legal Concerns Surrounding MediaSentry|date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-22 |first=Thomas|last=Mennecke|publisher=[[Slyck.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; some defendants have challenged the legality of MediaSentry's practices, by seeking to exclude evidence collected by MediaSentry from the lawsuits, and by filing complaints with state licensing boards.

The RIAA asserted that MediaSentry is not a private investigator, so does not require licensing in any jurisdiction.  Nevertheless, sometime in 2008 the RIAA quietly discontinued using MediaSentry's services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB123109364085551895|accessdate=2008-06-22|title=Changing Tack, RIAA Ditches MediaSentry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A February 2008 redesign of MediaSentry's website removed a section on "litigation support services" which described "gathering evidence for civil/criminal litigation and prosecution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080219-mediasentry-site-redesigned-loses-references-to-litigation.html|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=February 19, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-22|title=MediaSentry site redesign drops references to litigation|first=Eric|last=Bangeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early settlement offers===
In February, 2007, the RIAA launched an 'early settlement program' directed to ISP's and to colleges and universities, urging them to pass along letters to subscribers and students offering early "settlements", prior to the disclosure of their identities.  When accepted, these offers can save the RIAA the expense to procure the identities through a Doe lawsuit naming multiple defendants.

The settlement letters urged ISP's to preserve evidence for the benefit of the RIAA and invited the students and subscribers to visit an RIAA website for the purpose of entering into a "discount settlement" payable by credit card.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/02/riaa-adopts-new-policy-offers-pre-doe.html RIAA Adopts New Policy, offers Pre-Doe settlement option if ISP Holds Logs Longer, Asks ISP's to Correct Identification Mistakes]" Recording Industry vs. The People blog. February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2007, the focus had shifted from ISP's to colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960319.html?categoryid=18&amp;cs=1 RIAA targets university students]" (Variety.com)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle.com"&gt;{{cite news |first=Brock |last=Read |title=Record Companies to Accused Pirates: Deal or No Deal? |url=http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i28/28a03101.htm |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |page=A31 |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Lauten (April 4, 2007).

The average settlement amount offered by the RIAA is around $3,000, but it depends on the number of infringements&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Ken (March 26, 2007). [https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2007/03/students-largely-ignore-riaa-instant-settlement-offers.ars "Students largely ignore RIAA instant settlement offers"]. Ars Technica.&lt;/ref&gt; In one case in 2008, 18 UC Berkeley students were informed by the RIAA's lawfirm that they were infringing on copyrights through the use of Limewire. They were offered a settlement of $750 per song in order to avoid legal action.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siliconbeat.com/2008/01/21/riaa-set-to-sue-cal-student-for-allegedly-illegal-music-sharing/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification of defendants===
Between 2002 and 2003, the RIAA attempted to get [[Verizon]] to disclose the identities of file-sharing customers based on a simple one-page [[subpoena]]. Verizon attorney [[Sarah Deutsch]] challenged the subpoena's validity on procedural and privacy grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/2008-1082-955417.html Verizon's copyright campaign] Declan McCullagh&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2003, this failed when a federal appeals court overturned a lower court order. The RIAA claims this procedure was sanctioned by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], but the appeals court ruled that the DMCA regulation applies only to data actually hosted by an [[Internet service provider]], rather than data on a customer's computer. The [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to review this ruling in 2004. As a result, the RIAA must now file individual civil suits against each accused file-sharer, and the ISP and alleged file-sharer have more legal avenues for preventing disclosure of their identity, making the entire process much more expensive, slow and complicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subpoenadefense.org/ Subpoena Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; The court opinion was written by Judge [[Douglas Ginsburg]]. The RIAA typically files suits against multiple Does.

The RIAA names defendants based on ISP identification of the subscriber associated with an [[IP address]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/27/earlyshow/leisure/music/main1166218.shtml |title=Mom Fights Recording Industry |author=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=2007-04-02 | date=December 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such do not know any additional information about a person before they sue. After an Internet subscriber's identity is discovered, but before an individual lawsuit is filed, the subscriber is typically offered an opportunity to settle. The standard settlement is a payment of several thousand dollars to the RIAA, and an agreement not to engage in file-sharing of RIAA music.

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[Public Citizen]] oppose the ability of the RIAA and other companies to "strip Internet users of anonymity without allowing them to challenge the order in court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Citing Right to Anonymity Online, ACLU Asks Boston Court to Block Recording Industry Subpoena |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |date=September 29, 2003 |url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/anon/15590prs20030929.html |accessdate=April 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Record Industry Cuts Corners in Crusade Against File-Sharers |publisher=Public Citizen |date=2004-02-02 |url=http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/release.cfm?ID=1636 |accessdate=2007-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIAA's methods of identifying individual users have led to the issuing of [[subpoena]]s to a dead grandmother,&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050204-4587.html "I sue dead people"].

[https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060424-6662.html "RIAA sues computer-less family"]. [[Ars Technica]].&lt;/ref&gt; The RIAA has also brought lawsuits against children, some as young as 12.&lt;ref name="RIAA settles with 12-year-old girl"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/RIAA+settles+with+12-year-old+girl/2100-1027_3-5073717.html "RIAA settles with 12-year-old girl"], CNET News, September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIAA looks to various colleges and universities throughout the United States as some of the biggest offenders of peer to peer file sharing. It has found California colleges and universities to have received the most pre-litigation letters and copyright infringement notices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CA Assembly Committee Looks into High Number of Music Piracy Complaints at State Schools|date=September 2011|publisher=RIAA|url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=&amp;resultpage=&amp;id=9E39B88A-8F87-C04E-9EA9-4E7551AC99E1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Santangelo v. RIAA|Patricia Santangelo]] made the news by challenging the RIAA's lawsuit against her. While she succeeded in getting the lawsuit against her dismissed two years later, her children were then sued. A default judgment entered against her daughter Michelle for $30,750 for failing to respond to the lawsuit, was subsequently [[Vacated judgment|vacated]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/07/default-judgment-against-michelle.html Default Judgment against Michelle Santangelo vacated; RIAA seeks $513 in attorneys' fees]" Recording Industry vs. The People blog.

===Counterclaims===
Another defendant, [[Tanya Andersen]], a 41-year-old single mother living in [[Oregon]], filed counterclaims against the RIAA including a [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] charge. The RIAA requested deposition of her 10-year-old daughter.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/03/riaa-insists-on-deposing-tanya.html RIAA Insists on Deposing Tanya Andersen's 10-year-old daughter]", Recording Industry vs The People, "23 March 2007"&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, on July 4, 2007, the RIAA dropped the case, leaving open only the question of attorneys fees and the RIAA's liability under Ms. Andersen's counterclaims.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/06/riaa-drops-its-case-against-tanya.html RIAA Drops its Case Against Tanya Andersen]" Recording Industry vs. The People blog. June 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Ms. Andersen sued the RIAA, the record company plaintiffs, Safenet (MediaSentry), and Settlement Support Center LLC, for a huge list of accusations including fraud and negligent misrepresentation, violations of ORICO, abuse of legal process and  [[malicious prosecution]] &lt;ref&gt;"[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/11/judge-riaa-not-a-negligent-fraudulent-mobster/ Lawyer wants “Goliath verdict” against RIAA in abuse trial]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/06/tanya-andersen-sues-riaa-for-malicious.html Tanya Andersen Sues RIAA for Malicious Prosecution in Oregon]" Recording Industry vs The People, June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently amending her complaint to turn the case into a [[class action]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117971146.html?categoryId=16&amp;cs=1 RIAA Faces Serious Piracy Lawsuit]", Variety.com, August 30, 2007; "[https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/08/29/ap4065797.html Woman Targets RIAA With Lawsuit]", Forbes.com, August 29, 2007; "[https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070817-riaa-faces-first-class-action-suit.html RIAA faces possible class action over suing the innocent]", Ars Technica, August 17, 2007; "[http://www.p2pnet.net/story/13077 RIAA named in first class action]", p2pnet, August 16, 2007; "[http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/17/1728225 Class Action Initiated Against RIAA]", Slashdot, August 17, 2007.

In one file-sharing case, the RIAA has been referred by the defendants as "a cartel acting [[Collusion|collusively]] in violation of the [[United States antitrust law|antitrust laws]] and of [[public policy]], by tying their copyrights to each other, [[Collusive litigation|collusively litigating]] and settling all cases together, and by entering into an unlawful agreement among themselves to prosecute and to dispose of all cases in accordance with a uniform agreement, and through common lawyers, thus overreaching the bounds and scope of whatever copyrights they might have". In ''Arista v. Limewire'' this was as well alleged by the defendants and referred to in the defendants [[counterclaim]].

See, e.g. ''UMG v. Lindor'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2007/08/riaa-moves-to-strike-copyright-misuse.html "RIAA Moves to Strike 'Copyright Misuse' Affirmative Defense in UMG v. Lindor"].

In February 2008 it was alleged by a group of artist managers &amp; lawyers that the RIAA has been withholding settlements from artists for several years. The RIAA gained the money through lawsuits claiming to defend the rights of artists, although none of the artists whose music was 'illegally' downloaded reportedly received any of the settlement money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=New York Post|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/02272008/business/infringement__99428.htm|title=Infringement!

===Determination of damages===
By US Copyright Law, between $750 and $30,000 in damages can be sought for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Law of the United States of America http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504&lt;/ref&gt; The RIAA typically seeks $750 per song file in statutory damages.

In UMG v. Lindor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.riaalawsuits.us/documents.htm#UMG_v_Lindor "UMG v. Lindor"]. RIAALawsuites.us.&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant argued that the RIAA's damage theory was unconstitutional because it sought 1071 times the actual
cost per track in online stores ($.70). After a Brooklyn Federal Court judge upheld the legal theory behind the RIAA's assessment of damages in November 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilrweb.com/viewILRPDF.asp?filename=umg_lindor_061109OrderGrantMotLvAmend UMG v.

In 2008, federal judge [[Xavier Rodriguez]] ruled that teenager Whitney Harper would only have to pay $200 in damages per song that she shared on the KaZaA network, instead of the $750 per song that the RIAA was seeking. Since KaZaa did not expressly inform Harper that her actions were illegal, Rodriguez determined that she had unknowingly committed copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="arstechnica.com"/&gt;

In [[Capitol v. Thomas]], a Minnesota mother was ordered to pay $222,000 ($9,250 per song) in damages to the RIAA for illegally sharing 24 songs on Kazaa.  Before they first sued, the RIAA offered a settlement of $5,000, which Thomas refused. She later refused a second settlement of $25,000, which would have been donated to music industry persons in need. After three trials and multiple appeals, at one point of which statutory damages awarded were $1,920,000,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/11/thomas-rasset-damage-award-strange-unpredictable&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court refused to hear Thomas's case in March 2013.

===Awarding of costs to prevailing parties===
In 2006, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, [[Public Citizen]], the [[ACLU]] of Oklahoma Foundation, and the [[American Association of Law Libraries]] submitted an [[amicus curiae]] brief in support of the motion for attorneys fees that has been made by Deborah Foster in ''Capitol Records v.

The judge ruled that the RIAA's withdrawal of the case—after one and a half years of litigation—did not immunize it from possible liability for attorneys fees, holding that the defendant was a "prevailing party" under the Copyright Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilrweb.com/viewILRPDF.asp?filename=capitol_foster_dismissal July 13, 2006, Order and Decision]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court subsequently ruled that defendant was entitled to be reimbursed for her reasonable attorneys fees, since the RIAA's pursuit of its case was, at best, "marginal", and was being pursued to extract a settlement from someone who was clearly known not to be the direct infringer.&lt;ref name="recordingindustryvspeople"/&gt; The Court noted that the mere fact that Ms. Foster was a person who paid for an internet access account was not a basis for a copyright infringement lawsuit against her. Ms. Foster's motion for attorneys fees had been supported by an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief of the American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Association of Law Libraries, and ACLU Foundation of Oklahoma.

Other instances in which the RIAA was known to have been forced to back out of a case to avoid a loss, are ''[[Priority Records v. Brittany Chan]]'' in Michigan, ''Virgin Records v. Tammie Marson''&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.riaalawsuits.us/documents.htm#Virgin_v_Marson "Virgin Records v. Tammie Marson"]. RIAALawsuits.us.&lt;/ref&gt; in California, and ''Elektra v. Wilke''&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.riaalawsuits.us/documents.htm#Elektra_v_Wilke "Elektra v. Wilke"]. RIAALawsuits.us.&lt;/ref&gt; in Illinois.

===End of mass lawsuits===
[[Hilary Rosen]] was the RIAA's president and chief executive officer from 1998 to 2003 and under her leadership, the company commenced a legal campaign to reduce illegal file-sharing. Rosen has expressed "concern that the lawsuits have outlived most of their usefulness" and that music devices should try "to work better together."&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Hilary (June 4, 2006). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070218180330/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hilary-rosen/for-the-record-for-what-_b_22177.html "For the Record, for What It's Worth"].  Huffington Post.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008 the Wall Street Journal reported that the RIAA had dropped its program of mass lawsuits in favor of cooperative enforcement agreements with a number of ISPs. The RIAA still reserves the right to file lawsuits against 'particularly flagrant' offenders, but the article predicted these lawsuits would "slow to a trickle."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122966038836021137 "Music Industry to Abandon Mass Suits"], "[[The Wall Street Journal]]", December 19, 2008. Retrieved on 2009-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIAA has stated on their website that the intention of the lawsuit program was to bring awareness to the illegality of file-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/faq.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410034407/http://www.riaa.com/faq.php |archivedate=2012-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is evidence that the lawsuit program has reduced the amount of files offered by large file-sharers, one source stated in 2006 that there was a limited effect on those who offer less than 1000 files. Overall, the lawsuits have had a negligible effect on the availability of files at any random time.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharjee, S., Lertwachara, K, Gopal, R. and Marsden, J, "Impact of Legal Threats on Online Music Sharing Activity: An Analysis of Music Industry Legal Actions", 49 (2006) ''Journal of Law and Economics'' 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public relations campaigns==
Trade groups have conducted various public relations campaigns targeting consumer file sharing:
* The MPAA's "Respect Copyrights" campaigns, including the "[[Who Makes Movies?]]" and "[[You can click, but you can't hide]]" sub-campaigns.
* The RIAA's "Soundbyting" campaign.
* [[Access Copyright]]'s "[[Captain Copyright]]" campaign in Canada.
* The [[Business Software Alliance]]'s "Define The Line" campaign.
* The [[Federation Against Software Theft]]'s "[[Piracy is theft]]" campaign in the UK.

==Criticism==
There is much criticism of the RIAA's policy and method of suing individuals for copyright infringement, notably with Internet-based pressure groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and [[Students for Free Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/share/petition/ "Stop the RIAA! petition"], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]; [http://freeculture.org/riaafree/ "RIAA Free"], FreeCulture.org.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the RIAA has sued more than 20,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/howto-notgetsued.php "How to Not Get Sued For File Sharing"] [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;/ref&gt; people in the United States suspected of distributing copyrighted works and settled approximately 2,500 of the cases. [[Brad Templeton]] of the Electronic Frontier Foundation has called these types of lawsuits [[spamigation]] and implied they are done merely to [[Barratry (common law)|intimidate]] people.&lt;ref&gt;Blankenhorn, Dana (August 2008). [http://www.danablankenhorn.com/2006/08/spamigation.html "Spamigation and How to Fight It"]. danablankenhorn.com. Accessed 08-25-2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIAA was criticized in the media after they subpoenaed Gertrude Walton, an 83-year-old woman who died in December 2004.&lt;ref name="ISueDead"&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050204-4587.html "I sue dead people"]. ARS Technica. February 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Walton was accused of swapping rock, pop and rap songs. RIAA spokesman Jonathan Lamy commented that legal proceedings had commenced before Walton died. "Our evidence gathering and our subsequent legal actions all were initiated weeks and even months ago."

In a Brooklyn case, ''Elektra v. Schwartz'',&lt;ref name="Elektra v. Schwartz"&gt;"[http://info.riaalawsuits.us/documents.htm#Elektra_v_Schwartz Elektra v. Schwartz]"&lt;/ref&gt; against [[RaeJ Schwartz]], a Queens woman with Multiple Sclerosis, the RIAA's lawyers wrote to the Judge that they were in possession of a letter in which "...America Online, Inc., has confirmed that Defendant was the owner of the internet access account through which hundreds of Plaintiffs' sound recordings were downloaded and distributed to the public without Plaintiffs' consent." After the defense received a copy of the letter, it turned out that the letter merely identified Ms. Schwartz as the owner of an internet access account and said nothing at all about "downloading" or "distributing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/12/07/2351238 Slashdot | RIAA Mischaracterizes Letter Received From AOL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIAA has also been criticized for bringing lawsuits against children, including 12-year-old Brianna LaHara of [[New York City]] in 2003&lt;ref name="RIAA settles with 12-year-old girl"/&gt; and 13-year-old Brittany Chan of Michigan. Under the threat of a possible defendant's motion for summary judgment and attorneys fees, the RIAA withdrew the case ''Priority Records v. Chan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.riaalawsuits.us/documents.htm#Priority_v_Chan "Index of Litigation Documents Referred to in Recording Industry vs. The People"]. Ray Beckerman. riaalawsuits.us.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/blog/211 "Priority Records v. Chan: RIAA Must Get Guardian Ad Litem Appointed for Suit Against 13 Year Old"], Digital Music News, 3 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; while LaHara's mother agreed to pay $2,000 in settlements.

The RIAA's recent targeting of students has generated controversy as well.  An April 4, 2006 story in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] campus newspaper ''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]'' indicates that an RIAA representative stated to [[Cassi Hunt]], an alleged file-sharer, that previously, "the RIAA has been known to suggest that students drop out of college or go to community college in order to be able to afford settlements."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V126/N15/RIAA1506.html "Run Over by the RIAA Don...t Tap the Glass"]. Cassi Hunt. MIT Tech, April 4, 2006. Volume 126, Number 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIAA has also filed a lawsuit against a woman who has never bought, turned on, or used a personal computer for using an "online distribution system" to obtain unlicensed music files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2006/02/marie-lindor-to-move-for-summary.html "Marie Lindor to Move for Summary Judgment"]. Ty Rogers and Ray Beckerman. Recording Industry vs. The People blog. February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred again in the Walls case;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I don't understand this", said James Walls, "How can they sue us when we don't even have a computer?"&lt;ref name="Bylund"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The RIAA filed a lawsuit against Larry Scantlebury, a man who had died. They offered the deceased man's family a period of sixty days to grieve the death before they began to depose members of Mr. Scantlebury's family for the suit against his estate.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/12/riaa_to_grieving_fam.html RIAA to grieving family: We depose your children in 60 days]", August 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic study by Depoorter et al. (2011) among American and European college students found that users of file-sharing technologies were relatively anti-copyright and that copyright enforcement efforts generated backlash, hardening pro-file sharing beliefs among users of these technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Depoorter et al. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=740184 " Copyright Backlash"], Southern California Law Review, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Voting Rights Act of 1965''' is a landmark piece of [[federal government of the United States|federal]] [[legislation]] in the [[United States]] that prohibits racial discrimination in [[voting]].&lt;ref name=DOJvra65&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php|title=History of Federal Voting Rights Laws: The Voting Rights Act of 1965|publisher=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting Rights Act|url=http://nvrmi.com/?page_id=41|publisher=National Voting Rights Museum and Institute|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during the height of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] on August 6, 1965, and [[United States Congress|Congress]] later amended the Act five times to expand its protections.&lt;ref name=DOJvra65 /&gt; Designed to enforce the [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]] guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]], the Act secured the right to vote for [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|racial minorities]] throughout the country, especially in the [[Southern United States|South]]. According to the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]], the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of federal [[civil rights]] legislation ever enacted in the country.&lt;ref name=DOJintro&gt;{{Citation-attribution|now=n|{{cite web|title=Introduction to Federal Voting Rights Laws: The Effect of the Voting Rights Act|url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_c.php|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=January 8, 2014|date=June 19, 2009}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act contains numerous provisions that regulate elections. The Act's "general provisions" provide nationwide protections for voting rights. Section 2 is a general provision that prohibits every state and local government from imposing any voting law that results in discrimination against racial or language minorities. Other general provisions specifically outlaw [[literacy test]]s and similar devices that were historically used to disenfranchise racial minorities.

The Act also contains "special provisions" that apply to only certain jurisdictions. A core special provision is the Section 5 preclearance requirement, which prohibits certain jurisdictions from implementing any change affecting voting without receiving preapproval from the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] or the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for D.C.]] that the change does not discriminate against protected minorities.&lt;ref name=DOJsection5&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/about.php |title=About Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another special provision requires jurisdictions containing significant language minority populations to provide [[bilingual]] ballots and other election materials.

Section 5 and most other special provisions apply to jurisdictions encompassed by the "coverage formula" prescribed in Section 4(b). The coverage formula was originally designed to encompass jurisdictions that engaged in egregious voting discrimination in 1965, and Congress updated the formula in 1970 and 1975. In ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'' (2013), the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Judicial review in the United States|struck down]] the coverage formula as unconstitutional, reasoning that it was no longer responsive to current conditions.&lt;ref name="shelby"&gt;''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'', {{ussc|link=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/570/12-96/|volume=570|year=2014|docket=12-96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court did not strike down Section 5, but without a coverage formula, Section 5 is unenforceable.&lt;ref name="scotusblogplain"&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Amy|title=Details on Shelby County v.

==Background==
{{further|Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era}}
[[File:Bloody Sunday-Alabama police attack.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|alt=refer to caption|Alabama police in 1965 attack voting rights marchers participating in the first of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], which became known as "Bloody Sunday"]]
As initially ratified, the [[United States Constitution]] granted each state complete discretion to determine voter qualifications for its residents.&lt;ref&gt;United States Constitution art. I, sec. 2, cl. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bending&gt;{{cite book|last=May|first=Gary|title=Bending Toward Justice: The Voting Rights Act and the Transformation of American Democracy|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-465-01846-7|date=April 9, 2013|edition=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50}} After the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]], the three [[Reconstruction Amendments]] were ratified and limited this discretion. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] (1865) prohibits [[slavery in the United States|slavery]]; the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (1868) grants [[citizenship in the United States|citizenship]] to anyone "born or naturalized in the United States" and guarantees every person [[Due Process Clause|due process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] rights; and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] (1870) provides that "[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." These Amendments also empower [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] to [[Congressional power of enforcement|enforce]] their provisions through "appropriate legislation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landmark Legislation: Thirteenth, Fourteenth, &amp; Fifteenth Amendments|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/CivilWarAmendments.htm|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To enforce the Reconstruction Amendments, Congress passed the [[Enforcement Acts]] in the 1870s. The Acts criminalized the obstruction of a citizen's [[voting rights]] and provided for federal supervision of the electoral process, including [[voter registration]].&lt;ref name=Carolina&gt;{{Citation-attribution|now=n|''[[South Carolina v. Katzenbach]]'', {{ussc|383|301|1966}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|310}} However, in 1875 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] struck down parts of the legislation as unconstitutional in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' and ''[[United States v. Reese]]''.&lt;ref name=democracy&gt;{{cite book|last1=Issacharoff|first1=Samuel|last2=Karlan|first2=Pamela S.|last3=Pildes|first3=Richard H.|title=The Law of Democracy: Legal Structure of the Political Process|year=2012|publisher=Foundation Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-59941-935-1|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|97}} After the [[Reconstruction Era]] ended in 1877, enforcement of these laws became erratic, and in 1894, Congress repealed most of their provisions.&lt;ref name=Carolina /&gt;{{rp|310}}

Southern states generally sought to disenfranchise racial minorities during and after Reconstruction. From 1868 to 1888, [[electoral fraud]] and violence throughout the South suppressed the [[African-American]] vote.&lt;ref name="Direct"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Jones|first2=Jeffery|title=Race, Voting Rights, and Segregation: Direct Disenfranchisement|work=The Geography of Race in the United States|url=http://www.umich.edu/~lawrace/disenfranchise1.htm|date=September 2002|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1888 to 1908, Southern states legalized disenfranchisement by enacting [[Jim Crow laws]]; they amended their [[State constitution (United States)|constitutions]] and passed legislation to impose various voting restrictions, including [[literacy test]]s, [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], property-ownership requirements, moral character tests, requirements that voter registration applicants interpret particular documents, and [[grandfather clause]]s that allowed otherwise-ineligible persons to vote if their grandfathers voted (which excluded many African Americans whose grandfathers had been slaves or otherwise ineligible).&lt;ref name="Carolina" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Direct" /&gt; During this period, the Supreme Court generally upheld efforts to discriminate against racial minorities. In ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903), the Court held that irrespective of the Fifteenth Amendment, the [[federal judiciary of the United States|judiciary]] did not have the remedial power to force states to register racial minorities to vote.&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|100}}

In the 1950s, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] increased pressure on the [[United States federal government|federal government]] to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]]. This legislation authorized the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] to sue for [[injunctive relief]] on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were denied, created the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights Division]] within the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the [[Commission on Civil Rights]] to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1960]], which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.&lt;ref name="DOJintro" /&gt;

Although these acts helped empower courts to remedy violations of federal voting rights, strict legal standards made it difficult for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the [[electoral roll]]s, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal [[United States district court|district court]] judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South increased only marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|514}}

Congress responded to rampant discrimination against racial minorities in [[public accommodations]] and [[government services]] by passing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The Act included some voting rights protections; it required registrars to equally administer literacy tests in writing to each voter and to accept applications that contained minor errors, and it created a [[rebuttable presumption]] that persons with a sixth-grade education were sufficiently literate to vote.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|97}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Law 88-352|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/CivilRightsActOf1964.pdf|location=Title I|accessdate=October 19, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major Features of the Civil Rights Act of 1964|url=http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm|work=CongressLink|publisher=Dirksen Congressional Center|

Following the 1964 elections, civil rights organizations such as the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) pushed for federal action to protect the voting rights of racial minorities.&lt;ref name=eyes /&gt;{{rp|254–255}} Their efforts culminated in protests in [[Alabama]], particularly in the city of [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], where County Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]]'s police force violently resisted African-American voter registration efforts. Speaking about the voting rights push in Selma, [[James Forman]] of SNCC said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our strategy, as usual, was to force the U.S. government to intervene in case there were arrests—and if they did not intervene, that inaction would once again prove the government was not on our side and thus intensify the development of a mass consciousness among blacks. Our slogan for this drive was "[[One Man, One Vote]]."&lt;ref name=eyes /&gt;{{rp|255}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1965, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[James Bevel]],&lt;ref name=Garrow&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Garrow|editor1-first=David J.|title=We Shall Overcome: The Civil Rights Movement in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s|year=1989|publisher=Carlson Publishing|last=Kryn|first=Randy|chapter=James L.

These marches received national media coverage and drew attention to the issue of voting rights. King and other demonstrators were arrested during a march on February 1 for violating an anti-parade [[local ordinance|ordinance]]; this inspired similar marches in the following days, causing hundreds more to be arrested.&lt;ref name=eyes /&gt;{{rp|259–261}} On February 4, civil rights leader [[Malcolm X]] gave a militant speech in Selma in which he said that many African Americans did not support King's nonviolent approach;&lt;ref name=eyes /&gt;{{rp|262}} he later privately said that he wanted to frighten whites into supporting King.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|69}} The next day, King was released and a letter he wrote addressing voting rights, "Letter From A Selma Jail", appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=eyes /&gt;{{rp|262}} 

With the nation paying increasing attention to Selma and voting rights, President Johnson reversed his decision to delay voting rights legislation, and on February 6, he announced he would send a proposal to Congress.&lt;ref name="Bending" /&gt;{{rp|69}} However, he did not reveal the proposal's content or when it would come before Congress.&lt;ref name="eyes" /&gt;{{rp|264}}

===Original bill===

====Senate====
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was introduced in Congress on March 17, 1965 as S. 1564, and it was jointly sponsored by Senate Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) and Senate Minority Leader [[Everett Dirksen]] (R-IL), both of whom had worked with Attorney General Katzenbach to draft the bill's language.&lt;ref name=congresslink&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting Rights Act of 1965|work=The Dirksen Congressional Center|publisher=Congresslink|url=http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_votingrights_contents.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030140112/http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_votingrights_contents.htm|archivedate=October 30, 2014|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Democrats held two-thirds of the seats in both chambers of Congress after the [[United States Senate elections, 1964|1964 Senate elections]],&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|49}} Johnson worried that Southern Democrats would [[filibuster]] the legislation, as they had opposed other civil rights efforts. He enlisted Dirksen to help gain [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] support. Dirksen did not originally intend to support voting rights legislation so soon after supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but he expressed willingness to accept "revolutionary" legislation after learning about the police violence against marchers in Selma on Bloody Sunday.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|95–96}} Given Dirksen's key role in helping Katzenbach draft the legislation, it became known informally as the "Dirksenbach" bill.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|96}} After Mansfield and Dirksen introduced the bill, 64 additional Senators agreed to cosponsor it,&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|150}} with a total 46 Democratic and 20 Republican cosponsors.&lt;ref name="acsc.lib.udel.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting Rights Act|publisher=The Association of Centers for the Study of Congress|url=http://acsc.lib.udel.edu/exhibits/show/legislation/vra|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill contained several special provisions that targeted certain state and local governments: a "coverage formula" that determined which jurisdictions were subject to the Act's other special provisions ("covered jurisdictions"); a "preclearance" requirement that prohibited covered jurisdictions from implementing changes to their voting procedures without first receiving approval from the U.S. Attorney General or the U.S. District Court for D.C. that the changes were not discriminatory; and the suspension of "tests or devices", such as literacy tests, in covered jurisdictions. The bill also authorized the assignment of federal examiners to register voters, and of federal observers to monitor elections, to covered jurisdictions that were found to have engaged in egregious discrimination. The bill set these special provisions to expire after five years.&lt;ref name=Carolina /&gt;{{rp|319–320}}&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|520, 524}}&lt;ref name=RevisedBailout&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Richard A.|title=The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act: A Statutory Analysis of the Revised Bailout Provisions|journal=Washington University Law Review| year=1984| volume=62| issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.law.wustl.edu/lawreview/vol62/iss1/2/|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–6}}

The scope of the coverage formula was a matter of contentious Congressional debate. The coverage formula reached a jurisdiction if: (1) the jurisdiction maintained a "test or device" on November 1, 1964, and (2) less than 50% of the jurisdiction's voting-age residents either were registered to vote on November 1, 1964 or cast a [[ballot]] in the November 1964 presidential election.&lt;ref name=Carolina /&gt;{{rp|317}} This formula reached few jurisdictions outside the [[Deep South]]. To appease legislators who felt that the bill unfairly targeted Southern jurisdictions, the bill included a general prohibition on racial discrimination in voting that applied nationwide.&lt;ref name=1982hist&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=Thomas M.|last2=Markman|first2=Stephen J.|title=The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act: A Legislative History|journal=Washington and Lee Law Review|year=1983|volume=40|issue=4|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/wlulr/vol40/iss4/3|accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1352}} The bill also included provisions allowing a covered jurisdiction to "bail out" of coverage by proving in federal court that it had not used a "test or device" for a discriminatory purpose or with a discriminatory effect during the 5 years preceding its bailout request.&lt;ref name=RevisedBailout /&gt;{{rp|6}} Additionally, the bill included a "bail in" provision under which federal courts could subject discriminatory non-covered jurisdictions to remedies contained in the special provisions.&lt;ref name=3c&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 3(c); {{usc|52|10302(c)}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973a(c))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bail-in&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crum|first=Travis|title=The Voting Rights Act's Secret Weapon: Pocket Trigger Litigation and Dynamic Preclearance|journal=The Yale Law Journal|year=2010|volume=119|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal/note/the-voting-rights-act%27s-secret-weapon:-pocket-trigger-litigation-and-dynamic-preclearance|accessdate=August 27, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830171847/http://www.yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal/note/the-voting-rights-act%27s-secret-weapon:-pocket-trigger-litigation-and-dynamic-preclearance/|archivedate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2006–2007}}

The bill was first considered by the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], whose chair, Senator [[James Eastland]] (D-MS), opposed the legislation with several other Southern Senators on the committee. To prevent the bill from dying in committee, Mansfield proposed a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] to require the Judiciary Committee to report the bill out of committee by April 9, which the Senate overwhelmingly passed by a vote of 67 to 13.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|150}}&lt;ref name="acsc.lib.udel.edu"/&gt; During the committee's consideration of the bill, Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (D-MA) led an effort to amend the bill to prohibit poll taxes. Although the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]]—which banned the use of poll taxes in federal elections— was ratified a year earlier, Johnson's administration and the bill's sponsors did not include a provision in the voting rights bill banning poll taxes in ''state'' elections because they feared courts would strike down the legislation as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|521}}&lt;ref name=eyes /&gt;{{rp|285}} Additionally, by excluding poll taxes from the definition of "tests or devices", the coverage formula did not reach [[Texas]] or [[Arkansas]], mitigating opposition from those two states' influential [[congressional delegation]]s.&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|521}} Nonetheless, with the support of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] committee members, Kennedy's amendment to prohibit poll taxes passed by a 9-4 vote. In response, Dirksen offered an amendment that exempted from the coverage formula any state that had at least 60% of its eligible residents registered to vote or that had a voter turnout that surpassed the national average in the preceding presidential election. This amendment, which effectively exempted all states from coverage except [[Mississippi]], passed during a committee meeting in which three liberal members were absent. Dirksen offered to drop the amendment if the poll tax ban were removed. Ultimately, the bill was reported out of committee on April 9 by a 12-4 vote without a recommendation.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|152–153}}

On April 22, the full Senate started debating the bill. Dirksen spoke first on the bill's behalf, saying that "legislation is needed if the unequivocal mandate of the Fifteenth Amendment&amp;nbsp;... is to be enforced and made effective, and if the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] is to be made truly meaningful."&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|154}} Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] (R-SC) retorted that the bill would lead to "despotism and tyranny", and Senator [[Sam Ervin]] (D-NC) argued that the bill was unconstitutional because it deprived states of their right under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 2: House of Representatives|Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution]] to establish voter qualifications and because the bill's special provisions targeted only certain jurisdictions. On May 6, Ervin offered an amendment to abolish the coverage formula's automatic trigger and instead allow federal judges to appoint federal examiners to administer voter registration. This amendment overwhelmingly failed, with 42 Democrats and 22 Republicans voting against it.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|154–156}} After lengthy debate, Ted Kennedy's amendment to prohibit poll taxes also failed 49-45 on May 11.&lt;ref name="acsc.lib.udel.edu"/&gt; However, the Senate agreed to include a provision authorizing the Attorney General to sue any jurisdiction, covered or non-covered, to challenge its use of poll taxes.&lt;ref name=eyes /&gt;{{rp|156–157}}&lt;ref name=RevisedBailout /&gt;{{rp|2}} An amendment offered by Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] (D-NY) to enfranchise English-illiterate citizens who had attained at least a sixth-grade education in a non-English-speaking school also passed by 48-19. Southern legislators offered a series of amendments to weaken the bill, all of which failed.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|159}}

On May 25, the Senate voted for [[cloture]] by a 70-30 vote, thus overcoming the threat of filibuster and limiting further debate on the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Vote #67 in 1965: To Invoke Cloture and End Debate on S. 1564, the Voting Rights Act of 1965|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/89-1965/s67|work=govtrack.us|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 26, the Senate passed the bill by a 77-19 vote (Democrats 47-16, Republicans 30-2); only Senators representing Southern states voted against it.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|161}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Vote #78 in 1965: To Pass S. 1564, the Voting Rights Act of 1965|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/89-1965/s78|work=govtrack.us|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Celler]] (D-NY), Chair of the [[House Judiciary Committee]], introduced the Voting Rights Act in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on March 19, 1965 as H.R. 6400.&lt;ref name="acsc.lib.udel.edu"/&gt; The House Judiciary Committee was the first committee to consider the bill. The committee's ranking Republican, [[William Moore McCulloch|William McCulloch]] (R-OH), generally supported expanding voting rights, but he opposed both the poll tax ban and the coverage formula, and he led opposition to the bill in committee. The committee eventually approved the bill on May 12, but it did not file its committee report until June 1.&lt;ref name="Bending" /&gt;{{rp|162}} The bill included two amendments from subcommittee: a penalty for private persons who interfered with the right to vote, and a prohibition of all poll taxes. The poll tax prohibition gained [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[John William McCormack|John McCormack]]'s support. The bill was next considered by the [[United States House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]], whose chair, [[Howard W. Smith]] (D-VA), opposed the bill and delayed its consideration until June 24, when Celler initiated proceedings to have the bill discharged from committee.&lt;ref name="acsc.lib.udel.edu"/&gt; Under pressure from the bill's proponents, Smith allowed the bill to be released a week later, and the full House started debating the bill on July 6.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|163}}

To defeat the Voting Rights Act, McCulloch introduced an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It would have allowed the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, and it would have imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by [[House Minority Leader]] [[Gerald Ford]] (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats as an alternative to the Voting Rights Act.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|162–164}} The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing the Voting Rights Act. However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after [[William M. Tuck]] (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the Voting Rights Act would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House Vote #86 in 1965: To Recommit H.R. 6400, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, with Instructions to Substitute the Text of H.R. 7896 Prohibiting the Denial to Any Person of the Right to Register or to Vote Because of his Failure to Pay a Poll Tax or Any Other Such Tax, for the Language of the Committee Amendment|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/89-1965/h86|work=govtrack.us|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that night, the House passed the Voting Rights Act by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|163–165}}&lt;ref name="acsc.lib.udel.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House Vote #87 in 1965: To Pass H.R. 6400, the Voting Rights Act of 1965|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/89-1965/h87|work=govtrack.us|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conference committee====
The chambers appointed a [[conference committee]] to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. A major contention concerned the poll tax provisions; the Senate version allowed the Attorney General to sue states that used poll taxes to discriminate, while the House version outright banned all poll taxes. Initially, the committee members were stalemated. To help broker a compromise, Attorney General Katzenbach drafted legislative language explicitly asserting that poll taxes were unconstitutional and instructed the Department of Justice to sue the states that maintained poll taxes. To assuage concerns of liberal committee members that this provision was not strong enough, Katzenbach enlisted the help of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], who gave his support to the compromise. King's endorsement ended the stalemate, and on July 29, the conference committee reported its version out of committee.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|166–167}} The House approved this [[conference report]] version of the bill on August 3 by a 328-74 vote (Democrats 217-54, Republicans 111-20),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House Vote #107 in 1965: To Agree to Conference Report on S. 1564, the Voting Rights Act|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/89-1965/h107|work=govtrack.us|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate passed it on August 4 by a 79-18 vote (Democrats 49-17, Republicans 30-1).&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|167}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Vote #178 in 1965: To Agree to Conference Report on S. 1564, the Voting Rights Act of 1965|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/89-1965/s178|work=govtrack.us|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moholtra|first=Ajay|title=Rosa Parks Early Life &amp; Childhood|url=http://www.rosaparksfacts.com/rosa-parks-early-life-childhood/|publisher=Rosa Park Facts.com|date=June 1, 2008|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, President Johnson signed the Act into law with King, [[Rosa Parks]], [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], and other civil rights leaders in attendance at the signing ceremony.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|168}}

===Amendments===
{{main|Amendments to the Voting Rights Act of 1965}}
[[File:Bush Signs Voting Rights Act of 2006.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|President [[George W. Bush]] signs amendments to the Act in July 2006]]
Congress enacted major amendments to the Act in 1970, 1975, 1982, 1992, and 2006. Each amendment coincided with an impending expiration of some or all of the Act's special provisions. Originally set to expire by 1970, Congress repeatedly reauthorized the special provisions in recognition of continuing voting discrimination.&lt;ref name=Bending /&gt;{{rp|209–210}}&lt;ref name=RevisedBailout /&gt;{{rp|6–8}} Congress extended the coverage formula and special provisions tied to it, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, for five years in 1970, seven years in 1975, and 25 years in both 1982 and 2006. In 1970 and 1975, Congress also expanded the reach of the coverage formula by supplementing it with new 1968 and 1972 trigger dates. Coverage was further enlarged in 1975 when Congress expanded the meaning of "tests or devices" to encompass any jurisdiction that provided English-only election information, such as ballots, if the jurisdiction had a single language minority group that constituted more than five percent of the jurisdiction's voting-age citizens. These expansions brought numerous jurisdictions into coverage, including many outside of the South.&lt;ref name=DOJsection4&gt;{{citation-attribution|now=n|{{cite web |title=Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/misc/sec_4.php|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ease the burdens of the reauthorized special provisions, Congress liberalized the bailout procedure in 1982 by allowing jurisdictions to escape coverage by complying with the Act and affirmatively acting to expand minority [[political participation]].&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|523}}

In addition to reauthorizing the original special provisions and expanding coverage, Congress amended and added several other provisions to the Act.

Several of the amendments responded to judicial rulings with which Congress disagreed. In 1982, Congress amended the Act to overturn the Supreme Court case ''[[Mobile v.

Congress responded by expanding Section 2 to explicitly ban any voting practice that had a discriminatory ''effect'', regardless of whether the practice was enacted or operated for a discriminatory purpose.

==Provisions==
[[File:Voting Rights Act - first page (hi-res).jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|The first page of the Voting Rights Act of 1965]]

===General provisions===

====General prohibition of discriminatory voting laws====
Section 2 prohibits any jurisdiction from implementing a "voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure&amp;nbsp;... in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right&amp;nbsp;... to vote on account of race," color, or language minority status.&lt;ref name="CRS" /&gt;{{rp|37}}&lt;ref name="VRA-2"&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 2; {{usc|52|10301}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court has allowed private [[plaintiff]]s to sue to enforce this prohibition.&lt;ref name=PrivateRight&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tokaji|first=Daniel P.|title=Public Rights and Private Rights of Action: The Enforcement of Federal Election Laws|journal=Indiana Law Review|year=2010|volume=44|url=http://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/ilr/pdf/vol44p113.pdf|accessdate=February 25, 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|138}} In ''Mobile v.

When determining whether a jurisdiction's election law violates this general prohibition, courts have relied on factors enumerated in the Senate Judiciary Committee report associated with the 1982 amendments ("Senate Factors"), including:
# The history of official discrimination in the jurisdiction that affects the right to vote;
# The degree to which voting in the jurisdiction is racially polarized;
# The extent of the jurisdiction's use of majority vote requirements, unusually large [[electoral district]]s, prohibitions on [[bullet voting]], and other devices that tend to enhance the opportunity for voting discrimination;
# Whether minority candidates are denied access to the jurisdiction's candidate slating processes, if any;
# The extent to which the jurisdiction's minorities are discriminated against in socioeconomic areas, such as education, employment, and health;
# Whether overt or subtle racial appeals in [[political campaign|campaigns]] exist;
# The extent to which minority candidates have won elections;
# The degree that elected officials are unresponsive to the concerns of the minority group; and
# Whether the policy justification for the challenged law is tenuous.
The report indicates not all or a majority of these factors need to exist for an electoral device to result in discrimination, and it also indicates that this list is not exhaustive, allowing courts to consider additional evidence at their discretion.&lt;ref name=DOJsection2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WayOut /&gt;{{rp|344}}&lt;ref name=1982report&gt;{{Citation-attribution|now=n|Senate Report No. 97-417 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28–29}}

Section 2 prohibits two types of discrimination: "vote denial", in which a person is denied the opportunity to cast a ballot or to have their vote properly counted, and "vote dilution", in which the strength or effectiveness of a person's vote is diminished.&lt;ref name=NewDenial&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tokaji|first=Daniel P.|title=The New Vote Denial: Where Election Reform Meets the Voting Rights Act|journal=South Carolina Law Review|year=2006|volume=57|ssrn=896786|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|691–692}} Most Section 2 litigation has concerned vote dilution, especially claims that a jurisdiction's [[redistricting]] plan or use of [[at-large]]/multimember elections prevents minority voters from casting sufficient votes to elect their preferred candidates.&lt;ref name=NewDenial /&gt;{{rp|708–709}} An at-large election can dilute the votes cast by minority voters by allowing a cohesive majority group to win every legislative seat in the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Ross J.|title=Whose Vote Counts?

In ''[[Thornburg v. Gingles]]'' (1986), the Supreme Court used the term "vote dilution through submergence" to describe claims that a jurisdiction's use of an at-large/multimember election system or gerrymandered redistricting plan diluted minority votes, and it established a legal framework for assessing such claims under Section 2.{{efn|In ''Gingles'', the Supreme Court held that the ''Gingles'' test applies to claims that an at-large election scheme results in vote dilution. The Court later held, in ''[[Growe v. Emison]]'', {{ussc|507|25|1993}}, that the ''Gingles'' test also applies to claims that a redistricting plan results in vote dilution through the arrangement of [[single-member district]]s.&lt;ref name=DeGrandy&gt;''[[Johnson v. De Grandy]]'', {{ussc|512|997|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1006}}}} Under the ''Gingles'' test, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions:
# The racial or language minority group "is sufficiently numerous and compact to form a majority in a [[single-member district]]";
# The minority group is "politically cohesive" (meaning its members tend to vote similarly); and
# The "majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it&amp;nbsp;... usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate."&lt;ref name=Gingles&gt;''[[Thornburg v. Gingles]]'', {{ussc|478|30|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50–51}}
The first precondition is known as the "compactness" requirement and concerns whether a [[majority-minority district]] can be created. The second and third preconditions are collectively known as the "racially polarized voting" or "racial bloc voting" requirement, and they concern whether the voting patterns of the different racial groups are different from each other. If a plaintiff proves these preconditions exist, then the plaintiff must additionally show, using the remaining Senate Factors and other evidence, that under the "[[totality of the circumstances]]", the jurisdiction's redistricting plan or use of at-large or multimember elections diminishes the ability of the minority group to elect candidates of its choice.&lt;ref name=WayOut /&gt;{{rp|344–345}}

Subsequent litigation further defined the contours of "vote dilution through submergence" claims. In ''[[Bartlett v. Strickland]]'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bartlett v. Strickland]]'', {{ussc|556|1|2009|source=f}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that the first ''Gingles'' precondition can be satisfied ''only'' if a district can be drawn in which the minority group comprises a majority of voting-age citizens. This means that plaintiffs cannot succeed on a submergence claim in jurisdictions where the size of the minority group, despite not being large enough to comprise a majority in a district, is large enough for its members to elect their preferred candidates with the help of "crossover" votes from some members of the majority group.&lt;ref name=Roseman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseman|first=Brandon|title=Equal Opportunities Do Not Always Equate to Equal Representation: How Bartlett v.

City of Baytown'', 840 F.2d 1240 (5th Cir.), ''cert denied'', {{ussc|492|905|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleventh Circuit,&lt;ref&gt;''Concerned Citizens v.

Kent County'', 76 F.3d 1381 (6th Cir. 1996) (en banc)&lt;/ref&gt; and Seventh Circuit&lt;ref&gt;''Frank v. Forest County'', 336 F.3d 570 (7th Cir. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; have rejected such suits.&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|703}}}}

The Supreme Court provided additional guidance on the "totality of the circumstances" test in ''[[Johnson v. De Grandy]]'' (1994).&lt;ref name=DeGrandy /&gt; The Court emphasized that the existence of the three ''Gingles'' preconditions may be insufficient to prove liability for vote dilution through submergence if other factors weigh against such a determination, especially in lawsuits challenging redistricting plans. In particular, the Court held that even where the three ''Gingles'' preconditions are satisfied, a jurisdiction is unlikely to be liable for vote dilution if its redistricting plan contains a number of majority-minority districts that is proportional to the minority group's population. The decision thus clarified that Section 2 does not require jurisdictions to maximize the number of majority-minority districts.&lt;ref name=Gerken&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerken|first=Heather K.|title=Understanding the Right to an Undiluted Vote|journal=Harvard Law Review|year=2001|volume=114|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/360/|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion also distinguished the proportionality of majority-minority districts, which allows minorities to have a proportional ''opportunity'' to elect their candidates of choice, from the proportionality of election ''results'', which Section 2 explicitly does not guarantee to minorities.&lt;ref name=DeGrandy /&gt;{{rp|1013–1014}}

An issue regarding the third ''Gingles'' precondition remains unresolved. In ''Gingles'', the Supreme Court split as to whether plaintiffs must prove that the majority racial group votes as a bloc specifically because its members are motivated to vote based on racial considerations and not other considerations that may overlap with race, such as party affiliation. A [[plurality opinion|plurality]] of justices said that requiring such proof would violate Congress's intent to make Section 2 a "results" test, but Justice White maintained that the proof was necessary to show that an electoral scheme results in ''racial'' discrimination.&lt;ref name=GinglesNew&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosterlitz|first=Mary J.|title=Thornburg v.

Alamance County'', 99 F.3d 600 (4th Cir. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; have held that such proof is not an absolute requirement for liability but is a relevant additional factor under the "totality of the circumstances" test.

Although most Section 2 litigation has involved claims of vote dilution through submergence,&lt;ref name=NewDenial /&gt;{{rp|708–709}} courts also have addressed other types of vote dilution under this provision. In ''[[Holder v. Hall]]'' (1994),&lt;ref name=Holder&gt;''[[Holder v. Hall]]'', {{ussc|512|874|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that claims that minority votes are diluted by the small size of a governing body, such as a one-person [[county commission]], may not be brought under Section 2. A plurality of the Court reasoned that no uniform, non-dilutive "benchmark" size for a governing body exists, making relief under Section 2 impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guinier|first=Lani|title=(e)Racing Democracy: The Voting Rights Cases|journal=Harvard Law Review|year=1994|volume=108|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/guinier/publications/comment.pdf|accessdate=November 24, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of vote dilution may result from a jurisdiction's requirement that a candidate be elected by a [[majority vote]]. A majority-vote requirement may cause a minority group's candidate of choice, who would have won the election with a simple [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes, to lose after a majority of voters unite behind another candidate in a [[two-round system|runoff election]]. The Supreme Court has not addressed whether such claims may be brought under Section 2, and lower courts have reached different conclusions on the issue.{{efn|The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that challenges to majority-vote requirements under Section 2 are not cognizable,&lt;ref&gt;''Butts v.

====Specific prohibitions====
The Act contains several specific prohibitions on conduct that may interfere with a person's ability to cast an effective vote. One of these prohibitions is prescribed in Section 201, which prohibits any jurisdiction from requiring a person to comply with any "test or device" to register to vote or cast a ballot. The term "test or device" is defined as literacy tests, educational or knowledge requirements, proof of good moral character, and requirements that a person be vouched for when voting.&lt;ref&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 201; {{usc|52|10501}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973aa)&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Act's enactment, these devices were the primary tools used by jurisdictions to prevent racial minorities from voting.&lt;ref name=Main&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pitts|first=Michael J.|title=The Voting Rights Act and the Era of Maintenance|journal=Alabama Law Review|year=2008|volume=59|ssrn=1105115|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the Act suspended tests or devices temporarily in jurisdictions covered by the Section 4(b) coverage formula, but Congress subsequently expanded the prohibition to the entire country and made it permanent.&lt;ref name=RevisedBailout /&gt;{{rp|6–9}} Relatedly, Section 202 prohibits jurisdictions from imposing any "durational residency requirement" that requires persons to have lived in the jurisdiction for more than 30 days before being eligible to vote in a presidential election.&lt;ref name=Defending&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tokaji|first=Daniel P.|title=Intent and Its Alternatives: Defending the New Voting Rights Act|journal=Alabama Law Review|year=2006|volume=58|url=http://www.law.ua.edu/pubs/lrarticles/Volume%2058/Issue%202/tokaji.pdf|accessdate=January 7, 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|353}}

Several further protections for voters are contained in Section 11. Section 11(a) prohibits any person acting under [[color of law]] from refusing or failing to allow a qualified person to vote or to count a qualified voter's ballot. Similarly, Section 11(b) prohibits any person from intimidating, harassing, or coercing another person for voting or attempting to vote.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt; Two provisions in Section 11 address [[voter fraud]]: Section 11(c) prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to vote in a federal election, and Section 11(e) prohibits voting twice in a federal election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brewster|first1=Henry|last2=Dubler|first2=Grant|last3=Klym|first3=Peter|title=Election Law Violations|journal=American Criminal Law Review|year=2013|volume=50|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=50+Am.+Crim.+L.+Rev.+765&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=5b24ce89b18635a48d791eed5ae22e4e|accessdate=January 4, 2014}} {{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Oliveira|first=Pedro|title=Same Day Voter Registration: Post-Crawford Reform to Address the Growing Burdens on Lower-Income Voters|journal=Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law and Policy|year=2009|volume=16|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=16+Geo.+J.+Poverty+Law+%26+Pol'y+345&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=e5141b57dda7c0e0882b8958baae1ddd|accessdate=January 4, 2014}} {{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|360}}

Finally, under Section 208, a jurisdiction may not prevent anyone who is English-illiterate or has a [[disability]] from being accompanied into the ballot box by an assistant of the person's choice. The only exceptions are that the assistant may not be an [[Law of agency|agent]] of the person's employer or union.&lt;ref name=enfranchise /&gt;{{rp|221}}

====Bail-in====
Section 3(c) contains a "bail-in" or "pocket trigger" process by which jurisdictions that fall outside the coverage formula of Section 4(b) may become subject to preclearance. Under this provision, if a jurisdiction has racially discriminated against voters in violation of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments, a court may order the jurisdiction to have future changes to its election laws preapproved by the federal government.&lt;ref name=bail-in /&gt;{{rp|2006–2007}} Because courts have interpreted the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to prohibit only intentional discrimination, a court may bail in a jurisdiction only if the plaintiff proves that the jurisdiction enacted or operated a voting practice to purposely discriminate.&lt;ref name=bail-in /&gt;{{rp|2009}}

Section 3(c) contains its own preclearance language and differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction until such time as the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance for as long as the court orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of [[New Mexico]] in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.&lt;ref name=bail-in /&gt;{{rp|2009–2010}}&lt;ref name=section3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/42usc/subch_ia2.php#anchor_1973 |title=Section 3 of the Voting Rights Act |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) was little used; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, including 16 local governments and the states of Arkansas and New Mexico.&lt;ref name=DOJbrief&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief for the Federal Respondent, Shelby County v.

A more narrow bail-in process pertaining to federal observer certification is prescribed in Section 3(a). Under this provision, a federal court may certify a non-covered jurisdiction to receive federal observers if the court determines that the jurisdiction violated the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments. Jurisdictions certified to receive federal observers under Section 3(a) are not subject to preclearance.&lt;ref name=Observers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=James Thomas|title=The Power of Observation: The Role of Federal Observers Under the Voting Rights Act|journal=Michigan Journal of Race and Law|year=2007|volume=13|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=13+Mich.+J.+Race+%26+L.+227&amp;key=b99b2720f9f2a990705b288d64ad3365|accessdate=January 1, 2014}} {{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|236–237}}

===Special provisions===
{{see also|List of jurisdictions subject to the special provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965}}

====Coverage formula====
[[File:Us s5 cvr08.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Map depicting states and counties encompassed by the Act's coverage formula in January 2008 (excluding bailed-out jurisdictions)|States and counties encompassed by the Act's coverage formula in January 2008 (excluding bailed-out jurisdictions). Several counties subsequently bailed out,&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt; but the majority of the map accurately depicts covered jurisdictions before the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'' (2013), which declared the coverage formula unconstitutional.]]
Section 4(b) contains a "coverage formula" that determines which states and local governments may be subjected to the Act's other special provisions (except for the Section 203(c) bilingual election requirements, which fall under a different formula). Congress intended for the coverage formula to encompass the most pervasively discriminatory jurisdictions. A jurisdiction is covered by the formula if:

# As of November 1, 1964, 1968, or 1972, the jurisdiction used a "test or device" to restrict the opportunity to register and vote; and
# Less than half of the jurisdiction's eligible citizens were registered to vote on November 1, 1964, 1968, or 1972; or less than half of eligible citizens voted in the presidential election of November 1964, 1968, or 1972.

As originally enacted, the coverage formula contained only November 1964 triggering dates; subsequent revisions to the law supplemented it with the additional triggering dates of November 1968 and November 1972, which brought more jurisdictions into coverage.&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt; For purposes of the coverage formula, the term "test or device" includes the same four devices prohibited nationally by Section 201—literacy tests, educational or knowledge requirements, proof of good moral character, and requirements that a person be vouched for when voting—and one further device defined in Section 4(f)(3): in jurisdictions where more than 5% of the citizen voting age population are members of a single language minority group, any practice or requirement by which registration or election materials are provided only in English. The types of jurisdictions that the coverage formula applies to include states and "political subdivisions" of states.&lt;ref name=enfranchise /&gt;{{rp|207–208}} Section 14(c)(2) defines "political subdivision" to mean any county, parish, or "other subdivision of a State which conducts registration for voting."&lt;ref&gt;Voting Rights Act § 14(c)(2); {{usc|52|10310(c)(2)}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973l(c)(2))&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1965 coverage formula included the whole of Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia; and some subdivisions (usually counties) in Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, and North Carolina.&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt; The 1968 coverage resulted in the partial coverage of Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Wyoming. Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, and Wyoming filed successful "bailout" lawsuits, as also provided by section 4.&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt; The 1972 coverage formula covered the whole of Alaska, Arizona, and Texas, and parts of California, Florida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Dakota.&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt; The special provisions of the Act were due to expire in 1970, and Congress renewed them for another five years. In 1975, the Act's special provisions were extended for another seven years. In 1982, the coverage formula was extended again, this time for 25 years, but no changes were made to the coverage, and in 2006, the coverage formula was again extended for 25 years.&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt;

Throughout its history, the coverage formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions, most of which were in the Deep South. In ''Shelby County v. Holder'' (2013), the Supreme Court declared the coverage formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state [[sovereignty]] and [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]].&lt;ref name="shelby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liptak, A"&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court Invalidates Key Part of Voting Rights Act|author=Liptak, A.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 25, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other special provisions that are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, these provisions are unenforceable.&lt;ref name="scotusblogplain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rolls back"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/06/25/high-court-rolls-back-the-voting-rights-act-of-1965/ | title=High Court Rolls Back the Voting Rights Act of 1965 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=June 25, 2013| accessdate=June 25, 2013 | author=Von Drehle, David|authorlink=David Von Drehle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preclearance requirement====
Section 5&lt;ref name="VRA-5"&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 5; {{usc|52|10304}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973c)&lt;/ref&gt; requires that covered jurisdictions receive federal approval, known as "preclearance", before implementing changes to their election laws. A covered jurisdiction has the burden of proving that the change does not have the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of race or language minority status; if the jurisdiction fails to meet this burden, the federal government will deny preclearance and the jurisdiction's change will not go into effect. The Supreme Court broadly interpreted Section 5's scope in ''[[Allen v. State Board of Election]]'' (1969),&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;''[[Allen v. State Board of Elections]]'', {{ussc|393|544|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; holding that any change in a jurisdiction's voting practices, even if minor, must be submitted for preclearance.&lt;ref name=DOJCoveredChanges&gt;{{cite web|title=What Must  Be Submitted Under Section 5|url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/types.php|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also held that if a jurisdiction fails to have its voting change precleared, private plaintiffs may sue the jurisdiction in the plaintiff's local district court before a three-judge panel.{{efn|The Supreme Court subsequently held that plaintiffs may alternatively bring Section 5 enforcement actions in state courts.&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|534}}&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hathorn v. Lovorn]]'', {{ussc|457|255|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In these Section 5 "enforcement actions", a court considers whether the jurisdiction made a covered voting change, and if so, whether the change has been precleared. If the jurisdiction improperly failed to obtain preclearance, then the court will order the jurisdiction to obtain preclearance before implementing the change. However, the court may not consider the merits of whether the change should be approved.&lt;ref name=DOJsection5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PrivateRight /&gt;{{rp|128–129}}&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt;{{rp|556}}&lt;ref name=Lopez1&gt;''[[Lopez v. Monterey County]]'' (''Lopez I''), {{ussc|519|9|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}}

Jurisdictions may seek preclearance through either an "administrative preclearance" process or a "judicial preclearance" process. If a jurisdiction seeks administrative preclearance, the Attorney General will consider whether the proposed change has a discriminatory purpose or effect. After the jurisdiction submits the proposed change, the Attorney General has 60 days to interpose an objection to it. The 60-day period may be extended an additional 60 days if the jurisdiction later submits additional information. If the Attorney General interposes an objection, then the change is not precleared and may not be implemented.&lt;ref name=Posner&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posner|first=Mark A.|title=The Real Story Behind the Justice Department's Implementation of Section 5 of the VRA: Vigorous Enforcement, As Intended by Congress|journal=Duke Journal of Constitutional Law &amp; Public Policy|year=2006|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/djclpp/vol1/iss1/2/|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|90–92}} The Attorney General's decision is not subject to [[Judicial review in the United States|judicial review]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Morris v.

In several cases, the Supreme Court has addressed the meaning of "discriminatory effect" and "discriminatory purpose" for Section 5 purposes. In ''[[Beer v. United States]]'' (1976),&lt;ref name=beer&gt;''[[Beer v. United States]]'', {{ussc|425|130|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Court held that for a voting change to have a prohibited discriminatory effect, it must result in "retrogression" (backsliding). Under this standard, a voting change that causes discrimination, but does not result in ''more'' discrimination than before the change was made, cannot be denied preclearance for having a discriminatory effect.&lt;ref name=end&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCrary|first1=Peyton|last2=Seaman|first2=Christopher|last3=Valelly|first3=Richard|title=The End of Preclearance As We Knew It: How the Supreme Court Transformed Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act|journal=Michigan Journal of Race and Law|year=2006|volume=11|ssrn=1913565|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|283–284}} For example, replacing a poll tax with an equally expensive voter registration fee is not a "retrogressive" change because it causes equal discrimination, not more.&lt;ref name=ironic&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kousser|first=J. Morgan|title=The Strange, Ironic Career of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 1965–2007|journal=Texas Law Review|year=2008|volume=86|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/31447149/strange-ironic-career-section-5-voting-rights-act-1965-2007|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}{{Subscription or libraries|s|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|695}} Relying on the Senate report for the Act, the Court reasoned that the retrogression standard was the correct interpretation of the term "discriminatory effect" because Section 5's purpose is " 'to insure that [the gains thus far achieved in minority political participation] shall not be destroyed through new [discriminatory] procedures' ".&lt;ref name=beer /&gt;{{rp|140–141}} The retrogression standard applies irrespective of whether the voting change allegedly causes vote denial or vote dilution.&lt;ref name=end /&gt;{{rp|311}}

In 2003, the Supreme Court held in ''Georgia v. Ashcroft''&lt;ref name=Ash /&gt; that courts should not determine that a new redistricting plan has a retrogressive effect solely because the plan decreases the number of minority-majority districts. The Court emphasized that judges should analyze various other factors under the "totality of the circumstances", such as whether the redistricting plan increases the number of "influence districts" in which a minority group is large enough to influence (but not decide) election outcomes. In 2006, Congress overturned this decision by amending Section 5 to explicitly state that "diminishing the ability [of a protected minority] to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote within the meaning of" Section 5.&lt;ref&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 5(b); {{usc|52|10304(b)}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973c(b))&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertainty remains as to what this language precisely means and how courts may interpret it.&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|551–552, 916}}

Before 2000, the "discriminatory purpose" prong of Section 5 was understood to mean ''any'' discriminatory purpose, which is the same standard used to determine whether discrimination is unconstitutional. In ''[[Reno v. Bossier Parish]]'' (''Bossier Parish II'') (2000),&lt;ref name=Reno /&gt; the Supreme Court extended the retrogression standard, holding that for a voting change to have a "discriminatory purpose" under Section 5, the change must have been implemented for a ''retrogressive'' purpose. Therefore, a voting change intended to discriminate against a protected minority was permissible under Section 5 so long as the change was not intended to increase existing discrimination.&lt;ref name=end /&gt;{{rp|277–278}} This change significantly reduced the number of instances in which preclearance was denied based on discriminatory purpose. In 2006, Congress overturned ''Bossier Parish II'' by amending Section 5 to explicitly define "purpose" to mean "any discriminatory purpose."&lt;ref name=Promise /&gt;{{rp|199–200, 207}}&lt;ref&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 5(c); {{usc|52|10304(c)}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. 1973c(c))&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal examiners and observers====
Until the 2006 amendments to the Act,&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;{{rp|50}} Section 6 allowed the appointment of "federal examiners" to oversee certain jurisdictions' voter registration functions. Federal examiners could be assigned to a covered jurisdiction if the Attorney General certified that
# The Department of Justice received 20 or more meritorious complaints that the covered jurisdiction denied its residents the right to vote based on race or language minority status; or
# The assignment of federal examiners was otherwise necessary to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments.&lt;ref name=Observers /&gt;{{rp|235–236}}
Federal examiners had the authority to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls.&lt;ref name=Observers /&gt;{{rp|237}} The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.&lt;ref name=Observers /&gt;{{rp|238–239}}

Under the Act's original framework, in any jurisdiction certified for federal examiners, the Attorney General could additionally require the appointment of "federal observers". By 2006, the federal examiner provision was used solely as a means to appoint federal observers.&lt;ref name=Observers /&gt;{{rp|239}} When Congress repealed the federal examiner provision in 2006, Congress amended Section 8 to allow for the assignment of federal observers to jurisdictions that satisfied the same certification criteria that had been used to appoint federal examiners.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;{{rp|50}}

Federal observers are tasked with observing poll worker and voter conduct at polling places during an election and observing election officials tabulate the ballots.&lt;ref name="Observers" /&gt;{{rp|248}} The goal of the federal observer provision is to facilitate minority voter participation by deterring and documenting instances of discriminatory conduct in the election process, such as election officials denying qualified minority persons the right to cast a ballot, intimidation or harassment of voters on [[election day]], or improper vote counting.&lt;ref name="Observers" /&gt;{{rp|231–235}} Discriminatory conduct that federal observers document may also serve as evidence in subsequent enforcement lawsuits.&lt;ref name="Observers" /&gt;{{rp|233}} Between 1965 and the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in ''Shelby County v. Holder'' to strike down the coverage formula, the Attorney General certified 153 local governments across 11 states.&lt;ref name="DOJobservers"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Federal Observers and Election Monitoring|url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/examine/activ_exam.php|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of time and resource constraints, federal observers are not assigned to every certified jurisdiction for every election.&lt;ref name="Observers" /&gt;{{rp|230}} Separate provisions allow for a certified jurisdiction to "bail out" of its certification.&lt;ref name="DOJobservers" /&gt;

====Bailout====
Under Section 4(a), a covered jurisdiction may seek exemption from coverage through a process called "bailout."&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt; To achieve an exemption, a covered jurisdiction must obtain a declaratory judgment from a three-judge panel of the District Court for D.C. that the jurisdiction is eligible to bail out.&lt;ref name=DOJsection5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt; As originally enacted, a covered jurisdiction was eligible to bail out if it had not used a test or device with a discriminatory purpose or effect during the 5 years preceding its bailout request.&lt;ref name=RevisedBailout /&gt;{{rp|22, 33–34}} Therefore, a jurisdiction that requested to bail out in 1967 would have needed to prove that it had not misused a test or device since at least 1962. Until 1970, this effectively required a covered jurisdiction to prove that it had not misused a test or device since before the Act was enacted five years earlier in 1965,&lt;ref name=RevisedBailout /&gt;{{rp|6}} making it impossible for many covered jurisdictions to bail out.&lt;ref name=RevisedBailout /&gt;{{rp|27}} However, Section 4(a) also prohibited covered jurisdictions from using tests or devices in any manner, discriminatory or otherwise; hence, under the original Act, a covered jurisdiction would become eligible for bailout in 1970 by simply complying with this requirement. But in the course of amending the Act in 1970 and 1975 to extend the special provisions, Congress also extended the period of time that a covered jurisdiction must not have misused a test or device to 10 years and then to 17 years, respectively.&lt;ref name=RevisedBailout /&gt;{{rp|7, 9}} These extensions continued the effect of requiring jurisdictions to prove that they had not misused a test or device since before the Act's enactment in 1965.

In 1982, Congress amended Section 4(a) to make bailout easier to achieve in two ways. First, Congress provided that if a state is covered, local governments in that state may bail out even if the state is ineligible to bail out.&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt; Second, Congress liberalized the eligibility criteria by replacing the 17-year requirement with a new standard, allowing a covered jurisdiction to bail out by proving that in the 10 years preceding its bailout request:
# The jurisdiction did not use a test or device with a discriminatory purpose or effect;
# No court determined that the jurisdiction denied or abridged the right to vote based on racial or language minority status;
# The jurisdiction complied with the preclearance requirement;
# The federal government did not assign federal examiners to the jurisdiction;
# The jurisdiction abolished discriminatory election practices; and
# The jurisdiction took affirmative steps to eliminate voter intimidation and expand voting opportunities for protected minorities.
Additionally, Congress required jurisdictions seeking bailout to produce evidence of minority registration and voting rates, including how these rates have changed over time and in comparison to the registration and voting rates of the majority. If the court determines that the covered jurisdiction is eligible for bailout, it will enter a declaratory judgment in the jurisdiction's favor. The court will retain jurisdiction for the following 10 years and may order the jurisdiction back into coverage if the jurisdiction subsequently engages in voting discrimination.&lt;ref name=RevisedBailout /&gt;&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;{{rp|22–23}}&lt;ref name="VRA-4(a)"&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 4(a); {{usc|52|10301(a)(1)(F)}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a)(1)(F))&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1982 amendment to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984.&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt; Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the bailout request.&lt;ref name=DOJbrief /&gt;{{rp|54}} Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia.&lt;ref name=DOJsection4 /&gt; In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in ''[[Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder]]'' (2009),&lt;ref name=NW&gt;''[[Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder]]'', {{ussc|557|193|2009|source=f}}&lt;/ref&gt; which held that local governments that do not register voters have the ability to bail out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/us/23scotus.html |title=Justices Let Stand a Central Provision of Voting Rights Act |last=Liptak |first=Adam |date=June 23, 2009 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in ''Shelby County v.

Separate provisions allow a covered jurisdiction that has been certified to receive federal observers to bail out of its certification alone. Under Section 13, the Attorney General may terminate the certification of a jurisdiction if 1) more than 50% of the jurisdiction's minority voting age population is registered to vote, and 2) there is no longer reasonable cause to believe that residents may experience voting discrimination. Alternatively, the District Court for D.C. may order the certification terminated.&lt;ref name=Observers /&gt;{{rp|237, 239}}&lt;ref name=DOJobservers /&gt;

====Bilingual election requirements====
Two provisions require certain jurisdictions to provide election materials to voters in multiple languages: Section 4(f)(4) and Section 203(c). A jurisdiction covered by either provision must provide all materials related to an election—such as voter registration materials, ballots, notices, and instructions—in the language of any applicable language minority group residing in the jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=enfranchise /&gt;{{rp|209}} Language minority groups protected by these provisions include Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Alaskans.&lt;ref&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 4(f)(4); {{usc|52|10303(f)(4)}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(f)(4))&lt;/ref&gt; Congress enacted the provisions to break down language barriers and combat pervasive language discrimination against the protected groups.&lt;ref name=enfranchise /&gt;{{rp|200, 209}}

Section 4(f)(4) applies to any jurisdiction encompassed by the Section 4(b) coverage formula where more than 5% of the citizen voting age population are members of a single language minority group. Section 203(c) contains a formula that is separate from the Section 4(b) coverage formula, and therefore jurisdictions covered solely by 203(c) are not subject to the Act's other special provisions, such as preclearance. The Section 203(c) formula encompasses jurisdictions where the following conditions exist:
&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single language minority is present that has an English-illiteracy rate higher than the national average; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of "limited-English proficient" members of the language minority group is at least 10,000 voting-age citizens or large enough to comprise at least 5% of the jurisdiction's voting-age citizen population; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The jurisdiction is a political subdivision that contains an [[Indian reservation]], and more than 5% of the jurisdiction's American Indian or Alaska Native voting-age citizens are members of a single language minority and are limited-English proficient.&lt;ref name=enfranchise /&gt;{{rp|223–224}}&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Section 203(b) defines "limited-English proficient" as being "unable to speak or understand English adequately enough
to participate in the electoral process".&lt;ref name=enfranchise /&gt;{{rp|223}} Determinations as to which jurisdictions satisfy the Section 203(c) criteria occur once a decade following completion of the decennial census; at these times, new jurisdictions may come into coverage while others may have their coverage terminated. Additionally, under Section 203(d), a jurisdiction may "bail out" of Section 203(c) coverage by proving in federal court that no language minority group within the jurisdiction has an English illiteracy rate that is higher than the national illiteracy rate.&lt;ref name=enfranchise /&gt;{{rp|226}} After the 2010 census, 150 jurisdictions across 25 states were covered under Section 203(c), including statewide coverage of California, Texas, and Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Groves |first=Robert M. |title=Voting Rights Act Amendments of 2006, Determinations Under Section 203 |journal=Federal Register |date=October 13, 2011 |volume=76 |issue=198 |url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_203/2011_notice.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MT1HTPZz?url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_203/2011_notice.pdf |archivedate=January 8, 2014 |format=PDF |accessdate=February 23, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its enactment in 1965, the law immediately decreased racial discrimination in voting. The suspension of literacy tests and the assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for high numbers of racial minorities to register to vote.&lt;ref name=NewDenial /&gt;{{rp|702}} Nearly 250,000 African Americans registered in 1965, one-third of whom were registered by federal examiners.&lt;ref name=DonInfoImpact&gt;{{Citation-attribution|now=n|{{cite web|title=Voting Rights Act (1965): Document Info|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=100|publisher=Our Documents|accessdate=September 8, 2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In covered jurisdictions, less than one-third (29.3%) of the African American population was registered in 1965; by 1967, this number increased to more than half (52.1%),&lt;ref name=NewDenial /&gt;{{rp|702}} and a majority of African American residents became registered to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states.&lt;ref name=DonInfoImpact /&gt; Similar increases were seen in the number of African Americans elected to office: between 1965 and 1985, African Americans elected as state legislators in the 11 former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] increased from 3 to 176.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grofman|first1=Bernard|last2=Handley|first2=Lisa|title=The Impact of the Voting Rights Act on Black Representation in Southern State Legislatures|journal=Legislative Studies Quarterly|date=February 1991|volume=16|issue=1|url=http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~bgrofman/40%20Grofman-Handley-Impact%20of%20VRA%20on%20representation.pdf|accessdate=January 5, 2014|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|112}} Nationwide, the number of African American elected officials increased from 1,469 in 1970 to 4,912 in 1980.&lt;ref name=Main /&gt;{{rp|919}} By 2011, the number was approximately 10,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eilperin|first=Juliet|title=What's Changed for African Americans Since 1963, By the Numbers|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/08/22/whats-changed-for-african-americans-since-1963-by-the-numbers|accessdate=January 5, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, registration rates for language minority groups increased after Congress enacted the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992. In 1973, the percent of Hispanics registered to vote was 34.9%; by 2006, that amount nearly doubled. The number of Asian Americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58% by 2006.&lt;ref name=enfranchise /&gt;{{rp|233–235}}

After the Act's initial success in combating tactics designed to deny minorities access to the polls, the Act became predominately used as a tool to challenge racial vote dilution.&lt;ref name=NewDenial /&gt;{{rp|691}} Starting in the 1970s, the Attorney General commonly raised Section 5 objections to voting changes that decreased the effectiveness of racial minorities' votes, including discriminatory [[annexation]]s, redistricting plans, and election methods such as at-large election systems, runoff election requirements, and prohibitions on bullet voting.&lt;ref name=Posner /&gt;{{rp|105–106}} In total, 81% (2,541) of preclearance objections made between 1965 and 2006 were based on vote dilution.&lt;ref name=Posner /&gt;{{rp|102}} Claims brought under Section 2 have also predominately concerned vote dilution.&lt;ref name=NewDenial /&gt;{{rp|708–709}} Between the 1982 creation of the Section 2 results test and 2006, at least 331 Section 2 lawsuits resulted in published judicial opinions. In the 1980s, 60% of Section 2 lawsuits challenged at-large election systems; in the 1990s, 37.2% challenged at-large election systems and 38.5% challenged redistricting plans. Overall, plaintiffs succeeded in 37.2% of the 331 lawsuits, and they were more likely to succeed in lawsuits brought against covered jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=documenting&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Ellen|last2=Aisenbrey|first2=Margaret|last3=Baldwin|first3=Anna|last4=Cheuse|first4=Emma|last5=Weisbrodt|first5=Anna|title=Documenting Discrimination in Voting: Judicial Findings Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act|journal=University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform|year=2006|volume=39|ssrn=1029386|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|654–656}}

By enfranchising racial minorities, the Act facilitated a [[political realignment]] of the Democratic and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate [[Southern politics]]. After Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised racial minorities began to vote for liberal Democratic candidates throughout the South, and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse.&lt;ref name=polar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pildes|first=Richard H.|title=Why the Center Does Not Hold: The Causes of Hyperpolarized Democracy in America|journal=California Law Review|date=April 2011|volume=99|ssrn=1646989|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|290}} These dual trends caused the two parties to ideologically polarize, with the Democratic Party becoming more liberal and the Republican Party becoming more conservative.&lt;ref name=polar /&gt;{{rp|290}} The trends also created competition between the two parties,&lt;ref name=polar /&gt;{{rp|290}} which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the [[Southern strategy]].&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nixon's Southern Strategy: 'It's All in the Charts'|last=Boyd|first=James |date=May 17, 1970|publisher=''The New York Times''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/phillips-southern.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall.&lt;ref name=polar /&gt;{{rp|292}} By the mid-1990s, these trends culminated in a political realignment: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South,&lt;ref name=polar /&gt;{{rp|294}} with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.&lt;ref name="Bending" /&gt;{{rp|203}}

A 2016 study in the ''American Journal of Political Science'' found "that members of Congress who represented jurisdictions subject to the preclearance requirement were substantially more supportive of civil rights–related legislation than legislators who did not represent covered jurisdictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schuit|first=Sophie|last2=Rogowski|first2=Jon C.|date=December 1, 2016 |title=Race, Representation, and the Voting Rights Act |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12284/abstract |journal=American Journal of Political Science |volume=61|issue=3|language=en |pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/ajps.12284|issn=1540-5907}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study in ''The Journal of Politics'' found that Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act "increased black voter registration by 14–19 percentage points, white registration by 10–13 percentage points, and overall voter turnout by 10–19 percentage points.

==Constitutionality==

===Voter eligibility provisions===
Early in the Act's enforcement history, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of several provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. In ''[[Katzenbach v. Morgan]]'' (1966), the Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 4(e). This section prohibits jurisdictions from administering literacy tests to citizens who attain a sixth-grade education in an American school in which the predominant language was Spanish, such as schools in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;Voting Rights Act of 1965 § 4(e); {{usc|52|10303(e)}} (formerly 42 U.S.C. § 1973b(e))&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Court had earlier held in ''[[Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections]]'' (1959) that literacy tests did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lassiter v. Northampton County Board of Elections]]'', {{ussc|360|45|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Morgan'' the Court held that Congress could enforce Fourteenth Amendment rights—such as the right to vote—by prohibiting conduct it deemed to interfere with such rights, even if that conduct may not be independently unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buss|first=William G.|title=Federalism, Separation of Powers, and the Demise of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act|journal=Iowa Law Review|date=January 1998|volume=83|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ilr83&amp;div=19|accessdate=January 7, 2014}} {{subscription required|s}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|405–406}}&lt;ref&gt;''[[Katzenbach v. Morgan]]'', {{ussc|384|641|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|652–656}} After Congress created a nationwide ban on all literacy tests and similar devices in 1970 by enacting Section 201, the Court upheld the ban as constitutional in ''[[Oregon v. Mitchell]]'' (1970).&lt;ref name=Defending /&gt;&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;''[[Oregon v. Mitchell]]'', {{ussc|400|112|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in ''Oregon v. Mitchell'', the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]] the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in ''Oregon v. Mitchell'', and a majority of justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.&lt;ref name=Defending /&gt;{{rp|353}}&lt;ref name=Oregon /&gt;{{rp|118–121}}

===Section 2 results test===
The constitutionality of Section 2, which contains a general prohibition on discriminatory voting laws, has not been definitively explained by the Supreme Court. As amended in 1982, Section 2 prohibits any voting practice that has a discriminatory effect, irrespective of whether the practice was enacted or is administered for the purpose of discriminating. This "results test" contrasts with the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, both of which directly prohibit only purposeful discrimination. Given this disparity, whether the Supreme Court would uphold the constitutionality of Section 2 as appropriate legislation passed to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, and under what rationale, remains unclear.&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|758–759}}

In ''Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;''Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks'', {{ussc|469|1002|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, without a written opinion, a lower court's decision that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Court Backs Voting Plan| first=Al| last=Kamen| date=November 14, 1984| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/11/14/court-backs-voting-plan/0591488a-04a4-4efa-aca3-3599338bcc59/| work=[[The Washington Post]]| accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the opinion. Their reasoning was that the case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing. In later cases, the Supreme Court is more likely to disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written opinion, but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as being as equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to ''Brooks'', the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|759–760}}

===Coverage formula and preclearance===
The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the Section 5 preclearance requirement in three cases. The first case was ''[[South Carolina v. Katzenbach]]'' (1966),&lt;ref name=SCvK&gt;''[[South Carolina v. Katzenbach]]'', {{ussc|383|301|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was decided about five months after the Act's enactment. The Court held that Section 5 constituted a valid use of Congress's power to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment, reasoning that "exceptional circumstances" of pervasive racial discrimination, combined with the inadequacy of case-by-case litigation in ending that discrimination, justified the preclearance requirement.&lt;ref name=SCvK /&gt;{{rp|334–335}}&lt;ref name=TimeStill&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posner|first=Mark A.|title=Time is Still on Its Side: Why Congressional Reauthorization of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act Represents a Congruent and Proportional Response to Our Nation's History of Discrimination in Voting|journal=New York University Journal of Legislation and Public Policy|year=2006|volume=10|url=http://www.nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/POSNER-TIME-IS-STILL-ON-ITS-SIDE.pdf|accessdate=December 14, 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}} The Court also upheld the constitutionality of the 1965 coverage formula, saying that it was "rational in both practice and theory" and that the bailout provision provided adequate relief for jurisdictions that may not deserve coverage.&lt;ref name=SCvK /&gt;{{rp|330}}&lt;ref name=TimeStill /&gt;{{rp|76–77}}

The Supreme Court again upheld the preclearance requirement in ''[[City of Rome v. United States]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name=Rome&gt;''[[City of Rome v. United States]]'', {{ussc|446|156|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court held that because Congress had explicit constitutional power to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments "by appropriate legislation", the Act did not violate principles of federalism. The Court also explicitly upheld the "discriminatory effect" prong of Section 5, stating that even though the Fifteenth Amendment directly prohibited only intentional discrimination, Congress could constitutionally prohibit unintentional discrimination to mitigate the risk that jurisdictions may engage in intentional discrimination. Finally, the Court upheld the 1975 extension of Section 5 because of the record of discrimination that continued to persist in the covered jurisdictions. The Court further suggested that the temporary nature of the special provisions was relevant to Section 5's constitutionality.&lt;ref name=TimeStill /&gt;{{rp|77–78}}

The final case in which the Supreme Court upheld Section 5 was ''[[Lopez v. Monterey County]]'' (''Lopez II'') (1999).&lt;ref name=Lopez2&gt;''[[Lopez v. Monterey County]]'' (''Lopez II''), {{ussc|525|266|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Lopez II'', the Court reiterated its reasoning in ''Katzenbach'' and ''Rome'', and it upheld as constitutional the requirement that covered local governments obtain preclearance before implementing voting changes that their parent state required them to implement, even if the parent state was not itself a covered jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=TimeStill /&gt;{{rp|78}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Charlotte Marx|title=Lopez v. Monterey County: A Remedy Gone Too Far?|journal=Baylor Law Review|date=2000|volume=52|url=http://0-www.heinonline.org.polar.onu.edu/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/baylr52&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;index=journals/baylr1&amp;id=1|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|447}}

The 2006 extension of Section 5 was challenged before the Supreme Court in ''[[Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder]]'' (2009).&lt;ref name=NW /&gt; The lawsuit was brought by a municipal water district in Texas that elected members to a [[water board]]. The District wished to move a voting location from a private home to a public school, but that change was subject to preclearance because Texas was a covered jurisdiction. The District did not register voters, and thus it did not appear to qualify as a "political subdivision" eligible to bail out of coverage. Although the Court indicated in [[dicta]] (a non-binding part of the court's opinion) that Section 5 presented difficult constitutional questions, it did not declare Section 5 unconstitutional; instead, it interpreted the law to allow any covered local government, including one that does not register voters, to obtain an exemption from preclearance if it meets the bailout requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Justices Retain Oversight by U.S. on Voting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/us/23scotus.html|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=January 21, 2014|date=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bravin, Jess |title=Supreme Court Avoids Voting-Rights Act Fight |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB124567014181036773 |publisher=''The Wall Street Journal'' |date=June 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307161816/https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB124567014181036773 |archivedate=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2012, the Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] in the case of ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'' limited to the question of "whether Congress' decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b)&amp;nbsp;... exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, thus violating the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] and [[Article IV of the United States Constitution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/110912zr_d18e.pdf|title=Certiorari Granted|work=Order List: 568 U.S.|publisher=U.S. Supreme Court|date=November 9, 2012|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=supremes&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/02/27/the-supreme-court-voting-rights-act-case-explained/|title=Everything You Need to Know about the Supreme Court Voting Rights Act Case|work=Washington Post|date=February 27, 2013|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, 2013, the Court struck down Section 4(b) as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="shelby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rolls back" /&gt; The Court reasoned that the coverage formula violates the constitutional principles of "equal sovereignty of the states" and federalism because its disparate treatment of the states is "based on 40 year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day", which makes the formula unresponsive to current needs.&lt;ref name="shelby" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liptak, A"/&gt; The Court did not strike down Section 5, but without Section 4(b), no jurisdiction may be subject to Section 5 preclearance unless Congress enacts a new coverage formula.&lt;ref name="scotusblogplain" /&gt; After the decision, several states that were fully or partially covered—including Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina—implemented laws that were previously denied preclearance.

===Racial gerrymandering===
{{main|Gerrymandering in the United States#Affirmative|l1=Gerrymandering in the United States: Affirmative racial gerrymandering}}
While Section 2 and Section 5 prohibit jurisdictions from drawing electoral districts that dilute the votes of protected minorities, the Supreme Court has held that in some instances, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents jurisdictions from drawing district lines to favor protected minorities. The Court first recognized the [[justiciability]] of affirmative "racial gerrymandering" claims in ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' (1993).&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' (''Shaw I''), {{ussc|509|630|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Miller v. Johnson]]'' (1995),&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;''[[Miller v. Johnson]]'', {{ussc|515|900|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Court explained that a redistricting plan is constitutionally suspect if the jurisdiction used race as the "predominant factor" in determining how to draw district lines. For race to "predominate", the jurisdiction must prioritize racial considerations over traditional redistricting principles, which include "compactness, contiguity, [and] respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests."&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;{{rp|916}}&lt;ref name=RacialGerrymander&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebaugh|first=Nelson|title=Refining the Racial Gerrymandering Claim: Bush v.

In ''[[Bush v. Vera]]'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bush v. Vera]]'', {{ussc|517|952|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|983}} a plurality of the Supreme Court assumed that complying with Section 2 or Section 5 constituted compelling interests, and lower courts have allowed only these two interests to justify racial gerrymandering.&lt;ref name=democracy /&gt;{{rp|877}}

'''Withdrawal from representation''', in [[United States]] [[law]], occurs where an [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] terminates a relationship of representing a client. There are two types of withdrawal: mandatory and voluntary. Mandatory withdrawal occurs where a circumstance arises under which an attorney ''must'' terminate the representation, while voluntary withdrawal occurs where circumstances permit the attorney to terminate the representation at the attorney's election. Where litigation has been filed and an attorney is representing the client in [[court]], permission of the court must usually be sought in support of an attorney's withdrawal.

==Mandatory withdrawal==
There are many circumstances which require that an attorney must withdraw from a case:
# The client fires the attorney.
# The attorney determines that he is not competent to continue representing the client in a matter.
# A [[conflict of interest]] arises under which the attorney's continued representation of multiple clients impairs the attorney's obligations to the individuals.
# The client insists upon advancing a [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous claim]].
# Continued representation would violate the rules of [[professional responsibility]].
# The attorney is in a physical or emotional state that seriously impairs the attorney's ability to continue the representation.
# It is likely that the attorney will be called as a necessary witness as to a contested issue in the proceeding, and that testimony cannot be obtained elsewhere.
# The attorney discovers that the client is using the attorney's services to further a criminal act.

==Voluntary withdrawal==
An attorney may voluntarily terminate the attorney-client relationship at any time and without reason, if this will not have a material adverse effect on the interests of the client. Even if the withdrawal will be adverse to the client the attorney may still withdraw for a number of reasons:
# The client is engaged in illegal or fraudulent activity.
# The client fails to pay [[Attorney's fee|fees]] as agreed.
# The financial burden on the attorney of continuing the representation is too great.
# The client refuses to follow the advice of counsel, or engages in acts relating to the representation without informing the attorney or seeking the attorney's advice.
# The attorney is engaged with co-counsel of the client's choosing, and is unable to work with that co-counsel.

==Rules governing withdrawal==
Where the attorney withdraws from representation, he has a continuing duty to maintain the [[confidentiality]] of information provided by the client during the relationship, except to the extent that the attorney may need to reveal confidences in a lawsuit to recover unpaid fees owed. However, the attorney must refund any portion of the retainer or other fees paid that exceeds what the attorney has earned during the representation. The attorney must notify the client of the withdrawal prior to ceasing his work on the case, must make a reasonable effort to assist the client in obtaining new counsel, and must cooperate with that new counsel during the transition to the new representation. The attorney must also, on request, deliver the client's file to the client or the client's new counsel.
