The '''''Abbey of the Holy Ghost''''' is a medieval [[prose]] [[allegory]], ca. 1350. The text is preserved in at least 26 manuscripts, often followed by the ''Charter of the Abbey of the Holy Ghost''. The text advises lay women on how to live a [[Contemplation|contemplative]] life outside a [[monastery]]; the companion ''Charter'' speaks of the [[Fall of Man|fall]] and [[Christian salvation|salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lagorio|first=V.M.|title=[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]]|publisher=Metzler|chapter=Abbey of the Holy Ghost|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abraham Joshua Heschel''' (January 11, 1907&amp;nbsp;– December 23, 1972) was a Polish-born American [[rabbi]] and one of the leading [[Judaism|Jewish]] theologians and Jewish philosophers of the 20th century. Heschel, a professor of [[Jewish mysticism]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], authored a number of widely read books on [[Jewish philosophy]] and was active in the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/the-legacy-of-abraham-joshua-heschel "The Legacy of Abraham Joshua Heschel."] ''Tikkun''. Accessed May 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/24/arts/24conn.html "A Rabbi of His Time, With a Charisma That Transcends It."] ''The New York Times''. Accessed May 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Abraham Joshua Heschel was born in 1907 as the youngest of six children of Moshe Mordechai and Reizel Perlow. He was descended from preeminent European [[rabbi]]s on both sides of his family.&lt;ref name="vzexea"/&gt; His paternal great-great-grandfather and namesake was [[Rebbe]] [[Avraham Yehoshua Heshel]] of [[Opatów|Apt]] in present-day Poland. His mother was also a descendant of Avraham Yehoshua Heshel and other [[Hasidic dynasties]]. His siblings were Sarah, Dvora Miriam, Esther Sima, Gittel, and Jacob. Their father Moshe died of [[influenza]] in 1916 when Abraham was nine.

After a traditional [[yeshiva]] education and studying for Orthodox rabbinical ordination [[semicha]], Heschel pursued his doctorate at the [[University of Berlin]] and a liberal rabbinic ordination at the [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]]. There he studied under some of the finest Jewish educators of the time: [[Hanoch Albeck|Chanoch Albeck]], [[Ismar Elbogen]], [[Julius Guttmann]], and [[Leo Baeck]]. His mentor in Berlin was [[David Koigen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=hAntzKMXVwkC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=david+koigen+professor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MxVp4KblKF&amp;sig=SX-FpbCZpriRHMQL6_oQDS0LKGU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjltaf5yZjPAhXkCMAKHVidBHEQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20koigen%20professor&amp;f=true Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic Witness, Edward Kaplan]&lt;/ref&gt; Heschel later taught [[Talmud]] at the Hochschule. He joined a [[Yiddish]] poetry group, Jung Vilna, and in 1933, published a volume of Yiddish poems, ''Der Shem Hamefoyrosh: Mentsch,'' dedicated to his father.&lt;ref name="vzexea"&gt;[http://home.versatel.nl/heschel/Susannah.htm Abraham Joshua Heschel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231326/http://home.versatel.nl/heschel/Susannah.htm |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 1938, when Heschel was living in a rented room in the home of a Jewish family in [[Frankfurt]], he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and deported to Poland. He spent ten months lecturing on [[Jewish philosophy]] and [[Torah]] at Warsaw's [[Institute for Jewish Studies]].&lt;ref name = "vzexea"/&gt; Six weeks before the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)|German invasion of Poland]], Heschel left Warsaw for London with the help of [[Julian Morgenstern]], president of [[Hebrew Union College]], who had been working to obtain visas for Jewish scholars in Europe.&lt;ref name = "vzexea"/&gt;

Heschel's sister Esther was killed in a German bombing. His mother was murdered by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], and two other sisters, Gittel and Devorah, died in [[Nazi concentration camps]]. He never returned to Germany, Austria or Poland. He once wrote, "If I should go to Poland or Germany, every stone, every tree would remind me of contempt, hatred, murder, of children killed, of mothers burned alive, of human beings asphyxiated."&lt;ref name = "vzexea"/&gt;

Heschel arrived in New York City in March 1940.&lt;ref name = "vzexea"/&gt; He served on the faculty of [[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), the main seminary of [[Reform Judaism]], in [[Cincinnati]] for five years. In 1946, he took a position at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS) in New York City, the main seminary of [[Conservative Judaism]]. He served as professor of [[Jewish ethics]] and [[Kabbalah|Mysticism]] until his death in 1972.

==Marriage and family==
Heschel married Sylvia Straus, a concert pianist, on December 10, 1946, in Los Angeles. Their daughter, [[Susannah Heschel]], became a Jewish scholar in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20071122 Interview with Susannah Heschel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506000817/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20071122 |date=May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heschel's papers are held in the [[Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]] at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.duke.edu/2012/08/heschel Duke to Acquire Papers of Rabbi Heschel, Influential Religious Leader], Duke University, August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
[[File:SelmaHeschelMarch.jpg|thumb|Heschel (2nd from right) in the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma Civil Rights march]] with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] (4th from right). Heschel later wrote, "When I marched in Selma, my feet were praying."]]
Heschel explicated many facets of Jewish thought, including studies on medieval Jewish philosophy, [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hasidic philosophy]]. According to some scholars, he was more interested in spirituality than in critical text study; the latter was a specialty of many scholars at JTS. He was not given a graduate assistant for many years and was relegated to teach mainly in the education school or Rabbinical school, not in the academic graduate program. Heschel became friendly with his colleague [[Mordecai Kaplan]]. Though they differed in their approach to Judaism, they had a very cordial relationship and visited each other's homes from time to time.

Heschel believed the teachings of the Hebrew prophets were a clarion call for social action in the United States and worked for African Americans' [[civil rights]] and against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dreier|first1=Peter|title='Selma's' Missing Rabbi|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-dreier/selmas-missing-rabbi_b_6491368.html/|accessdate=March 13, 2015|publisher=Huffington Post|date=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also specifically criticized what he called "pan-halakhism", or an exclusive focus upon religiously compatible behavior to the neglect of the non-legalistic dimension of rabbinic tradition.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Influence outside Judaism===
[[File:Abraham Heschel with MLK.jpg|thumb|Heschel, left, presenting the Judaism and World Peace Award to [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], December 7, 1965]]
Heschel is a widely read Jewish theologian whose most influential works include ''Man Is Not Alone'', ''God in Search of Man'', ''The Sabbath,'' and ''The Prophets''. At the [[Vatican Council II]], as representative of [[American Jews]], Heschel persuaded the [[Catholic Church]] to eliminate or modify passages in its liturgy that demeaned the Jews, or referred to an expected conversion to Christianity. His theological works argued that religious experience is a fundamentally human impulse, not just a Jewish one. He believed that no religious community could claim a monopoly on religious truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gillman | first=Neil | authorlink =Neil Gillman| title=Conservative Judaism: The New Century | year=1993 | publisher=Behrman House Inc. | page = 163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==

===''The Sabbath'' (1951)===
''The Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man'' is a work on the nature and celebration of [[Shabbat]], the Jewish Sabbath. This work is rooted in the thesis that Judaism is a religion of time, not space, and that the Sabbath symbolizes the sanctification of time.

===''Man Is Not Alone'' (1951)===
''Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion'' offers Heschel's views on how people can comprehend God. Judaism views God as being radically different from humans, so Heschel explores the ways that Judaism teaches that a person may have an encounter with the ineffable. A recurring theme in this work is the radical amazement that people feel when experiencing the presence of the Divine. Heschel then goes on to explore the problems of doubts and faith; what Judaism means by teaching that God is one; the essence of humanity and the problem of human needs; the definition of religion in general and of Judaism in particular; and human yearning for spirituality. He offers his views as to Judaism being a pattern for life.

===''God in Search of Man'' (1955)===
''[[God in Search of Man|God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism]]'' is a companion volume to ''Man Is Not Alone''. In this book Heschel discusses the nature of religious thought, how thought becomes faith, and how faith creates responses in the believer. He discusses ways that people can seek God's presence, and the radical amazement that we receive in return. He offers a criticism of nature worship; a study of humanity's metaphysical loneliness, and his view that we can consider God to be in search of humanity. The first section concludes with a study of [[Jews as a chosen people]]. Section two deals with the idea of [[revelation]], and what it means for one to be a prophet. This section gives us his idea of revelation as an event, as opposed to a process. This relates to Israel's commitment to God. Section three discusses his views of how a Jew should understand the nature of Judaism as a religion. He discusses and rejects the idea that mere faith (without law) alone is enough, but then cautions against rabbis he sees as adding too many restrictions to Jewish law. He discusses the need to correlate ritual observance with spirituality and love, the importance of [[Kavanah]] (intention) when performing [[mitzvot]]. He engages in a discussion of religious behaviorism—when people strive for external compliance with the law, yet disregard the importance of inner devotion.

===''The Prophets'' (1962)===
This work started out as his PhD thesis in German, which he later expanded and translated into English. Originally published in a two-volume edition, this work studies the books of the Hebrew prophets. It covers their lives and the historical context that their missions were set in, summarizes their work, and discusses their psychological state. In it Heschel puts forward what would become a central idea in his theology: that the prophetic (and, ultimately, Jewish) view of God is best understood not as anthropomorphic (that God takes human form) but rather as anthropopathic—that God has human feelings.

In his book ''The Prophets'', Abraham Joshua Heschel describes the unique aspect of the Jewish prophets as compared to other similar figures. Whereas other nations have soothsayers and diviners who attempt to discover the will of their gods, according to Heschel the Hebrew prophets are characterized by their experience of what he calls theotropism—God turning towards humanity. Heschel argues for the view of Hebrew prophets as receivers of the "Divine [[Pathos]]", of the wrath and sorrow of God over his nation that has forsaken him. In this view, prophets do not speak for God so much as they remind their audience of God's voice for the voiceless, the poor and oppressed.

He writes:
{{Quote|Prophecy is the voice that God has lent to the silent agony, a voice to the plundered poor, to the profane riches of the world. It is a form of living, a crossing point of God and man. God is raging in the prophet's words.&lt;ref&gt;''The Prophets Ch.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===''Torah min HaShamayim'' (1962)===
Many consider Heschel's ''Torah min HaShamayim BeAspaklariya shel HaDorot'', (''Torah from Heaven in the mirror of the generations'') to be his masterwork. The three volumes of this work are a study of classical rabbinic theology and [[aggadah]], as opposed to [[halakha]] (Jewish law.) It explores the views of the rabbis in the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]] about the nature of [[Torah]], the revelation of God to mankind, prophecy, and the ways that Jews have used scriptural exegesis to expand and understand these core Jewish texts. In this work, Heschel views the 2nd century sages [[Rabbi Akiva]] and [[Ishmael ben Elisha]] as paradigms for the two dominant world-views in Jewish theology

Two Hebrew volumes were published during his lifetime by [[Soncino Press]], and the third Hebrew volume was published posthumously by JTS Press in the 1990s. An English translation of all three volumes, with notes, essays and appendices, was translated and edited by Rabbi [[Gordon Tucker]], entitled ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations''. In its own right it can be the subject of intense study and analysis, and provides insight into the relationship between God and Man beyond the world of Judaism and for all Monotheism.

===''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets'' (1966)===
Heschel wrote a series of articles, originally in Hebrew, on the existence of prophecy in Judaism after the destruction of the Holy [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. These essays were translated into English and published as ''Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets: Maimonides and Others'' by the American Judaica publisher [[KTAV Publishing House|Ktav]].

The publisher of this book states, "The standard Jewish view is that prophecy ended with the ancient prophets, somewhere early in the Second Temple era. Heschel demonstrated that this view is not altogether accurate. Belief in the possibility of continued prophetic inspiration, and in its actual occurrence appear throughout much of the medieval period, and even in modern times. Heschel's work on prophetic inspiration in the Middle Ages originally appeared in two long Hebrew articles. In them he concentrated on the idea that prophetic inspiration was possible even in post-Talmudic times, and, indeed, had taken place at various times and in various schools, from the [[Geonim]] to [[Maimonides]] and beyond."

==Commemoration==
[[Image:AJ Heschel school 270 W89 jeh.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Abraham Joshua Heschel School]] in [[Manhattan]]]]
Four schools have been named for Heschel, in the [[Upper West Side]] of New York City, [[Northridge, California]], [[Agoura Hills, California]], and [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. In 2009, a highway in Missouri was named "Dr. Abraham Joshua Heschel Highway" after a [[Springfield, Missouri]] area Neo-Nazi group cleaned the stretch of highway as part of an "Adopt-A-Highway" plan. Heschel's daughter, Susannah, has objected to the adoption of her father's name in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/us/23heschel.html?ref=us | work=The New York Times | title=Daughter Against Use of Father's Name to Subvert Neo-Nazis | first=Michael | last=Cooper | date=June 23, 2009 | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">'''Adaptive type''' – in [[evolutionary biology]] – is any [[population]] or [[taxon]] which have the potential for a particular or total occupation of given free of underutilized home habitats or position in the general economy of nature. In [[evolution | evolutionary]] sense, the emergence of new adaptive type is usually a result of [[adaptive radiation]] certain groups of organisms in which they arise categories that can effectively exploit temporary, or new conditions of the environment.

Such evolutive units with its distinctive – morphological and anatomical, physiological and other characteristics, ie. genetic and adjustments ([[feature (disambiguation)|feature]]) have a predispositiona  for a occupation  certain home habitats or position in the general  nature economy.

Simply, the adaptive type is one group [[organism]]s whose general biological properties represent a key to open the entrance to the observed [[adaptive zone]] in the observed [[natural]] ecological complex.&lt;ref&gt;Stransfield W.

Adaptive types are spatially and temporally specific. Since the frames of general biological [[property| properties]] these types of substantially [[genetics | genetic]] are defined between, in effect the emergence of new adaptive types of the corresponding change in [[population genetics| population genetic structure]] and eternal contradiction between the need for optimal adapted well the conditions of living environment, while maintaining genetic variation for survival in a possible new circumstances.

For example, the specific place in the economy of nature existed millions of years before the appearance of [[human]] [[type (biology)|type]]. However, just when the process of evolution of primates ([[order (biology)|order]] '' [[Primates]]'') reached a level that is able to occupy that position, it is open, and then (in [[life|leaving world]]) an unprecedented acceleration increasingly spreading.

{{buddhism}}

'''Buddhist ethics''' are traditionally based on what Buddhists view as the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]] perspective of the [[Buddha]], or other enlightened beings such as [[Bodhisattvas]]. The Indian term for ethics or morality used in Buddhism is ''Śīla'' ({{lang-sa|शील}}) or ''sīla'' ([[Pāli]]). ''Śīla'' in [[Buddhism]] is one of three sections of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], and is a code of conduct that embraces a commitment to harmony and self-restraint with the principal motivation being [[nonviolence]], or freedom from causing harm. It has been variously described as [[virtue]],&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 170; Harvey (2007), p. 199; Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli (1999), pp. 3 ''passim''; Nyanatiloka (1988), [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_s.htm entry for "sīla";] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613033615/http://www.budsas.org/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_s.htm |date=June 13, 2016 }} [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/perfections.html Thanissaro (1999);] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613033615/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/perfections.html |date=June 13, 2016 }} and, Warder (2004), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; right conduct,&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; [[morality]],&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2002), p. 89; Nyanatiloka (1988), [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_s.htm entry for "sīla";] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613033615/http://www.budsas.org/ebud/bud-dict/dic3_s.htm |date=June 13, 2016 }} and Saddhatissa (1987), pp. 54, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; moral discipline&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[precept]].

''Sīla'' is an internal, aware, and intentional ethical behavior, according to one's commitment to the path of liberation. It is an ethical compass within self and relationships, rather than what is associated with the English word "morality" (i.e., obedience, a sense of obligation, and external constraint).

''Sīla'' is one of the [[Threefold Training|three practices]] foundational to Buddhism and the non-sectarian [[Vipassana movement]] — ''sīla,'' ''[[Samadhi#Buddhism|samādhi]],'' and ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|paññā]]'' as well as the Theravadin foundations of ''sīla,'' ''[[Dāna]],'' and ''[[Bhavana]].''   It is also the second ''[[Paramita|pāramitā]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Horner, I.B. (trans.) (1975; reprinted 2000). The Minor Anthologies of the Pali Canon (Part III): 'Chronicle of Buddhas' (Buddhavamsa) and 'Basket of Conduct' (Cariyapitaka). Oxford: Pali Text Society. {{ISBN|0-86013-072-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sīla is also wholehearted commitment to what is wholesome. Two aspects of sīla are essential to the training: right "performance" (caritta), and right "avoidance" (varitta). Honoring the precepts of ''sīla'' is considered a "great gift"  (mahadana) to others, because it creates an atmosphere of trust, respect, and security.  It means the practitioner poses no threat to another person's life, property, family, rights, or well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Living This Life Fully:  Teachings of Anagarika Munindra, by Mirka Knaster Ph.D., Shambhala Publications, USA, 2010.  Pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral instructions are included in Buddhist scriptures or handed down through tradition. Most scholars of Buddhist ethics thus rely on the examination of [[Buddhist scriptures]], and the use of anthropological evidence from traditional Buddhist societies, to justify claims about the nature of Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown ''The Nature of Buddhist Ethics'' Macmillan 1992; Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundations ==
The source for the ethics of Buddhists around the world are the [[Three Jewels]] of the [[Buddha]], [[Dharma#Buddhism|Dharma]] and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. The Buddha is seen as the discoverer of liberating knowledge and hence the foremost teacher. The Dharma is both the teachings of the Buddha's path and the truths of these teachings. The Sangha is the community of noble ones (ariya), who practice the Dhamma and have attained some knowledge and can thus provide guidance and preserve the teachings. Having proper understanding of the teachings is vital for proper ethical conduct. The Buddha taught that [[right view]] was a necessary prerequisite for right conduct.

=== Karma and rebirth ===
[[File:The wheel of life%2C Trongsa dzong.jpg|thumb|225px|The ''[[bhavacakra]]'' (wheel of life) shows the realms of karmic rebirth, at its hub are the three poisons of greed, hatred and delusion.]]
A central foundation for Buddhist morality is the law of [[karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. The Buddha is recorded to have stated that right view consisted in believing that (among other things): "'there is fruit and ripening of deeds well done or ill done': what one does matters and has an effect on one’s future; 'there is this world, there is a world beyond': this world is not unreal, and one goes on to another world after death" ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 117, Maha-cattarisaka Sutta).

Karma is a word which literally means "action" and is seen as a natural law of the universe which manifests as cause and effect. In the Buddhist conception, Karma is a certain type of moral action which has moral consequences on the actor.&lt;ref name="Keown, Damien pg 5"&gt;Keown, Damien; Buddhist Ethics A Very Short Introduction, pg 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The core of karma is the mental intention, and hence the Buddha stated  ‘It is intention (cetana), O monks, that I call karma; having willed one acts through body, speech, or mind’ ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 6.63). Therefore, accidentally hurting someone is not bad Karma, but having hurtful thoughts is. Buddhist ethics sees these patterns of motives and actions as conditioning future actions and circumstances – the fruit ([[Phala]]) of one's present actions, including the condition and place of the actor's future life circumstances (though these can also be influenced by other random factors).&lt;ref name="Keown, Damien pg 5" /&gt; One's past actions are said to mold one's consciousness and to leave seeds ([[Bīja]]) which later ripen in the next life. The goal of Buddhist practice is generally to break the cycle, though one can also work for rebirth in a better condition through good deeds.

The root of one's intention is what conditions an action to be good or bad. There are three good roots (non-attachment, benevolence, and understanding) and [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three negative roots]] (greed, hatred and delusion). Actions which produce good outcomes are termed "[[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]]" (puñña – fruitful, auspicious) and obtaining merit is an important goal of lay Buddhist practice. The early Buddhist texts mention three 'bases for effecting karmic fruitfulness’ (''puñña-kiriya-vatthus''): giving (dana), moral virtue (sila) and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; One's state of mind while performing good actions is seen as more important than the action itself. The Buddhist Sangha is seen as the most meritorious "field of merit". Negative actions accumulate bad karmic results, though one's regret and attempts to make up for it can ameliorate these results.

=== The Four Noble Truths ===
The [[Four Noble Truths]] express one of the central Buddhist worldview which sees worldly existence as fundamentally unsatisfactory and stressful (Dukkha). [[Dukkha]] is seen to arise from craving, and putting an end to craving can lead to liberation ([[Nirvana]]). The way to put an end to craving is by following the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] taught by the Buddha, which includes the ethical elements of right speech, right action and right livelihood. From the point of view of the Four Noble Truths, an action is seen as ethical if it is conductive to the elimination of [[Dukkha]]. Understanding the truth of Dukkha in life allows one to analyze the factors for its arising, that is craving, and allows us to feel compassion and sympathy for others. Comparing oneself with others and then applying the [[Golden Rule]] is said to follow from this appreciation of Dukkha.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  From the Buddhist perspective, an act is also moral if it promotes spiritual development by conforming to the Eightfold Path and leading to Nirvana. In Mahayana Buddhism, an emphasis is made on the liberation of all beings. Therefore, special beings called [[Bodhisattvas]] are believed to work tirelessly for the liberation of all and are seen as important figures.

The Four Noble Truths are ''[[ Dukkha, Samudaya Magga and Nirodha Thitsar.]]''. In English meaning Dukkha is Suffering, Samudaya is Clinging, Magga is Noble Eightfold Path and Nirodha is Liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{The Four Noble Truth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Precepts ===
[[File:Dennis Genpo Merzel Jukai (Shasui).jpg|thumb|right|225px| In the [[Zen Buddhist]] initiation ceremony of [[Buddhist initiation ritual#Sōtō school|Jukai]], initiates take up the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]].]]
{{Main|Five Precepts}}
The foundation of Buddhist ethics for laypeople is [[The Five Precepts]] which are common to all Buddhist schools. The precepts or "five moral virtues" (''pañca-silani'') are not commands but a set of voluntary commitments or guidelines,{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=268 }} to help one live a life in which one is happy, without worries, and able to meditate well. The precepts are supposed to prevent suffering and to weaken the effects of greed, hatred and delusion. They were the basic moral instructions which the Buddha gave to laypeople and monks alike.  Breaking one's sīla as pertains to sexual conduct introduces harmfulness towards one's practice or the practice of another person if it involves uncommitted relationship.&lt;ref name="Peter Harvey 2001, pages 195-196"&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195-196.&lt;/ref&gt; When one "goes for refuge" to the Buddha's teachings one formally takes the five precepts,{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=181}} which are:&lt;ref name="bodhimonastery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodhi Monastery: the Five Precepts|url=http://www.bodhimonastery.net/bm/precepts.html|accessdate=2011-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123211604/http://bodhimonastery.net/bm/precepts.html|archive-date=2010-11-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# I undertake the training rule to abstain from taking life;
# I undertake the training rule to abstain from taking what is not given;
# I undertake the training rule to abstain from sensual misconduct;
# I undertake the training rule to abstain from false speech;
# I undertake the training rule to abstain from liquors, wines, and other intoxicants, which are the basis for heedlessness.

Buddhists often take the precepts in formal ceremonies with members of the monastic Sangha, though they can also be undertaken as private personal commitments.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} Keeping each precept is said to develop its opposite positive virtue.{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=479}} Abstaining from killing for example develops kindness and compassion,{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=68}} while abstaining from stealing develops non-attachment.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}} The precepts have been connected with [[utilitarianist]], [[deontological]]{{sfn|Keown|2013 |page=618}} and [[virtue ethics|virtue]] approaches to ethics.{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=481}} They have been compared with human rights because of their universal nature,{{sfn |Keown |2012 |pages=31{{en dash}}4}}{{sfn |Seeger |2010 |p=78}} and some scholars argue they can complement the concept of human rights.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}{{sfn |Seeger |2010 |pp=78, 85}}

Undertaking and upholding the five precepts is based on the principle of [[ahimsa|non-harming]] ([[Pāli]] and {{lang-sa|ahiṃsa|italic=yes}}).{{sfn|Keown|2013 |page=616}} The [[Pali Canon]] recommends one to compare oneself with others, and on the basis of that, not to hurt others.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pages=33, 71, 120}} Compassion{{sfn |Ratanakul |2007 |page=241 }} and a belief in [[karma (Buddhism)|karmic retribution]]{{sfn |Horigan |1996 |page=276}}form the foundation of the precepts.

The first precept consists of a prohibition of killing, both humans and all animals. Scholars have interpreted Buddhist texts about the precepts as an opposition to and prohibition of capital punishment,{{sfn |Alarid |Wang |2001 |pages=236{{en dash}}7}} suicide, abortion{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=213}}{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |page=110}} and euthanasia.{{sfn |Keown |2016b |page=170}} The second precept prohibits theft. The third precept refers to adultery in all its forms, and has been defined by modern teachers with terms such as ''sexual responsibility'' and ''long-term commitment''.&lt;!--71-2--&gt; The fourth precept involves falsehood spoken or committed to by action, as well as malicious speech, harsh speech and gossip.&lt;!--74, 76--&gt;{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=71{{en dash}}2, 74, 76}} The fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}} Early Buddhist Texts nearly always condemn alcohol,{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}} and so do Chinese Buddhist post-canonical texts.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=77{{en dash}}8}}{{sfn |Benn |2005 |pages=225{{en dash}}6}} Buddhist attitudes toward smoking differ per time and region, but are generally permissive.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}}{{sfn |Vanphanom |Phengsavanh |Hansana |Menorath |2009 |page=100}} In modern times, traditional Buddhist countries have seen revival movements to promote the five precepts.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=153}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=39 ล้านคนร่วมหมู่บ้านศีล 5 สมเด็จพระมหารัชมังคลาจารย์ ย้ำทำต่อเนื่อง|trans-title=39 million people have joined ''Villages Practicing Five Precepts'', Somdet Phra Maharatchamangalacharn affirms it should be continued|url=https://www.thairath.co.th/content/969738|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121085832/https://www.thairath.co.th/content/969738|archive-date=21 November 2017|deadurl=no|work=[[Thai Rath]]|publisher=Wacharapol|date=11 March 2017|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the West, the precepts play a major role in Buddhist organizations.{{sfn |Kaza |2000 |page=24}}

There is also a more strict set of precepts called the eight precepts which are taken at specific religious days or religious retreats.  The [[eight precepts]] encourage further discipline and are modeled on the monastic code. In the [[eight precepts]], the third precept on sexual misconduct is made more strict and becomes a precept of celibacy. The three additional rules of the Eight Precepts are:&lt;ref name="bodhimonastery" /&gt;
&lt;ol start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I accept the training rule to abstain from food at improper times.” (e.g. no solid foods after noon, and not until dawn the following day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I accept the training rule (a) to abstain from dancing, singing, instrumental music, and shows, and (b) from the use of jewelry, cosmetics, and beauty lotions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I accept the training rule to abstain from the use of high and luxurious beds and seats.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

[[Samanera|Novice-monks]] use the [[Ten Precepts (Buddhism)|ten precepts]] while fully ordained Buddhist monks also have a larger set of monastic precepts, called the [[Prātimokṣa]] (227 rules for monks in the Theravādin recension). Monks are supposed to be celibate and are also traditionally not allowed to touch money. The rules and code of conduct for monks and nuns is outlined in the [[Vinaya]]. The precise content of the [[vinayapitaka|scriptures on ''vinaya'']] (''vinayapiṭaka'') differ slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to the ''vinaya''.

In [[Mahayana Buddhism]], another common set of moral guidelines are the [[Bodhisattva vows]] and the [[Bodhisattva Precepts]] or the "Ten Great Precepts". The Bodhisattva Precepts which is derived from the Mahayana [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sutra]] include the Five precepts with some other additions such as the precept against slandering the Buddha's teachings. These exist above and beyond the existing monastic code, or lay follower precepts.&lt;ref name="bodiford"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bodiford | first = William M. | authorlink=William Bodiford|title = Soto Zen in Medieval Japan (Studies in East Asian Buddhism) | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-8248-3303-1 | pages=22–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brahmajala Sutra also includes a list of 48 minor precepts which prohibit the eating of meat, storing of weapons, teaching for the sake of profit, abandoning Mahayana teachings and teaching non Mahayana Dharma. These precepts have no parallel in [[Theravada|Theravāda]] Buddhism.

=== Ten wholesome actions ===
Another common formulation of Buddhist ethical action in the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] is the "path of the ten good actions" or "ten skilled karma paths" (''Dasa Kusala Kammapatha'') which are "in accordance with [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Khantipalo, The Wheel of Birth and Death, Collected Wheel Publications Volume X: Numbers 132–151&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schweiker, William (ed.) The Blackwell Companion to Religious Ethics, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Perera, The Way of the Noble, Buddhist Publication Society Kandy, Sri Lanka, The Wheel Publication No. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piya Tan, The Path of Awakening The way, the life and the liberation of the noble eightfold path, 2016, Singapore, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; These are divided into three bodily actions (''kaya kamma''), four verbal actions (''vaci kamma'') and three mental actions (''mano kamma'') all of which are said to cause "unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow".&lt;ref&gt;Pa Auk Sayadaw, The workings of Kamma, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; These ten paths are discussed in suttas such as [[Majjhima Nikaya]] MN 41 (''Sāleyyaka Sutta''), and MN 114:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://suttacentral.net/mn114/en/sujato|title=MN 114, Sujato (Trans), SuttaCentral|last=|first=|date=|website=SuttaCentral|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisdompubs.org/book/middle-length-discourses-buddha/selections/middle-length-discourses-41-saleyyaka-sutta|title=MN 41{{!}}The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha – Selections {{!}} Wisdom Publications|last=|first=|date=|website=www.wisdompubs.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodily actions:

# "Someone gives up killing living creatures", they "renounce the rod and the sword", "They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings."
# "They give up stealing. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness."
# "They give up sexual misconduct. They don’t have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don’t have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal."

Verbal actions:

# "A certain person gives up lying. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I see.’ So they don’t deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason."
# "They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony."
# "They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people."
# "They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial."

Mental actions:

# "It’s when someone is content. They don’t covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’ They have a kind heart and loving intentions: ‘May these sentient beings live free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy!’"
# "It’s when someone is content, and lives with their heart full of contentment. They are loving, and live with their heart full of love. They’re kind, and live with their heart full of kindness."
# "It’s when someone has such a view: ‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are duties to mother and father. There are beings reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are well attained and practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’"

=== Bases of meritorious actions ===
Yet another common ethical list in the Pali tradition is the "ten bases of meritorious action" (''Dasa Puñña-kiriya Vatthu'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bhikkhu Khantipalo, The Advantages of Merit, Number 38 in "Collected Bodhi Leaves Volume II: Numbers 31 to 60".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;K. Sri Dhammananda Maha Thera, [http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/whatbelieve.pdf What Buddhists Believe expanded 4th edition, 2002], p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nyanatiloka Thera, Buddhist Dictionary: Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by [[Nyanatiloka]] Thera, some texts ([[Itivuttaka]] 60) only mention three of these but later [[Atthakatha|Pali commentaries]] expanded these to ten, and the list of ten is a popular list in [[Theravada]] countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Crosby, Kate (2013), Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity, Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Itivuttaka|Ittivuttaka]] #60 says:&lt;blockquote&gt;“Bhikkhus, there are these three grounds for making merit. What three? The ground for making merit consisting in giving, the ground for making merit consisting in virtue, and the ground for making merit consisting in mind-development. These are the three.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;One should train in deeds of merit, that yield long-lasting happiness: Generosity, a balanced life, developing a loving mind.

* [[Dāna|Giving or charity]] (''dāna''), This is widely done by giving “the four requisites” to monks; food, clothing, shelter, and medicine. However giving to the needy is also a part of this.
* Morality (''sīla''), Keeping the five precepts, generally non-harming.
* [[Bhavana|Mental cultivation]] (''bhāvanā'').
* Paying due [[respect]] to those who are worthy of it (''apacāyana''), showing appropriate deference, particularly to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, and to seniors and parents. Usually done by placing the hands together in [[Añjali Mudrā]], and sometimes bowing.
* Helping others perform good deeds (''veyyāvacca''), looking after others.
* [[Transfer of merit|Sharing of merit after doing some good deed]] (''anumodana'')
* Rejoicing in the merits of others (''pattanumodana''), this is common in communal activities.
* Teaching the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]] (''dhammadesana''), the gift of Dhamma is seen as the highest gift.
* Listening to the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]] (''dhammassavana'')
* Straightening one's own [[View (Buddhism)|views]] (''ditthujukamma)''

=== Key values and virtues ===
[[File:Monks in Thailand.JPG|thumb|right|225px| Giving (Dana) is an important Buddhist virtue. The community of monastics is seen as the most meritorious field of karmic fruitfulness.]]
{{Buddhist Philosophy sidebar}}
Following the precepts is not the only dimension of Buddhist morality, there are also several important virtues, motivations and habits which are widely promoted by Buddhist texts and traditions. At the core of these virtues are the three roots of non-attachment (araga), benevolence (advesa), and understanding (amoha).

One list of virtues which is widely promoted in Buddhism are the [[Pāramitā]]s (perfections) – [[Dāna]] (generosity), [[Śīla|Sīla]] (proper conduct), [[Nekkhamma]] (renunciation), [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Paññā]] (wisdom), [[Vīrya|Viriya]] (energy), [[Kshanti|Khanti]] (patience), [[Sacca]] (honesty), [[Adhiṭṭhāna]] (determination), [[Mettā]] (Good-Will), [[Upekkha|Upekkhā]] (equanimity).

The Four divine abidings ([[Brahmaviharas]]) are seen as central virtues and intentions in Buddhist ethics, psychology and meditation. The four divine abidings are [[metta|good will]], [[Karuṇā|compassion]], [[Mudita|empathetic joy]], and [[Upekkha|equanimity]]. Developing these virtues through meditation and right action promotes happiness, generates good merit and trains the mind for ethical action.

An important quality which supports right action is Heedfulness ([[Appamada]]), a combination of energy/effort ([[Viriya]]) and Mindfulness. [[Mindfulness]] is an alert presence of mind which allows one to be more aware of what is happening with one's intentional states. Heedfulness is aided by 'clear comprehension' or 'discrimination' ([[Sampajañña]]), which gives rise to moral knowledge of what is to be done. Another important supporting quality of Buddhist morality is [[Faith in Buddhism|Trust or Confidence]] in the teachings of the Buddha and in one's own ability to put them into practice. [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Wisdom]] and Understanding are seen as a prerequisite for acting morally. Having an understanding of the true nature of reality is seen as leading to ethical actions. Understanding the truth of [[Anatta|not-self]] for example, allows one to become detached from selfish motivations and therefore allows one to be more altruistic. Having an understanding of the workings of the mind and of the law of karma also makes one less likely to perform an unethical action.

The Buddha promoted ‘self-respect’ ([[Hri (Buddhism)|Hri]]) and Regard for consequences ([[Apatrapya]]), as important virtues. Self-respect is what caused a person to avoid actions which were seen to harm one's integrity and Ottappa is an awareness of the effects of one's actions and sense of embarrassment before others.

Giving ([[Dāna]]) is seen as the beginning of virtue in Theravada Buddhism and as the basis for developing further on the path. In Buddhist countries, this is seen in the giving of alms to Buddhist monastics but also extends to generosity in general (towards family, friends, coworkers, guests, animals).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving is said to make one happy, generate good merit as well as develop non-attachment, therefore it is not just good because it creates good karmic fruits, but it also develops one's spiritual qualities. In Buddhist thought, the cultivation of [[Dana (Buddhism)|dana]] and ethical conduct will themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower hells is unlikely, even if there is no further Buddhist practice. There is nothing improper or un-Buddhist about limiting one's aims to this level of attainment.&lt;ref name="Peter Harvey 2001, pages 195-196" /&gt;

An important value in Buddhist ethics is non-harming or non-violence ([[ahimsa]]) to all living creatures from the lowest insect to humans which is associated with the first precept of not killing. The Buddhist practice of this does not extend to the extremes exhibited by [[Jainism]] (in Buddhism, unintentional killing is not karmically bad), but from both the Buddhist and Jain perspectives, non-violence suggests an intimate involvement with, and relationship to, all living things.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson, ''The Different Paths of Buddhism'' p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha also emphasized that ‘good friendship ([[Kalyāṇa-mittatā]]), good association, good intimacy’ was the whole, not the half of the holy life ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 45.2). Developing strong friendships with good people on the spiritual path is seen as a key aspect of Buddhism and as a key way to support and grow in one's practice.

In [[Mahayana Buddhism]], another important foundation for moral action is the [[Bodhisattva]] ideal. Bodhisattvas are beings which have chosen to work towards the salvation of all living beings. In Mahayana Buddhist texts, this path of great compassion is promoted as being superior to that of the [[Arhat]] because the Bodhisattva is seen as working for the benefit of all beings.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 130.&lt;/ref&gt; A Bodhisattva is one who arouses a powerful emotion called [[Bodhicitta]] (mind of enlightenment) which is a mind which is oriented towards the awakening of oneself and all beings.

== Issues ==

=== Killing ===
[[File:Saito Musashi-bo Benkei - tales of the wars of the Gempei, being the story of the lives and adventures of Iyo-no-Kami Minamoto Kuro Yoshitsune and Saito Musashi-bo Benkei the warrior monk (1910) (14780268451).jpg|thumb|200px|Japanese illustration of Iyo-no-Kami Minamoto Kuro Yoshitsune and [[Benkei|Saito Musashi-bo Benkei]], the Buddhist [[Sohei|warrior monk]].]]

The first precept is the abstaining from the taking of life, and the Buddha clearly stated that the taking of human or animal life would lead to negative karmic consequences and was non conductive to liberation. Right livelihood includes not trading in weapons or in hunting and butchering animals. Various suttas state that one should always have a mind filled with compassion and loving kindness for all beings, this is to be extended to hurtful, evil people as in the case of [[Angulimala]] the murderer and to every kind of animal, even pests and vermin (monks are not allowed to kill any animal, for any reason). Buddhist teachings and institutions therefore tend to promote peace and compassion, acting as safe havens during times of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 239.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, some Buddhists, including monastics such as Japanese [[Sohei|warrior monks]] have historically performed acts of violence. In China, the [[Shaolin Monastery]] developed a [[martial arts]] tradition to defend themselves from attack.

In Mahayana Buddhism, the concept of skillful means ([[upaya]]) has in some circumstances been used to excuse the act of killing, if it is being done for compassionate reasons. This form of "compassionate killing" is allowed by the ''Upaya-kausalya sutra'' and the ''Maha-Upaya-kausalya sutra'' only when it "follows from virtuous thought."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Some texts acknowledge the negative karmic consequences of killing, and yet promote it out of compassion. The ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Bodhisattva-bhumi]]'', a key Mahayana text, states that if a Bodhisattva sees someone about to kill other Bodhisattvas, they may take it upon themselves to kill this murderer with the thought that:

"If I take the life of this sentient being, I myself may be reborn as one of the creatures of hell. Better that I be reborn a creature of hell than that this living being, having committed a deed of immediate retribution, should go straight to hell."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

If then, the intention is purely to protect others from evil, the act of killing is sometimes seen as meritorious.

==== War ====
{{Main|Ahimsa#Buddhism}}
{{See also|Criticism of Buddhism#War and violence}}
[[File:Museum of Ethnology Vienna 002.JPG|thumb|220px|Statue portrait of [[5th Dalai Lama]].]]
The Buddhist analysis of conflict begins with the '[[Three poisons (Buddhism)|Three Poisons]]' of greed, hatred and delusion. Craving and attachment, the cause of suffering, is also the cause of conflict. Buddhist philosopher [[Shantideva]] states in his ''Siksasamuccaya'': "Wherever conflict arises among living creatures, the sense of possession is the cause". Craving for material resources as well as grasping to political or religious views is seen as a major source of war. One's attachment to self-identity, and identification with tribe, nation state or religion is also another root of human conflict according to Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha promoted [[non-violence]] in various ways, he encouraged his followers not to fight in wars and not to sell or trade weapons. The Buddha stated that in war, both victor and defeated suffer: "The victor begets enmity. The vanquished dwells in sorrow. The tranquil lives happily, abandoning both victory and defeat" ([[Dhammapada]], 201). Buddhist philosopher [[Candrakīrti]] wrote that soldiery was not a respectable profession: "the sacrifice of life in battle should not be respected, since this is the basis for harmful actions."&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Goodman, Charles, "Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/&gt;{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Mahayana Brahmajala Sutra]] states that those who take the [[Bodhisattva vows]] should not take any part in war, watch a battle, procure or store weapons, praise or approve of killers and aid the killing of others in any way. In his [[Abhidharma-kosa]], [[Vasubandhu]] writes that all soldiers in an army are guilty of the killing of the army, not just those who perform the actual killing.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Buddhist peace activists include The [[14th Dalai Lama]], [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Sulak Sivaraksa]], [[A. T. Ariyaratne]], [[Preah Maha Ghosananda]] and [[Nichidatsu Fujii]].

While [[pacifism]] is the Buddhist ideal, Buddhist states and kingdoms have waged war throughout history and Buddhists have found ways to justify these conflicts. The [[5th Dalai Lama]] who was installed as the head of Buddhism in Tibet by [[Gushri Khan]] after the [[Khoshut Khanate|Oirat invasion of Tibet]] (1635–1642), praised the acts of the Khan and said that he was an emanation of the great Bodhisattva [[Vajrapani]].&lt;ref name=Goodman /&gt; Under the fifth Dalai Lama and the powerful Gelug Regent Sonam Chophel (1595–1657), treasurer of the Ganden Palace, the Tibetan kingdom launched invasions of [[Bhutan]] (c. 1647, ending in failure) and [[Ladakh]] (c. 1679, which regained previously lost Tibetan territory) with Mongol aid.&lt;ref&gt;Samten G. Karmay, The Great Fifth, IIAS Newsletter #39 December 2005, https://iias.asia/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL39_1213.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is that of Buddhist [[Sohei|warrior monks]] in [[feudal Japan]] who sometimes committed organized acts of war, protecting their territories and attacking rival Buddhist sects. During the late [[Heian Period]], the [[Tendai]] school was a particularly powerful sect, whose influential monasteries could wield armies of monks. A key text of this sect was the [[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]], which contains passages allowing the use of violence for the defense of the Dharma.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 265.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ashikaga period]] saw military conflict between the Tendai school, [[Jōdo Shinshū]] school and the [[Nichiren]] Buddhists. [[Zen Buddhism]] was influential among the [[samurai]], and their [[Bushido]] code.

During [[World War II]] almost all [[Japanese Buddhism|Japanese Buddhists temples]] (except the [[Soka Gakkai]]) strongly supported Japanese imperialism and militarization.&lt;ref&gt;Gier, Nicholas, F.

==== Abortion ====
{{Main|Buddhism and abortion}}
[[File:Zojoji 01.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Jizo statues at [[Zojo-ji]] temple in [[Tokyo]]]]
There is no single [[Buddhist]] view concerning abortion, although traditional Buddhism rejects abortion because it involves the deliberate destroying of a human life and regards human life as starting at conception. Further, some Buddhist views can be interpreted as holding that life exists before conception because of the never ending cycle of life.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Abortion: Buddhism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910102909/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml |date=September 10, 2015 }}." ''BBC Religion &amp; Ethics.'' Retrieved January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional Buddhist view of rebirth sees consciousness as present in the embryo at conception, not as developing over time. In the [[Vinaya]] ([[Theravada]] and [[Sarvastivada]]) then, the causing of an abortion is seen as an act of killing punishable by expulsion from the monastic [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abhidharma-kosa]] states that 'life is there from the moment of conception and should not be disturbed for it has the right to live'.

One of the reasons this is seen as an evil act is because a human rebirth is seen as a precious and unique opportunity to do good deeds and attain liberation. The [[Jataka]] stories contain tales of women who perform abortions being reborn in a [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]. In the case where the mother's life is in jeopardy, many traditional Buddhists agree that abortion is permissible. This is the only legally permissible reason for abortion in [[Sri Lanka]], and is also a view accepted in the Tibetan tradition, as argued by Ganden Tri Rinpoche.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 320.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of rape, however, most Buddhists argue that following an act of violence by allowing 'another kind of violence towards another individual' would not be ethical. Aborting a fetus that is malformed is also seen as immoral by most Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those practicing in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] are said to be more tolerant of abortion than those who live elsewhere.&lt;ref name="barnhart"&gt;Barnhart, Michael G.  (1995). [http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/5/barnh981.html Buddhism and the Morality of Abortion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212072421/http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/5/barnh981.html |date=December 12, 2006 }}. ''Journal of Buddhist Ethics, 5.'' Retrieved August 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, women sometimes participate in [[Mizuko kuyo]] (水子供養 — lit. Newborn Baby Memorial Service) after an induced abortion or an abortion as the result of a [[miscarriage]]; a similar Taiwanese ritual is called ''[[yingling gongyang]]''. In China abortion is also widely practiced, but in Tibet it is very rare. Thus while most Buddhists would agree that abortion is wrong, they are less likely to push for laws banning the practice. The [[Dalai Lama]] has said that abortion is "negative," but there are exceptions.  He said, "I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance."&lt;ref name="Dreifus"&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Claudia Dreifus]] |title=The Dalai Lama |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/magazine/the-dalai-lama.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 28, 1993 |accessdate=July 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While abortion is problematic in Buddhism, contraception is generally a non-issue.

==== Suicide and euthanasia ====
{{Main|Buddhism and euthanasia}}
[[File:Thích Quảng Đức self-immolation.jpg|250px|thumb|Thích Quảng Đức's self-immolation during the [[Buddhist crisis]]]]
Buddhism understands life as being pervaded by [[Dukkha]], as unsatisfactory and stressful. Ending one's life to escape present suffering is seen as futile because one will just be reborn again, and again. One of the three forms of craving is craving for annihilation ([[Taṇhā#Vibhava-tanha (craving not to be)|vibhava tanha]]), and this form of craving is the root of future suffering. Dying with an unwholesome and agitated state of mind is seen as leading to a bad rebirth, so [[suicide]] is seen as creating negative karma.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Ending one's life is also seen as throwing away the precious opportunity to generate positive karma. While suicide does not seem to be interpreted as a breaking of the first precept (not killing other beings) it is still seen as a grave and unwholesome action.&lt;ref name="Peter Harvey 2000, page 288"&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Theravada Buddhism]], for a monk to praise the advantages of death, including simply telling a person of the miseries of life or the bliss of dying and going to heaven in such a way that he/she might feel inspired to commit suicide or simply pine away to death, is explicitly stated as a breach in one of highest vinaya codes regarding the prohibition of harming life, hence it will result in automatic expulsion from [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].&lt;ref&gt;Pruitt &amp; Norman, ''The Patimokkha'', 2001, Pali Text Society, Lancaster, Defeat 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism sees the experience of dying as a very sensitive moment in one's spiritual life, because the quality of one's mind at the time of death is believed to condition one's future rebirth.&lt;ref name="Peter Harvey 2000, page 288" /&gt; The Buddhist ideal is to die in a calm but conscious state, while learning to let go. Dying consciously, without negative thoughts but rather joyously with good thoughts in mind is seen as a good transition into the next life. Chanting and reciting Buddhist texts is a common practice; in Tibet the [[Bardo Thodol]] is used to guide the dying to a good rebirth.&lt;ref name="Peter Harvey 2000, page 288" /&gt;

Traditional Buddhism would hold [[Euthanasia]], where one brings about the death of a suffering patient (whether or not they desire this) so as to prevent further pain, as a breach of the first precept.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 295.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument that such a killing is an act of compassion because it prevents suffering is unacceptable to traditional Buddhist theology because it is seen to be deeply rooted in delusion. This is because the suffering being who was euthanized would just end up being reborn and having to suffer due to their karma (even though not all suffering is due to karma), and hence killing them does not help them escape suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 296.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abhidharma-kosa]] clearly states that the killing of one's sick and aged parents is an act of delusion. The act of killing someone in the process of death also ruins their chance to mindfully experience pain and learn to let go of the body, hence desire for euthanasia would be a form of aversion to physical pain and a craving for non-becoming. According to [[Kalu Rinpoche]] however, choosing to be removed from life support is karmically neutral.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 301.&lt;/ref&gt; The choice not to receive medical treatment when one is terminally ill is then not seen as morally reprehensible, as long as it does not arise from a feeling of aversion to life. This would also apply to not resuscitating a terminal patient.

However there are exceptions to the injunction against suicide. Several Pali suttas contain stories where self-euthanizing is not seen as unethical by the Buddha, showing that the issue is more complex. These exceptions, such as the story of the monk Channa and that of the monk Vakkali , typically deal with advanced Buddhist practitioners. In these exceptional cases, both Channa and Vakkali are both said to be enlightened [[arhats]] and euthanized themselves in a calm and detached state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;At wood, Michael. Suicide as A Response to Suffering. http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol4/suicide_as_a_response_to_suffering.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In East-Asian and Tibetan Buddhism, the practice of [[Self-immolation]] developed. In China, the first recorded self-immolation was by the monk Fayu (d. 396).&lt;ref&gt;Benn, James A. (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWL6EEkL8goC Burning for the Buddha: self-immolation in Chinese Buddhism], University of Hawaii Press, 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to James A. Benn, this tended to be much more common during times of social and political turmoil and Buddhist persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Benn (2007), 199.&lt;/ref&gt; It was often interpreted in Buddhist terms as a practice of heroic renunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Liz (2004). "Perspectives on the body" (PDF). In Buswell, Robert E. Encyclopedia of Buddhism. New York [u.a.]: Macmillan Reference USA, Thomson Gale. pp. 65–6. {{ISBN|0-02-865720-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was widely publicized during the [[Vietnam war]] and have also continued as a form [[Self-immolation protests by Tibetans in China|of protest by Tibetans against the Chinese government]].

==== Capital punishment ====
{{Main|Religion and capital punishment#Buddhism}}
Buddhism places great emphasis on the sanctity of life and hence in theory forbids the death penalty. However, capital punishment has been used in most historically Buddhist states. The first of the [[Five Precepts]] (Panca-sila) is to abstain from destruction of life. Chapter 10 of the [[Dhammapada]] states:

:''"Everyone fears punishment; everyone fears death, just as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill. Everyone fears punishment; everyone loves life, as you do. Therefore do not kill or cause to kill''".

Chapter 26, the final chapter of the Dhammapada, states "Him I call a [[brahmin]] who has put aside weapons and renounced violence toward all creatures. He neither kills nor helps others to kill". These sentences are interpreted by many Buddhists (especially in the West) as an injunction against supporting any legal measure which might lead to the death penalty. However, almost throughout history, countries where Buddhism has been the official religion (which have included most of the [[Far East]] and [[Indochina]]) have practiced the death penalty. One exception is the abolition of the death penalty by the [[Emperor Saga]] of [[Japan]] in 818. This lasted until 1165, although in private manors executions conducted as a form of retaliation continued to be performed.

=== Animals and the environment ===
[[File:Buddha Worshipped in Jungle by Animals - Middle Architrave - Rear Side - East Gateway - Stupa 1 - Sanchi Hill 2013-02-21 4462.JPG|thumb|right|225px|The Buddha, represented by the [[Bodhi tree]], attended by animals, [[Sanchi]] vihara.]]
Buddhism does not see humans as being in a special moral category over animals or as having any kind of God given dominion over them as [[Christianity]] does.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are seen as being more able to make moral choices, and this means that they should protect and be kind to animals who are also suffering beings who are living in [[samsara]]. Buddhism also sees humans as part of nature, not as separate from it. [[Thich Naht Hanh]] summarizes the Buddhist view of harmony with nature thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We classify other animals and living beings as nature, acting as if we ourselves are not part of it. Then we pose the question ‘How should we deal with Nature?’ We should deal with nature the way we should deal with ourselves! We should not harm ourselves; we should not harm nature...Human beings and nature are inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, pg 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Early Buddhist monastics spent a lot of time in the forests, which was seen as an excellent place for meditation and this tradition continues to be practiced by the monks of the [[Thai Forest Tradition]].

==== Vegetarianism ====
{{Main|Buddhist vegetarianism}}
There is a divergence of views within Buddhism on the need for vegetarianism, with some schools of Buddhism rejecting such a claimed need and with most Buddhists in fact eating meat. Many [[Mahayana]] Buddhists – especially the Chinese and Vietnamese traditions – strongly oppose meat-eating on [[scriptural]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/BuddhismAnimalsVegetarian/BuddhistVegetarian.htm Buddhist Resources on Vegetarianism and Animal Welfare] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911135953/http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/BuddhismAnimalsVegetarian/BuddhistVegetarian.htm |date=September 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first precept of Buddhism focuses mainly on direct participation in the destruction of life. This is one reason that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] made a distinction between killing animals and eating meat, and refused to introduce vegetarianism into monastic practice. While early Buddhist texts like the [[Pali Canon]] frown upon hunting, butchering, fishing and 'trading in flesh' (meat or livestock) as professions, they do not ban the act of eating meat. Direct participation also includes ordering or encouraging someone to kill an animal for you.

The Buddhist king [[Ashoka]] promoted vegetarian diets and attempted to decrease the number of animals killed for food in his kingdom by introducing 'no slaughter days' during the year. He gave up hunting trips, banned the killing of specific animals and decreased the use of meat in the royal household. Ashoka even banned the killing of some vermin or pests. His example was followed by later Sri Lankan kings.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 158.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Ashoka's rock edicts states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Here (in my domain) no living beings are to be slaughtered or offered in sacrifice...Formerly, in the kitchen of Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, hundreds of thousands of animals were killed every day to make curry. But now with the writing of this Dhamma edict only three creatures, two peacocks and a deer are killed, and the deer not always. And in time, not even these three creatures will be killed.&lt;ref&gt;The Edicts of King Asoka an English rendering by Ven. S. Dhammika © 1994, {{cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#rock14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510060618/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/dhammika/wheel386.html#rock14 |archivedate=2016-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many Buddhists, especially in East Asia, believe that Buddhism advocates or promotes [[vegetarianism]]. While Buddhist theory tends to equate killing animals with killing people (and avoids the conclusion that killing can sometimes be ethical, e.g. defense of others), outside of the Chinese and Vietnamese monastic tradition, most Buddhists do eat meat in practice.&lt;ref name="Dharma Data: Vegetarianism"&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd21.htm Dharma Data: Vegetarianism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109235226/http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/dharmadata/fdd21.htm |date=November 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some controversy surrounding whether or not the Buddha himself died from eating rancid pork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsuyun.com/vegetarian.html Vegetarianism and Buddhism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305033324/http://www.hsuyun.com/vegetarian.html |date=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most Chinese and Vietnamese monastics are vegetarian,&lt;ref name="Dharma Data: Vegetarianism" /&gt; vegetarian Tibetans are rare, due to the harsh Himalayan climate.&lt;ref name="Dharma Data: Vegetarianism" /&gt; Japanese lay people tend to eat meat, but monasteries tend to be vegetarian.&lt;ref name="Dharma Data: Vegetarianism" /&gt; The [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]], after contracting [[Hepatitis B]], was advised by doctors to switch to a high animal-protein diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author =Dalai Lama| authorlink =| author2 =| title =Freedom in exile: the autobiography of the Dalai Lama| publisher =HarperOne| year =1991| location =| pages =184–185| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=nQ7n_5UPX3IC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=dalai+lama+hepatitis#v=onepage&amp;q=dalai%20lama%20hepatitis&amp;f=false| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-06-098701-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dalai Lama]] eats vegetarian every second day, so he effectively eats a vegetarian diet for 6 months of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norm Phelps|Phelps, Norm]]. (2004). ''The Great Compassion: Buddhism and Animal Rights''. Lantern Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, vegetarianism among Buddhists is also common.

In the [[Pāli|Pali]] version of the [[Tripitaka]], there are number of occasions in which the Buddha ate meat as well as recommending certain types of meat as a cure for medical conditions. On one occasion, a general sent a servant to purchase meat specifically to feed the Buddha. The Buddha declared that:
{{quote|
Meat should not be eaten under three circumstances: when it is seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater); these, [[Jivaka]], are the three circumstances in which meat should not be eaten, Jivaka! I declare there are three circumstances in which meat can be eaten: when it is not seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater); Jivaka, I say these are the three circumstances in which meat can be eaten.|Jivaka Sutta}}

The Buddha held that because the food is given by a donor with good intentions, a monk should accept this as long as it is pure in these three respects. To refuse the offering would deprive the donor of the positive karma that giving provides. Moreover, it would create a certain conceit in the monks who would now pick and choose what food to eat. The Buddha did state however that the donor does generate bad karma for himself by killing an animal. In Theravada Buddhist countries, most people do eat meat, however.

While there is no mention of Buddha endorsing or repudiating vegetarianism in surviving portions of [[Pali]] [[Tripitaka]] and no Mahayana sutras explicitly declare that meat eating violates the first precept, certain [[Mahayana sutras]] vigorously and unreservedly denounce the eating of meat, mainly on the ground that such an act violates the bodhisattva's compassion. The sutras which inveigh against meat-eating include the Mahayana version of the ''Nirvana Sutra,'' the ''Shurangama Sutra,'' the ''Brahmajala Sutra,'' the ''Angulimaliya Sutra,'' the ''Mahamegha Sutra,'' and the ''Lankavatara Sutra,'' as well as the Buddha's comments on the negative karmic effects of [[meat consumption]] in the ''Karma Sutra''.  In the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], which presents itself as the final elucidatory and definitive Mahayana teachings of the Buddha on the very eve of his death, the Buddha states that "the eating of meat extinguishes the seed of Great Kindness", adding that all and every kind of meat and fish consumption (even of animals found already dead) is prohibited by him. He specifically rejects the idea that monks who go out begging and receive meat from a donor should eat it: ". . . it should be rejected . . . I say that even meat, fish, game, dried hooves and scraps of meat left over by others constitutes an infraction . . . I teach the harm arising from meat-eating." The Buddha also predicts in this sutra that later monks will "hold spurious writings to be the authentic Dharma" and will concoct their own sutras and lyingly claim that the Buddha allows the eating of meat, whereas in fact he says he does not. A long passage in the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] shows the Buddha speaking out very forcefully against meat consumption and unequivocally in favor of vegetarianism, since the eating of the flesh of fellow sentient beings is said by him to be incompatible with the compassion that a Bodhisattva should strive to cultivate. In several other Mahayana scriptures, too (e.g., the Mahayana [[jatakas]]), the Buddha is seen clearly to indicate that meat-eating is undesirable and karmically unwholesome.

==== Environment ====
Forests and jungles represented the ideal dwelling place for early Buddhists, and many texts praise the forest life as being helpful to meditation. Monks are not allowed to cut down trees as per the Vinaya, and the planting of trees and plants is seen as karmically fruitful. Because of this, Buddhist monasteries are often small nature preserves within the modernizing states in East Asia. The species [[ficus religiosa]] is seen as auspicious, because it is the same kind of tree that the Buddha gained enlightenment under.

In [[Mahayana Buddhism]], some teachings hold that trees and plants have [[Buddha nature]]. [[Kukai]] held that plants and trees, along with rocks and everything else, were manifestations of the 'One Mind' of [[Vairocana]] and [[Dogen]] held that plant life ''was'' [[Buddha nature]].

In pre-modern times, environmental issues were not widely discussed, though [[Ashoka]] banned the burning of forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken about the issue of environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]] have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, there is no point in going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Clean Environment Is a Human Right|url=http://www.dalailama.com/messages/environment/clean-environment/|publisher=[[14th Dalai Lama]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, while Buddhist scripture does not provide measures for active environmental protection (which would be a form of self-identification, and thus ''[[dukkha]]''), it provides a contrast to the Western systems of consumption, exploitation, and possession. 

=== Gender issues ===
{{Main|Women in Buddhism}}
[[File:Tibetan Nuns Volunteering Earthquake Zone.jpeg|thumb|right|225px| Buddhist nuns from the Tibetan tradition, volunteering in Kyegundo (Tibet Earthquake zone).]]
In pre-Buddhist Indian religion, women were seen as inferior and subservient to men. Buddha's teachings tended to promote gender equality as the Buddha held that women had the same spiritual capacities as men did. According to [[Isaline Blew Horner]], women in Buddhist India: "commanded more respect and ranked as individuals. They enjoyed more independence, and a wider liberty to guide and follow their own lives."&lt;ref&gt;IB Horner, Women Under Primitive Buddhism, 1930, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha gave the same teachings to both sexes, praised various female lay disciples for their wisdom and allowed women to become monastics ([[Bhikkhuni]]s) at a time when this was seen as scandalous in India, where men dominated the spiritual professions. The two chief female disciples of the Buddha were [[Khema]] and [[Uppalavanna]]. The Buddha taught that women had the same [[soteriological]] potential as men, and that gender had no influence on one's ability to advance spiritually to nirvana. In the early Buddhist texts, female enlightened [[Arhats]] are common. Buddhist nuns are however bound by an extra 8 precepts not applicable to Buddhist monks called [[The Eight Garudhammas]]. The authenticity of these rules is highly contested; they were supposedly added to the ([[bhikkhuni]]s) [[Vinaya]] "to allow more acceptance" of a monastic Order for women, during the Buddha's time but can be interpreted as a form of [[gender discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhammadharini.net/dhamma-talks-from-the-bhikkhuni-sangha/aranya-bodhi-hermitage/non-historicity-of-the-eight-garudhammas On the Apparent Non-historicity of the Eight Garudhammas Story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103030748/http://www.dhammadharini.net/dhamma-talks-from-the-bhikkhuni-sangha/aranya-bodhi-hermitage/non-historicity-of-the-eight-garudhammas |date=November 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100726221345/http://www.bhikkhuni.net/library/anaalayo-gender-discrimination-canon.html Gender Discrimination and the Pali Canon]&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Sponberg argues that the early Buddhist sangha sought social acceptance through 'institutional [[androcentrism]]' as it was dependent on material support from lay society. Because of this Sponberg concludes: "For all its commitment to inclusiveness at the doctrinal level, institutional Buddhism was not able to (or saw no reason to) challenge prevailing attitudes about gender roles in society."&lt;ref&gt;Sponberg, Attitudes toward Women and the
Feminine in Early Buddhism, 1992, http://www.nku.edu/~gartigw/teaching_files/Sponberg,%20Alan%20%20(1992)%20-%20Attitudes%20toward%20Women%20and%20the%20Feminine%20in%20Early%20Buddhism.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pre-Mahayana texts also state that while women can become Arhats, they cannot become a [[Buddhahood#Samyaksambuddha|Samyaksambuddha]] (a Buddha who discovers the path by himself), [[Chakravartin]]s (Wheel turning king), a [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Ruler of heaven]], a [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] devil or a [[Brahmā (Buddhism)|Brahama god]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 371-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Therigatha]] is a collection of poems from elder Buddhist nuns, and one of the earliest texts of women's literature. Another important text is the Therī-[[Apadāna]], which collects the biographies of eminent nuns. One such verses are those of the nun Soma, who was tempted by [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] when traveling in the woods. Mara states that women are not intelligent enough to attain enlightenment, Soma replies with a verse which indicates the insignificance of gender to spirituality:

:"What does womanhood matter at all
:When the mind is concentrated well,
:When knowledge flows on steadily
:As one sees correctly into Dhamma.
:One to whom it might occur,
:'I'm a woman' or 'I'm a man'
:Or 'I'm anything at all' —
:Is fit for Mara to address."&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, Discourses of the Ancient Nuns (Bhikkhuni-samyutta) © 1997, {{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bl143.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420152439/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bl143.html |archivedate=2016-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Haishangguanyin.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Guan Yin of the South Sea of Sanya]] is the largest statue of a woman in the world.]]
In [[Mahayana Buddhism]], Bodhisattvas such as [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and [[Guanyin]] are very popular female deities. Some [[Vajrayana|Buddhist Tantric]] texts include female consorts for each heavenly Buddha or Bodhisattva. In these Tantric couples, the female symbolizes wisdom ([[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajna]]) and the male symbolizes skillful means ([[upaya]]).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 363.&lt;/ref&gt; The union of these two qualities is often depicted as sexual union, known as [[yab-yum]] (father-mother).

In [[East Asia]], the idea of [[Buddha nature]] being inherent in all beings is taken to mean that, spiritually at least, the sexes are equal, and this is expressed by the [[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra|Lion’s Roar of Queen Srimala sutra]]. Based on this ideal of Buddha nature, the Chinese Chan ([[Zen]]) school emphasized the equality of the sexes. [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089–1163) of the Chinese [[Rinzai school|Linji school]] said of women in Buddhism: "For mastering the truth, it does not matter whether one is male or female, noble or base." &lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 366.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese founder of [[Soto Zen]], [[Dogen]] wrote: "If you wish to hear the Dharma and put an end to pain and turmoil, forget about such things as male and female. As long as delusions have not yet been eliminated, neither men nor women have eliminated them; when they are all eliminated and true reality is experienced, there is no distinction of male and female."&lt;ref&gt;Francis Harold Cook, Francis Dojun Cook, Eihei Dogen; How to Raise an Ox: Zen Practice as Taught in Master Dogen's Shobogenzo, page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attitude of Buddhists towards gender has been varied throughout history as it has been influenced by each particular culture and belief system such as [[Confucianism]] (which sees women as subservient) and [[Hinduism]]. The Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] (5th century CE) for example, seems to have been influenced by his [[Brahmin]] background in stating that rebirth as a male is higher than rebirth as a female.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Mahayana sutras such as the ‘Sutra on Changing the Female Sex’ and the ‘Questions of the Daughter Pure Faith’ also echo this idea. For various historical and cultural reasons such as wars and invasions, the orders of ordained Buddhist nuns disappeared or was never introduced in Southeast Asia and Tibet, though they slowly started being reintroduced by nuns such as [[Ayya Khema]], [[Dhammananda Bhikkhuni]], [[Tenzin Palmo]] and [[Thubten Chodron]]. Until very recently, China, Taiwan and Korea were the only places where fully ordained bhiksuni lineages still existed. An international conference of Buddhist nuns was held on February 1987 at [[Bodh Gaya]] and saw the formation of 'Sakyadhita' (Daughters of the Buddha) the International Association of Buddhist Women which focuses on helping Buddhist nuns throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationships ===
The Buddha placed much importance on the cultivation of good will and compassion towards one's parents, spouse, friends and all other beings. Buddhism strongly values harmony in the family and community. Keeping the five precepts and having a generous attitude (Dana) is seen as the foundation for this harmony. An important text, seen as the lay people's Vinaya (code of conduct) is the [[Sigalovada Sutta]] which outlines wrong action and warns against the squandering of wealth. The [[Sigalovada Sutta]] outlines how a virtuous person "worships the six directions" which are parents (East), teachers (South), wife (West), and friends and colleagues (North), and the two vertical directions as: ascetics and Brahmins (Up) and the Servants (Down). The text elaborates on how to respect and support them, and how in turn the Six will return the kindness and support. The relationships are based on reciprocation, and it is understood one has no right to expect behavior from others unless one also performs good acts in their favor.

Parents for example, are to be respected and supported with the understanding that they are to have provided care and affection to oneself. In marriage, the sutta states that a householder should treat their wife by "being courteous to her, by not despising her, by being faithful to her, by handing over authority to her, by providing her with adornments." while in return the wife "performs her duties well, she is hospitable to relations and attendants, she is faithful, she protects what he brings, she is skilled and industrious in discharging her duties."&lt;ref&gt;Narada Thera (trans), Sigalovada Sutta: The Discourse to Sigala The Layperson's Code of Discipline, {{cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518095524/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html |archivedate=2016-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha also stated that a wife and husband are to be each other's best friend (parama sakha). While monogamy is the predominant model for marriage, Buddhist societies have also practiced and accepted [[polygamy]] and [[polyandry]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics Cambridge University Press 2000, page 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism sees marriage not as sacred but as a secular partnership and hence has no issue with divorce.

=== Sexuality{{anchor|Sexual misconduct}} ===
{{Main|Buddhism and sexuality}}
The Third (or sometimes Fourth) of the [[Five Precepts]] of Buddhism states that one is to refrain from "[[sexual misconduct]]", which has various interpretations, but generally entails any sexual conduct which is harmful to others, such as rape, molestation and often adultery, although this depends on the local marriage and relationship customs. Buddhist [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s of most traditions are not only expected to refrain from all sexual activity but also take [[vows of celibacy]].

==== Sexual orientation ====
{{Main|Buddhism and sexual orientation}}
Among the Buddhist traditions there is a vast diversity of opinion about [[homosexuality]], and in interpreting the precedents which define "sexual misconduct" generally. Though there is no explicit condemnation of homosexuality in Buddhist sutras, be it [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] or [[Mantrayana]], societal and community attitudes and the historical view of practitioners have established precedents. Some ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' equate homosexuality with scriptural sexual misconduct prohibited by the [[Five Precepts]]. Other ''sangha'' hold that if sexuality is compassionate and/or consensual and does not contravene vows, then there is no karmic infraction, irrespective of whether it is same-sex or not. Buddhist communities in Western states as well as in Japan generally tend to be accepting of homosexuality. In Japan, homosexual relations among Buddhist samurai and clergy were actually quite common. Male homosexuality between clergy was especially common in the Tantric [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon school]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Pāli Canon]] &amp; [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgama]] (the Early Buddhist scriptures), there is no saying that same or opposite gender relations have anything to do with sexual misconduct,&lt;ref name="cunda kammaraputta sutta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta|trans-title=To Cunda the Silversmith|others=Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu|publisher=Access to Insight|year=1997|id=[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 10.176|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html| accessdate = 2011-03-14|quote=Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct.

This is clear, sound advice and seems to suggest that sexual misconduct is that which would disrupt existing family or love relationships. This is consonant with the general Buddhist principle that that which causes suffering for oneself or others is unethical behaviour. ("Unskillful behaviour" would be closer to the original.) There is no good reason to assume that '''''homosexual relations which do not violate this principle''''' should be treated differently. }}

Some later traditions, like [[Shantideva]] and [[Gampopa]], feature restrictions on non-vaginal sex (including homosexuality). A medieval commentary of the [[Digha Nikaya]] mentions examples of immorality in society, and one of the examples is homosexuality, whereas this has no basis in the Sutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ajahn Sujato|title=Why Buddhists Should Support Marriage Equality|url=https://sujato.wordpress.com/2012/03/21/1430/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Buddhist texts such as the [[Abhidharma-kosa]] and the [[Jataka tales]] make no mention of homosexuality in this regard. According to Jose Ignacio Cabezon, Buddhist cultures' attitudes towards homosexuality have generally been neutral.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

While both men and women can ordained, [[hermaphrodites]] are not allowed by the [[Vinaya]]. According to the ancient texts this is because of the possibility that they will seduce monks or nuns.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 413.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Vinaya also prevents ''[[Buddhism and sexual orientation#Paṇḍakas|pandakas]]'' from becoming monastics, which have been defined as "without testicles" and generally referred to those who lacked the normal (usually physical) characteristics of maleness (in some cases it refers to women who lack the normal characteristics of femaleness). This rule was established by the Buddha after a pandaka monk broke the Vinaya precepts by having relations with others. Therefore, it seems that pandakas were initially allowed into the Sangha. Later Buddhist texts like the [[Milinda Panha]] and the [[Abhidharma-kosa]] see pandakas as being spiritually hindered by their sexuality and mental defilements.

=== Economic ethics ===
[[File:Bhutan Gross National Happiness.jpg|thumb|260 px|right|[[Bhutan]]'s government promotes the concept of '[[Gross National Happiness]]' (GNH), based on Buddhist spiritual values.]]
{{Main|Buddhist economics}}
Buddha's teachings to laypeople included advice on how to make their living and how to use their wealth. Right livelihood is an element of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], and generally refers to making one's living without killing, being complicit in the suffering of other beings (by selling weapons, poison, alcohol or flesh) or through lying, stealing or deceit (advertising which deceives others, for example).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sigalovada Sutta states that a master should look after servants and employees by: "(1) by assigning them work according to their ability, (2) by supplying them with food and with wages, (3) by tending them in sickness, (4) by sharing with them any delicacies, (5) by granting them leave at times" ([[Digha Nikaya]] 31). Early Buddhist texts see success in work as aided by one's spiritual and moral qualities.

In the Adiya Sutta the Buddha also outlined several ways in which people could put their 'righteously gained' wealth to use:&lt;ref&gt;AN 5.41 , Adiya Sutta: Benefits to be Obtained (from Wealth) translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, {{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.041.than.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420202447/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.041.than.html |archivedate=2016-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Providing 'pleasure &amp; satisfaction' to themselves, their mother &amp; father, their children, spouse, slaves, servants, &amp; assistants.
#Providing 'pleasure &amp; satisfaction' to their friends and associates.
#Warding off calamities coming from fire, flood, kings, thieves, or hateful heirs, and keeps himself safe.
#Performs five oblations/offerings: to relatives, guests, the dead, kings, &amp; devas.
#Giving of offerings to priests ([[brahmins]]) and contemplatives (monks).

The Buddha placed much emphasis on the virtue of giving and sharing, and hence the practice of donating and charity are central to Buddhist economic ethics. Even the poor are encouraged to share, because this brings about greater spiritual wealth: "If beings knew, as I know, the results of giving &amp; sharing, they would not eat without having given, nor would the stain of selfishness overcome their minds. Even if it were their last bite, their last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared, if there were someone to receive their gift."&lt;ref&gt;Itivuttaka: The Group of Ones translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, {{cite web |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.1.001-027.than.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518095639/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.1.001-027.than.html |archivedate=2016-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern growth of [[Engaged Buddhism]] has seen an emphasis on social work and charity. Buddhist aid and activist organizations include [[Buddhist Global Relief]], Lotus Outreach, [[Buddhist Peace Fellowship]], Piyarra Kutta, [[International Network of Engaged Buddhists]], The [[Tzu Chi]] Foundation, Nonviolent Peaceforce, and [[Zen Peacemakers]].

Buddhist texts promote the building of public works which benefit the community and stories of Buddhist Kings like [[Ashoka]] are used as an example of lay people who promoted the public welfare by building hospitals and parks for the people. The Buddha's chief lay disciple, the rich merchant [[Anathapindika]] (‘Feeder of the Poor’) is also another example of a virtuous layperson who donated much of his wealth for the benefit of others and was thus known as the "foremost disciple in generosity". Early Buddhist texts do not disparage merchants and trade, but instead promote enterprise as long as it is done ethically and leads to the well being of the community. The gold standard for rulers in Buddhism is the ideal wheel turning king, the [[Chakravartin]]. A Chakravartin is said to rule justly, giving to the needy and combating poverty so as to prevent social unrest. A Chakravartin does not fight wars for gain but only in defense of the kingdom, he accepts immigrants and refugees, and builds hospitals, parks, hostels, wells, canals and rest houses for the people and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 198.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahayana Buddhism]] maintains that lay Bodhisattvas should engage in social welfare activities for the good and safety of others.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lands of Southern Buddhism, Buddhist monasteries often became places were the poor, destitute, orphaned, elderly can take shelter. Monasteries often provided education and took care of the sick, and therefore are also centers of social welfare for the poor.

[[Robert Thurman]], in his discussion of [[Nagarjuna]]'s ''Precious Garland Ratnavali'' sees the Mahayana Buddhist tradition as politically supporting ‘a [[welfare state]] ...a rule of compassionate [[socialism]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Thurman, Robert. Social and Cultural rights in Buddhism, {{cite web|url=http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MISC/misc30574.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020222155/http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MISC/misc30574.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent [[Buddhist socialism|Buddhist socialists]] include the [[14th Dalai Lama#Economics|14th Dalai Lama]], [[Buddhadasa]], [[B. R. Ambedkar]], [[U Nu]], [[Girō Seno’o]] and Lin Qiuwu.&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Jones, Buddhism and Marxism in Taiwan: Lin Qiuwu's Religious Socialism and Its Legacy in Modern Times, {{cite web |url=http://www.globalbuddhism.org/1/jones001.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200527/http://www.globalbuddhism.org/1/jones001.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[Neville Karunatilake]], [[E. F. Schumacher]], Padmasiri De Silva, [[Prayudh Payutto]] and [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] have promoted a [[Buddhist economics]] that does not necessarily define itself as socialist but still offers a critique of modern [[consumer capitalism]]. [[E. F. Schumacher]] in his "Buddhist economics" (1973) wrote: "Buddhist economics must be very different from the economics of modern materialism, since the Buddhist sees the essence of civilisation not in a multiplication of human wants but in the purification of human character."

While modern economics seeks to satisfy human desires, Buddhism seeks to reduce our desires and hence Buddhist economics would tend to promote a sense of [[Anti-consumerism]] and [[Simple living]]. In his ''Buddhist Economics: A Middle Way for the Market Place'', [[Prayudh Payutto]] writes that consumption is only a means to an end which is 'development of human potential' and 'well being within the individual, within society and within the environment'. From a Buddhist perspective then, 'Right consumption' is based on [[well being]] while 'wrong consumption' is the need to 'satisfy the desire for pleasing sensations or ego-gratification'.&lt;ref&gt;Payutto, Buddhist Economics A Middle Way for the Market Place, chapter three. {{cite web|url=http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma2/becono3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024024539/http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma2/becono3.html |archivedate=2016-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] argues that "the religion of [[consumerism]] emphasizes greed, hatred and delusion" which causes anxiety and that this must be countered with an ethic of satisfaction&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern attempts to practice Buddhist economics can be seen in the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]] and in the [[Gross National Happiness]] economics of Bhutan.

While Buddhism does not see anything wrong with wealth gained ethically, it does see greed and craving for riches as negative, and praises contentment as 'the greatest wealth'. [[Poverty]] and debt are seen as causes of suffering, immorality and social unrest if they prevent one from having basic necessities and peace of mind. For laypeople, Buddhism promotes the middle way between a life of poverty and a materialistic or consumerist life in which one is always seeking to enrich oneself and to buy more things.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000, page 195.&lt;/ref&gt; For Buddhist laypersons then, to be Buddhist does not mean to reject all material things, but, according to Sizemore and Swearer: "it specifies an attitude to be cultivated and expressed in whatever material condition one finds oneself. To be non-attached is to possess and use material things but not to be possessed or used by them. Therefore, the idea of non-attachment applies all across Buddhist society, to laymen and monk alike." &lt;ref&gt;Russell F. Sizemore and Donald K. Swearer, "Introduction" to Sizemore and Swearer, eds., Ethics, Wealth and Salvation: A Study in Buddhist Social Ethics (Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina, 1990), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3970">The '''Central European Institute of Philosophy''' ('''SIF'''; {{lang-cz|Středoevropský Institut Filosofie}}; {{lang-de|Mitteleuropäisches Institut für Philosophie}}) established in 2010, is a joint  institution of the [[Charles University]] Faculty of Humanities and the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic Academy of Sciences’]] Institute of Philosophy. The SIF seeks to follow in the footsteps of Prague’s “Cercle philosophique,” which was established by Czech and German professors from the University of Prague in 1934, but soon disbanded with the German occupation of [[Czechoslovakia]]. The Institute promotes [[Philosophical|philosophical research]] – with an emphasis on the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] as well as on trans/ [[interdisciplinary]].

The Czech Republic, with its tradition of a rather unusual symbiotic alliance of [[Czechs|Czech]], [[Jewish]], and [[Germans|German]] intellectuals is an ideal location for the SIF. The country has already birth to various influential movements: The Prague Circle literary school ([[Franz Kafka]], [[Max Brod]], [[Felix Weltsch]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Oscar Baum]]), in art [[Czech cubism]] and [[surrealism]] along with other disciplines such as empirical criticism ([[Ernst Mach]]), [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] ([[Edmund Husserl]]), and [[psychoanalysis]] ([[Sigmund Freud]]). As one of its primary objectives, the SIF seeks to map the rich potential of the varied cultural and ethnic influences that shape the present day Czech state. This mapping enables a hypothesis as to the reciprocal influences of not only other European traditions but also non-European and the consequences these might hold for the present and the future.

In keeping with this multi-cultural tradition, two directors guide the SIF: a Czech, Karel Novotny and a German, Hans Rainer Sepp. The Institute is composed of a staff of permanent and external members and is also supported by an international scholarly board of 36 professors or institutions representing twenty countries. All strive in close association so that SIF may bring together thinkers and scholars working in a wide range of disciplines concerned with the study of philosophical, historical, critical, and theoretical issues. In addition, SIF also is the home of the book series “Orbis Phaenomenologicus,” founded in 1993 and published by Königshausen &amp; Neumann, Würzburg, Germany, as well as the newly established series “libri nigri.  Thinking Across Boundaries” and “libri virides. The Young Forum,” published by Traugott Bautz, Nordhausen, Germany.

A research project entitled “Philosophical Investigations of Body Experiences: Trans-disciplinary Perspectives” is currently underway at the SIF. In addition to its ongoing research projects, the SIF offers specialized advanced courses in conjunction with the EU Master Program “German and French Philosophy in the European Context.” The Institute also organizes and hosts international conferences and is very active in facilitating the publication of established and young scholars alike. To date the SIF has organized three international conferences and edited ten book publications. All of these activities attest to SIF’s commitment to providing a place of intellectual exchange, dialogue, and debate as scholars re-think the methodology and assumptions of their respective disciplines in light of the cultural perspectives and assumptions of others both past and present.

The '''Chaplet of the Five Wounds''' is a [[Passionist]] [[Chaplet (prayer)|chaplet]] devoted to the [[Holy Wounds]] of [[Jesus]],{{r|Lea 1896, p. 525}} as a means to promote devotion to the Passion of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Womack |first=Warren |date=December 1951 |title=Chaplet of the Five Wounds: Its history blessing and indulgences |work=The Passionist |p=270-274, 333-334 |url=http://www.cpprovince.org/archives/thepassionist/chaplet-5wounds.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chaplet is due to Father Paul Aloysius, the sixth superior general of the Passionists. The devotion also honors the mystery of the [[Resurrection of Jesus|risen Christ]] which has the marks of the Five Wounds. [[Pope Leo XII]] approved the chaplet in 1823.&lt;ref name="Ball 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ball | first=Ann | year=2003 | title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices | publisher=Our Sunday Visitor | isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |p=123-124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This chaplet must be blessed by the Passionist superior or a delegation from him.&lt;ref name="Lea 1896, p. 525"&gt;{{cite book | last=Lea | first=Henry Charles | title=A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church |location=Philadelphia, USA |publisher=Lea Brothers |volume=Vol. 3: Indulgences | year=1896 |p=525 |url=https://archive.org/stream/IndulgencesV3#page/n539/mode/2up/search/five+wounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format of the chaplet==
This chaplet has 25 beads, grouped into five sets. The ''[[Gloria Patri]]'' is said on each bead.{{r|Ball 2003}} At the end of each section of beads, a Hail Mary in honor of the sorrows of Mary is said. At the end of the chaplet, three additional Hail Marys are said in honor of her tears.

'''The Chaplet of the Five Wounds of Jesus''' or the '''Little Chaplet of the Five Wounds of Jesus Crucified''' is a devotional prayer written in 1761&lt;ref&gt;St. Alphonsus Liguori, by Rev. D.F. Miller &amp; Rev. L.X. Auben, January 2009, page 176.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[St. Alphonsus Liguori]], a devotional writer and founder of the [[Redemptorist|Redemptorist Fathers]] religious community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12683a.htm Wuest, Joseph. "Redemptorists." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 2 Jun. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Alphonsus wrote the devotional as a [[meditation]] on the [[Holy Wounds|five piercing wounds]] that Christ suffered during his [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/passiondeathofje00ligu#page/472/mode/2up Liguori, Alfonso Maria de, Saint.

The concept of [[sin]], in the sense of violating a [[Moral universalism|universal moral code]], was unknown in [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Chinese folk religion|folk religion]] until around the second century CE, when [[Buddhism]] arrived from India and religious [[Daoism]] originated. While English lexically differentiates theological ''sin'' from legal ''crime'', the [[Chinese language]] uses one word ''zui'' 罪 meaning "crime; guilt; misconduct; sin; fault; blame."

==Terminology==
Chinese has two common words meaning "sin": ''zui'' ({{zh|s=罪|t=罪|p=zuì|w=''tsui''|l=crime}}) and ''guo'' ({{zh|s=过|t=過|p=guò |w=''kuo''|l=exceed}}).  The German sociologist [[Wolfram Eberhard]] wrote ''Guilt and Sin in Traditional China'', which said ''zui'' has three basic meanings "crime, punishment of a crime, and sin", and ''guo'' means "a criminal act which has been unintentionally committed, as well as a sin which has been committed without any intention" {{harv|Eberhard|1967|p=13}}.

''Zui'' can mean "crime; criminal act; punishment; guilt; fault; blame; wrongdoing; misconduct; sin; suffering; hardship". Some ''zui'' [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]], such as ''youzui'' [[wikt:有罪|有罪]] (with "have; there is") "guilty (of an offense); sinful", are ambiguous between "crime" and "sin"; while others are unequivocal, such as ''fanzui'' [[wikt:犯罪|犯罪]] (with "crime; criminal") "commit a crime; criminal act" or ''yuanzui'' [[wikt:原罪|原罪]] (with "origin; source") "original sin". The [[Chinese character]] 罪 for ''zui'' combines ''wang'' 罒 or 网 "net" over ''fei'' 非 "wrong", ideographically depicting, "A 网 net used to capture the criminal who has done 非 wrong" (Bishop 2011). ''Zui'' was used to translate Chinese Buddhist terminology, for instance, ''zuizhang'' 罪障 (with "obstruction") "sin" and ''zuiye'' 罪業 (with "action") "sinful karma".

''Zui'' 罪 "crime; guilt; punishment" had an archaic [[variant Chinese character]] ''zui'' 辠, written with ''zi'' 自 "nose" and ''xin'' 辛 "painful" —  emphasizing the "punishment" aspect of ''zui''. For instance, under [[traditional Chinese law]], the excruciating [[Five Punishments]] included ''yi'' 劓 "cutting off the nose". The (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' dictionary defined the original meanings of these homophonous ''zui'' characters as罪 "fish trap" and 辠 "crime; punishment", and noted [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BCE-206 BCE) imperial [[naming taboo]] made 辠 obsolete. The first Qin emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] 秦始皇 forbid using ''zui'' 辠 "crime", which graphically resembled ''huang'' 皇 "emperor" in his name, and replaced it with ''zui'' 罪 (Schuessler 2007:637). In [[Modern Standard Chinese]] character usage, ''zui'' 罪 is common and ''zui'' 辠 is rare.

''Guo'' nominally means "fault; mistake; error; excess" and verbally "pass by; go past; surpass; cross; exceed". The specialized sense of "sin" is usually  limited to Daoist usage, except for the Chinese "synonym compound" ''zuiguo(r)'' 罪過(兒) "fault; wicked act; sin; offense", which is a humble expression for "guilty conscience; this is really more than I deserve."

Words meaning "sin; violation of religious law" are not a [[linguistic universal]]. For instance, the anthropologist [[Verrier Elwin]], who studied the [[Gondi language]], said, "There are no words in Gondi for sin or virtue: a man may be ruined, here and hereafter, for a breach of a taboo, but the notion of retribution for sinners is an alien importation" {{Harv|Elwin|1947|p=145}}. The [[Gondi language]] word ''pap'' "sin" is a [[loanword]] from the [[Marathi language]]. Fürer-Haimendorf explains that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;… throughout the Christian era men and women of the western world believed in the existence of a universal phenomenon which they called sin. The tongues they spoke provided terms (''peccatum'', ''péché'', ''sin'', ''Sünde'' etc.) which referred to this phenomenon and it was not until the age of discovery that Christian missionaries encountered languages which did not contain any comparable terms. The existence of such languages leads us inevitably to the conclusion that the concept and with it the sense of sin cannot be common to all branches of humanity. This raises the question whether some societies lack the very idea that certain modes of conduct are not only undesirable in the eyes of other men but that they also bring the actor into conflict with supernatural powers believed to play the role of guardians of morality—in other words whether there exist ethnic groups devoid of any concept of 'sin' in the conventional sense. (1974:540) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Historical origins==
The word ''zui'' 辠 or 罪 "crime; guilt" occurred in [[Chinese classics]] and [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze inscriptions]] from the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046-256 BCE). Eberhard concluded that "sin" was unknown prior to the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE).
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we apply our definition of "sin" – a violation of a divine code – Chinese folk religion before the Han period (206 B.C.) seems not to have had the concept of sin, although it recognized a great number of supernatural beings. People who offended the deities, spirits, or other supernatural beings by not honoring them or by failing to sacrifice in the right way or at the right time might make them angry. The deities then could or would punish such people. An event of this kind was more or less like any offense against a human superior, with the only difference that deities were believed to be superior to humans; they formed, if this expression be permitted, a social class above the upper class in human society. This class of supernatural beings was structured: some deities had more, others less, power, but the structure was more like a class structure than like a bureaucratic one although one god was vaguely recognized as the highest of all. {{harv|Eberhard|1967|p=16}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Chinese historian [[Yu Ying-shih]] disagreed with Eberhard's conclusion that early Chinese religions disregarded "sin" because
&lt;blockquote&gt;… our knowledge of folk religion in ancient China is still too limited to warrant such a general statement. In his ''Analects'' Confucius once quoted a saying that was apparently common among the people as follows: "He who sins against heaven has none to whom he can pray." The word "sin" (''tsui'') here seems close enough to mean a violation of a divine code. {{harv|Yü|1968|p=619}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, none of the English ''Analects'' translations renders ''zui'' as "sin". This context (3/13) quotes Confucius explaining a rhymed [[adage]] about sacrificing to either the [[Kitchen God]] or [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestral spirits]].
*"He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray" ([[James Legge]])
*"He who has put himself in the wrong with Heaven has no means of expiation left" ([[Arthur Waley]])
*"If you incur blame with Heaven, you have nowhere to turn for forgiveness" ([[Burton Watson]])
*"If you offend Heaven, there is no one you can pray to" ([[A. Charles Muller]])

Bodde also disagreed with Eberhard.
&lt;blockquote&gt;I see no reason why the idea of sin must derive solely from belief in a divine law court—an obvious projection of the terrestrial law courts of bureaucratic China. On the contrary, the idea of sin could equally well spring from the fear of violating supernatural sanctions, even though not thought of as codified and bureaucratically administered. If one accepts this supposition, it then become evident that the concept of sin was already known in pre-Buddhist China, though in a form less widespread and perhaps less acutely felt than that disseminated by Buddhism and religious Taoism. {{harv|Bodde|1991|p=163}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Chinese Buddhism==
The history of [[Chinese Buddhism]] began circa the 1st or 2nd century CE when [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Silk Road]] Buddhist missionaries (originally perceived as foreign [[Huang-Lao]] Daoists) arrived in China.

Defining "folk Buddhism" as "a simplified form which even the uneducated could understand", Wolfram {{harvtxt|Eberhard|1967|pp=17-18}} said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems that folk Buddhism almost immediately brought to China the concept of sin and of punishment of sin. Texts, which are attributed to the late second century A.D., already enumerated the punishments meted out to the souls of sinners in different "hells." A sin committed during a lifetime was not immediately punished, but the sinner received punishment after death. This was an attempt to answer the eternal question why some people who had committed many crimes or immoral acts had a good life until their death, escaping punishment by human justice. Pre-Buddhist ethics had no answer to this problem other than to refer to fate (''ming'') as an unclear, inscrutable power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Ming'' [[wikt:命|命]] "life; fate; destiny; command" was personified in the ''[[Siming (deity)|Siming]] '' 司命 (lit. "Controller of Fate"), who arbitrated human destiny.

When Buddhist missionaries, such as [[An Shigao]] (d. 168 CE), began translating [[sūtras]] into Chinese, they used ''zui'' 罪 "crime; guilt" for [[Sanskrit]] ''pāpa'' or ''pāpá'' [[wikt:पाप|पाप]] "evil, misfortune, bad luck, trouble, mischief, harm; sin, vice, crime, guilt." ''Pāpa'' arises from intentions and actions that are ''akuśala'' "evil; inauspicious; unwholesome", which is translated as Chinese ''e'' 惡 "evil" or ''bushan'' 不善 "not good; unholy; bad; evil". [[Damien Keown]] (2003:211) explains, "Essentially, pāpa is that which leads one away from nirvāṇa, and is closer to the concept of error than an offence against divine authority or a condition innate in human nature such as original sin."

Buddhist monks and nuns practice ''pāpa-deśanā'' "confession of sins/infringements (of the [[Patimokkha]] code)", which Chinese transliterates as ''chanhui'' 懺悔 "repent; confess". The alternate term ''xiangbihui'' 向彼悔 "repent sins to others" (from ''pratideśanīya'') emphasizes publicly confessing to the monastic [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] "community". Buddhist confession is not considered an appeal for divine absolution, but an aid to spiritual progress and clearing karmic obstacles.

In the 5th century , Chinese Buddhists used ''wei'' [[wikt:穢|穢]] "dirty; vile; abominable; ugly" to denote "sin", and correspondingly, "the Buddhist 'paradise,' the place in which there is no sin" is called ''jingtu'' 淨土 "clean land; [[Pure Land Buddhism#The Pure Land|pure land]]"  {{harv|Eberhard|1967|p=13}}.

The Buddhist notion of "sin", translated as Chinese ''zui'', was explained in terms of [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]]. Thus, Eberhard explains,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The folk-Buddhistic concept of sin did not refer to an action against a single deity or to the provocation of divine anger, but it meant a violation of a moral code which was somehow set, and was applicable to and valid for the world of the gods as well as the world of man. Even if human justice had dealt with the criminal according to the law of the society, his offense still remained to be punished. Folk Buddhism eliminated the caprices or arbitrary reactions of deities, and instituted a religious system that we might call ''constitutional monarchism'', that is, the belief in a law that is absolutely binding even for the judge and is administered in an impersonal manner by an appointed heavenly judge. {{harv|Eberhard|1967|p=18}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{harvtxt|Eberhard|1967|p=21}} further described the "divine ministries and divine red tape" of modern [[Chinese folk religion]] as "a system of bureaucratic constitutional monarchy".

Buddhism opposes ''pāpa'' "sin; demerit" with ''[[Merit (Buddhism)|punya]]'' "[[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]]; meritorious action", referring to karmic merit gained from actions like giving alms, reciting sutras, and performing [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]] devotions. The Chinese translation of ''punya'' is ''gong'' [[wikt:功|功]] " achievement; result; skill; meritorious service", compounded in ''gong-guo'' 功過 "achievements and errors; merits and sins".

The ethnologist [[Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf]] described the importance of karmic "merit" in Chinese spiritual thought, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;… as Buddhism spread into China from the first century A.D. onwards the idea of sin and the punishment of sins gained wide currency. Indeed the systematisation of such punishments in numerous minutely described hells reflects the Chinese genius for classification. These supernatural punishments for violations of an impersonal moral code were independent of the mechanism of human justice. There was a strong emphasis on the feeling of guilt. Even if sinful actions remained undetected by society, the sinner knew that they were recorded by supernatural powers, and that punishment would inevitably follow after death. But like Tibetan Buddhists the Chinese believed that sins could be outweighed by meritorious actions. Hence feelings of guilt stimulated the giving of alms and support for monks and religious institutions. (1974: 551)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Buddhist scholar [[Alfred Bloom]] refuted the common Western belief that Chinese and Japanese religions have no sense of "sin" or "guilt".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sin and guilt are generally viewed from a Christian perspective in which sin is rebellion against the will of God, and consequent guilt is the feeling of rejection by the divine. Such sin and guilt is, of course, not experienced in the Buddhist context. However, it may be possible to employ the terms, or similar terms such as "depravity" or "defiled" to depict man's involvement in the passions and bondage to the world which prevents him from attaining the high Buddhist ideals revealed in Sakyamuni and his early disciples. Such people realize that they fall short of the potentialities of the human nature symbolized in Buddha. Their guilt is derived not from a feeling of rejection by deity, but by a self-rejection as they become aware of the gulf which separates them from the ideals of the Buddha. (1967:144-145)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some Buddhist Schools, such as [[Pure Land]], teach that we are currently in the degenerate and immoral [[Mappō]] "Latter Day of the Dharma", and can find salvation from sin through faith in [[Amitābha]].

==Daoism==
Early Daoist religious movements – Yellow Turban, Celestial Master, and Highest Clarity schools – believed that ''guo'' 過 "excess; sin" causes sickness and confession cures it. The recorded history of Daoist "sin" began in the 2nd-century CE, contemporaneous with the Buddhist introduction of ''zui'' 罪 "guilt; sin".

The role of "sin" in Daoism is frequently misconstrued. For instance, one introductory text (Cooper et al. 2010:14) claims, "Taoism has no doctrine of sin. Ethics should be incidental to spiritual values, and indeed, there is no ideograph in Chinese which conveys the Western conception of sin and a sense of guilt."  As mentioned above, ''zui'' 罪 means both "sin" and "guilt."

===Yellow Turban===
The [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] (184-205 CE) against the Han dynasty was led by [[Zhang Jue]], who founded ''Taiping Dao'' "The Way of Great Peace", based on the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' "Scripture of Great Peace." According to Stephen Bokenkamp, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Yellow Turbans converted people to their cause through healing practices, including old methods such as incantation and doses of water infused with the ashes of talismans, and a new one – confession of sins. This latter practice is significant. The ''Scripture of Great Peace'' relates confession to the idea that political and cosmic diseases are caused by humans and must be cured on the individual level. Sin, in this text, is the failure to act in accord with one's social role, thereby blocking the circulation of the Dao's energies. (1997:33) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This scripture teaches that sins result in natural disasters, epidemics, social discontent, and war. "Evil has accumulated for innumerable generations through the inheritance of sins" (tr. Kaltenmark 1979:24), and heaven has sent the Celestial Master to save humanity. The ''Scripture of Great Peace'' gives examples of the six worst sins (1979:33-34), such as accumulating [[Tao|Dao]] "the way" or [[De (Chinese)|De]] "inner power" without teaching them to others, and accumulating riches without aiding the poor.

The ''Taiping Jing'' introduced the Daoist dogma of ''chengfu'' 承負 "inherited burden", roughly comparable with Christian [[ancestral sin]]. Toshiaki Yamada (2008:265) explains that ''chengfu'' "refers to the liability for sins and transgressions that individuals and societies inherit from their predecessors. As fault and blame are passed from one generation to another, calamities and misfortune increase." Later generations can make amends for the sins of their ancestors, through reflective ''siguo'' 思過 "considering sin", confessional ''shouguo'' 首過 "admitting sin"), and corrective ''zize'' 自責 "blaming oneself". Daoist ''chengfu'' fundamentally differs from Buddhist ''karma''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Buddhism, the good and evil performed by an individual in past lives is reflected in what form his or her present life takes, and good and evil behavior in the present life determines future rebirth. ''Chengfu'', by contrast, not only considers the past and future lives of the individual, but also that individuals inherit the results of the good and evil of the behavior of their ancestors, and that these results accumulate not only at the individual level, but also at the social level. In this sense, "inherited burden" is based on the unit of the family and, as its extension, of society. (Yamada 2008:266) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Celestial Master===
The ''Tianshi Dao'' [[Way of the Celestial Masters]], founded by [[Zhang Daoling]] in 142 CE, taught that the gods maintained celestial registers of good and evil deeds, and regarded sickness as divine punishment for sins.

The Celestial Masters adapted Yellow Turban beliefs about sin, summarized by the French sinologist Isabelle Robinet. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Law and morality were one. The gods, some of whom were of popular origin, like the gods of the earth and the hearth, watched for and recorded misdeeds such as drunkenness, debauchery, and theft. These had to be expiated by confession, often public, and by penances that consisted of community service, such as road repair, or a retreat (into "purity chambers") to encourage the sinner to reflect. Sickness was seen as a punishment for sin and treated by religious methods like confession or the use of holy water. (1997:58-59) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In cases where Daoist religious practices did not cure sickness, (Bokenkamp 1997:299) "the failure was said to be caused by their not keeping faith with the Dao".

The ''tutan zhai'' 塗炭齋 "mud and ashes retreat" was a Celestial Master ritual meant to rescue the participants and their ancestors from sufferings in ''[[diyu]]'' 地獄 "earth prison; [[hell]]; [[naraka]]; purgatory" (Bokenkamp 1997:162, Robinet 1997:60). A [[Taoist priest]] would daub his face with mud and ashes (a [[synecdoche]] for flood and fire and metaphor for suffering) in penitence, lie on the (preferably frozen) ground, with hands tied behind his back (like a criminal), and confess past sins.

===Highest Clarity===
The [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] "Highest Clarity" School also believed in both individual and ancestral sins. Jeaneane Fowler (2005:143) stated, "The unbreakable bond with ancestors was emphasized in the belief that the sins of the ancestors of several generations past still affected the individual of today. However, reciprocally, the relative sin or merit of a living individual could also affect that of past ancestors. And if that living individual were to achieve salvation, then so would the ancestors."

In Highest Clarity tradition (Bokenkamp 1997:299), annual confession of sins was required on the [[autumnal equinox]] because that is the day when the spirits of one's body reported sins and transgressions to the Sage Lord.

===Sacred Jewel===
The [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] "Sacred Jewel" School of Daoism, which originated in the early 5th century, adapted Buddhist many precepts such as sin and reincarnation. The ''Sanyuan pin'' 三元品 "Precepts of the Three Primes" [[List of Lingbao texts|text]] lists 22 sins for "those who pursue the highest Dao":
*The sin to disregard the scriptures and precepts, harbor doubts or be in two minds about the teaching.
*The sin to despise the sagely writings or criticize the sacred scriptures. 
*The sin to make light of the teachers or break the solemn oath. 
*The sin to slander the elders or disregard the heavenly rules.
*The sin to steal the texts of the scriptures or practice without the proper teacher. 
*The sin to study on your own, without a teacher, or transmit the teachings without proper authorization. …
It further lists 145 sins for "students of the Dao and lay followers":
*The sin to pick a fight with a good fellow.
*The sin to speak evil or hypocrisy. 
*The sin to criticize your teachers, elders, or anyone else. 
*The sin to intoxicate yourself with wine and spirits. 
*The sin to kill living beings or give rise to evil thoughts. 
*The sin to harbor greed and passion, pride and sloth. … (tr. Kohn 1993:100-101)

Beginning around the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), the idea of ''gongguo ge'' 功過格 "ledgers of merit and demerit" became widespread, with sins divinely calculated as demerit points (Yamada 2008:266).

[[Kristofer Schipper]] (1993:222) noted that although modern Daoists believe the sin of losing ''[[qi]]'' "vital energy" can lead to illness and accidents,  sin "is not considered to be irreducible (there is no "original sin"). Neither it is something that is solely and simply moral, but is rather related to the equilibrium of the body."

==Chinese Christianity==
The concept of "sin; offense against god" is a long-standing [[hamartiology|hamartiological]] problem for [[Christianity in China]]. Uhalley and Wu (2001:71-72) described it as a "notorious crux in Christian-Confucian dialogue"; "The central issues here are the doctrines of sin as an offense against God, original sin, and redemption, which are, for Christians, revealed doctrines. But all are absent from, rather than contrary to, Confucian values."

Early [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] generally translated Latin ''peccatum'' "sin" with the Buddhist term ''zui'' 罪 "guilt; sin" rather than the Daoist ''guo'' 過 "exceed; sin". Some semantically related Chinese words are ''chan'' 懺 "repent; regret; confess (sins)", ''hui'' 悔 "regret, repent; show remorse", ''chanhui'' 懺悔 "confess; repent", ''shezui'' 赦罪 " pardon (a criminal); forgive (a sinner)", ''zuiquian'' 罪愆 "offense; [[sin of omission]]", ''buke raoshu de zui'' 不可饶恕的罪 "[[mortal sin]]", and ''ke yuanliang de zui'' 可原谅的罪 "[[venial sin]]".

Some Christian missionaries in China [[Christian apologetics|apologetically]] blamed their lack of converts upon Chinese misunderstandings of "sin". John {{harvtxt|Griffith|1859|p=42}} claimed, "Sin, however, in the Scriptural sense, is not recognized by their system. The contrast of good and evil, according to their view, resolves itself into a difference in degree." [[James Legge]] (1881:294) said neither Confucianism nor Daoism knew anything about the [[propitiation]] of sin, and, "The knowledge of God in Confucianism, which has become a heritage of the Chinese people, is very precious; but the restriction of the worship of Him to the sovereign has prevented the growth and wide development among them of a sense of sin." [[Dyer Ball]] (1927:535-536) described the "vague" Chinese idea of sin, and "the task of tasks is to bring home to the native mind the sense of what sin is.

In the 1980s-1990s, after the end of the Cultural Revolution, a number of Chinese [[Cultural Christian#Cultural Christians in China|Cultural Christians]] have advocated for the doctrine of original sin as having warrant in mainland China due to the sociopolitical unrest that it has recently experienced {{harv|Chow|2013}}.

==Sociological aspects==
[[Cultural anthropology]] traditionally distinguished two modalities of [[social control]]: a [[shame society]] based on inculcating feelings of shame and the threat of [[ostracism]], and a [[guilt society]] based on feelings of guilt and the threat of punishment. Western scholars generally classify the Chinese and Japanese societies as shame based, emphasizing the psychological fear of [[Face (sociological concept)#Psychology|losing face]].

Eberhard explained that in traditional [[Chinese culture]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sin was defined as actions, behavior, and thoughts that violated rules set up by supernatural powers. Sin is the equivalent of legal guilt, which is a violation of rules set up by earthly powers and the emotion which results from such a violation of legal rules. We might say that persons who have such a concept of "sin," and the emotions accompanying a sinful act or thought, seem to have internalized social norms to a perhaps even higher degree than persons who have only a feeling for legal guilt, because Chinese supernatural rules are based upon social norms. They are not in contradiction to these social norms and laws but strengthen and tighten them. {{harv|Eberhard|1967|p=14}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{harvtxt|Bodde|1991|p=162}} criticized this position: "Eberhard's separation of shame from guilt and sin seems to be too absolute and arbitrary. Surely in traditional China, as in other societies, all three feelings frequently entered into cases of wrongdoing, even though their proportions might vary according to the background of the particular wrongdoer."

Based on experiments in [[cross-cultural psychiatry]] (see {{harvnb|Qian|2007}}), modern scholars doubt the thesis of a Chinese "shame culture."

'''David Lee Hull''' (15 June 1935 – 11 August 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = DAVID L. HULL 1935-2010: Top philosopher of science backed gay, lesbian rights|author = Wisniewski|newspaper = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date = August 12, 2010|url = http://www.suntimes.com/news/obituaries/2591596,CST-NWS-x-Hull12.article|accessdate = October 21, 2015|first = Mary|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100816090747/http://www.suntimes.com/news/obituaries/2591596%2CCST-NWS-x-Hull12.article|archive-date = August 16, 2010|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American philosopher with a particular interest in the [[philosophy of biology]]. In addition to his academic prominence, he was well known as a [[gay]] man who fought for the rights of other gay and lesbian philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Overmann, R.J. (2000). "David Hull, Hod carrier." Biology and Philosophy 15: 311—320.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Hull was one of the first graduates of the [[History and Philosophy of Science]] department at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]].  After earning his PhD from IU he taught at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] for 20 years before moving to [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]], where he taught for another 20 years.  Hull was a former president of the Philosophy of Science Association and the Society for Systematic Biology.  He was particularly well known for his argument that species are not sets or collections but rather spatially and temporally extended individuals (also called the individuality thesis or "species-as-individuals" thesis).

Hull also proposed an elaborate discussion of science as an evolutionary process in his 1988 book, which also offered a historical account of the "taxonomy wars" of the 1960s and 1970s between three competing schools of taxonomy: [[phenetics]], [[evolutionary systematics]], and [[cladistics]]. In Hull's view, science evolves like organisms and populations do, with a demic population structure, subject to selection for ideas based on "conceptual inclusive credit." Either novelty or citation of work gives credit, and the professional careers of scientists share in credit by using successful research. This is a "hidden hand" account of scientific progress.

He was Dressler Professor in the Humanities Emeritus at [[Northwestern University]].

'''Dzogchen''' ({{bo|w=rdzogs chen}}) or "[[Pāramitā|Great Perfection]]", Sanskrit: '''अतियोग''', is a tradition of teachings in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] aimed at discovering and continuing in the natural [[Ground (Dzogchen)|primordial state]] of being.{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=4}} It is a central teaching of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and of [[Bon]].{{refn|group=quote|John Pettit: "Great Perfection" variously indicates the texts (''āgama, lung'') and oral instructions (''upadeśa, man ngag'') that indicate the nature of enlightened wisdom (''rdzogs chen gyi gzhung dang man ngag''), the verbal conventions of those texts (''rdzogs chen gyi chos skad''), the yogis who meditate according to those texts and instructions (''rdzogs chen gyi rnal &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;byor pa''), a famous monastery where the Great Perfection was practiced by monks and yogis (''rdzogs chen dgon sde''), and the philosophical system (''siddhānta, grub mtha&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'') or vision (''darśana, lta ba'') of the Great Perfection.{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=4}}}} In these traditions, Dzogchen is the highest and most definitive path of the nine vehicles to liberation.{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=82}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Padmasambhava in yam-yum.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Vajrasattva in [[Yab-Yum|yab-yum]], which represents the primordial union of wisdom and compassion. The male figure is usually linked to [[Karuṇā|compassion]] and [[Upaya|skillful means]], while the female partner relates to [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]].]]
''Dzogchen'' is composed of two terms:
* ''rdzogs'' – perfection&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;
* ''chen'' – great&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;

The term initially referred to the "highest perfection" of deity visualisation, after the visualisation has been dissolved and one rests in the natural state of the innately [[Luminous mind|luminous and pure mind]].{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; In the 10th and 11th century, ''Dzogchen'' emerged as a separate tantric vehicle in the [[Nyingma]] tradition,&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; used synonymously with the Sanskrit term ''ati yoga'' (primordial yoga).{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=24}}

According to van Schaik, in the 8th-century tantra ''Sarvabuddhasamāyoga'' 
{{quote|... there seems to be an association of Anuyoga with yogic bliss, and Atiyoga with a realization of the nature of reality via that bliss. This ties in with the three stages of deity yoga described in a work attributed to Padmasambhava: development (kye), perfection (dzog) and great perfection (dzogchen).&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;}}

According to the 14th Dalai Lama, the term ''dzogchen'' may be a rendering of the [[Sanskrit]] term ''mahāsandhi''.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=208}}

According to Anyen Rinpoche, the true meaning is that the student must take the entire path as an interconnected entity of equal importance. Dzogchen is perfect because it is an all-inclusive totality that leads to middle way realization, in avoiding the two extremes of nihilism and eternalism. It classifies outer, inner and secret teachings, which are only separated by the cognitive construct of words and completely encompasses Tibetan Buddhist wisdom.{{sfn| Anyen Rinpoche | 2006 | p = 12–13}}  It can be as easy as taking [[Bodhicitta]] as the method, and failing this is missing an essential element to accomplishment.{{sfn| Anyen Rinpoche | 2006 | p = 57}}

==Origins and history==

===Traditional accounts===

====Nyingma tradition====
[[File:Adi Buddha Samantabhadra.jpg|thumb|Adi Buddha [[Samantabhadra]].]]
According to the Nyingma tradition,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}} the primordial Buddha [[Samantabhadra]] taught Dzogchen to the Buddha [[Vajrasattva]], who transmitted it to the first human lineage holder, the Indian [[Garab Dorje]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 55 CE).{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}} According to tradition, the Dzogchen teachings were brought to Tibet by [[Padmasambhava]] in the late 8th and early 9th centuries. He was aided by two Indian masters, [[Vimalamitra]] and [[Vairocana]].{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} According to the Nyingma tradition, they transmitted the Dzogchen teachings in three distinct series, namely the Mind Series (''sem-de''), Space series (''long-de''), and Secret Instruction Series (''men-ngak-de'').{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}} According to tradition, these teachings were concealed shortly afterward, during the 9th century, when the Tibetan empire disintegrated.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} From the 10th century forward, innovations in the Nyingma tradition were largely introduced historically as revelations of these concealed scriptures, known as [[Terma (religion)|terma]].{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}}

====Bon tradition====
In the fourteenth century, Loden Nyingpo revealed a [[Terma (religion)|terma]] containing the story of [[Tonpa Shenrab Miwoche]].{{sfn|Schaik|2011|p=99}} According to this terma, Dzogchen originated with the founder of the Bon tradition, Tonpa Shenrab, who lived 18,000 years ago, ruling the kingdom of Tazik, which supposedly lay west of Tibet.{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}} He transmitted these teachings to the region of Zhang-zhung, the far western part of the Tibetan cultural world.{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} The earliest Bon literature only exists in Tibetan manuscripts, the earliest of which can be dated to the 11th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} The Bon tradition also has a threefold classification, namely ''Dzogchen'', ''A-tri'', and the "Zhang-zhung Aural Lineage (''zhang-zhung nyen-gyu'').{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}}

===Historical origins and development===

====Tibetan Empire (7th–9th century)====
The written history of Tibet begins in the early 7th century, when the Tibetan kingdoms were united, and Tibet expanded throughout large parts of Central Asia.{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=3}} [[Songtsen Gampo]] (reign ca.617-649/50) conquered the kingdom of Zhangzhung in western Tibet, dominated Nepal, and threatened the Chinese dominance in strategically important areas of the [[Silk Road]].{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=4}} He is also credited with the adoption of a writing system, the establishment of a legal code, and the introduction of Buddhism, though it probably only played a minor role.{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=4}} [[Tri Songdetsen]] (742-ca.797) adopted Buddhism, but also maintained the martial traditions of the Tibetan empire.{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=4}} The Tibetans controlled Dunhuang, a major Buddhist center, from the 780s until the mid-ninth century.{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=4-5}} Halfway through the 9th century the Tibetan empire [[History of Tibet#Era of Fragmentation|collapsed]].{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=5}} Royal patronage of Buddhism was lost, leading to a decline of Buddhism in Tibet,{{sfn|Schaeffer|Kapstein|Tuttle|2013|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/libra-oa:7588|title=Bringing Light Into the Darkness: An Intellectual History of Tibet's Dark Age (842-978 CE)|last=Manuel|first=Lopez,|date=2014|website=UVA Library {{!}} Virgo|language=en|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to recover with the renaissance of Tibetan culture occurring from the late 10th century to the early 12th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} known as the later dissemination of Buddhism.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}

====Traditional classification of Dzogchen texts (9th–14th century)====
Traditionally, the early Dzogchen literature is categorized into three categories,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} which more or less reflect the historical development of Dzogchen:
# [[Semde]] (Wylie: ''sems sde''; Skt: ''cittavarga''), the "Mind series"; this category contains the earliest (proto) Dzogchen teachings.{{sfn|Schaik|2004a}} Tradition attributes them to Padmasmabhava and his consorts, and dates them to the 8th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} but they first appeared in the 9th century, written by Tibetans;{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}
#[[Longde (Dzogchen)|Longde]] (Wylie:  ''klong sde''; Skt: ''abhyantaravarga''), the series of Space; this series reflects the developments of the 11th-14th centuries, when new Buddhist techniques and doctrines  were introduced into Tibet;{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} 
# [[Menngagde]] (Wylie:  ''man ngag sde'', Skt: ''upadeshavarga''), the series of secret Oral Instructions, also known as Seminal Heart or Nyingthik (''snying thig''), also reflects the developments of the 11th-14th centuries; this series has overshadowed the other two. This division focuses on two aspects of practice: ''kadag trekchö'', "the cutting through of primordial purity", and ''lhündrub tögal'', "the direct crossing of spontaneous presence".&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Marcia Binder (Ed.) (2002). The Dzogchen Primer: Embracing The Spiritual Path According To The Great Perfection. London, Great Britain: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-57062-829-7}} pg. 38)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origins and Dunhuang texts (8th–10th century)====
[[File:Dzogchen text from Dunhuang 9th century.jpeg|thumb|right|Dzogchen text from Dunhuang 9th century]]
According to [[Sam van Schaik]], who studies early Dzogchen manuscripts from the [[Dunhuang]] caves, the Dzogchen texts are influenced by earlier Mahayana sources such as the [[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]] and [[Buddhist Tantras|Indian Buddhist Tantras]] with their teaching of [[shunyata|emptiness]] and [[Luminous mind|luminosity]], which in Dzogchen texts are presented as 'ever-purity' (''ka-dag'') and 'spontaneous presence' (''lhun-grub'').&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam van Schaik also notes that there is a discrepancy between the histories as presented by the traditions, and the picture that emerges from those manuscripts.{{sfn|Schaik|2004a}}&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV"&gt;[http://earlytibet.com/2011/08/03/early-dzogchen-iv/ Sam van Schaik, ''Early Dzogchen IV: the role of Atiyoga'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no record of Dzogchen as a separate tradition or vehicle prior to the 10th century,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}} although the terms ''atiyoga'' (as a higher practice than Tantra) and ''dzogchen'' do appear in 8th and 9th century Indian tantric texts.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} There is also no independent attestation of the existence of any separate traditions or lineages under the name of ''Dzogchen'' outside of Tibet,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} and it may be a unique Tibetan teaching,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=168}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} drawing on multiple influences, including both native Tibetan non-Buddhist beliefs and Chinese and Indian Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}

According to van Schaik, the term ''atiyoga'' first appeared in the 8th century, in an Indian tantra called ''Sarvabuddhasamāyoga''.{{refn|group=note|Tibetan has a ninefold classification scheme for the Buddhist teachings. First come the vehicles of the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas. Then come the three vehicles of "outer" yoga, and then the three vehicles of "inner" yoga. The "inner yoga" vehicles are Mahāyoga, Anuyoga and Atiyoga. The Dzogchen teachings are part of Atiyoga.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;}} In this text, ''Anuyoga'' is the stage of yogic bliss, while ''Atiyoga'' is the stage of the realization of the "nature of reality."&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; According to van Schaik, this fits with the three stages of deity yoga as described in a work attributed to Padmasambhava: development (kye), perfection (dzog) and great perfection (dzogchen).&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; ''Atiyoga'' here is not a vehicle, but a stage or aspect of yogic practice.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; In Tibetan sources, until the 10th century ''Atiyoga'' is characterized as a "mode" (''tshul'') or a "view" (''lta ba''), which is to be applied within deity yoga.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;

According to van Schaik, the concept of dzogchen, "great perfection," first appeared as the culmination of the meditative practice of [[deity yoga]]{{refn|group=note|The visualization of a deity and recitation of his or her mantra.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;}} around the 8th century.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; The term ''dzogchen'' was likely taken from the ''[[Guhyagarbhatantra]]''. This tantra describes, as other tantras, how in the creation stage one generates a visualisation of a deity and its [[mandala]]. This is followed by the completion stage, in which one dissolves the deity and the mandala into oneself, merging oneself with the deity. In the ''Guhyagarbhatantra'' and some other tantras, there follows a stage called ''rdzogs chen'', in which one rests in the natural state of the innately [[Luminous mind|luminous and pure mind]].{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}

In the 9th and 10th centuries deity yoga was contextualized in Dzogchen in terms of nonconceptuality, [[Nondualism|nonduality]] and the spontaneous presence of the enlightened state.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; Some Dunhuang texts dated at the 10th century show the first signs of a developing nine vehicles system. Nevertheless, ''Anuyoga'' and ''Atiyoga'' are still regarded then as modes of ''Mahāyoga'' practice.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; Only in the 11th century came ''Atiyoga'' to be threatened as a separate vehicle, at least in the newly emerging Nyingma tradition.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; Nevertheless, even in the 13th century (and later) the idea of Atiyoga as a vehicle was controversial in other Buddhist schools.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt; Van Schaik quotes Sakya Pandita as writing, in his ''Distinguishing the Three Vows'':
{{quote|If one understands this tradition properly,&lt;br&gt;Then the view of Atiyoga too&lt;br&gt;Is wisdom and not a vehicle.&lt;ref group=web name="Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV" /&gt;}}

====Early Dzogchen – the Mind series (9–10th century)====
Most of the early Dzogchen literature, which are claimed to be "translations", are original compositions from a much later date than the 8th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} According to Germano, the Dzogchen-tradition first appeared in the first half of the 9th century, with a series of short texts attributed to Indian saints.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} They were codified into a canon of eighteen texts which were referred to as "mind oriented" (''sems phyogs''), and later became known as "mind series" (sems de''). {{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}

The mind series reflect the teachings of early Dzogchen, which rejected all forms of practice, and asserted that striving for liberation would simply create more delusion.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} One has simply to recognize the nature of one's own mind, which is naturally empty (''stong pa''), luminous ('''od gsal ba''), and pure.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} According to Germano, its characteristic language, which is marked by naturalism and negation, is already pronounced in some Indian tantras.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} Nevertheless, these texts are still inextricably bound up with tantric [[Mahayoga]], with its visualisations of deities and mandals, and complex initiations.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}

During the 9th and 10th centuries these texts, which represent the dominant form of the tradition in the 9th and 10th centuries,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} were gradually transformed into full-fledged tantras, culminating in the  [[Kulayarāja Tantra]] (''kun byed rgyal po'', "The All-Creating King"{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}), in the last half of the 10th or the first half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} According to Germano, this tantra was historically perhaps the most important and widely quoted of all Dzogchen scriptures.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}

====Transformation – the Space and Instruction series (11th–14th century)====
Early Dzogchen was completely transformed in the 11th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} with the [[History of Tibet#Era of Fragmentation|renaissance of Tibetan culture]] occurring from the late 10th century to the early 12th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}known as the later dissemination of Buddhism.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} New techniques and doctrines were introduced from India, resulting in new schools of Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} and radical new developments in Dzogchen doctrine and practice, with a growing emphasis on meditative practice.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} The older Bon and Nyingma traditions incorporated these new influences through the process of [[Terma (religion)|Treasure revelation]].{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} Especially the ''[[yogini]]'' tantras were influential, involving horrific imagery and violent rituals, erotic imagery, and sexual and somatic practices.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} These influences are reflected in the rise of [[subtle body]] representations and practices, new pantheons of wrathful and erotic Buddhas, increasingly [[Antinomianism|antinomium]] rhetorics, and a focus on death-motifs.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546-2547}}

These influences were incorporated in several movements such as the "Secret Cycle" (''gsang skor''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} "Ultra Pith" (''yang tig''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} "Brahmin's tradition" (''bram ze'i lugs''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} the "Space Class Series,"{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} and especially the "Instruction Class series",{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} which culminated in the "Seminal Heart" (''snying thig''), which emerged in the late 11th and early 12th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}}

The "Seminal Heart" belongs to the "Instruction series."{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} The main texts of the instruction series are the so-called [[seventeen tantras]] and the two "seminal heart" collections, namely the ''[[Vima Nyingtik|bi ma snying thig]]'' (''Vima Nyingthig'',{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} "Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra") and the ''mkha' 'gro snying thig'' (''Khandro nyingthig'',{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} "Seminal Heart of the Dakini").{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} The "Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra" is attributed to Vimalamitra, but was largely composed by their discoverers, in the 11th and 12th century.{{sfn|Germano|Gyatso|2001|p=244}} The "Seminal Heart of the Dakini" was produced by Tsultrim Dorje (''Tshul khrims rdo rje'')(1291-1315/17).{{sfn|Germano|Gyatso|2001|p=244}}

The Seminal Heart teachings became the dominant Dzogchen-teachings,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}  but was also criticized by conservative strands within the Nyingma-school.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} The most important Nyingma of the 12th century, Nyangrel Nyingma Özer (''Nyang ral nyi ma 'od zer'', 1136-1204{{refn|group=note|In the eleventh and twelfth centuries there were several competing terma traditions surrounding [[Vimalamitra]], [[Songtsen Gampo]], [[Vairotsana]] and Padmasambhava.{{sfn|Davidson|2005|p=229}} At the end of the 12th century, there was the "victory of the Padmasambhava cult." {{sfn|Davidson|2005|p=278}} Nyangrel Nyima Özer was the principal architect of the Padmasambhava mythos.{{sfn|Gyatso|2006}} The [[Maratika Cave]] is referred to in Tibetan literature from the 12th century. ''[[Kathang Zanglingma]]'', a terma with the biography of Padmasambhava, revealed and transmitted by Nyangrel Nyima Ozer, narrates the "events:  which made the Maratika caves a sacred place for [[Vajrayana]] practitioners.}}
) developed his "Crown Pith" (''spyi ti'') to reassert the older traditions in a new form.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} His writings, which were also presented as revelations, are marked by a relative absence of ''yogini'' tantra influence, and transcend the prescriptions of specific practices, as well as the rhetoric of violence, sexuality and transgression.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}

====Longchenpa's ''Seven Treasuries'' (14th century)====
A pivotal figure in the history of Dzogchen was [[Longchenpa|Longchenpa Rabjampa]] (1308-1364, possibly 1369). He systematized the Seminal Heart teachings{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} and other collections of texts that were circulating at the time in Tibet,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=169}} in the [[Seven Treasuries]] (''mdzod bdun''), the "Trilogy of Natural Freedom" (''rang grol skor gsum''), and the [[Trilogy of Natural Ease]] (''ngal gso skor gsum'').{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} Longchenpa refined the terminology and interpretations, and integrated the Seminal Heart teachings with broader Mahayana literature.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}

Malcolm Smith notes that Longchenpa's ''Tshig don mdzod,'' the [[Seven Treasuries|"Treasury of Subjects,"]]&lt;ref group=web name="MS"&gt;[http://www.atikosha.org/2012/09/a-preliminary-note-on-vimalamitras.html Malcolm Smith, ''A Preliminary Note on Vimalamitra's Aural Lineage '']&lt;/ref&gt; was preceded by several other texts by other authors dealing with the same topics.&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt; Smith mentions the 12th century text "The Eleven Subjects of The Great Perfection"{{refn|group=note|''rdzogs pa chen po tshig don bcu gcig pa bzhugs so''}} by Nyi 'bum. This itself was derived from the eighth and final chapter of the commentary to [[Necklace of Precious Pearls|The String of Pearls Tantra]].&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt;

Nyi 'bum's "Eleven Subjects" is the basis for Longchenpa's "Treasury of Subjects" as well as Rigzin Godem's "The Aural Lineage of Vimalamitra"{{refn|group=note|''rgod kyi ldem 'phru can. dgongs pa zang thal''}}&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt; from the Gongpa Zangthal.&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt;

According to Smith, Nyi 'bum's "Eleven Subjects" provided the outline upon which Longchenpa's "Treasury of Subjects" was based, using the general sequence of citations, and even copying or reworking entire passages.&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt; According to Smith, Nyi 'bum's "Eleven Subjects" was transmitted in a close circle of disciples, with very little outside contact, whereas Longchenpa's "Treasury of Subjects" contains responses to 14th century scholastic objections to Dzogchen.&lt;ref group=web name="MS"/&gt;

====Later termas====
In subsequent centuries more additions followed, including the "Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones"{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} (''kar-gling zhi-khro''){{refn|group=note|''zab-chos zhi-khro dgongs-pa rang-grol''}} by [[Karma Lingpa]],{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=ix}} (1326–1386), popularly known as "Karma Lingpa's Peaceful and Wrathful Ones",{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} which includes the two texts of the ''[[Bardo Thodol|bar-do thos-grol]]'', the "Tibetan Book of the Dead".{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}}{{refn|group=note|The ''bar-do thos-grol'' was translated by Kazi Dawa Samdup (1868-1922), and edited and published by W.Y. Evans-Wenz. This translation was popularized as "the Tibetan Book of the Dead", but contains many mistakes in translation and interpretation.{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}}{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71-115}} See also {{Citation | last =Reynolds | first =John Myrdin | year =1989 | title =Self-Liberation through seeing with naked awareness | publisher =Station Hill Press, Inc.}}}}

Other important termas are "The Penetrating Wisdom" (''dgongs pa zang thal''), revealed by Rinzin Gödem (''rig 'dzin rgod ldem'', 1337-1409);{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} and "The Nucleus of Ati's Profound Meaning" (''rDzogs pa chen po a ti zab don snying po'') by Terdak Lingpa (''gter bdag gling pa'', 1646-1714).{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}

Particularly influential of these later revelations are the works of [[Jigme Lingpa]] (1730–1798).{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} His [[Longchen Nyingthig]] (''klong chen snying thig''), "The Heart-essence of the Vast Expanse"{{sfn|Klein|Wangmo|2010}} or "The Seminal Heart of the Great Matrix",{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} is a hidden teaching from [[Padmasambhava]] which was revealed by Jigme Lingpa.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} The Longchen Nyingthig is said to be the essence of the ''Vima Nyingthig'' and ''Khandro Nyingthig'', the "Early Nyingthig,",{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} and has become known as the "later Nyingthig".{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} It is one of the most widely practiced teachings in the Nyingmapa school.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=xxxv}} [[Patrul Rinpoche]]  (1808–1887) wrote down Jigme Lingpa's pre-liminary practices into a book called ''The Words of My Perfect Teacher''.{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2011}}

====Modern times====
In the early 20th century the first publications on Tibetan Buddhism appeared in the west. An early publication on Dzogchen was the so-called "Tibetan Book of the Dead," edited by W.Y. Evans-Wentz, which became highly popular, but contains many mistakes in translation and interpretation.{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71-115}} Dzogchen has been popularized in the western world by the Tibetan diaspora, starting with the exile of 1959. Well-known teachers include [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] and [[Namkhai Norbu]]. The 14th Dalai Lama is also a qualified Dzogchen teacher.&lt;ref group=web name="GD" /&gt;

[[Chögyam Trungpa]] coined the term ''Maha Ati'' for Dzogchen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trungpa |first=Chögyam |authorlink=Chögyam_Trungpa |title=The Essential Chogyam Trungpa |year=1999 |publisher=Shambhala Publications, Inc |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=1-57062-466-6 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; a master of the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism. He generally preferred to introduce [[Sanskrit]] rather than [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] terms to his students and felt "Maha Ati" was the closest equivalent for Dzogchen, although he acknowledged it was an unorthodox choice. The coinage does not follow the [[sandhi]] rules which would be rendered as mahāti. This serves as an indication of its pedigree as a [[calque]].

===Kagyu and Gelugpa===
Dzogchen has also been taught and practiced in the [[Kagyu]]{{refn|group=note|Wylie: ''bka' brgyud''}} lineage,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=169}} beginning with the Third [[Karmapa]], [[Rangjung Dorje]]  (1284–1339).{{refn|group=note|Wylie: ''rang byung rdo rje''}} 

The [[Drikung]] Kagyu also have a tradition of Dzogchen teachings, the ''yangzab dzogchen''.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Krasser, Tibetan studies, International Association for Tibetan Studies. Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1997 - Tibet (China), page 586&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lozang Gyatso, 5th Dalai Lama]] (1617–1682), [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama]] ( 1876–1933), and [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama]] (present), all [[Gelug]]pas, are also noted Dzogchen masters, although their adoption of the practice of Dzogchen has been a source of controversy among more conservative members of the Gelug tradition.&lt;ref group=web name="GD"&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/messages/dolgyal-shugden/ganden-tripa/the-shugden-affair-i Georges Dreyfus, ''The Shugden Affair: Origins of a Controversy (Part I)''. Official website of the Office of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103131534/http://dalailama.com/messages/dolgyal-shugden/ganden-tripa/the-shugden-affair-i|date=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual background==
[[File:Appearance of sky for weather forecast, Dhaka, Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|The metaphors of sky and spaciousness are often used to describe the nature of mind in Dzogchen.]]
[[Tibetan Buddhism]] developed five main schools. The Madhyamika philosophy obtained a central position in the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]], [[Sakya]] and [[Gelugpa]] schools. The [[Jonang|Jonang school]], which until recently was thought to be extinct, developed a different interpretation of [[Two truths doctrine|ultimate truth]].
Dzogchen texts use unique terminology to describe the Dzogchen view. Some of these terms deal with the different elements and features of the mind. The generic term for consciousness is ''shes pa'', and includes the six sense consciousnesses. Different forms of shes pa include ''ye shes'' ([[Jñāna]], 'pristine consciousness') and ''shes rab'' ([[Prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]], wisdom).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sam van Schaik]], two significant terms used in Dzogchen literature is the Ground (''gzhi'') and Gnosis (''rig pa''), which represent the "ontological and gnoseological aspects of the nirvanic state" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Dzogchen literature also describes nirvana as the "expanse" (''klong'' or ''dbyings'') or the "true expanse" (''chos dbyings'', Sanskrit: [[Dharmadhatu]]). The term [[Dharmakaya]] is also often associated with these terms in Dzogchen,&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; as explained by [[Tulku Urgyen]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dharmakaya is like space. You cannot say there is any limit to space in any direction. No matter how far you go, you never reach a point where space stops and that is the end of space. Space is infinite in all directions; so is dharmakaya. Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Pema Kunsang; Wellsprings of the Great Perfection The Lives and Insights of the Early Masters, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Malcolm Smith, the Dzogchen view is also based on the Indian Buddhist [[Buddha-nature]] doctrine of the [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 14th Dalai Lama  the Ground is the Buddha-nature, the nature of mind which is emptiness.&lt;ref&gt; The (14th) Dalai Lama (2000), ''Dzogchen: Heart Essence of the Great Perfection'', p.109&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rinpoche Thrangu, [[Rangjung Dorje]] (1284–1339), the third Karmapa Lama (head of the Karma Kagyu) and Nyingma lineage holder, also stated that the Ground is Buddha-nature.{{refn|group=note|Rangjung Dorje also influenced [[Dolpopa]]. In 1321 the famous scholar [[Dolpopa]] (1292-1361) visited [[Tsurphu]] Monastery for the first time and had extensive discussions with Rangjung Dorje about doctrinal issues. It appears that Rangjung Dorje almost certainly influenced the development of some of Dolpopa's theories, possibly including his [[Zhentong]] (''gzhan stong'') method.&lt;ref&gt;Stearns, Cyrus (1999). ''The Buddha from Dolpo: A Study of the Life and Thought of the Tibetan Master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen'', pp. 17, 47–48, 51–52, 61. State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|0-7914-4191-1}} (hc); {{ISBN|0-7914-4192-X}} (pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to Rinpoche Thrangu, "whether one does Mahamudra or Dzogchen practice, buddha nature is the foundation from which both of these meditations develop."&lt;ref&gt;Rinpoche Thrangu (2006), ''On Buddha Essence: A Commentary on Rangjung Dorje's Treatise'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basis===
[[File:Tibetan Dharmacakra.png|thumb|right|180px|The [[gankyil]] symbolizes the inseparability of all of the groups of three in Dzogchen teaching, such as the Base, Path, and Fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Namkhai Norbu; The Crystal and the Way of Light: Sutra, Tantra, and Dzogchen, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A key concept in Dzogchen is the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|'basis', 'ground' or 'primordial state']] (Tibetan: ''gzhi'', Sanskrit: ''sthana''), also called the general ground (''spyi gzhi'') or the original ground (''gdod ma'i gzhi''). The basis is the original state "before realization produced buddhas and nonrealization produced sentient beings". It is atemporal and unchanging and yet it is "noetically potent", giving rise to mind, delusion and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis is also associated with the term [[Dharmata]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis has three qualities:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, p. 13.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petit, John Whitney (1999), Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzochen, the Great Perfection, Boston: Wisdom Publications, pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Essence - purity, which refers to emptiness (''[[shunyata]]'', ''stong pa nyid'')
*Nature - Natural perfection (''lhun grub''), also translated "spontaneous presence",&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; which also refers to luminosity or clarity (''gsal''). 
*Compassion (''[[karuṇā]]'', ''thugs rje''), the "immanent presence of the ground in all appearances".&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text, "An Aspirational prayer for the Ground, Path and Result" defines the three aspects of the basis thus:&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, pp. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

::''Because its essence is empty, it is free from the limit of eternalism''
::''Because its nature is luminous, it is free from the extreme of nihilism''
::''Because its compassion is unobstructed, it is the ground of the manifold manifestations''

Moreover, the basis is associated with the primordial or original [[Buddhahood]], also called [[Samantabhadra]], which is said to be beyond time itself and hence Buddhahood is not something to be gained, but an act of recognizing what is already immanent in all sentient beings.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, this view of the basis stems from the Indian [[Buddha-nature]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms used to describe the basis include unobstructed (''ma 'gags pa''), universal (''kun khyab'') and omnipresent.&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rigpa===
[[File:Quartz crystal.jpg|thumb|Rigpa is often explained through the metaphor of a crystal or a [[crystal ball]]]]
[[File:Melong Dorje.jpg|thumb|Melong Dorje, wearing a [[Melong]] (mirror), which is a symbol of ''ka dag''.]]
''[[Rigpa]]'' (Sk: ''Vidya'', "knowledge") is a central concept in Dzogchen which means "unconfused knowledge of the basis that is its own state".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 12.
&lt;/ref&gt; It is "reflexively self-aware primordial wisdom,"{{sfn|Klein|Wangyal|2006|p=109}} which is self-reflexively aware of itself as unbounded wholeness.{{sfn|Ray|2001|p=v}}{{refn|group=quote|Descriptions of ''rigpa'':
* Klein and Wangyal: "[...] the essence and base of self-arisen wisdom is the allbase, that primordial open awareness is the base, and that recognition of this base is not separate from the primordial wisdom itself [...] that open awareness is itself authentic and its authenticity is a function of it being aware of, or recognizing itself as, the base [...] The reflexively self-aware primordial wisdom is itself open awareness (''[[rigpa]]''), inalienably one with unbounded wholeness."{{Klein|Wangyal|2006|p=109}}
* Reginald Rey: "...primordial wisdom's recognition of itself as unbounded wholeness [...] the incorruptible mindnature.{{sfn|Ray|2001|p=v}}}} The analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one's true nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections; or like a [[crystal ball]] that takes on the colour of the material on which it is placed without itself being changed. The knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity (which cannot be found by searching nor identified){{sfn|Third Dzogchen Rinpoche|2008|p=152}} is called [[rigpa]].{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=97}}

According to [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]], there are three aspects of rigpa:&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;
# The essential nature of rigpa: primal purity (ka-dag). Rigpa is primordially without stains, both being self-void (''rang-stong'') and other-void (''gzhan-stong'');
# The influencing nature of rigpa: the manner in which rigpa influences others. Rigpa is responsiveness (''thugs-rje'', compassion). It responds effortlessly and spontaneously to others with compassion;
# The functional nature of rigpa: rigpa effortlessly and spontaneously establishes "appearances" (''lhun-grub'').

As Berzin notes, all of the good qualities (''yon-tan'') of a Buddha are already "are innate (''lhan-skyes'') to rigpa, which means that they arise simultaneously with each moment of rigpa, and primordial (''gnyugs-ma''), in the sense of having no beginning.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;

Sam van Schaik translates rigpa as "[[gnosis]]" which he glosses as "a form of awareness aligned to the nirvanic state".&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that other definitions of rigpa include "free from elaborations" (''srpos bral''), "non conceptual" (''rtog med'') and "transcendent of the intellect" (''blo 'das''). It is also often paired with emptiness, as in the contraction ''rig stong'' (gnosis-emptiness).&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

John W. Pettit notes that ''rigpa'' is seen as beyond affirmation and negation, acceptance and rejection, and therefore it is known as "natural" (''ma bcos pa'') and "effortless" (''rtsol med'') once recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, Dzogchen is also known as the pinnacle and final destination of all paths.

===Ma Rigpa===
''Ma Rigpa'' ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]) is the opposite of rigpa or knowledge. ''Ma rigpa'' is ignorance or unawareness, the failure to recognize the nature of the basis. An important theme in Dzogchen texts is explaining how ignorance arises from the basis or [[Dharmata]], which is associated with ''ye shes'' or 'pristine consciousness'.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Automatically arising unawareness (''lhan-skyes ma-rigpa'') exists because the basis is seen having a natural cognitive potentiality and luminosity (''gdangs''), which is the ground for [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]]. When consciousness fails to recognize that all phenomena arise as the creativity (''rtsal'') of the nature of mind and misses its own luminescence or does not "recognize its own face", sentient beings arise instead of Buddhas. As explained by [[Tulku Urgyen]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the case of an ignorant sentient being the mind is called empty cognizance suffused with ignorance (marigpa). The mind of all the Buddhas is called empty cognizance suffused with awareness (rigpa).&lt;ref&gt;Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche; Repeating the Words of the Buddha, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Vimalamitra]]'s ''Illuminating Lamp'', delusion arises because sentient beings "lapse towards external mentally apprehended objects". This external grasping is then said to produce sentient beings out of [[dependent origination]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This dualistic conceptualizing process which leads to samsara is termed [[Manas-vijnana|manas]] as well as "awareness moving away from the ground".&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanence and Distinction===
[[File:Dzong.jpg|thumb|The [[Garuda]] is used as a symbol of primordial nature, which is already completely perfect, since this mythological animal is said to be born fully grown.&lt;ref&gt;Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, page 109.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to Sam van Schaik, there is a certain tension in Dzogchen thought (as in other forms of Buddhism) between the idea that [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]] are immanent within each other and yet are still different. In texts such as the [[Longchen Nyingtig]] for example, the basis and rigpa are presented as being "intrinsically innate to the individual mind".&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Great Perfection Tantra of the Expanse of Samantabhadra’s Wisdom'' states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you think that he who is called “the heart essence of all buddhas, the Primordial Lord, the noble Victorious One, Samantabhadra” is contained in a mindstream separate from the ocean-like realm of sentient beings, then this is a nihilistic view in which samsara and nirvana remain unconnected.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, [[Longchenpa]] (12th century), writes in his ''Illuminating Sunlight'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every type of experiential content belonging to samsara and nirvana has, as its very basis, a natural state that is a spontaneously present buddha—a dimension of purity and perfection, that is perfect by nature. This natural state is not created by a profound buddha nor by a clever sentient being. Independent of causality, causes did not produce it and conditions can not make it perish. This state is one of self-existing wakefulness, defying all that words can describe, in a way that also transcends the reach of the intellect and thoughts. It is within the nonarising vastness of such a basic natural state that all phenomena belonging to samsara and nirvana are, essentially and without any exception, a state of buddha—purity and perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Pema Kunsang; Wellsprings of the Great Perfection The Lives and Insights of the Early Masters, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This lack of difference between these two states, their [[non-dual]] (''advaya'') nature, corresponds with the idea that change from one to another doesn't happen due to an ordinary process of causation but is an instantaneous and perfect 'self-recognition' (''rang ngo sprod'') of what is already innately (''lhan-skyes'') there.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; According to John W. Pettit, this idea has its roots in Indian texts such as [[Nagarjuna]]'s [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]], which states that samsara and nirvana are not separate and that there is no difference between the "doer", the "going" and the "going to" (i.e. the ground, path and fruit).&lt;ref&gt;Pettit, John W.; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 78&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of this emphasis on immanence, Dzogchen texts do indicate a subtle difference between terms associated with delusion (''kun gzhi'' or ''alaya'', ''sems'' or mind) and terms associated with full enlightenment (''dharmakaya'' and ''rigpa'').&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The Alaya and [[Ālayavijñāna]] are associated with karmic imprints (''vasana'') of the mind and with mental afflictions (''klesa''). The "alaya for habits" is the basis (''gzhi'') along with ignorance (''marigpa'') which includes all sorts of obscuring habits and grasping tendencies.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;

These terms stem from Indian [[Yogacara]] texts, such as the [[Ratnagotravibhāga]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harmonisation with Madhyamaka===
Koppl notes that although later Nyingma authors such as [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] attempted to harmonize the view of Dzogchen with [[Madhyamaka]], the earlier Nyingma author [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo]] did not.{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}{{refn|group=quote|Heidi Koppl: "Unlike Mipham, Rongzom did not attempt to harmonize the view of Mantra or Dzogchen with Madhyamaka."{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}}} Rongzom held that the views of sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of tantra.{{sfn|Koppl|2008|p=ch4}}{{refn|group=quote|Heidi Koppl: "By now we have seen that Rongzom regards the views of the Sutrayana as inferior to those of Mantra, and he underscores his commitment to the purity of all phenomena by criticizing the Madhyamaka objectification of the authentic relative truth."{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}}} In contrast, the 14th Dalai Lama, in his book Dzogchen, &lt;ref&gt;the Dalai Lama, Dzogchen p. 158 (Snow Lion 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that Madhyamaka and Dzogchen come down to the same point. The view of reality obtained through Madhyamaka philosophy and the Dzogchen view of Rigpa can be regarded  as identical. With regard to the practice in these traditions, however, at the initial stages there do seem certain differences in practice and emphasis.

==Teachings and practice==
Dzogchen is a secret teaching emphasizing the rigpa view. It is a secret from those who are incapable of receiving it. The student can properly receive it with direct in-person realization under a guru's instruction. It is accessible to all; however, it is generally considered an advanced practice because safety from generating an incorrect view necessitates preliminary practices with a teacher's empowerment. {{sfn|Ingram|1993|}}

Dzogchen teachings emphasize naturalness, spontaneity and simplicity.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} Although Dzogchen is portrayed as being distinct from tantra, it has incorporated many concepts and practices from tantric Buddhism.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} It embraces a widely varied array of traditions, that range from a systematic rejection of all tantric practices, to a full incorporation of tantric practices.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}}

===Three principles===
The [[Vima Nyingtik|"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra"]] epitomized the Dzogchen teaching in three principles, known as the Three Statements of Garab Dorje (Tsik Sum Né Dek). They give in short the development a student has to undergo:
#Direct introduction to one's own nature (Tib. ''ngo rang thog tu sprod pa''), namely ''rigpa'';
#Not remaining in doubt concerning this unique state (Tib. ''thag gcig thog tu bcad pa'');
#Continuing to remain in this state (Tib. ''gdeng grol thog tu bca' pa'').

In subsequent centuries these teachings were expanded, most notably in the [[Longchen Nyingthig]] by [[Jigme Lingpa]] (1730-1798).{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} His systematisation is the most widely used Dzogchen-teaching nowadays.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}

===Structure of practice===


====Anthology of practices====
The dzogchen teachings consist of vast anthologies of practices presented as preliminary and auxiliary contemplative techniques, including standard Buddhist meditation techniques and tantra practices which have been integrated into Dzogchen.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547, 2548}}

Longchenpa, in "Finding Comfort and Ease in Meditation" (''bsam gtan ngal gso''), the second text of the [[Trilogy of Natural Ease]] (''ngal gso skor gsum''),{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=254}} and its auto-commentary the ''Shing rta rnam dag'',{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}} uses the standard triad of meditative experiences (''nyams'') to structure the text and the practices: bliss (''bde ba''), radiance/clarity (''gsal ba''), and non-conceptuality (''mi rtog pa'').{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=254}} This triad is also presented as preliminaries, main practice, and concluding phase.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}} The preliminaries are further divided into:
* the general preliminaries on impermanence and renunciation of cyclic existence, which corresponds to the [[Therevada]]; 
* the special preliminaries on compassion and the engendering of compassionate motivation, which corresponds with the [[Mahayana]]; 
* the supreme preliminaries, consisting of the generation phase, perfection phase and Guru yoga.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}}

This systematisation contextualized the system in terms of Tibetan Buddhism, while simultaneously relegating these preliminaries to a lower status, while emphasizing their necessity.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}} Longchenpa couples meditation with Guru yoga in these preliminaries.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}}

The teachings based on the ''Longchen Nyingthig'' are divided into preliminary practices and main practices.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|1994}} Alexander Berzin explicitly mentions meditative practices as a preliminary of the main practice.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets"&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/dzogchen-advanced/the-major-facets-of-dzogchen Alexander Berzin, ''The Major Facets of Dzogchen'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|2001}}{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=81}}{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2011}}

====General overview====
A general overview gives the following:
* Preliminary practices:
** Initial empowerment: according to Tsoknyi Rinpoche, Dzogchen practice starts with receiving empowerment;{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=4}} 
** ''[[Ngondro]]'', general or outer, and special or inner preliminary practices, which prepare one for the main practice;
* Great Perfection practice:
** Further empowerment:  receiving an empowerment (''dbang'', initiation) and keeping the vows conferred at that time. This activates our Buddha-mind, by consciously generating a state of mind that is accompanied by understanding;
** Supreme preliminary practices: Jigme Lingpa's ''ru shan'' and ''sbyong ba''; practice of the three samadhis;{{refn|group=note|According to Berzin, this is the equivalent of the generation stage, as emphasized in Mahayoga.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;}}
** Main practice, which consists of:&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Ron Garry: "The practice is that of Cutting through Solidity (khregs chod), which is related to primordial purity (ka dag); and Direct Vision of Reality (thod rgal), which is related to spontaneous presence (Ihun grub)."{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|2005|p=296}}}}
*** ''Trekchö'', "break through",&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt; recognising ''rigpa'';
*** ''Tögal'' (''thod rgal''), "leap ahead",&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt; spontaneous presence"{{sfn|Rinpoche Dzogchen Ponlop|2003}}{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004}} which is the stabilisation of ''rigpa'' and compassionate action.
** Concluding phase

===Preliminary practices===
The ''[[Ngondro]]'', preliminary practices, consist of outer preliminaries and inner preliminaries.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;

====Initial empowerment====
According to Tsoknyi Rinpoche, before one starts with the Dzogchen-practices [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] is necessary. This plants the "seeds of realization" within the present body, speech and mind.{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=4}} Empowerment "invests us with the ability to be liberated into the already present ground."{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=5}} The practices bring the seeds to maturation, resulting in the qualities of enlightened body, speech and mind.{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=6}}

====General or outer preliminaries====
The outer preliminaries are as follows:&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;
* appreciating our precious human rebirths; 
* contemplating death and impermanence; 
* contemplating the faults of samsara; 
* contemplating karmic cause and effect and the possibility of gaining liberation from it; 
* contemplating the benefits of liberation; 
* building and maintaining a good relation with a spiritual teacher;

====Special or inner preliminaries====
The inner preliminaries are as follows:&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt; 
* taking refuge; 
* cultivating [[bodhichitta]] and the "far-reaching attitudes" (Tib. ''phar-byin'', Skt. ''[[paramita]]''); 
* practicing [[Vajrasattva]] recitation, for purification of the gross obstacles; 
* practicing [[mandala]] offerings, in which we develop generosity and strengthen our enlightenment-building network of positive force; 
* making  ''kusali'' offerings of ''[[chöd]]'', in which we imagine cutting up and giving away our ordinary bodies; 
* practicing [[Guru Yoga]], in which we recognize and focus on [[Buddha-nature]] in our spiritual mentors and in ourselves;

===Great perfection practices===

====Empowerment====
According to Berzin, receiving [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] (''dbang'', initiation) and keeping the vows conferred at that time is a necessary step to move on to the main practice. This activates our Buddha-mind, by consciously generating a state of mind that is accompanied by understanding. Alexander Berzin further notes:&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;
* "In Gelug, the conscious experience is some level of blissful awareness of voidness."
* "In the non-Gelug systems, it is focus on Buddha-nature in our tantric masters and in us, with some level of understanding of Buddha-nature."
* "In dzogchen, it is focus specifically on the basis three aspects of rigpa as Buddha-nature factors in our tantric masters and in us."

====Supreme preliminary practices====
With the influence of tantra, and the systematisations of Longchenpa, the main Dzogchen practices came to be preceded by preliminary (meditative) practices.{{sfn|Germano|1994}}

In the text "Finding Comfort and Ease in the Nature of Mind" (''sems nyid ngal gso''), which is part of the [[Trilogy of Natural Ease]] (''ngal gso skor gsum''), Longchenpa arranges 141 contemplative practices, split into three sections: exoteric Buddhism (92), tantra (92), and the Great Perfection (27).{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=251}} Most of these practices are "technique-free."{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=254}} The typical Buddhist meditations are relegated to the preliminary phase, while the main meditative practices are typical "direct" approaches.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=262}}

Longchenpa includes the perfection phase techniques of channels, winds and nuclei into the main and concluding phases.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=256}} The "concluding phase" includes discussions of new contemplative techniques, which aid the practice of the main phase.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=257}}

The Great Perfection practices as described by Jigme Lingpa consist of preliminary practices, specific for the Great Perfection practice, and the main practice.{{sfn|Schaik|2004b|p=98}}

=====Jigme Lingpa – ''ru shan'' and ''sbyong ba''=====
[[Image:Nyingma Jigme Lingpa.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jigme Lingpa]]]] 
Jigme Lingpa mentions two kinds of preliminary practices, '''khor 'das ru shan dbye ba'',{{refn|group=note|Korday Rushen; {{bo|t=འཁོར་འདས་རུ་ཤན|w='khor 'das ru shan}}}} "making a gap between samsara and nirvana,"{{sfn|Schaik|2004B|p=98}}{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=81}}  and ''sbyong ba''.{{sfn|Schaik|2004B|p=98}}

''Ru shan'' is a series of visualisation and recitation exercises,{{sfn|Schaik|2004B|p=98}} derived from the Seminal Heart tradition.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=262}} The name reflects the dualism of the distinctions between mind and insight, [[Eight Consciousnesses|ālaya]] and [[dharmakāya]].{{sfn|Schaik|2004B|p=98}} Longchenpa places this practice in the "enhancement" (''bogs dbyung'') section of his concluding phase. It describes a practice "involving going to a solitary spot and acting out whatever comes to your mind."{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=262}}{{refn|group=note|See {{Citation | last =Germano | first =David | chapter =The Elements, Insanity, and Lettered Subjectivity | editor-last =Lopez, Jr. | editor-first =Donald | year =1997| title =The Religions of Tibet in Practice | publisher =Princeton University Press}}.}}{{refn|group=quote|John Pettit , in ''Tricycle Magazine'', winter 1997: "David Germano [...] describes unusual practices of the Great Perfection [...] Germano introduces the "differentiation of Samsara and Nirvana," a form of meditative warm-up exercise that has not, to my knowledge, ever been discussed so explicitly. This practice is unusual by any standard, Tibetan or Western, except perhaps for those who have experimented with [[Stanislav Grof]]'s Holotropic Breathwork or Primal Scream Therapy. (See also [[Ego death]]). In the exercise, a practitioner jumps, prowls, and howls like a wolf and imitates its thought patterns, or pretends to be a mass murderer and then suddenly switches to the outlook of a self-sacrificing saint. "In short," Germano writes, "one lets oneself go crazy physically, verbally and mentally in a flood of diverse activity, so that by this total surrender to the play of images and desire across the mirroring surface of one's being, one gradually comes to understand the very nature of the mirror itself."&lt;ref group=web name="TM"&gt;[http://www.tricycle.com/reviews/the-religions-tibet-practice John Pettit, ''Review of "The Religions of Tibet in Practice"'', TriCycle Magazine, Winter 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Sbyong ba'' is a variety of teachings for training (''sbyong ba'') the body, speech and mind. The training of the body entails instructions for physical posture. The training of speech mainly entails recitation, especially of the syllable ''[[Om mani padme hum|hūm]]''. The training of the mind is a Madhyamaka-like analysis of the concept of the mind, to make clear that mind cannot arise from anywhere, reside anywhere,or go anywhere. They are in effect an establishment of [[Sunyata|emptiness]] by means of the intellect.{{sfn|Schaik|2004B|p=98-99}}

=====Meditative practices=====
According to Alexander Berzin, after the preliminary practices follow meditative practices, in which the practitioners works with the three aspects of rigpa.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Berzin also uses the term "Mahayoga Stage" for this stage.&lt;ref group=web name="Berzin-Major Facets" /&gt;}}

The three samadhis (ting-nge-’dzin gsum) are practiced, in which the practitioners works, in the imagination, with the three aspects of rigpa:
# "Basis samadhi" on the authentic nature (''gzhi de-bzhin-nyid-kyi ting-nge-’dzin'', ''de-ting''): the meditator is absorbed in an approximation of rigpa’s primal purity. It is a state of open receptiveness (''klong''), which is the basis for being able to help others as a Buddha;
# "Path samadhi illuminating everywhere" (''lam kun-snang-ba’i ting-nge-’dzin'', ''snang-ting''): being moved by compassion, the meditator is absorbed in an approximation of rigpa’s responsiveness;
# "Resultant samadhi on the cause" (''‘bras-bu-rgyu’i-ting-nge-’dzin'', ''rgyu-ting''): the meditator is absorbed in the visualization of a seed-syllable, which brings the result of actually helping limited beings.

=====''Semdzin''=====
[[File:Dzogchen A.png|thumb|right|White Tibetan letter Ah]]
The Dzogchen meditation practices also include a series of exercises known as ''Semdzin'' (''sems dzin''),{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=81}} which literally means "to hold the mind" or "to fix mind."{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=81}} They include a whole range of methods, including fixation, breathing, and different body postures, all aiming to bring one into the state of contemplation.{{sfn|Norbu|2000|p=130}}{{refn|group=note|Longchenpa divides them into three categories of seven exercises.{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=81}} Exercises in the first category include
{{quote|"[F]ixating on a white Tibetan letter A on the tip of one's nose. Linking the letter with one's breathing, it goes out into space with each exhalation and returns to the tip of the nose with each inhalation. This fixation inhibits the arising of extraneous thoughts [...] however, the second exercise in the same category involves the sounding of the syllable PHAT! which instantly shatters one's thoughts and attachments. Symbolically, the two parts of the syllable indicate the two aspects of enlightenment, that is, PHA signifies Means (''thabs'') and TA signifies Wisdom (''shes rab'')."{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=81}}}}

According to Reynolds, it is this specific ''Semdzin'' practice which was used by Patrul Rinpoche to provide a direct introduction to the knowledge of ''rigpa''. It temporarily blocks the flow of thought, and brings us temporarily in a state of emptiness and clarity.{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=82}}}}

====Main practice====

=====Trekchö=====
The practice of Trekchö (''khregs chod''), "cutting through solidity",{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|2005|p=296}} reflects the earliest developments of Dzogchen, with its admonition against practice.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{refn|group=note|Compare [[Karma Chagme]], who associates Trekchö with [[Semde]].{{sfn|Karma Chagme|Gyatrul Rinpoche|Wallace|1998|p=180}} He further equates Trekchö with [[Mahāmudrā]],{{sfn|Karma Chagme|Gyatrul Rinpoche|Wallace|1998|p=180}}}} In this practice one first identifies, and then sustains recognition of, one's own innately pure, empty awareness.{{sfn|Dahl|2009|p=255}}{{sfn|Mackenzie Stewart|2014}}{{refn|group=quote|See also:
* The main trekchö instructions in the [[Lamrim Yeshe Nyingpo]]: "This instant freshness, unspoiled by the thoughts of the three times; You directly see in actuality by letting be in naturalness."{{sfn|Schmidt|2001|p=77}}
* [[Tsoknyi Rinpoche|Drubwang Tsoknyi Rinpoche]]: "''Trekchö'' is the thorough cut of cutting through, cutting the obscurations completely to pieces, like slashing through them with a knife. So the past thought has ceased, the future thought hasn't yet arisen, and the knife is cutting through this stream of present thought. But one doesn't keep hold of this knife either; one lets the knife go, so there is a gap.  When you cut through again and again in this way, the string of thought falls to pieces. If you cut a rosary in a few places, at some point it doesn't work any longer.{{sfn|Schmidt|2002|p=38}}
* Namkhai Norbu: "Once one has arrived at contemplation through any method, one has to continue in it, and working to bring this continuation into every action and situation is called ''Tregchöd'', which literally means "(spontaneous cutting of tension," in thes ense that as soon as the primordial state manifests and dualism is thus overcome, on einstantly falls into a state of total relaxation, like a bundle of sticks, that, having been bound together, falls loosely into a total relaxed pattern as soon as the string binding it has been cut."{{sfn|Norbu|2000|p=130}}}} Students receive [[pointing-out instruction]] (''sems khrid'', ''ngos sprod'') in which a teacher introduces the student to the nature of his or her mind.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} According to Tsoknyi Rinpoche, these instructions are received after the preliminary practices, though there's also a tradition to give them before the preliminary practices.{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=7}}{{refn|group=quote|Tsoknyi Rinpoche: "As for my own personal experience, when I underwent the ngondro training, I had already received some Dzogchen instructions. The awakened state of rigpa had been pointed out, and I had a lukewarm certainty about what it was. But the ngondro helped me progress.{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=7}}"}}{{refn|group=quote|Some examples of ''Trekchö'':
* John Myrdhin Reynolds: "[T]he proper procedure is to introduce the practitioner directly to the state of contemplation by way of first dissolving one's mental activities (''sems kyi yal-ba ngo-sprod-pa''). If one observes the mind and searches for where a thought (''rnam-rtog'') arises, where it remains, and where it goes, no matter how much one researches and investigates this, one will find nothing. It is this very "unfindability" (''mi rnyed'') of the arising, the abiding, and the passing away of thoughts which is the greatest of all finds. Thoughts do not arise from anywhere (''byung sa med''), they do not remain anywhere (''gnas sa med''), and they do not go anywhere ('''gro sa med''). They do not arise from within the body, nor do they arise from outside the body. They are truly without any root or source (''ghzi med rsta bral''). Like the clouds in the sky, they arise only to dissolve again. Thoughts arise out of the state of emptiness and return again into this state of emptiness, which represents pure potentiality. We only have to observe our mind to discover this for ourselves. And this shunyata, this state of emptiness, is in fact the very essence of the mind (''sems kyi ngo-bo stong-pa nyid'').{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=75}}
* [[Sogyal Rinpoche]]: "Nyoshul Lungtok, who later became one of the greatest Dzogchen masters of recent times, followed his teacher Patrul Rinpoche for about eighteen years. During all that time, they were almost inseparable. Nyoshul Lungtok studied and practiced extremely diligently, and accumulated a wealth of purification, merit, and practice; he was ready to recognize the Rigpa, but had not yet had the final introduction. Then, one famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery. It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: "Did you say you do not know the essence of Mind?" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.&lt;br&gt;"There's nothing to it really," Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, "My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father." Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side. Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, "Do you see the stars up there in the sky?"&lt;br&gt;"Yes."&lt;br&gt;"Do you hear the dogs barking in Dzogchen Monastery?"&lt;br&gt;"Yes."&lt;br&gt;"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?"&lt;br&gt;"Yes."&lt;br&gt;"Well, the nature of Dzogchen is this: simply this."&lt;br&gt;Nyoshul Lungtok tells us what happened then: "At that instant, I arrived at a certainty of realization from within. I had been liberated from the fetters of 'it is' and 'it is not.' I had realized the primordial wisdom, the naked union of emptiness and intrinsic awareness. I was introduced to this realization by his blessing, as the great Indian master Saraha said: He in whose heart the words of the master have entered, Sees the truth like a treasure in his own palm."{{sfn|Sogyal Rinpoche|1994|p=160}}}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ramana Maharshi#Death experience (1896)|Ramana Maharshi's awakening]], [[Kensho#Spontaneous kenshō|spontaneous kenshō]], and [[Subitism|sudden insight]]}}

Jigme Lingpa divides the trekchö practice into ordinary and extraordinary instructions.{{sfn|Schaik|2004b|p=99}} The ordinary section comprises the rejection of the ''all is mind – mind is empty'' approach, which is a conceptual establishment of emptiness.{{sfn|Schaik|2004b|p=99}} Jigme Lingpa's extraordinary instructions give the instructions on the breakthrough proper, which consist of the setting out of the view (''lta ba''), the doubts and errors that may occur in practice, and some general instructions thematized as "the four ways of being at leisure" (''cog bzhag'').{{sfn|Schaik|2004b|p=99}} The "setting out of the view" tries to point the reader toward a direct recognition of rigpa, insisting upon the immanence of rigpa, and dismissive of meditation and effort.).{{sfn|Schaik|2004b|p=99-100}} Insight leads to ''nyamshag'', "being present in the state of clarity and emptiness".{{sfn|Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|2001|p=87}}

=====Tögal=====
''Tögal'' (''thod rgal'') means "spontaneous presence",{{sfn|Rinpoche Dzogchen Ponlop|2003}}{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004}} "direct crossing",{{sfn|Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche|1994|p=44}} "direct crossing of spontaneous presence",{{sfn|Schmidt|2002}} or "direct transcendence.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} The literal meaning is "to proceed directly to the goal without having to go through intermediate steps."{{sfn|Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche|1994|p=224}}

''Tögal'' is also called "the practice of vision",&lt;ref group=web name="OTZZ"&gt;[http://www.wisdom-books.com/ProductExtract.asp?PID=14663 Extract from ''Oral Tradition from Zhang Zhung. An Introduction to the Bonpo Dzogchen Teachings of the Oral Tradition from Zhang Zhung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181933/http://www.wisdom-books.com/ProductExtract.asp?PID=14663 |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the practice of the Clear Light (''[[Ösel (yoga)|od-gsal]]'')".&lt;ref group=web name="OTZZ" /&gt; It entails progressing through the [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Four_visions Four Visions].{{sfn|Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche|1994|p=38}} The practices engage the subtle body of psychic channels, winds and drops (''rtsa rlung thig le'').{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} The practices aim at generating a spontaneous flow of luminous, rainbow-colored images that gradually expand in extent and complexity.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}

''Tögal'' is an innovative practice,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} and reflects the innovations of the  Manngede cycles in Dzogchen, and the incorporation of complex tantric techniques and doctrines.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} They are an adaptation of Tantric "perfection phase" techniques (''rdzogs rim''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} as outlined in the early-eleventh-century Indian Tantric ''[[Kalachakra]]'' cycle, "The Wheel of Time",{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} which was probably  a direct inspiration for the Seminal Heart.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}

====Rainbow body====
Lhun grub practice may lead to full enlightenment and the self-liberation of the human body into a [[rainbow body]]{{refn|group=note|Wylie: 'ja' lus, pronounced Jalü}} at the moment of death,{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=204}} when all the fixation and grasping has been exhausted.{{sfn|Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche|1994|p=233}} It is a nonmaterial body of light with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one's compassion.{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|2005|p=296}}{{sfn|Matthieu|2001|p=153}}{{sfn|Ray|2001|p=323}} It is a manifestation of the [[Sambhogakāya]].{{sfn|Matthieu|2001|p=153}}

Some exceptional practitioners such as [[Padmasambhava]] and [[Vimalamitra]] are held to have realized a higher type of rainbow body without dying. Having completed the four visions before death, the individual focuses on the lights that surround the fingers. His or her physical body self-liberates into a nonmaterial body of light (a [[Sambhogakāya]]) with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one's compassion.{{sfn|Matthieu|2001|p=153}}

His parents fought and eventually separated, and he felt alienated from a hostile school environment.&lt;ref name=int/&gt; He also experienced considerable fear and anxiety growing up in post-war Germany, where he would play in bombed-out buildings. He later stated that pain "was in the energy field of the country".&lt;ref name="VanSun"&gt;Douglas Todd (2002-10-05).

At the age of 15, he read several books written by the German [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[Joseph Anton Schneiderfranken]], also known as Bô Yin Râ. Tolle has said he responded "very deeply" to those books.&lt;ref name=int&gt;[http://www.inner-growth.info/power_of_now_tolle/eckhart_tolle_home.htm ''Dialogues With Emerging Spiritual Teachers'', by John W.

Retrieved on 2010-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Troubled by "depression, anxiety and fear", he began "searching for answers" in his life.&lt;ref name=int/&gt;

In his early twenties, he decided to pursue his search by studying philosophy, psychology, and literature, and enrolled in the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name=int/&gt; After graduating,&lt;ref name=int/&gt; he was offered a scholarship to do postgraduate research at [[Cambridge University]], which he entered in 1977 but dropped out soon after.&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Indy /&gt;

==Inner transformation==
One night in 1977, at the age of 29, after having suffered from long periods of [[depression (mood)|depression]], Tolle says he experienced an "inner transformation".&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; That night he awakened from his sleep, suffering from feelings of depression that were "almost unbearable," but then experienced a life-changing [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]].&lt;ref name=int/&gt;  Recounting the experience, he says, {{quote|I couldn’t live with myself any longer. And in this a question arose without an answer: who is the ‘I’ that cannot live with the self? What is the self? I felt drawn into a void! I didn’t know at the time that what really happened was the mind-made self, with its heaviness, its problems, that lives between the unsatisfying past and the fearful future, collapsed. It dissolved. The next morning I woke up and everything was so peaceful. The peace was there because there was no self. Just a sense of presence or "[[being]]ness," just observing and watching.&lt;ref name="TeleMag" /&gt;}}

Tolle recalls going out for a walk in London the next morning, and finding that "everything was miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic."&lt;ref name=int/&gt; The feeling continued, and he began to feel a strong underlying sense of peace in any situation.&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt; He stopped studying for his doctorate, and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting, "in a state of deep bliss," on park benches in [[Russell Square]], Central London, "watching the world go by." He stayed with friends, in a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monastery]], or otherwise [[homelessness|slept rough]] on [[Hampstead Heath]]. His family thought him "irresponsible, even insane."&lt;ref name="TeleMag"/&gt;  He changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart; by some reports this was in [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the German philosopher and mystic, [[Meister Eckhart]].&lt;ref name=Indy/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAtoday&gt;Cathy Lynn Grossman (2010-15-04).

Tolle writes in the introduction to his second book, ''Stillness Speaks'': &lt;blockquote&gt;A true spiritual teacher does not have anything to teach in the conventional sense of the word, does not have anything to give or add to you, such as new information, beliefs, or rules of conduct. The only function of such a teacher is to help you remove that which separates you from the truth ... The words are no more than signposts.&lt;ref name=StillnessSpeaks&gt;{{cite book |title=Stillness Speaks  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcfueLfqxR8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Eckhart%20Tolle&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Tolle |first=Eckhart |year=2003 |publisher=New World Library |isbn=978-1-57731-400-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He says that his book, ''The Power of Now'', is "a restatement for our time of that one timeless spiritual teaching, the essence of all religions".&lt;ref name=PoN6&gt;Tolle, ''[[The Power of Now]]'' (2005 edition), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that religions "have become so overlaid with extraneous matter that their spiritual substance has become almost completely obscured",&lt;ref name=PoN6/&gt; that they have become "to a large extent ... divisive rather than unifying forces" and become "themselves part of the insanity".&lt;ref&gt;Tolle, ''[[A New Earth]]'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolle writes that "the most significant thing that can happen to a human being [is] the separation process of thinking and awareness" and that awareness is "the space in which thoughts exist".&lt;ref&gt;Tolle, ''[[A New Earth]]'', p. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt;  Tolle says that "the primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it".&lt;ref&gt;Tolle, ''A New Earth'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his official website, "at the core of Tolle's teachings lies the transformation of consciousness, a spiritual awakening that he sees as the next step in human evolution. An essential aspect of this awakening consists in transcending our ego-based state of consciousness. This is a prerequisite not only for personal happiness but also for the ending of violent conflict endemic on our planet".&lt;ref name=bioOW/&gt;

In his book ''A New Earth'', he describes a major aspect of the human dysfunction as "ego" or an "illusory sense of self"&lt;ref&gt;Tolle, ''A New Earth'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; based on unconscious identification with one's memories and thoughts,&lt;ref&gt;Tolle, ''[[A New Earth]]'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; and another major aspect he calls "pain-body"&lt;ref name="NY"/&gt; or "an accumulation of old emotional pain".&lt;ref&gt;Tolle, ''A New Earth'', p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/09/pressandpublishing Penguin borne aloft by the power of Oprah's persuasion]. ''[[The Observer]]''. Retrieved on 2010-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, others praise his re-working and synthesis of traditions. New Age writer [[William Bloom]] wrote that "Tolle is offering a very contemporary synthesis of Eastern spiritual teaching, which is normally so clothed in arcane language that it is incomprehensible", thereby providing "a valuable perspective on Western culture".&lt;ref name=Indy /&gt; Publisher Judith Kendra says, "The ideas [that Tolle is] talking about have been in existence for thousands of years in both Eastern texts and with the great Western mystics, but he's able to make them understandable".&lt;ref name=Indy /&gt;  Musician [[Annie Lennox]] said he "has some kind of special quality that I've never encountered before".&lt;ref name=Indy /&gt;

====Reception by Christian theologians====
Christian scholars have differing opinions on the compatibility of Tolle's ideas with Christianity.

James Beverley, professor of Christian Thought and Ethics at the evangelical [[Tyndale University College and Seminary|Tyndale Seminary in Toronto]], says that Tolle's worldview "is at odds with central Christian convictions" and that "Tolle denies the core of Christianity by claiming there is no ultimate distinction between humans and God and Jesus".&lt;ref name="Macleans" /&gt; [[John G. Stackhouse, Jr.|John Stackhouse]], a professor of theology and culture at evangelical [[Regent College]] in Vancouver, says that he "gives a certain segment of the population exactly what they want: a sort of supreme religion that purports to draw from all sorts of lesser, that is, established religions".&lt;ref name="Macleans" /&gt; Stackhouse has described him as one of several spiritual teachers who "purport to have investigated the world’s religions (quite a claim) and found them wanting, who routinely subject those religions to withering criticism, and who then champion their own views as superior to all these alternatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.johnstackhouse.com/2009/10/22/eckhart-tolle-the-mask-of-stresslessness-hiding-a-deep-bitter-anger/ | title=Eckhart Tolle: Does the Mask of "Stresslessness" Hide a Deep, Bitter Anger? | accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Stafford Betty, teacher for Religious Studies at [[California State University, Bakersfield]] finds common ground between Tolle's worldview and that of Christian mystics. He notes that "one of the key elements in Tolle's teaching is that deep within the mind is absolute stillness in which one can experience 'the joy of Being'".&lt;ref name="NatCath"&gt;Stafford Betty (2008-04-18), [http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2008b/041808/041808t.htm "Eckhart Tolle's message is positive, but is it Christian?]".  ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'', 44.17, p. 22(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic priest and theologian [[Richard Rohr]] credits Tolle for helping to reintroduce ancient Christian mysticism to modern Christians: "Tolle is, in fact, rather brilliantly bringing to our awareness the older tradition ... [which is] both the ground and the process for breaking through to the theological contemplation of God, and acquired contemplation of Jesus, the Gospels, and all spiritual things."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rohr|Rohr, Richard]]. [https://www.eckharttolle.com/article/Spirituality-And-The-Christian-Tradition "Eckhart Tolle and the Christian Tradition"]. ''EckhartTolle.com''. Retrieved November 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 ''[[The Independent]]'' noted that "Tolle's theories are certainly seen by many as profoundly non-Christian, even though Tolle often quotes from the Bible," but that "Tolle does have fans in academic, even Christian, circles".&lt;ref name="Indy" /&gt; It cited Andrew Ryder, a theologian at [[All Hallows College]] in Dublin, who wrote, "While he may not use the language of traditional Christian spirituality, Tolle is very much concerned that, as we make our way through the ordinary events of the day, we keep in touch with the deepest source of our being."&lt;ref name="Indy" /&gt;

'''Henri Atlan''' (born 27 December 1931 in [[Blida]], [[French Algeria]]) is a [[French people|French]] biophysicist and philosopher.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Jewish family in French Algeria, Atlan gained degrees in [[medicine]] and [[biophysics]] at the [[University of Paris]] (now [[University Paris Diderot]]). He married [[Liliane Atlan]] in 1952; they had two children while living in Paris, Miri in 1953 and Michael in 1956.&lt;ref name="JWA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schneider |first1=Judith Morganroth |title=Liliane Atlan |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Atlan-Liliane |website=Jewish Women's Archive |accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] working on ageing and mutation.

==Career and thought==
Influenced by [[Heinz von Foerster]], Atlan became interested in applying [[cybernetics]] and [[information theory]] to living organisms, and went to the [[Weizmann Institute]] in [[Rehovot]] to work under the biophysicist [[Aharon Katchalsky]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In 1972, he returned to Paris; and, in that year, his 1972 work on information theory and [[Self-organization in cybernetics|self-organising systems]], entitled ''L'organisation biologique et la théorie de l'information'', received a wide readership.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In this book, he proposed the principle of "[[complexity]] from [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]]"&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Henri+Atlan%22%22complexity+from+noise%22 occurrences] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=François |editor-first=Charles |editor-link=Charles François (systems scientist) |title=[[International Encyclopedia of Systems and Cybernetics]] |year=2011 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SZxnQgAACAAJ 1997] |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |location=[[Berlin]] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=XCn2mn98uEAC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=%22complexity+from+noise+principle%22+Atlan+1972 107] |isbn=3-1109-6801-0 |id={{ISBN|978-3-110-96801-9}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|le principe de complexité par le bruit}}),&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Henri+Atlan%22%22complexité+par+le+bruit%22 occurrences] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22complexité+par+le+bruit%22%22L'Organisation+biologique+et+la+théorie+de+l'information%22+1972].&lt;/ref&gt; concept taken up in his following book ''Entre le cristal et la fumée'' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22complexité+par+le+bruit%22%22Entre+le+cristal+et+la+fumée%22+1979].&lt;/ref&gt; and development of 1960 Von Foerster's notion of "order from noise". In Paris, he then taught biophysics at the [[Hôtel-Dieu de Paris|Hôtel-Dieu]] and, later, at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]'s [[Hadassah Medical Center]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

His participation with [[Francisco Varela]] at a conference in [[Cerisy-la-Salle]] encouraged interest in [[cognitive science]] in France.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Atlan was instrumental in the establishment of the [[Centre de Recherche en Epistémologie Appliquée]] (CREA) at the [[École Polytechnique]], and was appointed in 1983 to the [[Comité Consultatif National d'Ethique|Comité Consultatif National d'Éthique pour la Sciences de a Vie et de la Santé]] (National Advisory Committee on Ethics in the Life Sciences and Medicine). He has been appointed to a chair in the philosophy of biology at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

He is also a member of [[Collegium International]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} an organization of leaders with political, scientific, and ethical expertise whose goal is to provide new approaches in overcoming the obstacles in the way of a peaceful, socially just, and an economically sustainable world.

Nasr went to [[Firuz Bahram High School]] in Tehran&lt;ref&gt;جهانبگلو. رامین. ''در جستجوی امر قدسی (مصاحبه با دکتر نصر)''. نشر نی. 1385&lt;br&gt;Interview with Ramin Jahanbegloo in: ''Dar Jostejooye Amr e Qodsi''. {{ISBN|964-312-848-2}} p.229&lt;/ref&gt; before being sent to the United States for education at thirteen. In the US, Nasr first attended [[Peddie School]] in [[Hightstown, New Jersey]], graduating in 1950 as the [[valedictorian]] of his class and also winner of the Wyclifte Award.&lt;ref&gt;Sheikh, Nadia. [http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/02/20/News/Islamic.Scholar.Calls.Gw.Home-2730054.shtml "Islamic scholar calls GW home"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711135728/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/02/20/News/Islamic.Scholar.Calls.Gw.Home-2730054.shtml |date=2011-07-11 }}, ''[[The GW Hatchet]]'', February 20, 2007. Accessed February 5, 2011. "As a 12-year-old, Nasr came to the United States to study at the Peddie School, a New Jersey boarding school where he graduated in 1950 as valedictorian."&lt;/ref&gt;

A scholarship offered by [[MIT]] in [[physics]] made him the first Iranian undergraduate to attend that university.&lt;ref name="nasr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasr.org/bios.html |title=Biography / Dr. Seyyed Hossein Nasr |publisher=Nasr.org |date=1933-04-07 |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he also began studying under [[Giorgio de Santillana]] and others in various other branches such as [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophy]]. During his studies there he became acquainted with the works of the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] authority [[Frithjof Schuon]]. This school of thought has shaped Nasr's life and thinking ever since. Nasr had been a disciple of [[Frithjof Schuon]] for over fifty years and his works are based on the doctrine and the viewpoints of the [[perennial philosophy]].

Upon his graduation from [[MIT]], Nasr obtained a master's degree in [[geology]] and [[geophysics]] in 1956, and went on to pursue his Ph.D. degree in the history of science and learning at [[Harvard University]]. He planned to write his dissertation under the supervision of [[George Sarton]], but Sarton died before he could begin his dissertation work and so he wrote his dissertation under the direction of [[I. Bernard Cohen]], [[Hamilton Gibb]], and [[Harry Wolfson]].

At the age of twenty-five, Nasr graduated with his Ph.D. from Harvard and completed his first book, ''Science and Civilization in Islam'', the title being a direct tribute to ''[[Science and Civilization in China]]'', the work by [[Joseph Needham]] which had for task to present to Westerners the complex developments of the [[history of science and technology in China]], a mission Nasr was himself following for the [[Muslim world|Islamic civilization]], "although I was working single-handedly, a twenty-five-year-old scholar, and he had a whole group working with him at [[Cambridge university|Cambridge]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramin Jahanbegloo]], ''In Search of the Sacred : A Conversation with Seyyed Hossein Nasr on His Life and Thought'', [[ABC-CLIO]] (2010), p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral dissertation entitled "Conceptions of Nature in Islamic Thought" was published in 1964 by [[Harvard University Press]] as ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines''.

Apart from mastering [[Arabic language|Arabic]] he was initially taught in his childhood, during his student years, Nasr also learned different languages, namely [[French language|French]] (he could read [[René Guénon|Guénon]] and [[Frithjof Schuon|Schuon]] in the text), [[ancient Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[German language|German]] (mainly to work on [[Hegel]] for his PhD thesis).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramin Jahanbegloo]], ''In Search of the Sacred : A Conversation with Seyyed Hossein Nasr on His Life and Thought'', [[ABC-CLIO]] (2010), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back to Iran===
Nasr began his teaching career in 1955 when he was still a young doctoral student at [[Harvard University]]. He became a full professor by the age of 30.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}

After Harvard, Nasr returned to [[Iran]] as a professor at [[Tehran University]], and then at [[Sharif University|Arya Mehr University]] (Sharif University) where he was appointed president in 1972. Before that, he served as Dean of The Faculty of Letters, and Academic Vice-Chancellor of [[Tehran University]] from 1968 to 1972.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}

Nasr also learned [[Islamic philosophy]] from the philosophers [[Allameh Tabatabaei]], Sayyid Abul-Hasan Qazwini and Sayyid Muhammad Kazim Assar during that period leading up to the revolution.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}}

Nasr was appointed personal secretary to [[Farah Diba|Farah Pahlavi Empress of Iran]] as Head of the Empress's Private Bureau.&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;Knight, Michael M. ''William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an'', Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, p61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 she commissioned him to establish and lead the [[Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy]],&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt; the first academic institution to be conducted in accordance with the intellectual principles of the [[Traditionalist School]]. During that time, Nasr, [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei|Tabatabaei]], [[William Chittick]], Kenneth Morgan, [[Sachiko Murata]], [[Toshihiko Izutsu]], and [[Henry Corbin]] held various philosophical discourses. The book ''[[Shi'a Islam (Book)|Shi'a Islam]]'' was one product of this period.

===Return to the West===
[[File:Nasr.jpg|thumb|right|Nasr in 2002]]
Upon his return to the west, Nasr took up positions at [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Temple University]], and since 1984 has been at [[The George Washington University]] where he is now a full-time University Professor of Islamic Studies.

Nasr helped with the planning and expansion of Islamic and Iranian studies academic programs in several universities such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], the [[University of Utah]], and the [[University of Southern California]].

He was an advisor for the award-winning, PBS-broadcast documentary ''[[Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet]]'' (2002), produced by Unity Productions Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upf.tv/ |title=upf.tv |publisher=upf.tv |date= |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''human biocomputer''', coined by [[John C. Lilly]], refers to the "hardware" of the [[human anatomy]]. This would include the [[brain]], [[internal organs]], and other human organ systems such as [[cardiovascular]], [[digestion|digestive]], [[endocrine]], [[immune]], [[Integumentary system|integumentary]], [[lymphatic]], [[muscular]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], [[reproductive]], [[respiratory]], [[skeletal]], and [[urinary]] systems. The biocomputer has stored program properties, and self-metaprogramming properties, with limits determinable and to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parts ==
The functional organization of the human biocomputer is:&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

== General clarification ==
The levels of the human biocomputer are explained thus:
Levels from one to two are the boundaries between external reality and the body. Certain energies and materials (heat, light, sound, food, and secretions) pass through this boundary in special places. Levels two to three are the boundaries of body and brain, in which special structures such as blood vessels, nerve fibers, and cerebrospinal fluid pass. Levels four through eleven are in the brain circuitry, and is the software inside the biocomputer. Levels after ten are termed unknown. This is to allow an openeness for future scientific research, and discoveries. This is also to illustrate the unwillingness to subscribe to any dogmatic belief, to encourage creative, courageous and imaginative investigation, to emphasize the necessity for unknown factors on all levels, and to point out the [[heuristic]] nature of this schema.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
=== Mind ===
[[Mind]], which is defined as the sum total of all the programs and metaprograms (and even supraself metaprograms) of a human biocomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; This is the software and is looked at as the opposite of the hardware.
=== Brain ===
The brain is defined as the visible, palpable living set of structures to be included in the human biocomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stored programs ===
A stored program is defined as a set of instructions which are placed in memory storage of the biocomputer, and which control the biocomputer when orders are given for that program to be activated.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; These programs can be activated by the same biocomputer, another biocomputer, or a situation outside of the biocomputer.

=== Metaprogramming ===
Metaprogramming is defined as a set of instructions, descriptions, and implementations of related thoughts and actions(programs).&lt;ref name="potter"&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  Self metaprogramming involves the creation, revision, and reorganization of programs and metaprograms.&lt;ref name="potter"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5228">An '''indifferent act''' is any action that is neither good nor evil.

When acts are considered in general, with respect only to their object, there are acts that can be said to be neither good nor bad, but indifferent.  It is a topic of much dispute whether a specific act, performed by a specific person in particular circumstances, and for a certain end, can be indifferent, provided that it is not something done out of habit rather than deliberation.

==Catholic theologians on indifferent acts==
Can the character of indifference be predicated of the act, considered not as an abstraction of the mind, but in the concrete, as it is exercised by the individual in particular circumstances, and for a certain end?

To this question [[St. Bonaventure]],&lt;ref&gt;in 2, dist. 41, a. 1, q. 3 where, however, he speaks directly of merit only&lt;/ref&gt; answers in the affirmative, and with him [[Duns Scotus]],&lt;ref&gt;in 2, dist. 40-41, et quodl. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and all the [[Scotist]] school. So also [[Patritius Sporer]];&lt;ref&gt;Theol. Moral., 1, III, § v&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Elbel]];&lt;ref&gt;Theol. Moral., tom. I, n. 86&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabriel Vásquez|Vasquez]];&lt;ref&gt;in 1-2, disp. 52&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pablo José Arriaga|Arriaga]];&lt;ref&gt;De Act. Hum., disp. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Archbishop Walsh]].&lt;ref&gt;De Act. Hum., n. 588 sq.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;In 2, dist. 40., a. 5; De Malo, q. 2, a. 4 et 5; 1-2, q. 18, a. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and his commentators hold the opposite opinion. So too do [[Francisco Suárez]];&lt;ref&gt;De. Bon. Et Mal., disp. lx&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles René Billuart]];&lt;ref&gt;diss. IV, a. 5 et 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alphonsus Liguori]];&lt;ref&gt;L. 2, n. XLIV&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Bouquillon]];&lt;ref&gt;Theol. Moral. Fund., n. 371&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustine Lehmkuhl]];&lt;ref&gt;Theol. Moral., L. I, tract. I, III&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Noldin]].&lt;ref&gt;Sum. Theol. Moral., I, 85 sq.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thomists, no less than the Scotists, recognize as morally indifferent acts done without deliberation, such, for instance, as the stroking of one's beard or the rubbing of one's hands together, as these ordinarily take place. Admittedly indifferent, too, will those acts be in which there is but a physical deliberation, as it is called, such as is realized when, for instance, we deliberately read or write, without any thought of the moral order. The question here is of those acts only that are performed with advertence to a moral rule. Again, most of the Thomists will allow that an act would be indifferent in the case where an agent would judge it to be neither good nor bad after he had formed his conscience, according to the opinion of Scotists. Finally, no controversy is raised regarding the indifference of acts with reference to supernatural merit. The doctrine that all the works of [[infidel]]s are evil has been formally condemned. Yet clearly, while the deeds of those without grace may be morally good, and thus in the supernatural order escape all demerit, they cannot, at the same time, lay claim to any merit.

Both the Thomists and Scotists will declare that, to be morally good, an act must be in conformity with the exigencies and dignity of our rational nature. But the question is, what is to be reckoned as conformable to the exigencies and dignity of our rational nature? According to the Scotists, the deliberate act of a rational being, to be morally good, must be referred to a positively good end. Hence those acts in which the agent adverts to no end, and which have for their object nothing that is either conformable to our rational nature, nor yet contrary to it, such as eating, drinking, taking recreation, and the like, cannot be accounted morally good. Since, however, these discover no deviation from the moral norm, they cannot be characterized as evil, and so therefore, it is said, must be considered as indifferent.

According to the opinion of Thomas Aquinas, a common one among theologians, it is not necessary, in order to be morally good, that an act should be referred to a positively good end. It is enough that the end is seen to be not evil, and that in the performance of the act the bounds set by right reason be not transgressed. Thus the acts of eating, drinking, taking recreation, and the like, while, in the abstract, they are neither conformable nor contrary to our rational nature, in the concrete, by reason of the circumstance of their being done in the manner and the measure prescribed by reason, become fully in accord with our rational nature, and hence morally good. It will be observed from the foregoing that the Thomists hold as morally good the acts which the Scotists maintain to be only morally indifferent.

According to a third class of theologians, a deliberate act which is not referred to a positively good end must be reputed as morally evil. Hence that which we have described as good in the doctrine of Thomas Aquinas, and as indifferent to the mind of Duns Scotus, must according to these theologians, be deemed nothing else than bad. The advocates of this opinion are one with Aquinas only in declaring that there are no indifferent deliberate acts. They differ from him radically in their [[rigour]].

'''Jean Soldini''' (born 13 March 1956 in [[Lugano]]) is a Swiss and French philosopher, art historian and poet.

==Biography==

He studied in Paris, where he earned the [[Habilitation à diriger des recherches]] (1995), after he graduated with a Ph.D. in philosophy and with a preceding Ph.D. in history of architecture.

==Knowledge and hospitality==

His studies are aimed to build a non-authoritarian metaphysics where [[aesthetics]] of [[hospitality]] plays a primary role within knowledge, looking for the possibility of a resistance against the annihilation of the Other. A resistance against the arrogance of any kind of authoritarian thinking with its multiform camouflages, with its never-ending threat against what is existing-with-other. The aesthetics of hospitality does not be confused with an aestheticization of hospitality. It is a philosophy involved to reflect on sensation through what has its focus on the senses: to donate and receive food, water, a roof for sleeping.
Soldini is also author of essays on [[Alberto Giacometti]], on the philosophical margins of a creative work that put into effect the vital desire to know radically.

'''Jules Lequier''' (or '''Lequyer''',&lt;ref&gt;Lequyer's birth certificate had "Lequier" but in 1834 his father had the spelling legally fixed as "Lequyer."&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ləkɥije|lang}}; 30 January 1814 – 11 February 1862) was a French philosopher from [[Brittany]]. Lequier came to death, presumably as a suicide, by swimming out into the ocean.

==Philosophical work==
Lequier wrote in favour of dynamic divine [[omniscience]], wherein God's knowledge of the future is one of possibilities rather than actualities. Omniscience, under this view, is the knowledge of necessary facts as necessary, and contingent facts as contingent. Since the future does not yet exist as anything more than a realm of abstract possibilities, it is no impugning of divine omniscience to claim that God does not know the future as a fixed and unalterable state of affairs: that he does not know what is not there to be known. Lequier's approach guarantees both divine and human freedom, and suggests a partial resolution of the apparent inconsistency of human-wrought evil and the perfect goodness, power and knowledge of God.

{{Sufism|Ideas}}{{Sunni Islam}}
'''''Kashf''''' ({{lang-ar|كشف}}) "unveiling" is a [[Sufism|Sufi]] concept dealing with knowledge of the heart rather than of the intellect. Kashf describes the state of experiencing a personal divine revelation after ascending through spiritual struggles, and uncovering the heart (a spiritual faculty) in order to allow divine truths to pour into it. Kashf is etymologically related to ''mukashafa'' “disclosure”/ “divine irradiation of the essence”,&lt;ref name="Kashf"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gardet |first=L. |title=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition |work="Kashf" |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/kashf-COM_0458?s.num=0&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.encyclopaedia-of-islam-2&amp;s.q=Kashf |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which connotes “gain[ing] familiarity with things unseen behind the veils”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gulen|first=M. Fethullah|title=Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufism: Emerald Hills of the Heart, Vol. 2|year=2004|publisher=The Light, Inc.|location=Somerset|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those who have purified their hearts, and who come to know the Divine Names and Attributes to the fullest of their individual capacities, the veils in front of the purely spiritual realms are opened slightly, and they begin to gain familiarity with the unseen. In Sufism, an even further revelatory capacity exists by which the Divine mysteries become readily apparent to the seeker through the light of knowledge of [[God]]. This is called ''tajalli'' "manifestation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gulen|first=M. Fethullah|title=Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufism: Emerald Hills of the Heart, Vol. 2|year=2004|publisher=The Light, Inc.|location=Somerset|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veil References in Islamic Literature ==
Two passages in the '''Qur'an''' serve as the most solid basis for elaboration on the Sufi concept of kashf:

:*''' [50.22]''' ‘Thou wast heedless of this; therefore We have now removed from thee thy covering [veil], and so thy sight today is piercing.’
:* '''[53.57-58]''' The Imminent is imminent; apart from God none can disclose [remove] it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trans. A.J.|first=Arberry|title=The Koran Interpreted|year=1996|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb “kashafa,” but never the noun “kashf” occurs in the [[Qur'an]] a variety of times in the sense of either “to uncover” (a part of the body) or “to take away” (misfortune, danger).&lt;ref name="Kashf"/&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Hadith of the Veils'''&lt;/big&gt;

One [[hadith]] holds particular significance for the concept of ''kashf'':

2 - {{lang|ar|إن بين الله عز وجل وبين الخلق سبعين ألف حجاب وأقرب الخلق إلى الله عز وجل جبريل وميكائيل ، وإسرافيل ، وإن بينهم وبينه أربع حجب : حجاب من نار ، وحجاب من ظلمة ، وحجاب من غمام ، وحجاب من الماء
الراوي: سهل بن سعد الساعدي المحدث: ابن الجوزي - المصدر: موضوعات ابن الجوزي - الصفحة أو الرقم: 1/166
خلاصة حكم المحدث: لا أصل له}}

"Between God (mighty and sublime) and creation are ''70,000 veils''. The nearest of creatures to God (mighty and sublime) are [[Gabriel]], [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], and [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and between them and Him are four veils: a veil of fire, a veil of darkness, a veil of cloud, and a veil of water."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn al-Jawzi|first=Mawdu'at|title=Narrator Sahl ibn Sa'd al-Sa'id|others=Translated by Cyrus Ali Zargar|publisher=1/166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Hadith is quoted somewhat differently by ''[[Ibn Majah]]'' as follows:

“God has '''seventy thousand veils of light and darkness'''; if He were to remove them, the radiant splendors of His Face would burn up whoever (or ‘whatever creature’) was reached by His Gaze.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=James Winston|title=The Reflective Heart: Discovering Spiritual Intelligence in 'Ibn Arabi's Meccan Illuminations|year=2005|publisher=Fons Vitae|location=Louisville|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that''' [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]''', cousin to the '''Prophet [[Muhammad]]''', prayed a prayer that included this excerpt during the month of [[Sha'baan]]:

My Lord, grant me complete severance of my relations with everything else and total submission to You. Enlighten the eyes of our hearts with the light of their looking at You to the extent that they penetrate the '''veils of light''' and reach the Source of Grandeur, and let our souls get suspended by the glory of Your sanctity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duas.org/invocation.htm |title=The Invocation (Munajat) of Shabaniyah }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sufi Scholars on Kashf ==
'''[[Abd al-Karīm ibn Hawāzin Qushayri|Al-Kushayri]]''' expands on [[Abu Bakr al-Kalabadhi|al-Kalabadhi]]’s proposal that ''tajalli'' (manifestation) of '''“the essence”''' of the Divine is called''' ''mukashafa'''''. He then illustrates three stages in progression towards understanding the Real:
:# '''''Muhadara'''''—getting oneself into position vis-à-vis the objective sought. The objective remains veiled at this stage. This stage presupposes the presence of the heart, but relies on transmission of proof through the intellect (i.e. understanding God through his miraculous signs).
:# '''''Mukashafa'''''—lifting of the veil. Here reasoning (of the intellect) gives way to evident proof (through intuition). One directly encounters the Attributes of God. Yet, this stage is still considered an intermediary stage.
:# '''''[[Mushahada]]'''''—direct vision. This stage indicates an immediate encounter with The Real, without the intellect OR the intuition acting as an intermediary. This is direct experience of the Divine Essence.&lt;ref name="Kashf"/&gt;

'''[[Al-Ghazali]]'''—This Sufi scholar discusses the concept of '''''kashf''''', not purely in its mystical sense, but also with respect to [[theology]] in general. In conjunction with Al-Kushayri, Al-Ghazali links '''''kashf''''' with intuition. For Al-Ghazali, '''''mukashafa''''' has a dual sense:
:# It indicates an inner state of purification, which is subjective and brought about by “unveiling” or ''kashf''.
:# It describes the objective truths that are revealed through the “unveiling”/''kashf''.

Since, for Al-Ghazali, ''kashf'' is linked to [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], he describes ''mukashafa'' as the certain knowledge of the unseen discovered by the “science of the saints”.&lt;ref name="Kashf"/&gt; Thus, ''kashf'' is considered '''“a light,”''' that is freely bestowed upon the purified worshipper through the grace of God, yet also yields sure intuitive knowledge for the worshipper upon whom it is bestowed.

'''[[Ibn Arabi]]'''—This Sufi mystic indicates the necessity for “divine unveiling” (''kashf'') as the means by which to understand the universality of the '''reality of realities''' (i.e. the universality of God’s oneness). In ''[[Fana (Sufism)|fana]]'' (self-annihilation), the individual ego passes away and divine self-manifestation occurs. This self-manifestation is eternal (as it comes from God), but it must be continually reenacted by the human in time. Therefore, the human becomes a pure receptor required for pure consciousness to be realized. The human is a sort of ''[[barzakh]]'' or intermediary between divinity and elementality, between spirit and matter, and open to the experience of ''kashf''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sells |first=Michael |title=Ibn Arabi's Polished Mirror: Perspective Shift and Meaning Event |journal=Studia Islamica |year=1998 |volume=67 |pages=121–149 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1595976?uid=3739616&amp;uid=2474212893&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21102699007243 |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ali Hujwiri]]'''—The author of the Persian Sufi text ''[[Kashf ul Mahjoob]]'' (Revelation of the Veiled) Hujwiri argues, along with Al-Kushayri that very few ''real'' Sufis exist anymore in his time; rather, there are a large number of “false pretenders” which he calls ''mustaswif''—“the would-be Sufi”. In his text, Hujwiri describes the '''“veils which should be lifted”''' in order to purify one's heart and really pursue Sufism. Hujwiri argues for the importance of “morals” over “formal practice” in Sufism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karamustafa|first=Ahmet T.|title=Sufism: The Formative Period|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to directly address the problematic diversity in [[Islam|Muslim belief]] during his time. In ''Kashf ul Mahjoob'', he describes various Sufi approaches to theoretical ideas, linking them to particular key Sufi figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karamustafa|first=Ahmet T.|title=Sufism: The Formative Period|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Kashf'' and Shi’ism ==
In Shi’ism, the spiritual experience of ''kashf'' is treated as a theological rather than purely mystical dimension.
 
:'''[[Imami]]s'''—[[Sayyid Haydar Amuli]] distinguishes three kinds of knowledge: 1) by the intellect, 2) by transmission, 3) by ''kashf''—this is the only form of knowledge that leads to true understanding of '''Reality'''
:Amuli additionally distinguishes between two kinds of kashf:
		
:#'''''kashf suwari'''''—divine manifestations reach the senses of sight and hearing
:# ''''kashf ma’nawi'''''—spiritual encounter, such as the disclosure indicated by ''mukashafa''

:'''[[Ismali]]s'''—these followers of Shi’ism put emphasis on ''kashf'' in a double sense as both a Gnostic and cosmic “state.” The Ismalis define “cycles of metahistory”&lt;ref name="Kashf"/&gt; which alternate between phases of “unveiling” (''dawr-al-kashf'') and “occultation” (''dawr-al-satr'').

== Controversy in the Muslim World ==
The concept of ''kashf'' remains controversial in the Muslim world because it indicates the ability to “know” the unknowable. According to the '''Qur'an''', Muslims are required to believe in the unseen (namely [[Allah]]), but knowledge of the unseen is a power that should belong solely to God. But it does not contradict the quran because only God has knowledge of the unseen and if someone else other than God has that knowledge, then it's only because it was given to them by God.

Sufis further would argue that “the only guide to God is God Himself”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Valerie|title=Sufism, Mystics, and Saints in Modern Egypt|year=1995|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do believe that every genuine worshipper has the capability to experience unveiling (personal revelation), but that this personal revelation occurs by the grace of God. Some say, if a worshipper fails to experience unveiling, "it indicates that that person is pursuing Sufism for a reason other than the love of God alone." - However this in fact, incorrect. As devout Sufis believe that every individual's experience in sufism is different, similaraly to how different people have tha ability to see different things, therefore one can confirm that Kashf is not an ability granted to everyone. God is in fact the one who does the unveiling once a person has given up on all worldly forms of knowledge and his/her heart is pure and open for God. It is God's will to choose what people see and which people see. '''Ibn ‘Arabi''' calls this “inner receptivity” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=James Winston|title=The Reflective Heart: Discovering Spiritual Intelligence in 'Ibn Arabi's Meccan Illuminations|year=2005|publisher=Fons Vitae|location=Louisville|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the manifestation (''tajalli'') of the Divine Mysteries, the essence of which is ''mukashafa''.

== Peripatetic Scholars vs. Sufis ==
'''Peripatetic scholars''' such as '''[[Avicenna]], [[al-Kindi]], and [[al-Farabi]]''' argue that the intellect unaided by divine unveiling (''kashf'') is sufficient in order for man to attain ultimate truth.

'''Sufis''' such as '''[[Bayazid Bastami]], [[Rumi]], and [[Ibn al-Arabi]]''', contrarily argue that the limited human intellect is insufficient and misleading as a means of understanding ultimate truth. This kind of understanding requires intimate, personal, direct knowledge resulting from the removal of the veils separating man from God as given to man by God himself. This is ''kashf''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chittick|first=William C.|title=Mysticism versus Philosophy in Earlier Islamic History: The Al-Tusi, Al-Qunawi Correspondence|journal=Religious Studies|year=1981|volume=17|issue=1|pages=87–104|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=2414864|accessdate=4 April 2011|doi=10.1017/S0034412500012804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Types of ''Kashf'' ==
Later mystics{{Who|date=September 2010}}, relying upon the traditional terminology, classified the revelations as follows:

*'''Kashf kaunī''', revelation on the plane of the created things, is a result of pious actions and purifications of the lower soul; it becomes manifest in dreams and [[clairvoyance]].
*'''Kashf ilāhī''', divine revelation, is a fruit of constant worship and polishing of the heart; it results in the knowledge of the world of spirits and in [[cardiognosis]] ["soul-reading"] so that the mystic sees hidden things and reads hidden thoughts.
*'''Kashf aqlī''', revelation by reason, is essentially the lowest grade of intuitive knowledge; it can be attained by polishing the moral faculties, and can be experienced by the philosophers as well.
*'''Kashf īmānī''', revelation through faith, is the fruit of perfect faith after man has acquired proximity to the perfections of prophethood. He will be blessed by direct divine addresses — he talks with the angels, meets the spirits of the prophets, and sees the Night of Might and the blessings of the month of [[Ramadan|Ramaḍan]] in human form in the ālam almithāl.&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, Mystical dimensions of Islam (1975), pg192&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kashmiriyat'''  is the ethno-national and [[social consciousness]] and cultural values of the [[Kashmiri people]]. The term ''Kashmiriat'' has come to signify a centuries-old indigenous secularism of Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Term Kashmiriat|url=http://www.epw.in/perspectives/term-kashmiriat.html|accessdate=6 April 2015|agency=Economic &amp; Political Weekly|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging around the 16th century, it is characterised by religious and cultural harmony, [[patriotism]] and pride for their mountainous homeland of [[Kashmir]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}  In recent 2007 poll conducted by the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] in New Delhi, 84 percent of people in [[Srinagar]] want to see the return of [[Kashmiri Pandits]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSDEL291796 87 pct in Kashmir Valley want independence - poll], Reuters, 13 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A MORI survey of popular opinion in the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], including the [[Kashmir Valley]], found 92% respondents opposed to the state being divided on the basis of religion or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1912/19121300.htm  Kashmiris reject war in favour of democracy], Frontline, 8 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/papers/mori_survey_JK.htm MORI Survey in Jammu and Kashmir], South Asia Terrorism Portal, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholar [[Christopher Snedden]] states that the concept of Kashmiriyat has been 'romanticised' and Kashmiriyat could not prevent antipathy and rivalry between the [[Kashmiri Pandit|Kashmiri Pandits]] and the [[Kashmiri Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=a19eCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT40&amp;lpg=PT40&amp;dq=the+concept+of+kashmiriyat+has+been+somewhat+romanticised&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P1SWS80h4t&amp;sig=raYpmhMSA4yjCC2gRydoYAjzuW8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivlOK-xafQAhXKo5QKHYkmCzQQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20concept%20of%20kashmiriyat%20has%20been%20somewhat%20romanticised&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Kashmir and Kashmiris|last=Snedden|first=Christopher|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781849046220|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The Kashmir region enjoys significant ethnic, cultural and religious diversity. The region has historically been an important centre for [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. [[Islam]] was introduced in the medieval centuries, and [[Sikhism]] also spread to the region under the rule of the [[Sikh Empire]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. Kashmir has a significant place in the [[mythology]] and history of all four religions. The region derives its name from the [[Kashmiri Pandit]] ancestor, named Rishi [[Kashyapa]] and is believed to have been the abode of the celestial beings.&lt;ref name="WV"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is home to many legendary Hindu and Buddhist monuments and institutions. The [[Hazratbal shrine]] houses a relic that is believed to be the hair of [[Muhammad]], the prophet of Islam. In his journeys seeking religious enlightenment, [[Guru Nanak]] travelled to Kashmir. Kashmiris believe that the ideas of ''Kashmiriyat'' the rule of Sultan [[Zain ul Abedin]], who gave equal protection, importance and patronage to Kashmir's different religious communities.&lt;ref name="WV"/&gt;

==Philosophy==

Kashmir's existence is characterised by its insular Himalayan geography, harsh winter climate and isolation in economic and political terms. The region has also seen political turmoil and foreign invasions. ''Kashmiriat'' is believed to be an expression of solidarity, resilience and patriotism regardless of religious differences.&lt;ref name="WV"/&gt; It is believed to embody an ethos of harmony and a determination of survival of the people and their heritage. To many Kashmiris, ''Kashmiriat'' demanded religious and social harmony and brotherhood. It has been strongly influenced by [[Kashmir Shaivism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sufism]], carrying a long-standing conviction that any and every religion will lead to the same divine goal.&lt;ref name="WV"/&gt;

Kashmir was also influenced by the Mughal emperor [[Akbar]]'s genesis of a syncretic philosophy of ''[[Din-i-Illahi]]'', which emphasized the blending of Hindu and Muslim ideals and values. Works in the Kashmiri language, art, culture and literature strongly expound and emphasize ''Kashmiriat'' as a way of life.&lt;ref name="Lit"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2006-09-22 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the impact and importance of ''Kashmiriat'' has been concentrated in the [[Kashmir Valley]] only, which is the real historical Kashmir. The farther regions of [[Gilgit, Pakistan|Gilgit]], [[Baltistan]], [[Jammu]] and [[Ladakh]] have not been influenced by this philosophy, as these regions are not Kashmiri in terms of culture, language or ethnicity.

==Modern challenges==

The culture and ethos of ''Kashmiriat'' was greatly eroded at the onset of the [[Kashmir conflict]], when the region was claimed by [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] and its territory divided during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]]. In the political debate on sovereignty over Kashmir, many interpret ''Kashmiriat'' as [[nationalism]] and an expression for political independence from both Pakistan and India. The onset of [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|militancy in Kashmir from 1989]] has led to the exodus of almost all Hindus from Kashmir and violent attacks against the remaining communities of Hindus and Sikhs, further eroding the fabric of ''Kashmiriat''.&lt;ref name="WV"/&gt; Amidst the wider dispute between India and Pakistan. Conscious efforts to revive ''Kashmiriat'' have been made by various communities of Muslims and Hindus through united opposition to violence in the state.&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite web

A '''love letter''' is a romantic way to express feelings of [[love]] in [[writing|written form]]. Whether delivered by hand, [[mail]], [[carrier pigeon]], or romantically left in a secret location, the [[Letter (message)|letter]] may be anything from a short and simple message of love to a lengthy explanation of feelings. Love letters may 'move through the widest range of [[emotions]] – devotion, disappointment, grief and indignation, self-confidence, ambition, impatience, self-reproach and resignation'.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Redice, "Introduction" ''The Letters of Abelard and Heloise'' (Penguin 1978) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical sketch==
One of the first love letters in the world, mentioned more than 5000 years ago, is one carried from [[Rukmini]] to [[Krishna]] by her Brahmin messenger Sunanda.  This letter appears in the [[Bhagavatha Purana]], book 10, chapter 52.

Examples from Ancient Egypt range from the most formal – 'the royal widow .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [[Ankhesenamun]] wrote a letter to the king of the Hittites, Egypt's old enemy, begging him to send one of his sons to Egypt to marry her' – to the down-to-earth: let me 'bathe in thy presence, that I may let thee see my beauty in my tunic of finest linen, when it is wet'.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rosalie David, ''The Egyptian Kingdoms'' (Oxford 1975) p. 25 and p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial China might demand a higher degree of literary skill: when a heroine, faced with an arranged marriage, wrote to her childhood sweetheart, he exclaimed, 'what choice talent speaks in her well-chosen words .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. everything breathes the style of a [[Li T'ai-po|Li T'ai Po]]. How on earth can anyone want to marry her off to some humdrum clod?'&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Franke trans., ''The Golden Casket'' (1967) p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ovid]]'s Rome, 'the tricky construction and reception of the love letter' formed the centre of his [[Ars Amatoria]] or Art of Love: 'the love letter is situated at the core of Ovidian [[Eroticism|erotics]]'.&lt;ref name="Rimell2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victoria Rimell|title=Ovid's Lovers: Desire, Difference and the Poetic Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YiamoAgo1iIC|date=15 June 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86219-6}} p. 133 and p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;
The Middle Ages saw the formal development of the [[Ars dictaminis]], including the art of the love letter, from opening to close. For salutations, 'the scale in love letters is nicely graded from "To the noble and discreet lady P., adorned with every elegance, greeting" to the lyrical fervours of "Half of my soul and light of my eyes .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. greeting, and that delight which is beyond all word and deed to express"'.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Waddell, ''The Wandering Scholars'' (1968) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The substance similarly 'ranges from doubtful equivoque to exquisite and fantastic dreaming', rising to appeals for 'the assurance "that you care for me the way I care for you"'.&lt;ref&gt;Waddell, p. 157 and p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The love letter continued to be taught as a skill at the start of the eighteenth century, as in [[Richard Steele]]'s ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]''.&lt;ref name="Newman2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald J. Newman|title=The Spectator: Emerging Discourses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfklInrL9rUC&amp;pg=221|year=2005|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-910-5|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps in reaction, the artificiality of the concept came to be distrusted by the [[Romantics]]: '"A love-letter? My letter – a love-letter? It .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. came straight from my heart"'.&lt;ref&gt;Fyodor Dostoyevsky, ''The Idiot'' (Penguin 1973) p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

==The modern love letter==
The love letter continued to flourish in the first half of the twentieth-century – [[F Scott Fitzgerald]] gives us a [[Flapper]] 'absorbed in composing one of those non-committal, marvellously elusive letters that only a young girl can write'&lt;ref&gt;F. Scott Fitzgerald, ''Bernice Bobs Her Hair'' (Penguin 1968( p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; – and may even have been encouraged by the then-prevalence of global war. Before the wide use of telecommunications, letters were one of the few ways for a couple to remain in contact, particularly in wartime: when one of them was posted or stationed some distance from the other, the "being apart" often intensified emotions. Sometimes a desired normal communication could lead to a letter expressing love, longing and desires: 'the very act of writing often triggers love feelings in the writer'.&lt;ref&gt;Renata Salecl, in T. McGowan/S. Kunkle, ''Lacan and Contemporary Film'' (2004) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; During these times, "love letters" were the only means of communication, and soldiers even swapped addresses of desirable young ladies so that an initial communication and possible start of a relationship could be initiated{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. On the downside, when a correspondence was delayed, 'our move, the secrecy, the battle...it could be explained, but no explanation soothed my worry'; yet when letters came, operational contingencies might mean the need to 'Fold the letter carefully away...Fold that whole world away, and passion and love, so that they couldn't be hurt; yet of course they were there...when I saw a man, any man, reading a letter'.&lt;ref&gt;John Masters, ''The Road Past Mandalay'' (London 1973) p. 164 and p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the century, with the coming of the [[permissive society]] - 'imprisoning in physical bonding'&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly and Marion Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (Dorset 1999) p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; - and the instantaneity of the [[Information Age]], the more distanced and nuanced art of the love letter might be said to have fallen somewhat into disrepute: 'what could be more tradition-bound than a woman's (heterosexual) love letter?'.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Gould, ''Writing in the Feminine'' (1990) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; A couple might instead separate with the exchange, '"You should have said - I'll write." "But we won't." "No, but let's preserve the forms, the ''forms'' at least..."'.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Lessing, ''The Golden Notebook'' (1973) p. 636&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the electronic age, however, the humble love letter may possibly still play its part in life, if in new formats (exemplified perhaps in ''[[You've Got Mail]]''); and 'on the internet, one can find numerous sites where people obtain advice on how to write a love letter'.&lt;ref&gt;Salecl, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes letters are preferable to face-to-face contact because they can be written as the thoughts come to the author's mind. This may allow feelings to be more easily expressed than if the writer were in the beloved's presence. Further, expressing strong emotional feelings to paper or some other permanent form can be an expression within itself of desire and the importance of the beloved and the lover's emotions. Perhaps any 'correspondence is a kind of love affair...tinged by a subtle but palpable eroticism';&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''The Journalist and the Murderer'' (London 1991) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; while by contrast, in mobile, Twitter or Tweet, 'telegraphese was infectious', and the sign-off '"LOL! B cool B N touch bye"...felt like having a disinterested young mother'.&lt;ref&gt;William Gibson, ''Zero History'' (London 2010) p. 110 and p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression of feelings may be made to an existing love or in the hope of establishing a new [[personal relationship|relationship]]; and the increasing rarity and consequent emotional charm of personal mail may also serve to emphasize the emotional importance of the message.

===''Possession''===
In [[A. S. Byatt]]'s novel ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'', the (twentieth century) plot turns on the discovery of love letters between two (nineteenth century) literary figures: 'as though you'd found — [[Jane Austen]]'s love letters'.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Byatt, ''Possession'' (London 1990) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In his last letter, returning the correspondence, the man says 'You should burn them, I think, and yet, if [[Abelard]] had destroyed [[Heloise (abbess)|Eloisa]]'s marvellous words, if the [[Letters of a Portuguese Nun|Portuguese Nun]] had kept silent, how much the poorer would we not be, how much less wise?'.&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also explored how love letters subsequently 'exclude the reader as reader, they are written, if they are true letters, for ''a'' reader';&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 'typically unrecognised quality of...the keeping of distance'&lt;ref&gt;T. Pitt-Aikens/A. T. Ellis, ''Loss of the Good Authority'' (London 1989) p. 36-7&lt;/ref&gt; in the face of the cult of 'letting it all hang out...we question everything except the centrality of sexuality'&lt;ref&gt;Byatt, p. 271 and p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; — a theme epitomised perhaps in the fate of the letters themselves.

===Encore: "A Love Letter"===
[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] consistently linked desire and the letter: 'The function of desire is a last residuum of the effect of the signifier in the subject'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994) p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, he called a late seminar "A Love Letter", emphasising therein that 'speaking of love is in itself a ''[[jouissance]]'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, in Juliet Mitchell and Jacqueline Rose, ''Feminine Sexuality'' (New York 1982) p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; It was perhaps with respect to the love letter that he conceded that 'in the life of a man, a woman is something he believes in...believes her effectively to be saying something. That's when things get stopped up — to believe ''in'', one believes ''her''. It's what's called love'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, in Mitchell/Rose, p. 168-9&lt;/ref&gt; (He added) 'Believing a woman is, thank God, a widespread state — which makes for company, one is no longer all alone'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, in Mitchell/Rose, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and setting==
{{Love sidebar|related}}
As with any letter, a love letter could be written in any structure or style.  One historically popular method is as a [[sonnet]] or other form of [[poem]]. [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] are often cited as good examples of how to write emotional themes. Structure and suggestions of love letters have formed the subject of many published books, such as the [[anthology]] ''[[Love Letters of Great Men]]''. 'After reading hundreds of love letters for her collection ''The Book of Love'' [[Cathy N. Davidson]] confesses, "The more titles I read, the less I was able to generalize about female versus male ways of loving or expressing that love"'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Hardin, ''Love in a Green Shade'' 92006) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of a relationship, returning love letters to the sender or burning them can symbolize the pain felt. In the past, love letters also needed to be returned as a matter of honor: a love letter, particularly from a lady, could be compromising or embarrassing later in life, and the use of 'compromising letters...for blackmailing or other purposes'&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle, ''The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'' (Oxford 1993) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; was a Victorian cliche.

Some [[stationery]] companies produce [[paper]] and [[envelope]]s specifically for love letters.  Some of these are [[olfaction|scented]] — 'ground up lavender...a whole new sensory experience in letter reading'&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin LLoyd, ''The Actor's Way'' (2006) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; — though most people prefer to spray them with their own [[perfume]]. This emphasizes, in the receiver's mind, the physical connection that occurred between them in this form of communication and thus may strengthen the overall impact of the letter.

'''Maha bandha''' (Sanskrit: महा बंध, Mahā Bandha), translated as "The great bandha" is one of the internal locks or [[Bandha (Yoga)|bandha]]s described and employed in [[yoga]].

==Practice==
In a meditation pose for the duration of Bahir [[Kumbhaka]] all three [[Bandha (Yoga)|bandha]]s are gradually assumed and held, in the following order: [[Jalandhara Bandha]], [[Uddiyana Bandha]] and finally [[Mula Bandha]]. Releasing of the [[Bandha (Yoga)|bandha]]s goes in the same order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maheshwarananda|first1=Paramhans Swami|title=Yoga in daily Life - The System|date=2000|publisher=Ibera Verlag - European University Press Verlagsgesellschaft m.b.H.|isbn=3-85052-000-5|page=429|url=http://www.yogaindailylife.org/system/en/|chapter=Maha Bandha|chapter-url=http://www.yogaindailylife.org/system/en/bandhas/maha-bandha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precaution==
All precaution from all three assumed [[Bandha (Yoga)|bandha]]s should be considered.

'''Mark Wrathall''' (born 1965) is Professor of [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and a fellow and tutor at [[Corpus Christi College Oxford|Corpus Christi College, Oxford]].  His main interests include [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], the phenomenology of religion, the philosophy of popular culture, and the philosophy of law. He is considered a leading interpreter of the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]].  Wrathall is featured in [[Tao Ruspoli]]'s film ''[[Being in the World]]''. According to a recent reviewer of Wrathall's latest book, "Wrathall's writing is clear and comprehensive, ranging across virtually all of Heidegger's collected works.... Wrathall's overall interpretation of Heidegger's work is crystal clear, compelling, and relevant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Käufer|first=Stephan|title=Heidegger and Unconcealment|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24750-heidegger-and-unconcealment-truth-language-and-history/|work=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Mark Wrathall received a BA in philosophy at [[Brigham Young University]] in 1988.  In 1991, he received both a Juris Doctorate from [[Harvard law school|Harvard]] and an MA in philosophy from [[Boston College]].  After clerking for [[Cecil F. Poole]] at the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], he pursued a Ph.D. in philosophy from the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]], graduating in 1996, where he was a student of the Heidegger scholar [[Hubert Dreyfus]].  From 1994 to 1996 he was a teaching fellow at [[Stanford Law School]].  He taught at Brigham Young University from 1996 to 2006 (first in the political science department, then from 1999 in the philosophy department).  From 2006 to 2017, he was a professor at the University of California, Riverside.

Wrathall has also contributed to the philosophy of popular culture, editing a book on the philosophical themes found in the music of [[U2]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,600118407,00.html|title=U2 lyrics a big hit in philosophy class at Y.|publisher=''Desert News''|date=March 14, 2005|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing essays on film and philosophy.  Wrathall's work on popular culture intersects with his interests in religion.  He draws on Heidegger, [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] to describe how secularism and technology undermine belief in objective eternal meanings and values.  But Wrathall thinks [[nihilism]] also "opens up access to richer and more relevant ways for us to understand creation and for us to encounter the divine and the sacred."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16964">'''Mary Beckerle''' is an American [[cell biologist]] who studies [[cancer]] at the [[Huntsman Cancer Institute]] at the [[University of Utah]] Medical School. At Huntsman Cancer Institute, she serves as the CEO and also as Associate Vice President for Cancer Affairs at the University of Utah. Beckerle’s research helped to define a novel molecular pathway for [[cell motility]], and more recently, she has begun research into [[Ewing’s sarcoma]], a pediatric bone cancer. Beckerle’s lab has already made a ground breaking discover in regards to Ewing’s Sarcoma in relation to the EWS/FLI protein.&lt;ref name="Reference A"&gt;Neufield, Erica. “Huntsman Cancer Institute Awarded Grant for Children's Cancer Research” CureSearch for Children’s Cancer. {{cite web|url=http://www.curesearch.org/Huntsman-Cancer-Institute-Investigator-Awarded-Grant-for-Childrens-Cancer-Research/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224144505/http://www.curesearch.org/Huntsman-Cancer-Institute-Investigator-Awarded-Grant-for-Childrens-Cancer-Research/ |archivedate=2014-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her lab discovered EWS/FLI to disrupt the internal cellular skeleton, which decreases the ability of cells to adhere to their proper environment. This can help explain the metastasis of tumors in patients suffering from Ewing’s sarcoma.

==Early life==

Mary Catherine Beckerle was born in Rivers Edge, New Jersey to Martin and Mickey Beckerle. She is the oldest of three daughters, with sisters Bobby and Jeanne. Her father worked at the New York Telephone Co. and died suddenly at the age of 36 of [[emphysema]].&lt;ref name="Reference B"&gt;Benson, Lee, “They all want what Huntsman has — The woman in charge”. Deseret News.  March 1, 2014. Accessed November 11, 2014.[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865597712/They-all-want-what-Huntsman-has-2-The-woman-in-charge.html?pg=all]&lt;/ref&gt; Mary was twelve at the time. Her mother, a registered nurse, worked hard to keep the family together. Mary’s interest growing up included swimming and participation in [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scouts]]. As a teenager, she held jobs in a bakery, in a library, as a lifeguard, and at a Howard Johnson restaurant. Even with all these activities, school always remained Mary’s chief focus. After high school, she attended [[Wells College]], a small all girls’ school in New York, where she earned a B. A. in Biology and Psychology.&lt;ref name="Reference B"/&gt; She graduated ''magna cum laude'' and was a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].&lt;ref name="Reference C"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175208/http://www.ascb.org/files/profiles/Mary_beckerle.pdf “Mary Beckerle” American Society of Cell Biology. 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; Before continuing her education, she took a year off and worked in a cellular biology research laboratory at [[University of Texas]] Southwest Medical Center. After this, she attended the [[University of Colorado]] Boulder where she earned a PhD. in Molecular Biology. Her education then continued at the [[University of North Carolina]] Chapel Hill where she was a postdoctoral fellow in Anatomy and Cell Biology.&lt;ref name="Reference A"/&gt;

==Personal life==

While at the [[University of North Carolina Chapel Hill]], Beckerle met David Murrell. She would go on to marry him. The couple shares one son, David, who Mary describes as “my greatest joy in life.” Since moving to Utah, Dr. Beckerle has taken interest in mountain biking and hiking.&lt;ref name="Reference C"/&gt;

==Career==

After finishing her postdoctoral research, Beckerle joined the University of Utah faculty as an assistant professor of Biology.  She continued teaching at the University of Utah as well research and was one of the first professors to move into the Huntsman Cancer Institute when it opened in 1999. Also in 1999, she was awarded the Ralph E. and Willa T. Main Presidential Endowed Chair in Cancer Research at the University of Utah.&lt;ref name="DN2008"/&gt; Upon moving into the institute, she led a program specializing in cancer cell biology until 2003. In 2003, she was named the deputy director of the center. In 2006, she was named the CEO and the director over the entire Huntsman Cancer Institute. In 2009, she was also named the Associate Vice President for  Cancer Affairs at the University of Utah. She holds the Jon M. Huntsman Presidential Endowed Chair at the University of Utah, where she has also been promoted to a distinguished professorship in the biology department.&lt;ref&gt;http://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mddetail.php?facultyID=u0028589&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her career, Beckerle has served on many boards and committees, both within Huntsman Cancer Institute and nationally. In 1990, she served on the editorial board of [[Molecular Biology]] of the cell.&lt;ref name="Reference C"/&gt; She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the Curie Institute in Paris in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/mary-c-beckerle/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Dr. Beckerle served as the president of the American Society of Cell Biology. She was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="DN2008"&gt;http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695274977/Huntsman-director-elected-to-academy.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, she has been named to the [[American Association of Cancer Research]] Science Policy and Legislative Affairs Committee. She has served in many capacities for the [[National Institute of Health]], both on tasks forces as well as the NIH Advisory Committee to the Director from 2007-2010. She has also served as chair of the [[American Cancer Society]] Council for Extramural Grants. Currently, she serves on the Scientific Review Board of the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], the Board of Directors of the American Association for Cancer Research, the Coalition for Life Sciences Board of Directors. She serves on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the National Center for Biological Sciences at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bangalore, and the Mechanobiology Institute of the National University of Singapore. Beckerle serves on numerous National Cancer Institute-designated Cancer Center External Scientific Advisory Boards, including the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania, and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. In 2013, she was elected to the Board of Directors of the American Association for Cancer Research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/research/labs/beckerle/mary-beckerle.php Mary Beckerle.

=== 2017 Huntsman Cancer Institute Firing and Reinstatement ===
On 17 April 2017, Beckerle was terminated as CEO and Director of the Huntsman Cancer Institute via an email from University of Utah President [[David W. Pershing]] and Senior Vice President for Health Sciences [[Vivian Lee]]. The university did not disclose reasons for the dismissal, but members of the Huntsman family issued several public criticisms of the move, and called for Beckerle's reinstatement while criticizing the leadership shown by Pershing and Lee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sltrib.com/news/5189972-155/acclaimed-researcher-out-at-utahs-huntsman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ksl.com/?sid=43916078&amp;nid=148&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent days, members of the family made media appearances, published full page newspaper ads reiterating their support for cancer research and Beckerle, and even called for the termination of top university officials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sltrib.com/home/5203352-155/huntsman-calls-top-u-administrators-inept&lt;/ref&gt; Beckerle's firing occurred as the University of Utah and Huntsman Cancer Foundation were negotiating terms for a new memorandum of understanding to govern the operations of Huntsman Cancer Institute &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2017/08/04/emails-firing-of-huntsman-cancer-institute-ceo-sparked-by-funding-operational-disputes/&lt;/ref&gt;.  Some Huntsman Cancer Institute faculty and staff were among over 3600 individuals who signed a petition requesting Beckerle be restored to her position. On 19 April, roughly 100 demonstrators marched from the Huntsman Cancer Institute facilities across the university campus to the Office of President Pershing, calling for Beckerle's return. This came on the heels of other meetings and protests in the university community. On the morning of 25 April, the university's board of trustees met in a closed session, after which Pershing briefly spoke to reporters, mentioning that an announcement would be forthcoming later in the day. Within a few hours, it was announced that Beckerle would be reinstated as CEO and Director of the Huntsman Cancer Institute, and would report directly to the University President, bypassing Vivian Lee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sltrib.com/news/5215605-155/pershing-beckerle-reinstated-to-helm-of?fullpage=1&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April, Vivian Lee announced via email that, effective the same day, she was stepping down as the university's senior vice president for health sciences, dean of the medical school, and CEO of the healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sltrib.com/news/5231822-155/u-health-care-ceo-vivian-lee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ksl.com/?sid=44043827&amp;nid=148&amp;title=dr-vivian-lee-resigns-post-at-u-health-care-&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and Ewing’s Sarcoma==

Beckerle’s research employs several different techniques to exam signaling problems and [[cell motility]] issues.  Both of these problems could potentially play a role in the development of Ewing’s sarcoma.

Ewing’s Sarcoma is a bone cancer affecting mainly children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stjude.org/ewing-sarcoma Ewing Sarcoma. St’ Jude’s Children’s Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt; Tumors of Ewing’ Sarcoma are typically found in the long bones of the legs and arms, or bones in the chest, trunk, pelvis, back, or head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/cancer/ewings-sarcoma Ewing’s Sarcoma. WebMD]&lt;/ref&gt; Beckerle’s research in this area focuses on a key pathway as  believed to be a mechanism by which the cancer cells can spread. Ewing sarcoma occurs due to a chromosomal mutation that causes an atypical protein, known as EWS/FLI, to be present (also called expressed), and that when EWS/FLI is expressed, literally thousands of genes are misregulated, leading to abnormal behavior. Beckerle’s lab found that the EWS/FLI protein disrupted cell adhesion and limited the ability of cells to remain in their normal environment. The EWS/FLI protein is difficult to regulate so  Beckerle’s team is focused on an essential regulating protein called ysine specific demethylase (LSD1). Preliminary research has aimed to halt the function of LSD1 to prevent the spread of Ewing Sarcoma cells.&lt;ref name="Reference A"/&gt;

'''Nomy Arpaly''' is a Professor of Philosophy at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Philosophy : Philosophy Faculty|url=https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/people-facultymember.php?key=2|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her main research interests include ethics, moral psychology, action theory, and free will; she has written two books on moral agency (''Unprincipled Virtue: an Inquiry into Human Agency'' and ''In Praise of Desire'',) and one (''Merit, Meaning, and Human Bondage – an Essay on Free Will'') on free will.&lt;ref name=oup/&gt;&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|last=Arpaly|first=Nomy|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=https://research.brown.edu/pdf/10322.pdf?nocache=1537956474|publisher=Brown University|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Arpaly received a dual bachelor's from [[Tel Aviv University]] in 1992 in philosophy and linguistics, and a doctorate in philosophy from [[Stanford University]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; She accepted a position as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]] for the 1998–9 term, before accepting an Assistant Professorship at [[Rice University]] where she stayed in 2003.  In 2003, she accepted an Assistant Professorship at [[Brown University]], where she was promoted to Associate Professor in 2006, and then to Professor of Philosophy in 2014.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==Research areas and publications==
Arpaly has authored three volumes – one focused on moral agency – ''Unprincipled Virtue: an Inquiry into Human Agency'' (2002) – and one focused on free will – ''Merit, Meaning, and Human Bondage – an Essay on Free Will'' (2006.)&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  and one dealing with human agency – ''In Praise of Desire'' (2014.)&lt;ref name=oup&gt;{{cite web|title=In Praise of Desire: Nomy Arpaly|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199348169.do|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, she's written a number of peer-reviewed papers dealing with topics such as ethics, moral psychology, and action theory.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

In ''Unprincipled Virtue: an Inquiry into Human Agency'', Arpaly sets out to develop a systematic way to determine whether an individual is blameworthy or praiseworthy.&lt;ref name=pb&gt;{{cite journal|last=McConnell|first=Terrance|title=Review of Nomy Arpaly's Unprincipled Virtue|journal=Philosophical Books|date=January 2005|volume=46|issue=1|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arpaly engages with (and attempts to refute) a number of prominent philosophers who have dealt with the issue previously (including Kant and Aristotle,) but focuses foremost on developing her own theory of praiseworthiness, one in which people are praise (or blame)worthy for their acts in a way that varies with their moral motivations, and (in the case of blameworthiness) with the amount of their moral indifference – a concept she sums up as – Praiseworthiness as Responsiveness to Moral Reasons.&lt;ref name=pb/&gt;   Arpaly articulates a skeptical and deflationary view of the whole idea of autonomy, pointing out that at least eight separate notions of the idea of autonomy can be found in modern philosophical literature, and doubting that autonomy of any sort is needed for an action to be praiseworthy.&lt;ref name=pb/&gt;&lt;ref name=up&gt;{{cite book|last=Arpaly|first=Nomy|title=Unprincipled virtue : an inquiry into moral agency.|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195179767|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most significant contributions of Arpaly's book is simply that it lays out the flaws present in most former philosophical debate on the subject – the use of overly simple and unnuanced models in previous discussions of praiseworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suikkanen|first=Jussi|title=Unprincipled Virtue – Nomy Arpaly|journal=Ratio|date=June 2006|volume=19|issue=2|pages=261–265|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.2006.00324.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the central claims of ''Unprincipled Virtue'' is that the assistance that [[Huckleberry Finn]] renders to Jim is morally worthy even though Huck actively believes that he is doing something wrong, and that [[akrasia]] can sometimes be a more rational state than individual autonomy.&lt;ref name=pb/&gt;&lt;ref name=up/&gt;

"'''''Per fas et nefas'''''" (Latin for "through right and wrong") refers to unfair [[eristic]] treatment. It occurs when [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]] A postulates a theory, and cites several reasons that justify it. Interlocutor B then refutes one of the arguments, and triumphantly declares that A's argument has no basis, even though they never said a word about the other arguments that A put forth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3523">'''Peter Joseph Elvenich''' (29 January 1796 – 16 June 1886) was a German [[Catholic]] [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]] born in Embken, a village that today is part of [[Nideggen]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. He was a principal supporter and defender of Hermesianism, a theological belief system based on the teachings of [[Georg Hermes]] (1775–1831).

He studied theology and philosophy in [[Münster]] and [[Bonn]], and in 1821 became a schoolteacher in [[Koblenz]]. During the following year he became a lecturer at the [[University of Bonn]], where in 1826 he became an associate professor of philosophy. In 1829 he attained a full professorship at the [[University of Breslau]], where in 1837 he took on additional duties as [[librarian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/Elvenich Biography] at [[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the papal decrees of 26 September 1835 and 7 January 1836, of which [[Pope Gregory XVI]] condemned writings issued by Georg Hermes, Elvenich, along with Johann Wilhelm Joseph Braun (1801-1863), traveled to [[Rome]] in order to the convince the Pope to revise the decrees of condemnation. Their efforts were in vain, and several years later the condemnation was reiterated by [[Pope Pius IX]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W1g_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA302 A history of Christian doctrines, Volume 3] by Karl Rudolf Hagenbach&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843 Elvenich was removed from his post in [[Breslau]] at the request of [[Johannes von Geissel]], coadjutor to the [[Archbishop of Cologne]]. After the [[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council]] of 1870, he became a member of the [[Old Catholic Church]].

The term '''process model''' is used in various contexts. For example, in [[business process modeling]] the enterprise process model is often referred to as the ''business process model''.

[[Image:Meta-levels.svg|thumb|right|300px|Abstraction level for processes&lt;ref name="Rolland1993"&gt;
[[Colette Rolland]] (1993). ''Modeling the Requirements Engineering Process. 3rd European-Japanese Seminar on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Overview ==
Process models are [[wiktionary:Process|process]]es of the same nature that are classified together into a model. Thus, a process model is a description of a process at the type level. Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it. The same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus, has many instantiations. One possible use of a process model is to prescribe how things must/should/could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens. A process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like. What the process shall be will be determined during actual system development.&lt;ref name="Rolland1998"&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] and Pernici, C. Thanos (1998). ''A Comprehensive View of Process Engineering. Proceedings of the 10th International Conference CAiSE'98''. B. [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] 1413. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of a process model are to be:
*Descriptive
**Track what actually happens during a process
**Take the point of view of an external observer who looks at the way a process has been performed and determines the improvements that must be made to make it perform more effectively or efficiently.
*Prescriptive
**Define the desired processes and how they should/could/might be performed.
**Establish rules, guidelines, and behavior patterns which, if followed, would lead to the desired process performance. They can range from strict enforcement to flexible guidance.
*Explanatory
**Provide explanations about the rationale of processes.
**Explore and evaluate the several possible courses of action based on rational [[argument]]s.
**Establish an explicit link between processes and the requirements that the model needs to fulfill.
**Pre-defines points at which data can be extracted for reporting purposes.

== Purpose ==
From a theoretical point of view, the [[meta-process modeling]] explains the key concepts needed to describe what happens in the development process, on what, when it happens, and why. From an operational point of view, the meta-process modeling is aimed at providing guidance for method engineers and application developers.&lt;ref name=Rolland1993/&gt;

The activity of [[business model|modeling a business]] process usually predicates a need to change processes or identify issues to be corrected. This transformation may or may not require IT involvement, although that is a common driver for the need to model a business process. [[Change management]] programmes are desired to put the processes into practice. With advances in technology from larger platform vendors, the vision of business process models (BPM) becoming fully executable (and capable of round-trip engineering) is coming closer to reality every day. Supporting technologies include [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), [[model-driven architecture]], and [[service-oriented architecture]].

Process modeling addresses the process aspects of an enterprise [[business architecture]], leading to an all encompassing [[enterprise architecture]].  The relationships of a business processes in the context of the rest of the enterprise systems, data, organizational structure, strategies, etc. create greater capabilities in analyzing and planning a change. One real-world example is in corporate [[mergers and acquisitions]]; understanding the processes in both companies in detail, allowing management to identify redundancies resulting in a smoother merger.

Process modeling has always been a key aspect of [[business process reengineering]], and continuous improvement approaches seen in [[Six Sigma]].

== Classification of process models ==

=== By coverage ===
There are five types of coverage where the term process model has been defined differently:&lt;ref name="Dowson1988"&gt;M. Dowson (1998). ''Iteration in the Software Process, Proc 9th Int. Conf. on Software Engineering''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Activity-oriented: related set of activities conducted for the specific purpose of product definition; a set of partially ordered steps intended to reach a goal.&lt;ref name="Feiler1993"&gt;P.H. Feiler and [[W.S. Humphrey]]. (1993). ''Software Process Development and Enactment: Concepts and Definitions, Proc. 2nd Int. Conf. on "Software Process"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Product-oriented: series of activities that cause sensitive product transformations to reach the desired product.&lt;ref name=Sianipar2014&gt;

''A Multi-Model View of Process Modelling. Requirements Engineering''. Vol 4, Nr 4. Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By alignment ===
Processes can be of different kinds.&lt;ref name=Rolland1998/&gt; These definitions "correspond to the various ways in which a process can be modelled".

* Strategic processes
** investigate alternative ways of doing a thing and eventually produce a plan for doing it
** are often creative and require human co-operation; thus, alternative generation and selection from an alternative are very critical activities
* Tactical processes
** help in the achievement of a plan
** are more concerned with the tactics to be adopted for actual plan achievement than with the development of a plan of achievement
* Implementation processes
** are the lowest level processes
** are directly concerned with the details of the ''what'' and ''how'' of plan implementation

=== By granularity ===
[[Granularity]] refers to the level of detail of a process model and affects the kind of guidance, explanation and trace that can be provided. Coarse granularity restricts these to a rather limited level of detail whereas fine granularity provides more detailed capability. The nature of granularity needed is dependent on the situation at hand.&lt;ref name=Rolland1998/&gt;

Project manager, customer representatives, the general, top-level, or middle management require rather coarse-grained process description as they want to gain an overview of time, budget, and resource planning for their decisions. In contrast, software engineers, users, testers, analysts, or software system architects will prefer a fine-grained process model where the details of the model can provide them with instructions and important execution dependencies such as the dependencies between people.

While notations for fine-grained models exist, most traditional process models are coarse-grained descriptions. Process models should, ideally, provide a wide range of granularity (e.g. Process Weaver).&lt;ref name=Rolland1998/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernström1991"&gt;C. Fernström and L. Ohlsson (1991). ''Integration Needs in Process Enacted Environments, Proc. 1st Int. Conf. on the Software Process''. IEEE computer Society Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By flexibility ===
[[Image:flexibility.png|thumb|right|300px|Flexibility of Method construction approaches &lt;ref name="HBO"&gt;
A.F. Harmsen, [[Sjaak Brinkkemper]] and J.L.H. Oei  (1994). ''Situational Method Engineering for information Systems Project Approaches''. North Holland&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was found that while process models were prescriptive, in actual practice departures from the prescription can occur.&lt;ref name=Rolland1999/&gt; Thus, frameworks for adopting methods evolved so that systems development methods match specific organizational situations and thereby improve their usefulness. The development of such frameworks is also called situational [[method engineering]].

Method construction approaches can be organized in a flexibility spectrum ranging from 'low' to 'high'.&lt;ref name=HBO/&gt;

Lying at the 'low' end of this spectrum are rigid methods, whereas at the 'high' end there are modular method construction. Rigid methods are completely pre-defined and leave little scope for adapting them to the situation at hand. On the other hand, modular methods can be modified and augmented to fit a given situation. Selecting a rigid methods allows each project to choose its method from a panel of rigid, pre-defined methods, whereas selecting a path within a method consists of choosing the appropriate path for the situation at hand. Finally, selecting and tuning a method allows each project to select methods from different approaches and tune them to the project's needs." &lt;ref name="Rolland1997"&gt;[[Colette Rolland]] (1997). 'A Primer for Method Engineering. Proceedings of the INFORSID Conference''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quality of methods ==

As the quality of process models is being discussed in this paper, there is a need to elaborate quality of modeling techniques as an important essence in quality of process models.  In most existing frameworks created for understanding the quality, the line between quality of modeling techniques and the quality of models as a result of the application of those techniques are not clearly drawn.  This report will concentrate both on quality of process modeling techniques and quality of process models to clearly differentiate the two.
Various frameworks were developed to help in understanding quality of process modeling techniques, one example is Quality based modeling evaluation framework or known as Q-Me framework which argued to provide set of well defined quality properties and procedures to make an objective assessment of this properties possible.&lt;ref name=hommes/&gt;
This framework also has advantages of providing uniform and formal description of the model element within one or different model types using one modeling techniques&lt;ref name=hommes&gt;BJ Hommes, V Van Reijswoud, Assessing the Quality of Business Process Modeling Techniques -Proceedings of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences – 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
In short this can make assessment of both the product quality and the process quality of modeling techniques with regard to a set of properties that have been defined before.

Quality properties that relate to [[business process modeling]] techniques discussed in &lt;ref name=hommes/&gt; are:

* Expressiveness: the degree to which a given modeling technique is able to denote the models of any number and kinds of application domains.
* Arbitrariness: the degree of freedom one has when modeling one and the same domain
* Suitability: the degree to which a given modeling technique is specifically tailored for a specific kind of application domain.
* Comprehensibility: the ease with which the way of working and way of modeling are understood by participants.
* Coherence: the degree to which the individual sub models of a way of modeling constitute a whole.
* Completeness; the degree to which all necessary concepts of the application domain are represented in the way of modeling.
* Efficiency: the degree to which the modeling process uses resources such as time and people.
* Effectiveness: the degree to which the modeling process achieves its goal.

To assess the quality of Q-ME framework; it is used to illustrate the quality of the dynamic essentials modeling of the organisation (DEMO) business modeling techniques.

It is stated that the evaluation of the Q-ME framework to the DEMO modeling techniques has revealed the shortcomings of Q-ME. One particular is that it does not include quantifiable metric to express the quality of business modeling technique which makes it hard to compare quality of different techniques in an overall rating.

There is also a systematic approach for quality measurement of modeling techniques known as complexity metrics suggested by Rossi et al. (1996). Techniques of Meta model is used as a basis for computation of these complexity metrics. In comparison to quality framework proposed by [[John Krogstie|Krogstie]], quality measurement focus more on technical level instead of individual model level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bart-Jan Hommes, ''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220260389_Business_Process_Change_A_Study_of_Methodologies_Techniques_and_Tools/file/72e7e52a1d6f118dba.pdf The evaluation of business process modeling techniques],'' phd thesis TU Delft 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors (Cardoso, Mendling, Neuman and Reijers, 2006) used complexity metrics to measure the simplicity and understandability of a design. This is supported by later research done by Mendling ''et al.'' who argued that without using the quality metrics to help question quality properties of a model, simple process can be modeled in a complex and unsuitable way. This in turn can lead to a lower understandability, higher maintenance cost and perhaps inefficient execution of the process in question.&lt;ref name="MendlingMoserBPM"&gt;J. Mendling, M. Moser, G. Neumann, H. Verbeek, B. Dongen, W. van der Aalst, A Quantitative Analysis of Faulty EPCs in the SAP Reference Model, BPM Center Report BPM-06-08, BPMCenter.org, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of modeling technique is important in creating models that are of quality and contribute to the correctness and usefulness of models.

== Quality of models ==
Earliest process models reflected the dynamics of the process with a practical process obtained by instantiation in terms of relevant concepts, available technologies, specific implementation environments, process constraints and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the 9th international conference on Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Enormous number of research has been done on quality of models but less focus has been shifted towards the quality of process models. Quality issues of process models cannot be evaluated exhaustively however there are four main guidelines and frameworks in practice for such. These are: top-down quality frameworks, bottom-up metrics related to quality aspects, empirical surveys related to modeling techniques, and pragmatic guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Mendling |first2=H. A. |last2=Reijers |first3=W. M. P. |last3=van der Aalst |title=Seven process modeling guidelines (7PMG) |journal=Information and Software Technology |volume=52 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=127–136 |doi=10.1016/j.infsof.2009.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hommes quoted Wang ''et al.'' (1994)&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt; that all the main characteristic of quality of models can all be grouped under 2 groups namely correctness and usefulness of a model, correctness ranges from the model correspondence to the phenomenon that is modeled to its correspondence to syntactical rules of the modeling and also it is independent of the purpose to which the model is used.

Whereas the usefulness can be seen as the model being helpful for the specific purpose at hand for which the model is constructed at first place. Hommes also  makes a further distinction between internal correctness (empirical, syntactical and semantic quality) and external correctness (validity).

A common starting point for defining the quality of conceptual model is to look at the linguistic properties of the modeling language of which syntax and semantics are most often applied.

Also the broader approach is to be based on semiotics rather than linguistic as was done by Krogstie using the top-down quality framework known as SEQUAL.&lt;ref name=krogstie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=O. |last=Lindland |first2=G. |last2=Sindre |first3=A. |last3=Sølvberg |title=Understanding quality in conceptual modeling |journal=IEEE Software |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=1994 |pages=42–49 |doi=10.1109/52.268955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, knowledge Externalisation, domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling.

The framework does not however provide ways to determine various degrees of quality but has been used extensively for business process modeling in empirical tests carried out &lt;ref&gt;D. Moody, G. Sindre, T. Brasethvik and A. Sølvberg, Evaluating the quality of process models: empirical testing of a quality framework. In: S. Spaccapietra, S.T. March and Y. Kambayashi, Editors, Conceptual Modeling – ER 2002, 21st International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, Tampere, Finland, October 7–11, 2002, Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol. 2503, Springer (2002), pp. 380–396.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to previous research done by Moody ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L. Moody, G. Sindre, T. Brasethvik, A. Sølvberg. Evaluating the Quality of Process Models: Empirical Testing of a Quality Framework&lt;/ref&gt; with use of conceptual model quality framework proposed by Lindland ''et al.'' (1994) to evaluate quality of process model, three levels of quality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morris |first=C. W. |year=1970 |title=Foundations of the Theory of Signs |location=Chicago |publisher=Chicago University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; were identified:

* Syntactic quality: Assesses extent to which the model conforms to the grammar rules of modeling language being used.
* Semantic quality: whether the model accurately represents user requirements
* Pragmatic quality: whether the model can be understood sufficiently by all relevant stakeholders in the modeling process. That is the model should enable its interpreters to make use of it for fulfilling their need.

From the research it was noticed that the quality framework was found to be both easy to use and useful in evaluating the quality of process models however it had limitations in regards to reliability and difficult to identify defects. These limitations led to refinement of the framework through subsequent research done by [[John Krogstie|Krogstie]]. This framework is called SEQUEL framework by Krogstie ''et al.'' 1995 (Refined further by Krogstie &amp; Jørgensen, 2002) which included three more quality aspects.

* Physical quality: whether the externalized model is persistent and available for the audience to make sense of it.
* Empirical quality: whether the model is modeled according to the established regulations regarding a given language.
* Social quality: This regards the agreement between the stakeholders in the modeling domain.

Dimensions of Conceptual Quality framework&lt;ref&gt;[[John Krogstie|J. Krogstie]], O. Lindland, G. Sindre, Defining quality aspects for conceptual models, in: Proc. IFIP8.1 Working Conference on Information Systems Concepts: Towards a Consolidation of Views, Marburg, Germany, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
Modeling Domain is the set of all statements that are relevant and correct for describing a problem domain, Language Extension is the set of all statements that are possible given the grammar and vocabulary of the modeling languages used. Model Externalization is the conceptual representation of the problem domain.

It is defined as the set of statements about the problem domain that are actually made. Social Actor Interpretation and Technical Actor Interpretation are the sets of statements that actors both human model users and the tools that interact with the model, respectively 'think' the conceptual representation of the problem domain contains.

Finally, Participant Knowledge is the set of statements that human actors, who are involved in the modeling process, believe should be made to represent the problem domain. These quality dimensions were later divided into two groups that deal with physical and social aspects of the model.

In later work, Krogstie et al.&lt;ref name=krogstie/&gt; stated that while the extension of the SEQUAL framework  has fixed some of the limitation of the initial framework, however other limitation remain .
In particular, the framework is too static in its view upon semantic quality, mainly considering models, not modeling activities, and comparing these models to a static domain rather than seeing the model as a facilitator for changing the domain.

Also, the framework's definition of pragmatic quality is quite narrow, focusing on understanding, in line with the semiotics of Morris, while newer research in linguistics and semiotics has focused beyond mere understanding, on how the model is used and affects its interpreters.

The need for a more dynamic view in the semiotic quality framework is particularly evident when considering process models, which themselves often prescribe or even enact actions in the problem domain, hence a change to the model may also change the problem domain directly. This paper discusses the quality framework in relation to active process models and suggests a revised framework based on this.

Further work by Krogstie ''et al.'' (2006) to revise SEQUAL framework to be more appropriate for active process models  by redefining physical quality with a more narrow interpretation than previous research.&lt;ref name =krogstie&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Krogstie |first2=G. |last2=Sindre |first3=H. |last3=Jorgensen |title=Process models representing knowledge for action: a revised quality framework |journal=European Journal of Information Systems |volume=15 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=91–102 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other framework in use is Guidelines of Modeling (GoM) &lt;ref&gt;J. Becker, M. Rosemann and C. Uthmann, Guidelines of business process modeling. In: W. van der Aalst, J. Desel and A. Oberweis, Editors, Business Process Management. Models, Techniques, and Empirical Studies, Springer, Berlin (2000), pp. 30–49&lt;/ref&gt; based on general accounting principles include the six principles: Correctness, Clarity deals with the comprehensibility and explicitness (System description) of model systems.
Comprehensibility relates to graphical arrangement of the information objects and, therefore, supports the understand ability of a model.
Relevance relates to the model and the situation being presented. Comparability involves the ability to compare models that is semantic comparison between two models, Economic efficiency; the produced cost of the design process need at least to be covered by the proposed use of cost cuttings and revenue increases.

Since the purpose of organizations in most cases is the maximization of profit, the principle defines the borderline for the modeling process. The last principle is Systematic design defines that there should be an accepted differentiation between diverse views within modeling.
Correctness, relevance and economic efficiency are prerequisites in the quality of models and must be fulfilled while the remaining guidelines are optional but necessary.

The two frameworks SEQUAL and GOM have a limitation of use in that they cannot be used by people who are not competent with modeling. They provide major quality metrics but are not easily applicable by non-experts.

The use of bottom-up metrics related to quality aspects of process models is trying to bridge the gap of use of the other two frameworks by non-experts in modeling but it is mostly theoretical and no empirical tests have been carried out to support their use.

Most experiments carried out relate to the relationship between metrics and quality aspects and these works have been done individually by different authors: Canfora et al. study the connection mainly between count metrics (for example, the number of tasks or splits -and maintainability of software process models);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Canfora |first2=F. |last2=Garcia |first3=M. |last3=Piattini |first4=F. |last4=Ruiz |first5=C. |last5=Visaggio |title=A family of experiments to validate metrics for software process models |journal=Journal of Systems and Software |volume=77 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=113–129 |doi=10.1016/j.jss.2004.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardoso validates the correlation between control flow complexity and perceived complexity; and Mendling et al. use metrics to predict control flow errors such as deadlocks in process models.&lt;ref name=MendlingMoserBPM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mendling, Detection and prediction of errors in epc business process models, Ph.D. thesis, Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, http://wi.wu-wien.ac.at/home/mendling/publications/Mendling%20Doctoral%20thesis.pdf, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The results reveal that an increase in size of a model appears to reduce its quality and comprehensibility.
Further work by Mendling et al. investigates the connection between metrics and understanding &lt;ref name=mendling14/&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;J. Mendling and M. Strembeck, Influence factors of understanding business process models. In: W. Abramowicz and D. Fensel, Editors, Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Business Information Systems (BIS 2008), Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing vol. 7, Springer-Verlag (2008), p. 142153.&lt;/ref&gt; While some metrics are confirmed regarding their effect, also personal factors of the modeler – like competence – are revealed as important for understanding about the models.

Several empirical surveys carried out still do not give clear guidelines or ways of evaluating the quality of process models but it is necessary to have clear set of guidelines to guide modelers in this task. Pragmatic guidelines have been proposed by different practitioners even though it is difficult to provide an exhaustive account of such guidelines from practice.
In,&lt;ref&gt;B.Silver, Ten Tips for Effective Process Modeling,BPMInstitute.org, &lt;http://www.bpminstitute.org/articles/article/article/bpms-watch-ten-tips-for-effective-process-modeling.html&gt;, Wednesday January 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 10 tips for process modeling are summarized, many technical definitions and rules are provided, but it does not teach how to create process models that are effective in their primary mission - maximizing shared understanding of the as-is or to-be process.
Most of the guidelines are not easily put to practice but "label activities verb–noun" rule has been suggested by other practitioners before and analyzed empirically.
From the research.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mendling, H.A. Reijers, J. Recker, Activity Labeling in Process Modeling: Empirical Insights and Recommendations, Information Systems. URL: &lt;http://eprints.qut.edu.au/19625/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; value of process models is not only dependent on the choice of graphical constructs but also on their annotation with textual labels which need to be analyzed. It was found that it results in better models in terms of understanding than alternative labelling styles.

From the earlier research and ways to evaluate process model quality it has been seen that the process model's size, structure, expertise of the modeler and modularity affect its overall comprehensibility.&lt;ref name=mendling14&gt;J. Mendling, H.A. Reijers and J. Cardoso, What makes process models understandable? In: G. Alonso, P. Dadam and M. Rosemann, Editors, Business Process Management, 5th International Conference, BPM 2007, Brisbane, Australia, September 24–28, 2007, Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol. 4714, Springer, Brisbane, Australia (2007), pp. 48–63.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;H. A. Reijers, J. Mendling, Modularity in process models: Review and effects in: M. Dumas, M. Reichert, M.-C. Shan (Eds.), Business Process Management BPM 2008, Vol. 5240 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer, Milan, Italy, 2008, pp. 20-35&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these a set of guidelines was presented&lt;ref name=mendling19&gt;J. Mendling, H. A. Reijers, W. M. P. van der Aalst, Seven process modeling guidelines (7pmg), QUT ePrints Report 12340, Queensland University of Technology (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; 7 Process Modeling Guidelines (7PMG). This guideline uses the verb-object style, as well as guidelines on the number of elements in a model, the application of structured modeling, and the decomposition of a process model. The guidelines are as follows:

* G1 Minimize the number of elements in a model
* G2 Minimize the routing paths per element
* G3 Use one start and one end event
* G4 Model as structured as possible
* G5 Avoid OR routing elements
* G6 Use verb-object activity labels
* G7 Decompose a model with more than 50 elements

7PMG still though has limitations with its use: Validity problem 7PMG does not relate to the content of a process model, but only to the way this content is organized and represented.
It does suggest ways of organizing different structures of the process model while the content is kept intact but the pragmatic issue of what must be included in the model is still left out.
The second limitation relates to the prioritizing guideline the derived ranking has a small empirical basis as it relies on the involvement of 21 process modelers only.

This could be seen on the one hand as a need for a wider involvement of process modelers' experience, but it also rises the question what alternative approaches may be available to arrive at a prioritizing guideline.&lt;ref name=mendling19/&gt;

'''Raimon Panikkar Alemany''', also known as '''Raimundo Panikkar''' and '''Raymond Panikkar'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20100826/53990452372.html|title=Biodata|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100829081848/http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20100826/53990452372.html|archivedate=2010-08-29|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; (November 2, 1918 &amp;ndash; August 26, 2010), was a Catalan [[Roman Catholic]] priest and a proponent of [[Interfaith dialogue|inter-religious dialogue]]. As a scholar, he specialized in [[comparative religion]].

==Early life and education==
Raimon Panikkar was born as the son of a Spanish [[Roman Catholic]] mother and a [[Hindu]] [[India]]n father in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{citejournal|work=Time|date=September 20, 2010|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was well-educated and from the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] bourgeoisie. His father, Ramunni Panikkar, belonged to  [[Malabar district|Malabar]] [[Nair]] family from [[South India]]. Panikkar's father was a freedom fighter during [[British Raj|British colonial rule in India]] and escaped from Britain and married into a Catalan family. Panikkar's father studied in England and was the representative of a German chemical company in Barcelona. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Educated at a [[Jesuit]] school, Panikkar studied chemistry and philosophy at the universities of [[University of Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and [[Complutense University of Madrid|Madrid]], and Catholic Theology in Madrid and Rome. He earned a doctorate in philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]] in 1946 and a doctorate in chemistry in 1958.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{citejournal|work=The New York Times|date=September 6, 2010|page=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a third doctorate in theology at the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] in Rome in 1961.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He compared St. Thomas Aquinas's Philosophy with the eighth-century Hindu philosopher [[Adi Shankara|Ādi Śańkara]]'s Interpretation of the [[Brahma Sutras]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

==Career==

In 1946 he was ordained a [[Catholic priest]], and became a professor of philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

He made his first trip to India in 1954 where he studied [[Indian philosophy]] and religion at the [[University of Mysore]] and [[Banaras Hindu University]], where he met several Western monks seeking Eastern forms for the expression of their Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; "I left Europe [for India] as a Christian, I discovered I was a Hindu and returned as a Buddhist without ever having ceased to be Christian," he later wrote.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

While in Jerusalem during 1962, he was summoned to Rome by Opus Dei founder and director, [[Saint]] [[Josemaría Escrivá]], who expelled him after a brief trial where he was charged with disobedience to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Raimon Panikkar |author= Raffaele Luise |id= San Paolo |place= Milan |year=2011 |pages= 25-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 he became a visiting professor at [[Harvard Divinity School]] and a professor of religious studies at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; For many years he taught in the spring and spent the rest of the year doing research in India.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Where the typical approach to Cross-Cultural Religious Studies, especially in a secular university, was to hold two or more traditions at arm's length and draw lines of comparison between them, Panikkar's approach was to view issues in the real world through the eyes of two or more traditions.

In 1987 he moved to [[Tavertet]] in [[Catalonia]], in the hills north of Barcelona, where he founded the Raimon Panikkar Vivarium Foundation, a center for intercultural studies.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; 
In 2005 he creates Arbor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moneyhouse registration|url=http://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/p/panikkar_alemany_raimon-4995690/|website=Moneyhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the realization of his principle of interreligious collaboration for the relief of poverty in thousands of villages of India &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arbor Foundation India|url=https://www.arborindia.org|website=Arbor India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panikkar authored more than 40 books and 900 articles. His complete works are being published in Italian. His 1989 [[Gifford Lectures]] were published in English by Orbis in 2009 under the title "The Rhythm of Being."

In a statement from his residence in Tavertet dated January 26, 2010, he wrote: "Dear Friends . . . I would like to communicate with you that I believe the moment has come, (put off time and again), to withdraw from all public activity, both the direct and the intellectual participation, to which I have dedicated all my life as a way of sharing my reflections.  I will continue to be close to you in a deeper way, through silence and prayer, and in the same way I would ask you to be close to me in this last period of my existence.  You have often heard me say that a person is a knot in a network of relationships; in taking my leave from you I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for having enriched me with the relationship I have had with each of you.  I am also grateful to all of those who, either in person or through association, continue working to spread my message and the sharing of my ideals, even without me.  Thankful for the gift of life which is only such if lived in communion with others: it is with this spirit that I have lived out my ministry."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2552">The '''Seleucians''' were an ancient [[Gnostic]] sect who are said to have flourished in [[Galatia]].
 
==History==
They derived their name from a Seleucus, who with a certain Hermias is said to have propounded and taught their beliefs. According to [[Philastrius]] (''Diversarum Hereseon Liber'', LV), the teaching of these beliefs was based on the crudest form of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. While they maintained that God was incorporeal, they asserted that matter was coeternal with Him. They exceeded the usual dualistic tenets in attributing evil to God as well as to matter. In their system the souls of men were not created by God, but were formed from earthly components -fire and air- by angels.
 
[[Christ]], they said, did not sit at the right hand of the Father in [[Heaven]] because (Psalm xviii, 6) "He hath set his tabernacle in the sun" must be interpreted to mean that Christ left His body in the sun. They did not practise [[baptism]], basing their refusal to do so on the words of [[John the Baptist]] (Matthew 3:11): "He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire". By [[hell]] they understood this present world, while [[Resurrection]] they explained as being merely the procreation over death with the expectation of a glorious immortality.
 
The doctrines of Seleucus and his adherents were the source of another series of doctrines taught by some of their disciples who called themselves '''Prolinianites''' or '''Hermeonites'''. These latter rejected the [[dogmas]] of the Resurrection and [[Last Judgment]]. According to Philastrius they 'perverted' (i.e. converted) large numbers.

A great deal of uncertainty exists regarding the history and real cause of the fact that the doctrines of the Seleucians so closely resembled those of [[Hermogenes (philosopher)|Hermogenes]], and because Hermogenes is not mentioned by Philastrius, conclude that these two were one and the same system of belief. This assumption is plausible but there are vital differences between the teaching of Hermogenes and that of the Seleucians as, for example, on the subject of Christ as Creator which, together with the virgin birth, was admitted by Hermogenes. If any weight is to be attached to a method of chronology which seems rather arbitrary, the date assigned by Philastrius to the Seleucians, viz. after the reign of [[Decius]], would exclude the supposition that he confounded them with the followers of Hermogenes.

'''Shotgun email''' refers to an [[email]] requesting information or action that only requires the efforts of one person but is sent to multiple people in an effort to guarantee that at least one person will respond. The shotgun email often results in multiple people responding to something already accomplished and therefore results in a loss of overall productivity. Shotgun emailing is considered poor [[Netiquette|internet etiquette]].

An example would be a person of authority in a business organization sending out an email to five technicians in the [[information technology]] department of his company to let them know his [[computer printer|printer]] is broken. One technician responds with an on-site call and fixes the problem. Later in the day, other technicians follow-up to fix the printer that is already back in order. Shotgun emails can also be request for information or other tasks.

The blind shotgun email occurs when the sender uses the blind co-copy feature of an email program to hide the fact that a shotgun email is in use. This is considered particularly deceitful.

"'''The {{'}}Me{{'}} Decade and the Third Great Awakening'''" is an essay by American author [[Tom Wolfe]], in which Wolfe coined the phrase {{" '}}Me' Decade", a term that became common as a descriptor for the decade of the 1970s. The essay was first published as the [[wikt:cover story|cover story]] in the August 23, 1976 issue of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine&lt;ref name="newyork"/&gt; and later appeared in his collection ''[[Mauve Gloves &amp; Madmen, Clutter &amp; Vine]]''.&lt;ref name="mauve"/&gt;

In one of the essay's most famous passages, exemplifying his style of description, Wolfe called [[Jimmy Carter]] a "[[Missionary Baptists|Missionary]] lectern-pounding Amen ten-finger C-major-chord Sister-Martha-at-the-[[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]]-keyboard loblolly [[wiktionary:backwoods#Adjective|piney-woods]] [[Southern Baptist Convention|Baptist]]."&lt;ref name=mauve /&gt;{{rp|134}}

==Origin of the term {{" '}}Me' Decade"==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = ...The old [[Alchemy|alchemical]] dream was changing base metals into gold. The new alchemical dream is: changing one's personality – remaking, remodeling, elevating, and polishing one's very ''self''... and observing, studying, and doting on it. (Me!)...

}}

The term "'Me' Decade" describes a general new attitude of Americans in the 1970s, in the direction of [[atomism (social)|atomized]] [[individualism]] and away from [[communitarianism]], in clear contrast with social values prevalent in the United States during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="perspectives" /&gt;

Wolfe asserts the disappearance of the socioeconomic class he calls the "[[proletariat]]", in parallel with the concurrent appearance of an American "[[American middle class#Lower middle class|lower middle class]]". He cites the [[Post–World War II economic expansion|economic boom of postwar America]] as affording the average American a new sense of self-determination and [[individuation]] associated with the widespread economic prosperity. Wolfe describes the resulting abandoning of [[Communitarianism|communal]], [[Progressive Era|progressive]], and [[Modern liberalism in the United States#The New Deal|New Deal-style]] politics as "taking the money and running". He traces the preoccupation with [[self]] and [[self-development]] back to the [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] European [[gentry]]. Wolfe states that the "[[chivalry|chivalric]] tradition" and the philosophy behind "the [[finishing school]]" are inherently dedicated to the building and forming of [[personal development|personal character]] and conduct.&lt;ref name="newyork" /&gt;

Wolfe believes that the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and the [[New Left]] school of thought promoted a recovery of the self in a flawed and corrupt America, a philosophy extended in the 1970s with a spreading idea that use of the drug [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], commonly known as "acid", would unveil a [[true self and false self|true and real self]]. He describes the revelatory experience of [[hallucinogen]]s as similar to, even competitive with, [[religious ecstasy]], transforming the religious climate in America. Wolfe chronicles the American periods of [[Christian revival]] known as the First and Second [[Great Awakening]]s, to which he analogizes the 1970s and their dominant social trends. He argues that the "Me" Decade of the 1970s is a "Third Great Awakening".&lt;ref name="newyork" /&gt;

==Criticism==
In his influential work ''[[The Culture of Narcissism]]'', cultural historian [[Christopher Lasch]] states that Wolfe "inadvertedly provides evidence that undermines a religious interpretation of the "conscioussness movement"" and quotes Wolfe as saying "most people, historically, have ''not'' lived their lives as if thinking "I have only one life to live". Instead they lived as if they were living their ancestors' and their offspring's lives".&lt;ref name="Christopher Lasch 1979"&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Lasch|title=The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=7zhc7oT80SQC&amp;pg=PA6|year=1979|publisher=W.W.

'''Thomas Hill Green''' (7 April 1836&amp;nbsp;– 15 March 1882), known as '''T. H. Green''', was an English philosopher, political [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] and [[Temperance movement|temperance]] reformer, and a member of the [[British idealism]] movement. Like all the British idealists, Green was influenced by the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[historicism]] of [[G. W. F. Hegel]]. He was one of the thinkers behind the philosophy of [[social liberalism]].

== Life ==

Green was born at [[Birkin]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England, where his father was rector. On his paternal side, he was descended from [[Oliver Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/history/green-thomas-hill/ Thomas, Geoffrey, "Thomas Hill Green", 1836-1882]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams and R. W. Dyson, ''Fifty Major Political Thinkers'' (2007). p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; His education was conducted entirely at home until, at the age of 14, he entered [[Rugby School|Rugby]], where he remained for five years.

In 1855, he became an undergraduate member of [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and was elected fellow in 1860.  He began a life of teaching (mainly philosophical) in the university – first as college tutor, afterwards, from 1878 until his death, as [[White's Chair of Moral Philosophy|Whyte's Professor of Moral Philosophy]].

The lectures he delivered as professor form the substance of his two most important works, viz., the ''[http://fair-use.org/t-h-green/prolegomena-to-ethics/ Prolegomena to Ethics]'' and the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050827091329/http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/green/obligation.pdf Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation]'', which contain the whole of his positive constructive teaching. These works were not published until after his death, but Green's views were previously known indirectly through the ''Introduction'' to the standard edition of [[David Hume]]'s works by Green and [[Thomas Hodge Grose|T. H. Grose]], fellow of [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College]], in which the doctrine of the "English" or "empirical" philosophy was exhaustively examined.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosophical Works of David Hume'', ed. by T. H. Green and T. H. Grose, 4 vols. (1882–86)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Green sat in the committee which was formed to create an Oxford [[women's college]] "in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations." This resulted in the founding of [[Somerville Hall]] (later Somerville College).

Green was involved in local politics for many years, through the University, temperance societies and the local Oxford Liberal association. During the passage of the [[Second Reform Act]], he campaigned for the franchise to be extended to all men living in boroughs even if they did not own real property. In that sense, Green's position was more radical than that of most other Advanced Liberals, including [[William Ewart Gladstone]].

It was in the context of his Liberal Party activities that in 1881, Green gave what became one of his most famous statements of his liberal political philosophy, the "Lecture on Liberal Legislation and Freedom of Contract".&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/111green.html Hanover Historical Texts Project]&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, he was also lecturing on religion, epistemology, ethics and political philosophy.

Most of his major works were published posthumously, including his lay sermons on ''Faith and The Witness of God'', the essay "On the Different Senses of 'Freedom' as Applied to Will and the Moral Progress of Man", ''Prolegomena to Ethics'', ''Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation'', and the "Lecture on Liberal Legislation and Freedom of Contract".

Green died of [[blood poisoning]] at 45. In addition to friends from his academic life, approximately 2,000 local townspeople attended his funeral.

He helped to found the [[City of Oxford High School for Boys]].

== Thought ==
Hume's [[empiricism]] and biological [[evolution]] (including [[Herbert Spencer]]) were chief features in English thought during the third quarter of the 19th century. Green represents primarily the reaction against such doctrines. Green argued that when these doctrines were carried to their logical conclusion, they not only "rendered all philosophy futile", but were fatal to practical life. By reducing the human mind to a series of unrelated atomic sensations, these related teachings destroyed the possibility of [[knowledge]], he argued. These teachings were especially important for Green to refute because they had underpinned the conception of mind that was held by the nascent science of psychology. Green tried to deflate the pretensions of psychologists who had claimed that their young field would provide a scientific replacement for traditional epistemology and metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Klein, [http://individual.utoronto.ca/alex_klein/Scholarship.htm ''The Rise of Empiricism: William James, Thomas Hill Green, and the Struggle over Psychology''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104065835/http://individual.utoronto.ca/alex_klein/Scholarship.htm |date=4 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green further objected that such empiricists represented a person as a "being who is simply the result of natural forces", and thereby made conduct, or any theory of conduct, meaningless; for life in any human, intelligible sense implies a personal self that (1) knows what to do, and (2) has power to do it. Green was thus driven, not theoretically, but as a practical necessity, to raise again the whole question of humankind in relation to nature. When (he held) we have discovered what a person in themselves are, and what their relation to their environment is, we shall then know their function—what they are fitted to do. In the light of this knowledge, we shall be able to formulate the moral code, which, in turn, will serve as a criterion of actual civic and social institutions. These form, naturally and necessarily, the objective expression of moral ideas, and it is in some civic or social whole that the moral ideal must finally take concrete shape.

===What is man?===
To ask "What is man?" is to ask "What is experience?" for experience means that of which I am conscious. The facts of [[consciousness]] are the only facts that, to begin with, we are justified in asserting to exist. On the other hand, they are valid evidence for whatever is necessary to their own explanation, i.e. for whatever is logically involved in them. Now the most striking characteristic of humans, that in fact which marks them specially, as contrasted with other animals, is self-consciousness.  The simplest mental act into which we can analyse the operations of the human mind—the act of sense-perception—is never merely a change, physical or psychical, but is the consciousness of a change.

Human experience consists, not of processes in an animal organism, but of these processes recognised as such.  That which we perceive is from the outset an apprehended fact—that is to say, it cannot be analysed into isolated elements (so-called sensations) which, as such, are not constituents of consciousness at all, but exist from the first as a synthesis of relations in a consciousness which keeps distinct the "self" and the various elements of the "object," though holding all together in the unity of the act of perception.  In other words, the whole mental structure we call knowledge consists, in its simplest equally with its most complex constituents, of the "work of the mind." [[John Locke|Locke]] and Hume held that the work of the mind was ''eo ipso'' [by that very act] unreal because it was "made by" humans and not "given to" humans. It thus represented a subjective creation, not an objective fact. But this consequence follows only upon the assumption that the work of the mind is arbitrary, an assumption shown to be unjustified by the results of exact science, with the distinction, universally recognised, which such science draws between truth and falsehood, between the real and "mere ideas." This (obviously valid) distinction logically involves the consequence that the object, or content, of knowledge, viz., reality, is an intelligible ideal reality, a system of thought relations, a spiritual cosmos. How is the existence of this ideal whole to be accounted for? Only by the existence of some "principle which renders all relations possible and is itself determined by none of them"; an eternal self-consciousness which knows in whole what we know in part. To God the world is, to humans the world becomes. Human experience is God gradually made manifest.

===Moral philosophy===
Carrying on the same method into the area of [[moral philosophy]], Green argued that ethics applies to the conditions of social life—that investigation into human nature which metaphysics began. The faculty employed in this further investigation is no "separate moral faculty," but that same reason which is the source of all our knowledge – ethical and other.

Self-reflection gradually reveals to us human capacity, human function, with, consequently, human responsibility. It brings out into clear consciousness certain potentialities in the realisation of which human's true good must consist. As the result of this analysis, combined with an investigation into the surroundings humans live in, a "content"—a moral code—becomes gradually evolved. Personal good is perceived to be realisable only by making real and actual the conceptions thus arrived at. So long as these remain potential or ideal, they form the motive of action; motive consisting always in the idea of some "end" or "good" that humans present to themselves as an end in the attainment of which he would be satisfied; that is, in the realisation of which he would find his true self.

The determination to realise the self in some definite way constitutes an "act of will," which, as thus constituted, is neither arbitrary nor externally determined. For the motive which may be said to be its cause lies in the person himself, and the identification of the self with such a motive is a self-determination, which is at once both rational and free. The "freedom of man" is constituted, not by a supposed ability to do anything he may choose, but in the power to identify himself with that true good that reason reveals to him as his true good.

This good consists in the realisation of personal character; hence the final good, i.e. the moral ideal, as a whole, can be realised only in some society of persons who, while remaining ends to themselves in the sense that their individuality is not lost but rendered more perfect, find this perfection attainable only when the separate individualities are integrated as part of a social whole.

Society is as necessary to form persons as persons are to constitute society.  Social union is the indispensable condition of the development of the special capacities of its individual members.  Human self-perfection cannot be gained in isolation; it is attainable only in inter-relation with fellow-citizens in the social community.

The law of our being, so revealed, involves in its turn civic or political [[Duty|duties]]. Moral goodness cannot be limited to, still less constituted by, the cultivation of self-regarding virtues, but consists in the attempt to realise in practice that moral ideal that self-analysis has revealed to us as our ideal. From this fact arises the ground of political obligation, because the institutions of political or civic life are the concrete embodiment of moral ideas in terms of our day and generation. But, since society exists only for the proper development of Persons, we have a criterion by which to test these institutions—namely, do they, or do they not, contribute to the development of moral character in the individual citizens?

It is obvious that the final moral ideal is not realised in any body of civic institutions actually existing, but the same analysis that demonstrates this deficiency points out the direction that a true development will take.

Hence arises the conception of rights and duties that should be maintained by law, as opposed to those actually maintained; with the further consequence that it may become occasionally a moral duty to rebel against the state in the interest of the state itself—that is, in order better to subserve that end or function that constitutes the ''raison d'être'' of the state.  There exists a "general will" that is a desire for a common good that cannot be easily reconciled as there is an antagonism between the "common good" and the "private good": such as: "... interest in the common good, in some of its various forms, is necessary to produce that good, and to neutralise or render useful other desires and interests". Its basis is can be conceived as coercive authority imposed upon the citizens from without or it can be seen as a necessary restriction of individual liberty in light of a social contract, but this consists in the spiritual recognition or [[metaphysics]], on the part of the citizens, of what constitutes their true nature, some conceptions and complicating factors are elaborating questions concerning: "Will, not force, is the basis of the state.", "Citizen Rights Against the State", "Private Rights. The Right to Life and Liberty", "The Right of the State Over the Individual in War", "The Right of the State to Punish",  "The Right of the State to Promote Morality ",  "The Right of the State in Regard to Property", and "The Right of the State in Regard to the Family".

===Philosophy of state action===
Green believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences.  But the state must be careful when deciding which liberties to curtail and in which ways to curtail them. Over-enthusiastic or clumsy state intervention could easily close down opportunities for conscientious action thereby stifling the moral development of the individual. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual. Even when such a hazard had been identified, Green tended to favour action by the affected community itself rather than national state action itself — local councils and municipal authorities tended to produce measures that were more imaginative and better suited to the daily reality of a social problem. Hence he favoured the "local option" where local people decided on the issuing of liquor licences in their area, through their town councils.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, P. P., "T. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation", ''History of Political Thought'', 6 (1985), 517–50. Reprinted in A. Vincent, ed., ''The Philosophy of T. H. Green'' (Aldershot: Gower, 1986), pp. 76–103&lt;/ref&gt;

Green stressed the need for specific solutions to be tailored to fit specific problems.  He stressed that there are no eternal solutions, no timeless division of responsibilities between national and local governmental units. The distribution of responsibilities should be guided by the imperative to enable as many individuals as possible to exercise their conscientious wills in particular contingent circumstances, as only in this way was it possible to foster individual self-realisation in the long-run.  Deciding on the distribution of responsibilities was more a matter for practical politics than for ethical or political philosophy. Experience may show that the local and municipal levels are unable to control the harmful influences of, say, the brewery industry. When it did show this, the national state should take responsibility for this area of public policy.

Green argued that the ultimate power to decide on the allocation of such tasks should rest with the national state (in Britain, for instance, embodied in Parliament). The national state itself is legitimate for Green to the extent that it upholds a system of rights and obligations that is most likely to foster individual self-realisation. Yet, the most appropriate structure of this system is determined neither by purely political calculation nor by philosophical speculation. It is more accurate to say that it arose from the underlying conceptual and normative structure of one's particular society.

===Influence of Green's thought===
Green's teaching was, directly and indirectly, the most potent philosophical influence in England during the last quarter of the 19th century, while his enthusiasm for a common [[citizenship]], and his personal example in practical municipal life, inspired much of the effort made in the years succeeding his death to bring the universities more into touch with the people, and to break down the rigour of class distinctions. His ideas spread to the [[University of St. Andrews]] through the influence of Prof. [[David George Ritchie]], a former student of his, who eventually helped found the [[Aristotelian Society]]. [[John Dewey]] wrote a number of early essays on Green's thought, including ''Self-Realization as the Moral Ideal''.

Green was directly cited by many [[social liberal]] politicians, such as [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] and [[H. H. Asquith]], as an influence on their thought. It is no coincidence that these politicians were educated at Balliol College, Oxford. [[Roy Hattersley]] called for Green's work to be applied to the problems of 21st century Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200312010041 New Statesman – Forgotten favourites – Politics of aspiration. T H Green was the first philosopher of social justice. Today's cabinet ministers would do well to read him, writes Roy Hattersley]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works and commentary ==
Green's most important treatise—the ''[http://fair-use.org/t-h-green/prolegomena-to-ethics/ Prolegomena to Ethics]'', practically complete in manuscript at his death—was published in the year following, under the editorship of [[Andrew Cecil Bradley|A. C. Bradley]] (4th ed., 1899). Shortly afterwards, [[Richard Lewis Nettleship|R. L. Nettleship]]'s standard edition of his ''Works'' (exclusive of the ''Prolegomena'') appeared in three volumes:

# Reprints of Green's criticism of Hume, Spencer, [[G. H. Lewes]]
# Lectures on Kant, on Logic, on the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050827091329/http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ugcm/3ll3/green/obligation.pdf Principles of Political Obligation]''
# ''Miscellanies'', preceded by a full ''Memoir by the Editor''.

All three volumes are available for download at [https://archive.org/search.php?query=thomas%20hill%20green Internet Archive]

The ''Principles of Political Obligation'' was afterwards published in separate form. A criticism of Neo-Hegelianism will be found in [[Andrew Seth]] ([[Pringle Pattison]]), [https://archive.org/details/hegelianismandp00sethuoft ''Hegelianism and Personality''] (1887).

'''Thought identification''' refers to the empirically verified use of technology to, in some sense, read people's [[mind]]s. Advances in research have made this possible by using [[Neuroimaging|human neuroimaging]] to decode a person's conscious experience based on non-invasive measurements of an individual's brain activity.&lt;ref name="Decoding mental states"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haynes|first1=John-Dylan|last2=Geraint|first2=Rees|title=Decoding mental states from brain activity in humans|url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v7/n7/full/nrn1931.html|website=Nature Reviews|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of [[neuropsychology]] Barbara Sahakian qualifies, "A lot of neuroscientists in the field are very cautious and say we can't talk about reading individuals' minds, and right now that is very true, but we're moving ahead so rapidly, it's not going to be that long before we will be able to tell whether someone's making up a story, or whether someone intended to do a crime with a certain degree of certainty."&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;''The Guardian'', "[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/feb/09/neuroscience.ethicsofscience The brain scan that can read people's intentions]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:MRI-Philips.JPG|thumb|MRI scanner that could be used for Thought Identification]]
Psychologist [[John-Dylan Haynes]] experienced breakthroughs in brain imaging research in 2006 by using [[fMRI]]. This research included new findings on visual object recognition, tracking dynamic mental processes, [[Lie detection|lie detecting]], and decoding unconscious processing. The combination of these four discoveries revealed such a significant amount of information about an individual's thoughts that Haynes termed it "brain reading".&lt;ref name="Decoding mental states" /&gt;

The fMRI has allowed research to expand by significant amounts because it can track the activity in an individual's brain by measuring the brain's blood flow. It is currently thought to be the best method for measuring brain activity, which is why it has been used in multiple research experiments in order to improve the understanding of how doctors and psychologists can identify thoughts.&lt;ref name="fMRI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saenz|first1=Aaron|title=fMRI Reads the Images in Your Brain – We Know What You’re Looking At|url=http://singularityhub.com/2010/03/17/fmri-reads-the-images-in-your-brain-we-know-what-youre-looking-at-video/|website=SingularityHUB|publisher=Singularity University|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "thought identification" started being used in 2009 after neuroscientist [[Marcel Just]] coined it in a [[60 Minutes]] interview. His reasoning for this term pertains to his overall goal of his research "to see if they could identify exactly what happens in the brain when people think specific thoughts".&lt;ref name="CBS 60 Minutes"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Technology May Soon "Read" Your Mind|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-technology-may-soon-read-your-mind/|website=CBS News|publisher=CBS|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Identifying thoughts===
[[File:Screw Driver display.jpg|thumb|300px|right|When humans think of an object, such as a screwdriver, many different areas of the brain activate]]
When humans think of an object, such as a screwdriver, many different areas of the brain activate. Marcel Just and his colleague, Tom Mitchell, have used fMRI brain scans to teach a computer to identify the various parts of the brain associated with specific thoughts.&lt;ref name=SixtyMinutes&gt;''60 Minutes'' "[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-10131643-76.html Technology that can read your mind]"&lt;/ref&gt;

This technology also yielded a discovery: similar thoughts in different human brains are surprisingly similar neurologically. To illustrate this, Just and Mitchell used their computer to predict, based on nothing but fMRI data, which of several images a volunteer was thinking about. The computer was 100% accurate, but so far the machine is only distinguishing between 10 images.&lt;ref name=SixtyMinutes/&gt;

John-Dylan Haynes states that fMRI can also be used to identify recognition in the brain. He provides the example of a criminal being interrogated about whether he recognizes the scene of the crime or murder weapons.&lt;ref name=SixtyMinutes/&gt; Just and Mitchell also claim they are beginning to be able to identify kindness, hypocrisy, and love in the brain.&lt;ref name=SixtyMinutes/&gt; In 2008 [[IBM]] applied for a patent on how to extract mental images of human faces from the human brain. It uses a feedback loop based on brain measurements of the fusiform gyrus area in the brain which activates proportionate with degree of facial recognition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20100049076.pdf IBM Patent Application: Retrieving mental images of faces from the human brain]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a team led by Shinji Nishimoto used only brain recordings to partially reconstruct what volunteers were seeing. The researchers applied a new model, about how moving object information is processed in human brains, while volunteers watched clips from several videos. An algorithm searched through thousands of hours of external YouTube video footage (none of the videos were the same as the ones the volunteers watched) to select the clips that were most similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Shinji|last1=Nishimoto|first2=An T.|last2=Vu|first3=Thomas|last3=Naselaris|first4=Yuval|last4=Benjamini|first5=Bin|last5=Yu|author5-link=Bin Yu|first6=Jack L.|last6=Gallant|title=Reconstructing Visual Experiences from Brain Activity Evoked by Natural Movies|journal=[[Current Biology]]|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.031|volume=21|issue=19|year=2011|pages=1641–1646|pmid=21945275|pmc=3326357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2011/09/22/breakthrough-could-enable-others-to-watch-your-dreams-and-memories-video/Scientific American Blog, Breakthrough Could Enable Others to Watch Your Dreams and Memories &amp;#91;Video&amp;#93;, Philip Yam]&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors have uploaded demos comparing the watched and the computer-estimated videos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMA23JJ1M1o Nishimoto et al. uploaded video, "Nishimoto.etal.2011.3Subjects.mpeg" on Youtube]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predicting intentions===
{{see also|Neuroscience of free will|Neuroscience of free will#Criticisms}}
Some researchers in 2008 were able to predict, with 60% accuracy, whether a subject was going to push a button with their left or right hand. This is notable, not just because the accuracy is better than chance, but also because the scientists were able to make these predictions up to 10 seconds before the subject acted – well before the subject felt they had decided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

John Dylan-Haynes has also demonstrated that fMRI can be used to identify whether a volunteer is about to add or subtract two numbers in their head.&lt;ref name=SixtyMinutes/&gt;

====Reading thoughts before they are voiced====
December 16, 2015, a study conducted by Toshimasa Yamazaki at [[Kyushu Institute of Technology]] found that during a [[rock-paper-scissors]] game a computer was able to determine the choice made by the subjects before they moved their hand. An [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] was used to measure activity in the [[Broca's area]] to ''see'' the words two seconds before the words were uttered.&lt;ref name="IEICE-Yamazaki1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ieice.org/ken/paper/gbdh/eng/|title=Silent Speech BCI - An investigation for practical problems|date = 2015-12-16|accessdate=2016-01-17|publisher=IEICE Technical Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discovery-Yamazaki1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/mind-reading-computer-knows-what-youre-about-to-say-160107.htm|first1=Alyssa|last1= Danigelis|title=Mind-Reading Computer Knows What You're About to Say|date = 2016-01-07|accessdate=2016-01-17|publisher=Discovery News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nishinippon-Yamazaki1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nishinippon.co.jp/nnp/national/article/216215|title=頭の中の言葉　解読　障害者と意思疎通、ロボット操作も　九工大・山崎教授ら|language = Japanese|date = 2016-01-04|accessdate=2016-01-17|publisher=[[Nishinippon Shimbun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain as input device===
[[File:EPOC IGN.jpg|thumb|right|140px|The [[Emotiv Systems#Emotiv Epoc|Emotiv Epoc]] is one way that users can give commands to devices using only thoughts]]
[[Emotiv Systems]], an Australian electronics company, has demonstrated [[Emotiv Systems#Emotiv Epoc|a headset]] that can be trained to recognize a user's thought patterns for different commands. Tan Le demonstrated the headset's ability to manipulate virtual objects on screen, and discussed various future applications for such [[Comparison of consumer brain–computer interfaces|brain-computer interface devices]], from  powering wheel chairs to replacing the mouse and keyboard.&lt;ref name=TedWaves&gt;Tan Le: [http://www.ted.com/talks/tan_le_a_headset_that_reads_your_brainwaves.html A headset that reads your brainwaves]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decoding brain activity to reconstruct words===
On 31 January 2012 Brian Pasley and colleagues of University of California Berkeley published their paper in [[PLoS Biology]] wherein subjects' internal neural processing of auditory information was decoded and reconstructed as sound on computer by gathering and analyzing electrical signals directly from subjects' brains.&lt;ref name= "Pasley"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pasley | first1 = BN | last2 = David | first2 = SV | last3 = Mesgarani | first3 = N | last4 = Flinker | first4 = A | last5 = Shamma | first5 = SA | display-authors = 5 | last6 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Reconstructing Speech from Human Auditory Cortex | url = | journal = PLoS Biol | volume = 10 | issue = 1| page = e1001251 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research team conducted their studies on the superior temporal gyrus, a region of the brain that is involved in higher order neural processing to make semantic sense from auditory information.&lt;ref name= "BBC auditorydecoding"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16811042] Science decodes 'internal voices' BBC News 31 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The research team used a computer model to analyze various parts of the brain that might be involved in neural firing while processing auditory signals. Using the computational model, scientists were able to identify the brain activity involved in processing auditory information when subjects were presented with recording of individual words.&lt;ref name= "NHS_inner_voice_unlocked"&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/news/2012/02February/Pages/mind-reading-telephathy-inner-voice.aspx] Secrets of the inner voice unlocked 1 Feb 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the computer model of auditory information processing was used to reconstruct some of the words back into sound based on the neural processing of the subjects. However the reconstructed sounds were not of good quality and could be recognized only when the audio wave patterns of the reconstructed sound were visually matched with the audio wave patterns of the original sound that was presented to the subjects.&lt;ref name="NHS_inner_voice_unlocked"/&gt; However this research marks a direction towards more precise identification of neural activity in cognition.

=== Recognizing brain waves in security ===
In 2013 a project led by University of California Berkeley professor John Chuang published findings on the feasibility of brainwave-based computer authentication as a substitute for passwords. Improvements in the use of biometrics for computer authentication has continually improved since the 1980s, but this research team was looking for a method faster and less intrusive than today's retina scans, fingerprinting, and voice recognition. The technology chosen to improve security measures is an [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG), or brainwave measurer, to improve passwords into "pass thoughts." Using this method Chuang and his team were able to customize tasks and their authentication thresholds to the point where they were able to reduce error rates under 1%, significantly better than other recent methods. In order to better attract users to this new form of security the team is still researching mental tasks that are enjoyable for the user to perform while having their brainwaves identified. In the future this method could be as cheap, accessible, and straightforward as thought itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEW RESEARCH: COMPUTERS THAT CAN IDENTIFY YOU BY YOUR THOUGHTS|url=http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/newsandevents/news/20130403brainwaveauthentication|website=UC Berkeley School of Information|publisher=UC Berkeley|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical issues==
With [[Neuroimaging|brain scanning]] technology becoming increasingly accurate, experts predict important debates over how and when it should be used. One potential area of application is criminal law. Haynes states that simply refusing to use brain scans on suspects also prevents the wrongly accused from proving their innocence.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; It has been argued that allowing brain scans in the United States would violate the [[5th Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th Amendment's]] right to not self incriminate. One of thousands of important questions is whether brain imaging is like testimony, or instead like DNA, blood, or semen. Paul Root Wolpe, director of the Center for Ethics at Emory University in Atlanta predicts that this question will be decided by a Supreme Court case.&lt;ref name="CBS 60 Minutes"/&gt;

In other countries outside the United States, thought Identification has already been used in criminal law. In 2008 an Indian woman was convicted of murder after an EEG of her brain allegedly revealed that she was familiar with the circumstances surrounding the poisoning of her ex-fiancé.&lt;ref name="CBS 60 Minutes"/&gt; Some neuroscientists and legal scholars doubt the validity of using thought identification as a whole for anything past research on the nature of deception and the brain.&lt;ref name=Lying&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stix|first1=Gary|title=Can fMRI Really Tell If You're Lying?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-lie-detector/?page=1|website=Scientific American|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future research ==
Experts are unsure of how far thought identification can expand, but Marcel Just believed in 2014 that in 3–5 years there will be a machine that is able to read complex thoughts such as 'I hate so-and-so'.&lt;ref name="CBS 60 Minutes"/&gt;

Donald Marks, founder and chief science officer of MMT, is working on playing back thoughts individuals have after they have already been recorded.&lt;ref name="Mind Reader"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cuthbertson|first1=Anthony|title=Mind Reader: Meet The Man Who Records and Stores Your Thoughts, Dreams and Memories|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/mind-reader-meet-man-who-records-stores-your-thoughts-dreams-memories-1463094|website=International Business Times|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the University of California Berkeley have already been successful in forming, erasing, and reactivating memories in rats. Marks says they are working on applying the same techniques to humans. This discovery could be monumental for war veterans who suffer from [[posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]].&lt;ref name="Mind Reader" /&gt;

Further research is also being done in analyzing brain activity during video games to detect criminals, [[neuromarketing]], and using brain scans in government security checks.&lt;ref name="fMRI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS 60 Minutes" /&gt;

The '''University of Illinois clout scandal''' resulted from a series of articles in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' which reported that some applicants to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC) "received [[social influence|special consideration]]" for acceptance between 2005 and 2009, despite having sub-par qualifications.  The series began on May 29, 2009.  An investigatory committee appointed by [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois governor]] [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] was formed a few weeks later.  The controversy led to the resignation of [[B. Joseph White]], president of the University of Illinois, who oversaw the three campuses in the University system, and [[Richard Herman]], chancellor of UIUC.  The scandal eventually spread to include evidence of graft by members of the Board of Trustees, resulting in the resignation of seven of the nine members.

==Initial findings==
On May 29, 2009, the ''Chicago Tribune'' published "Clout Goes to College," an article detailing preferential consideration to applicants with connections to politicians and university trustees.  According to the article, some students were being admitted despite having sub-par qualifications. The investigation revealed that approximately 800 students over five years landed on the so-called "clout list" and, though not all were unworthy, the admission rate of these students was eight percentage points higher than the school average.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; One student was accepted into the graduate business school after having been rejected three times. Prior to acceptance, university officials did not confirm whether he had a [[bachelor's degree]] from an accredited university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200907230912.htm|title=Varsity staff testify in scam involving Indian-American|publisher=[[Press Trust of India]] (''[[The Hindu]]'')|date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=July 25, 2009|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Indo-American-Univ-top-trustee-questioned-in-admission-scandal/492651|title=Indo-American Univ top trustee questioned in admission scandal|work=The Indian Express  |date=July 22, 2009|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A panel appointed by the governor to investigate the scandal found that the Board of Trustees had acted improperly and exerted continuing pressure on University officials.  The panel "put much of the blame on Richard Herman, chancellor of the university's flagship campus in Urbana-Champaign, saying his conduct was inconsistent with the university's 'principles of ethical conduct and fair dealing.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-08-07-illinois-admissions_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Illinois panel: University trustees in admissions scandal should resign | date=August 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the thousands of pages of e-mails and other documents released by the university in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request involved communication with Herman.  The panel also found fault with University president [[B. Joseph White]].  Upon first release, the most notable student to receive special consideration was a relative of [[Tony Rezko]], who was convicted on sixteen charges of fraud and bribery and was a political contributor to then-governor [[Rod Blagojevich]]. In one email, White wrote to Urbana chancellor Herman that Blagojevich "has expressed his support, and would like to see admitted" two applicants, including Rezko's relative. The university had rejected the application of Rezko's relative earlier in the day, but later reversed the decision despite poor [[ACT (test)|ACT]] scores.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-uofi-clout,0,6326007.story|title=Clout Goes to College|work=Chicago Tribune|date=May 29, 2009|accessdate=July 17, 2009 | first1=Jodi S. |

===Students who benefited from clout===
Most of the students who benefited from political connections came from elite and affluent high schools. Among the least connected were students who attended [[Chicago Public Schools]]. Wealthier schools already had an advantage due to families who had political connections to elected officials and university trustees. High schools that had the most applicants on the clout list included [[Highland Park High School (Highland Park, Illinois)|Highland Park High School]], [[Deerfield High School (Illinois)|Deerfield High School]], [[New Trier High School]], [[Glenbrook North High School]], [[Glenbrook South High School]], [[Loyola Academy]], [[St. Ignatius College Preparatory School]], [[Fenwick High School (Oak Park, Illinois)|Fenwick High School]], [[Benet Academy]], [[Hinsdale Central High School]], [[Carl Sandburg High School]], and [[York Community High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tara |last=Malone |author2=Darnell Little |author3=Jodi S.

==Controversy and resignations with Board of Trustees==
The University is overseen by a Board of Trustees consisting of nine members appointed by the governor for six-year terms, as well as three students. The Board oversees the operation of the three campuses and is intended to be a watchdog of and advocate for the University. Trustee Larry Eppley, board chairman from 2002-2008, was the first to resign, with a higher number of admissions request than any other member.&lt;ref name="touch.chicagotribune.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://touch.chicagotribune.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-48337964/|title=University of Illinois trustee resigns over admissions scandal|last=|first=|date=|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next chairman of the board, Niranjan Shah, announced his resignation from the board thereafter amid allegations that he had meddled with applications and had pressured the university to hire one of his relatives.  Trustees Ed McMillan, David Doris, Robert Vickrey, Devon Bruce, and Kenneth Schmidt followed.  Only James Montgomery and Francis Carroll held out.&lt;ref name="touch.chicagotribune.com"/&gt;

==University and state response==
White stated on May 29, 2009 that, "There's no secret clout list. The Tribune invented the term 'secret clout list'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silverberg|first=Melissa|url=http://www.dailyillini.com/news/campus/2009/05/29/white-denies-tribunes-corruption-reports-student-trustee-some-will-need-to-go|title=White denies Tribune's corruption reports; student trustee: some "will need to go down"|work=[[The Daily Illini]]|date=May 29, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; White stated the following day, "To the extent some problems were pointed out, we can and will correct them."

The [[Southern Illinois University School of Law]] on the [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|Carbondale campus]] revealed that Blagojevich submitted letters of recommendation for two students, but neither was admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wood |first=Paul |url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2009/07/07/ui_chancellor_says_ex-trustee_chairman_pressured_him |title=UI chancellor says ex-trustee chairman pressured him |work=The News-Gazette |date=July 7, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710175230/http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2009/07/07/ui_chancellor_says_ex-trustee_chairman_pressured_him |archivedate=July 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commission findings==
The commission led by Mikva found that trustees, deans, White, and Herman, all contributed to "substantial...admission-related abuses and irregularities."

The panel's recommendation include, but are not limited to:
*Calling "on all members of the Board of Trustees to voluntarily submit their resignations and thereby permit the Governor to determine which Trustees should be reappointed."
*Urging the Governor to "charge the new Board with conducting a thorough and expeditious review of the University President, the UIUC Chancellor, and other University administrators, with respect to the information set forth in" the Commission's Report.
*Recommending creation of a "firewall" that isolates school officials not involved with the admissions process.
*Urging input on the process to elect board of trustees members from other interested parties, especially the alumni groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admissionsreview.illinois.gov/documents/FinalReport.pdf|title=Report &amp; Recommendations|publisher=State of Illinois Admissions Review Commission|date=August 7, 2009|accessdate=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-08-07-illinois-admissions_N.htm|title=Illinois panel: University trustees in admissions scandal should resign|publisher=Associated Press (''[[USA Today]]'')|date=August 7, 2009|accessdate=October 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==White's resignation==
[[File:Bernard Joseph White.jpg|thumb|right]]
On October 3, 2009, the University Board of Trustees accepted the resignation of President White ([[University of Illinois clout scandal#University and state response|see related section]]) as of the end of the year.  White timed his resignation to free the University from paying a $475,000 bonus that would have been due to him in February.  Christopher Kennedy, who had taken over as Board chairman, said of White, "He is a class act and I think his decision today will contribute to his reputation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-u-of-i-white-resign-24-sep24,0,161068.story | work=Chicago Tribune | first1=Jodi S. | last1=Cohen | first2=Stacy | last2=St. Clair | first3=Tara | last3=Malone | title=University of Illinois President B. Joseph White resigns}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In accepting White's resignation, the Board named as a temporary replacement Stanley Ikenberry. Ikenberry had been president at the university from 1979 through 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/10/03/us/AP-US-Illinois-Admissions-President.html?_r=1 "U of Ill. Trustees OK President's Resignation"] [[Associated Press]] via [[The New York Times]], October 3, 2009. Retrieved 10/3/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

At White's final Board of Trustees meeting on November 11, 2009, he shared a September 24, 2009 letter from Judge [[Abner J. Mikva]] stating, "I was sad to learn that you are resigning as President of the University."  Judge Mikva added, "Everything that came out during the investigation by the University of Illinois Admissions Review Commission that I headed indicated that you always had the best interests of the University as the basis for your actions."  He concluded, "You are a person of great integrity and worthy of great respect."  On January 21, 2010, the Board of Trustees appointed White President Emeritus of the University of Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uillinois.edu/trustees/…/003a%20jan%20President%20Emeritus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  White also continued to assist the University's "Brilliant Futures" fundraising campaign.  More than $1.71 billion of the campaign's $2.25 billion goal had been raised under White's leadership at the time of his resignation.  White also retained his faculty position at the University.

The University of Illinois Board of Trustees then named Michael J. Hogan, formerly the president of the University of Connecticut, to succeed Ikenberry and become the permanent president of the University of Illinois. Hogan later resigned on March 23, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-23/news/ct-met-u-of-i-president-20120323_1_admissions-scandal-chairman-christopher-kennedy-urbana-champaign-and-springfield-campuses|title=University of Illinois President Michael Hogan resigns|last=Cohen|first=Jodi S.|date=March 23, 2012|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...after months of turmoil, a faculty mutiny and a scandal in the president's office..." having lasted 20 months in the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-22/news/chi-u-of-i-president-resigns-20120322_1_senator-in-anonymous-emails-faculty-illinois-president-michael-hogan | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Embattled U. of I. president resigns | date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University then said veteran administrator Bob Easter would take over the presidency.

It was originally written as articles in Dutch for a virtual journal,&lt;ref&gt;[https://thecorrespondent.com/utopia-for-realists/ This book originated on The Correspondent]&lt;/ref&gt; and since compiled and translated into several languages. It offers a [[Critical theory|critical]] proposal that it claims is a practical approach to [[Utopian socialism|reconstructing modern society]] to promote  a more productive and equitable life based an three core ideas:
* a universal and unconditional [[basic income]] paid to [[World population|everybody]]
* a short  [[Work week|working week]] of [[Working time|fifteen-hours]]
* [[open border]]s worldwide with the free exchange of citizens between all nations

==Rationale==
As a result of the advance of [[international trade]] and [[economic science]] in recent decades, globalization has radically transformed the traditional social and economic order from smaller, connected nations to a new [[world economy]] which, while already demonstrably capable of  rescuing  millions of people from poverty, could be extended to the entire human race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Forum_IncGrwth_2017.pdf World Economic Forum Growth Development Index 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the new global system unfairly compensates a [[G20|few rich countries]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/eco/growth/2501905.pdf OECD:Trade Between Developed And Developing Countries': The Decade Ahead]&lt;/ref&gt;  and, with the progressive substitution of [[human capital]]  with [[automation]] and [[robotics]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/01/23/robotics-and-automation-employment-and-aging-baby-boomers/ Robotics and automation, employment, and aging Baby Boomers]&lt;/ref&gt; has also generated an increase in inequality, both between the  [[capitalism|investment community]] and its [[workforce]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epi.org/publication/the-decline-in-labors-share-of-corporate-income-since-2000-means-535-billion-less-for-workers/ EconomicPolicy Institute, 2015:The decline in labor’s share of corporate income]&lt;/ref&gt; within the G20 nations as well as between [[developed country|developed countries]]  and their [[Developing country|developing neighbours]].

==Justification==
Each idea is [[critical theory|supported]] by multiple academic studies and anecdotal evidence including numerous success stories. 
For example, it quotes  
* Richard Nixon's 1968 plan for a basic income for Americans&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/05/richard-nixon-ubi-basic-income-welfare/ Jacobin:Nixon’s Basic Income Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Canada|Federal]] project in city of [[Dauphin, Manitoba]] once eradicated poverty&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/12/23/mincome-in-dauphin-manitoba_n_6335682.html Huffington Post;A Canadian City Once Eliminated Poverty And Nearly Everyone Forgot About It]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The perceived success of the [[Schengen Agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://theconversation.com/business-will-suffer-if-border-crossings-between-european-neighbours-are-shut-47022 The Conversation (website): Business will suffer if border crossings between European neighbours are shut]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

Bregman points out that many imperatives of modern law were once highly controversial proposals, perhaps even abhorrent innovations: 
* [[Abolition of slavery timeline|Abolition of slavery]] 
* [[Women's rights|Emancipation of women]]
* [[LGBT rights by country or territory|Decriminalization of homosexuality]]

The author finally tries to provide a critical balance between [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals of caring and sharing, the [[Conservatism|conservative]] impetus of directive leadership, and [[Liberalism|liberal]] concepts of equality and freedom. He claims there are proven solutions waiting to be implemented, lacking only political courage and financial backing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2483">{{For|the place in Tolkien's legendarium|Númenor}}
'''Westernesse''' is a fictional kingdom in the [[Middle English]] [[medieval romance|romance]] of ''[[King Horn]]''. It has been associated with various regions in the [[British Isles]], among which are [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] district in [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=696}} cites ''Cambridge Hist. of Eng Lit.'', i. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether or not Westernesse should be identified with one or more real-world locations remains, however, a point of dispute, since the narrative contains little geographic detail, and only vaguely echoes historical events.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In ''King Horn'', Westernesse can be reached by sea, and is ruled by King Almair. The throne eventually passes to Arnoldin, who is a loyal companion of the narrative's hero, Horn.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=696–697}}

==Tolkien and Westernesse==
Many people today know 'Westernesse' as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s translation of [[Númenor]], the name which he gave to one of the realms in his fictional world of [[Middle-earth]]. Tolkien, who studied Middle English texts professionally, indicated in one of his letters that he had derived his translation from the name as it occurred in ''King Horn'':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tolkien|1981|p=361}}, letter 276 (12th September 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|I have often used ''Westernesse'' as a translation. This is derived from rare Middle English ''Westernesse'' (known to me only in MS. C of ''King Horn'') where the meaning is vague, but may be taken to mean 'Western lands' as distinct from the East inhabited by the Paynim and Saracens.}}

The '''Wild Salmon Center''' (WSC) is an international conservation organization that works to protect wild [[salmon]], [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]], [[char]], [[trout]] and the [[ecosystems]] on which these species depend.&lt;ref&gt;Chivers, CJ. The New York Times. "Salmon Find a Surprising..." October 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Headquartered in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], United States, the WSC works with communities, businesses, governments, and other non-profits to protect and preserve healthy salmon ecosystems in the North Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;"About Us" http://www.wildsalmoncenter.org/about/index.php accessed on: 05/05/11&lt;/ref&gt;  WSC programs range in location from Russia, Japan, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, and California.

==Background==
The WSC was founded as a non-profit by Pete Soverel and Tom Pero in 1992, and was run entirely by volunteers during its first five years.  Originally the WSC received funding for research and conservation through organizing angling trips to the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East. These expeditions were a joint venture between the WSC and [[Moscow State University]].  In 1998, WSC hired Guido Rahr as Executive Director, formerly with the conservation organization Oregon Trout, where he developed an approach to salmon conservation that focused on proactive protection of the strongest remaining populations (stronghold strategy).  The organization expanded rapidly between 1999 and 2010.  A new organization called The Conservation Angler was created in 2003 to take over the [[ecotourism]] programs, allowing the WSC to focus solely on science and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford: Graduate School of Business. "The Wild Salmon Center" May 28, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the WSC programs, State of the Salmon, a science-based program created in 2003 in collaboration with [[Ecotrust]], used data to track the health and trends of wild salmon populations.  This data was then analyzed, and used to inform salmon management and conservation throughout the [[Pacific Rim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stateofthesalmon.org/ State of the Salmon]. accessed on: 05/15/2011&lt;/ref&gt; While State of the Salmon has concluded, sustainable fisheries work continues with a new organization, [[Ocean Outcomes]], which was incubated and launched by Wild Salmon Center in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://wildsalmoncenter.org/2015/02/10/ocean-outcomes/&lt;/ref&gt; Ocean Outcomes is a global fishery improvement organization targeting high risk fisheries - the fisheries that face the biggest conservation challenges and have the most to gain from improvements. O2 works hand-in-hand with commercial fisheries and local communities to improve the sustainability of global fisheries.

==Stronghold Strategy==
Adopted in 1999, the WSC has been focused on a proactive "salmon stronghold" conservation strategy as a regional and international approach to salmon conservation.&lt;ref&gt;The Oregonian. '[http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/wild_salmon_center_wants_to_di.htm Wild Salmon Center wants to Redirect...]" September 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Salmon strongholds refer to river ecosystems that contain the most abundant and [[biologically diverse]] populations of wild salmon. Select areas on the [[Kamchatka]] Peninsula, Sakhalin Island, and the [[Russian Far East]] mainland, as well as key watersheds in the lower 48 US States, British Columbia, [[Bristol Bay]] and much of [[Alaska]] are considered salmon strongholds .&lt;ref&gt;Oceanography.  "Salmon Strongholds" September 2010 Vol. 23/3 P.14&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of its efforts to protect habitat in Oregon, the Wild Salmon Center is a member of the [[North Coast State Forest Coalition]]. In identifying and then protecting salmon strongholds, the WSC aims to conserve healthy salmon stocks before they decline and ensure [[sustainable]] fish populations survive for the long term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildsalmoncenter.org/programs/north_america/strongholds.php Programs].

'''Wilhelm (William) Dittenberger''' (August 31, 1840 in [[Heidelberg]] – December 29, 1906 in [[Halle (Saale)]]) was a German [[philologist]] in classical epigraphy.

==Life==
Wilhelm Dittenberger was the son of the Protestant theologian [[Wilhelm Theophor Dittenberger]]. After attending school in [[Heidelberg]] and [[Weimar]] (then directed by [[Hermann Sauppe]]), he studied classical philology at Jena from 1859 and transferred to [[Göttingen]] in 1861, where he was reunited with Hermann Sauppe and received his doctorate at the beginning of 1863 for a work on the Athenian [[ephebes]]. From autumn of that year, he taught at the Göttingen Gymnasium while he completed his [[habilitation]] on [[Sallust]] at the [[University of Göttingen]]. Initially, Dittenberger remained a schoolteacher, becoming a teacher at the Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium in [[Berlin]] in 1865, at the [[Rudolstadt]] Gymnasium from 1867, and at the gymnasium in [[Quedlinburg]] from 1873 to 1874. In 1874 he was appointed Professor of Classical Philology at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]]. He was a corresponding member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and an ordinary member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]].

Dittenberger's research focus was Greek epigraphy. His name is associated above all with the edited collections ''Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum'' (later re-edited by [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]]) and ''Orientis Graeci Inscriptiones Selectae''. For ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'', Dittenberger was responsible for the Athenian inscriptions of the Roman period, of [[Megaris]] and [[Boeotia]], and of [[Phocis]], [[Lokris]], [[Aetolia]], [[Acarnania]] and the [[Ionian Islands]]. In addition he edited the inscriptions of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] (with [[Karl Purgold]]) and the 6th to 11th editions of the widely used commentary on [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' begun by [[Friedrich Kraner]].

His son, Heinrich Dittenberger (1875–1952), was a lawyer in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], [[Leipzig]], and [[Berlin]], as well as Chief Director of the [[German Bar Association]] from 1910 to 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender.'' Vol. 7, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death in 1907, his library was acquired by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], as was the library of [[Johannes Vahlen]], slightly later (1913). Together, the two libraries form the ''Dittenberger-Vahlen Collectionn of Classical Texts'', containing over 15,000 books and 17,000 reprints. In 2000, the university began the digitisation of this collection with the assistance of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].

Dittenberger's tomb is located in the Nordfriedhof in Halle.

'''Wongudan Altar''', located in [[Jung-gu, Seoul|Jung-gu]], [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], was built in 1897 to serve as a site for the performance of the [[Heaven worship|rite of heaven]].  The site was also known by other names, such as '''Hwangudan''' (환구단, {{lang|ko-Hant|圜丘壇}}), '''Jecheondan''' (제천단, {{lang|ko-Hant|[[wikt:祭|祭]][[wikt:天|天]][[wikt:壇|壇]]}}) and '''Wondan''' (원단, {{lang|ko-Hant|圜壇}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocp.go.kr/jsp/vr/cybertour_main.jsp?codeid=32010701&amp;eflag=E Cyber Tour into Cultutural Properties]&lt;/ref&gt; Wongudan was designated South Korea's Historic Site No.&amp;nbsp;157 on July 15, 1967.

The Rite of Heaven was performed during the pre-[[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms period]].  During the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty, King [[Seongjong of Goryeo|Seongjong]] was the first of the Goryeo kings to perform the rite, designed to ensure a bountiful harvest.  King Seongjong standardized the ''Wonguje'' rituals.  During the Goryeo Dynasty, the practice was abolished. King [[Sejo of Joseon|Sejo]] of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] briefly restarted the rite but stopped the practice in the tenth year of his reign in 1464.

The ritual was restarted again when King [[Gojong of Joseon|Gojong]] proclaimed the [[Korean Empire]] in 1897, but it was subsequently abolished by the Japanese colonial government in 1910.

Wongudan was built in 1897. The site of the complex sat between [[Namsan (Seoul)|Namsan]] and [[Bukhansan]], and was considered highly auspicious by [[geomancers]].  The altar complex was also designed to mimic natural elements such as the sun and moon.  It was a three-story altar made of granite and was used for animal sacrifice.  The top center of the altar held a conical yellow-roofed building.  The altar was destroyed by the Japanese in 1913.  Today, the Hwanggungu (Yellow Palace Shrine), a three-storied octagonal shrine built in 1899, remains along with three plaster drums with dragon decorations, and a gate.  The Hwangungu, built on the north side of the altar complex, was designed for worshiping of Heaven and respecting [[Taejo of Joseon|Taejo]], the founder of the Joseon Dynasty.  The Gocheonje ritual was revived in 2002 with the intention of annual performance as a revival of Korean cultural heritage.

The imperial [[Japan]]ese built the Railroad Chosun Hotel in the area where they had demolished Wongudan Altar. In 1968, that hotel was demolished and the Westin Chosun Hotel was built in its place. The Hwangungu still stands in the hotel complex today and although it is not a well known tourist site, it is popular with the guests of the hotel.
