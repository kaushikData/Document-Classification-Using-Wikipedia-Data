[[Image:Contemporaine afb jeanne d arc.png|thumb|right|Joan of Arc drawing by Clément de Fauquembergue, 1429. The artist never saw Joan.&lt;ref&gt;Alain-Gilles Minella (2012). ''Jeanne d'Arc pour les Nuls'', First Gründ, Paris, (online French) [https://books.google.com/books?id=EDofp6mcgf4C&amp;pg=PT340&amp;lpg=PT340&amp;dq=Cl%C3%A9ment+de+Fauquembergue+n%27a+jamais+rencontr%C3%A9+Jeanne+d%27Arc&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PdSP-BA5g9&amp;sig=eao9FWl9apzHq6IVHUMfMz8roUc&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dGmHU_2aBcvO0AWbyYGYBA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cl%C3%A9ment%20de%20Fauquembergue%20n%27a%20jamais%20rencontr%C3%A9%20Jeanne%20d%27Arc&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There are a number of [[Historical revisionism|revisionist theories]] about [[Joan of Arc]]  which contradict the established account of her life. These include the theory that she was in fact guilty of the heresy for which she was condemned; that bones and other alleged relics come from her; that she escaped death at the stake and lived out her life in secret.

The following interpretations are sometimes advanced to the public but have not gained significant acceptance among academic historians.

For avowedly fictional representations of Joan in art, literature, and popular culture see [[Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc]].

== Royal bastard ==

 }}
In 1819, Pierre Caze published ''La Vérité sur Jeanne d’Arc'', which argued that Joan of Arc was the illegitimate daughter of the Queen, [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], and [[Louis I de Valois, Duke of Orléans|Duke Louis of Orléans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caze|first1=Pierre|title=La Vérité sur Jeanne d’Arc|date=1819|location=Paris|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Caze's reasoning, the queen hid their daughter in the countryside with the d'Arc family.  When Joan of Arc met the future King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] she would have given him a private sign that she was his half sister.  It has been theorized that the coat of arms he later granted her included a sword as a [[baton sinister|baton of bastardy]].

Although this would provide an explanation for how she gained the trust of Charles VII in early 1429, this hypothesis has too many other difficulties to be taken seriously.  Foremost among them is that the duke of Orleans died on November 23, 1407.  Isabeau of Bavaria delivered a son on November 10, 1407.  The likelihood of conceiving a daughter in the interim is exceedingly small.  Assuming Joan of Arc was born the following year, she would have been 23 years old at her trial in 1431.  She estimated her own age at 19 and all but one of the 115 witnesses at the trial of rehabilitation concurred with that age.

Furthermore, if the sword in Joan of Arc's coat of arms represented a baton of bastardy, then it would be unique in heraldry; it is inconsistent with the laws of [[heraldry]] that a sword ''party per pale'' (see "Coat of Arms of Jeanne d'Arc"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/jeannedarc.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) be considered a sign of illegitimacy.  It would also mean that Joan of Arc and several witnesses perjured themselves about her birth.  In the words of Regine Pernoud and Marie-Veronique Clin, "Yet amateur historians still insist that all these people – as well as Charles VII, the duke of Alençon, Dunois, Bertrand de Poulengy – carried out an intricate plot to disguise Joan's authentic royal parents.  This thesis lacks credible documentation."&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud and Clin, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survival ==
Several impostors claimed to be Joan of Arc after the execution date.  The most successful was [[Claude des Armoises]].  Claude des Armoises married the knight Robert des Armoises and claimed to be Joan of Arc in 1436.  She gained the support of Joan of Arc's brothers.  She carried on the charade until 1440, gaining gifts and subsidies.  One chronicle states, "In this year there came a young girl who said she was the Maid of France and played her role so well that many were duped by her, and especially the greatest nobles."  Claude finally confessed she was a fraud after Charles VII asked her to repeat the secret which the real Joan had revealed to him when they first met at Chinon in March 1429, which Claude could not do.&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine. "Joan of Arc By Herself and Her Witnesses" p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern authors attempt to revive this claim by asserting that some other victim was substituted for Joan of Arc at the stake.  The likelihood of this is extremely thin, since the trial of nullification records sworn testimony from numerous witnesses who were present at the execution and confirmed her identity.&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud and Clin, pp. 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine. ''Joan of Arc by Herself and her Witnesses'', pp. 228–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. Cobham Brewer|Dr. Cobham Brewer]] wrote in his nineteenth century volume ''Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'':

{{quote|text=M. Octave Delepierre has published a pamphlet, called Doute Historique, to deny the tradition that Joan of Arc was burnt at Rouen for sorcery. He cites a document discovered by Father Vignier in the seventeenth century, in the archives of Metz, to prove that she became the wife of Sieur des Armoise, with whom she resided at Metz, and became the mother of a family. Vignier subsequently found in the family muniment-chest the contract of marriage between "Robert des Armoise, knight, and Jeanne D’Arcy, surnamed the Maid of Orleans." In 1740 there were found in the archives of the Maison de Ville (Orléans) records of several payments to certain messengers from Joan to her brother John, bearing the dates 1435, 1436. There is also the entry of a presentation from the council of the city to the Maid, for her services at the siege (dated 1439). M. Delepierre has brought forward a host of other documents to corroborate the same fact, and show that the tale of her martyrdom was invented to throw odium on the English.&lt;ref&gt;Dr E, Cobham Brewer, ''Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The revisionist theory described by Brewer has been criticized on a number of grounds, including the significant number of eyewitnesses to Joan's execution, as well as the fact that Claude des Armoises subsequently confessed before a number of witnesses on multiple occasions to being an impostor.&lt;ref&gt;St. Joan Center.  Misconceptions Series: [http://www.stjoan-center.com/misconceptions/armoises_theory.html "Did Joan Survive as Claude des Armoises?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Graeme Donald argues that much of the story of Joan of Arc is a myth. He says there are no accounts or portraits of Joan of Arc's victories during her time period, nor is she mentioned as a commander of the French army by [[Georges Chastellain|Chastellain]]. He also states that the most definitive work of her life was written by [[Jules Etienne Joseph Quicherat|Jules Quicherat]] between 1841 and 1849, after he discovered a cache of documents relating to her trial. Donald argues that she was most likely not burned.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme, Donald (2009). ''Lies, damned lies, and history''. pp. 99–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have contradicted this view by pointing out that there is a wealth of information about Joan of Arc's campaigns and life from her contemporaries, including eyewitness accounts of the battles which frequently mention Joan's presence.&lt;ref&gt;Among the books which present translations of extensive excerpts from the eyewitness accounts: Pernoud, Regine. "Joan of Arc by Herself and her Witnesses", pp. 59–60, 70-71, 80–93, 113–19, 12–24, 130, 132–34, 138–39, 147–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were written during the campaigns themselves, such as Guy de Laval's letter on 8 June 1429.&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine. "Joan of Arc by Herself and her Witnesses", pp. 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Witch==
In 1921, anthropologist [[Margaret Murray]] argued that Joan was correctly identified as a witch by the religious authorities who condemned her to death, but that what they called witchcraft was in fact a survival of the pagan "old religion" of pre-Christian Europe. She claimed that Joan and [[Gilles de Rais]] were leaders of a pagan witch cult that was a rival to the Catholic church.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Kathleen L. (2013). ''The Life of Margaret Alice Murray: A Woman's Work in Archaeology''. New York: Lexington Books, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Joan was the "incarnate God" of a cult derived from the worship of the virgin huntress [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;ref&gt;Karen Sullivan, ''The Interrogation of Joan of Arc''. Contributors, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1999, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray claimed that this was still the religion of most of the common people and the reason Joan inspired the ordinary soldier:

{{quote|The men-at-arms, drawn from the lower orders, followed without hesitation one whom they believed to have been sent by their God, while the whole army was commanded by Marshal Gilles de Rais, who apparently tried to belong to both religions at once.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, M., ''The Witch Cult in Western Europe'', Appendix IV, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Murray, the destruction of Joan was orchestrated by the Catholic church itself and was its first major victory against the surviving pagan cult:

{{quote|The fifteenth century marks the first great victories of the Church. Beginning with the trials in Lorraine in 1408 the Church moved triumphantly against Joan of Arc and her followers in 1431, against Gilles de Rais and his coven in 1440, against the witches of Brescia in 1457.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Alva Hoyt, ''Witchcraft'', Southern Illinois University Press, 1989, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Murray's views have been dismissed by later scholars as pseudo-historical fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bailey. "Witchcraft Historiography" (review) in Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft - Volume 3, Number 1, Summer 2008, pp. 81–85.&lt;/ref&gt; One historian called her ideas "vapid balderdash".&lt;ref&gt;C. L'Estrange Ewen (1938) "Some Witchcraft Criticism: A Plea for the Blue Pencil".&lt;/ref&gt; Her claims about Joan of Arc were dismissed by historians based on the extensive evidence of Joan's actual religious views, such as the letters she dictated in which she defines her faith in "King Jesus, King of Heaven and of all the earth, my rightful and sovereign Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine; and Clin, Marie-Veronique. "Joan of Arc : Her Story", p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and the many eyewitness accounts of her beliefs and behavior.

== Relics and sites ==
[[Image:Jehanne signature.jpg|thumb|right|Joan of Arc dictated her letters. Three of the surviving ones are signed.]]
The Joan of Arc museum at [[Chinon]], [[France]] has a charred bone fragment reputed to belong to Joan of Arc.  Its authenticity is unconfirmed and appears to be unlikely, given the circumstances of her death. Indeed, forensic analysis has indicated that the [[Joan of Arc#Alleged relics disproven|bone is actually from an Egyptian mummy]]. The English ordered her body burned to ashes and the ashes cast into the River [[Seine]]. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] has a helmet in its Arms and Armor collection with a legendary attribution to Joan of Arc.  The museum makes no claims that this legend is true, but notes that the helmet dates from the right time period.

Several locations associated with Joan of Arc still exist, including the house where she was born, at [[Domrémy-la-Pucelle]].  The site has been converted to a museum.  The adjacent church has undergone extensive alterations since the fifteenth century but still contains a fourteenth-century statue of Saint Margaret, before which Joan of Arc probably prayed.  By contrast, the royal castle at [[Chinon]] is now a ruin.  Little more than the outer wall remains.  One wall remains of the great hall where she met [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]].

'''Analytic philosophy''' (sometimes '''analytical philosophy''') is a style of [[philosophy]] that became dominant in the [[Western world]] at the beginning of the 20th century. The term can refer to one of several things:
* As a philosophical practice,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Avrum Stroll, ''Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy'' (Columbia University Press, 2000), p. 5: "[I]t is difficult to give a precise definition of 'analytic philosophy' since it is not so much a specific doctrine as a loose concatenation of approaches to problems." Also, see Stroll (2000), p. 7: "I think Sluga is right in saying 'it may be hopeless to try to determine the essence of analytic philosophy.' Nearly every proposed definition has been challenged by some scholar. [...] [W]e are dealing with a family resemblance concept."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Hans-Johann Glock]], ''What Is Analytic Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 205: "The answer to the title question, then, is that analytic philosophy is a tradition held together ''both'' by ties of mutual influence ''and'' by family resemblances."&lt;/ref&gt; it is characterized by an emphasis on argumentative clarity and precision, often making use of [[formal logic]], conceptual analysis, and, to a lesser degree, mathematics and the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref name="LeiterWeb"&gt;[[Brian Leiter]] (2006) webpage [http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp ''"Analytic" and "Continental" Philosophy'']{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }}.
Quote on the definition: "'Analytic' philosophy today names a style of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics, than with the humanities."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Glock | first1 = H. J. | title = Was Wittgenstein an Analytic Philosopher? | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9973.2004.00329.x | journal = Metaphilosophy | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 419–444 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colin McGinn, ''The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey through Twentieth-Century Philosophy'' (HarperCollins, 2002), p. xi.: "analytical philosophy [is] too narrow a label, since [it] is not generally a matter of taking a word or concept and analyzing it (whatever exactly thatthat might be). [...] This tradition emphasizes clarity, rigor, argument, theory, truth. It is not a tradition that aims primarily for inspiration or consolation or ideology. Nor is it particularly concerned with 'philosophy of life,' though parts of it are. This kind of philosophy is more like science than religion, more like mathematics than poetry – though it is neither science nor mathematics."&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a historical development, analytic philosophy refers to certain developments in early 20th-century philosophy that were the historical antecedents of the current practice. Central figures in this historical development are [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]]. In this more specific sense, analytic philosophy is identified with specific philosophical traits (many of which are rejected by many contemporary analytic philosophers), such as:
** The logical-positivist principle that there are not any specifically philosophical facts and that the object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts. This may be contrasted with the traditional [[foundationalism]], which considers philosophy to be a special science (i.e., the discipline of knowledge) that investigates the fundamental reasons and principles of everything.&lt;ref&gt;See Aristotle Metaphysics (Book II 993a), Kenny (1973) p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many analytic philosophers have considered their inquiries as continuous with, or subordinate to, those of the natural sciences. This is an attitude that begins with [[John Locke]], who described his work as that of an "underlabourer" to the achievements of natural scientists such as Newton. During the 20th century, the most influential advocate of the continuity of philosophy with science was [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Quine's papers "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" and "Epistemology Naturalized".&lt;/ref&gt;
** The principle that the logical clarification of thoughts can be achieved only by analysis of the [[logical form]] of philosophical [[propositions]].&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Martinich, "Introduction," in Martinich &amp; D. Sosa (eds.), ''A Companion to Analytic Philosophy'' (Blackwell, 2001), p. 1: "To use a general name for the kind of analytic philosophy practiced during the first half of the twentieth century, [...] 'conceptual analysis' aims at breaking down complex concepts into their simpler components."&lt;/ref&gt; The logical form of a proposition is a way of representing it (often using the [[formal grammar]] and symbolism of a [[logical system]]), to reduce it to simpler components if necessary, and to display its similarity with all other propositions of the same type. However, analytic philosophers disagree widely about the correct logical form of ordinary language.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, op. cit., 4.111&lt;/ref&gt;
** The neglect of generalized philosophical systems in favour of more restricted inquiries stated rigorously,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Soames, ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century'' Vol. 1 (Princeton UP, 2003), p. xv: "There is, I think, a widespread presumption within the tradition that it is often possible to make philosophical progress by intensively investigating a small, circumscribed range of philosophical issues while holding broader, systematic questions in abeyance. What distinguishes twentieth-century analytical philosophy from at least some philosophy in other traditions, or at other times, is not a categorical rejection of philosophical systems, but rather the acceptance of a wealth of smaller, more thorough and more rigorous, investigations that need not be tied to any overarching philosophical view." See also, e.g., "Philosophical Analysis" (catalogued under "Analysis, Philosophical") in ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Vol. 1 (Macmillan, 1967), ''esp.'' sections on "Bertrand Russell" at p. 97''ff'', "G.E. Moore" at p. 100''ff'', and "Logical Positivism" at p. 102''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; or ordinary language.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the works of [[G.E. Moore]] and [[J.L. Austin]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a characteristic paragraph by Russell:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern analytical empiricism [...] differs from that of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerful logical technique. It is thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve definite answers, which have the quality of science rather than of philosophy. It has the advantage, in comparison with the philosophies of the system-builders, of being able to tackle its problems one at a time, instead of having to invent at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods, in this respect, resemble those of science.&lt;ref&gt;B. Russell, ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1945), p. 834.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Scandinavia]], the majority of university philosophy departments today identify themselves as "analytic" departments.&lt;ref name="Searle03P1"&gt;
"Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the analytic tradition—- such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism, existentialism, or Marxism—- feel it necessary to define their position in relation to analytic philosophy." [[John Searle]] (2003), ''Contemporary Philosophy in the United States'' in N. Bunnin and E. P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed., (Blackwell, 2003), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Analytic philosophy is often understood in contrast to other philosophical traditions, most notably [[continental philosophy|continental philosophies]] such as [[existentialism]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and also [[Thomism]] and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]] (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 2: "Analytic philosophy is mainly associated with the contemporary English-speaking world, but it is by no means the only important philosophical tradition. In this volume two other immensely rich and important such traditions are introduced: Indian philosophy, and philosophical thought in Europe from the time of Hegel." L.J. Cohen, ''The Dialogue of Reason: An Analysis of Analytical Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 5: "So, despite a few overlaps, analytical philosophy is not difficult to distinguish broadly [...] from other modern movements, like phenomenology, say, or existentialism, or from the large amount of philosophizing that has also gone on in the present century within frameworks deriving from other influential thinkers like Aquinas, Hegel, or Marx." H.-J. Glock, ''What Is Analytic Philosophy?'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 86: "Most non-analytic philosophers of the twentieth century do not belong to continental philosophy."&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History&lt;!--'History of analytic philosophy', 'History of Analytic philosophy', 'History of analytical philosophy', and 'History of Analytical philosophy' redirect here--&gt;==
[[British idealism]], as taught by philosophers such as [[F. H. Bradley]] (1846–1924) and [[Thomas Hill Green]] (1836–1882), dominated English philosophy in the late 19th century. With reference to this intellectual basis the initiators of analytic philosophy, [[G. E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], articulated early analytic philosophy.

Since its beginning, a basic goal of analytic philosophy has been conceptual clarity,&lt;ref name="PenguinDicP22"&gt;Mautner, Thomas (editor) (2005) ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'', entry for 'Analytic philosophy'', pp. 22–3&lt;/ref&gt; in the name of which Moore and Russell rejected [[Hegelianism]] for being obscure — see for example Moore's "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]" and Russell's critique of the [[doctrine of internal relations]].&lt;ref&gt;"Analytic philosophy opposed right from its beginning English neo-Hegelianism of Bradley's sort and similar ones. It did not only criticize the latter's denial of the existence of an external world (anyway an unjust criticism), but also the bombastic, obscure style of Hegel's writings." {{cite journal|last=Jonkers |first=Peter |year=2003 |title=Perspectives on Twentieth Century Philosophy:A Reply to Tom Rockmore |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |volume=3 |issn=1566-5399 |url=http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000129/article.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128165848/http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000129/article.pdf |archivedate=2007-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by developments in modern logic, the early Russell claimed that the problems of philosophy can be solved by showing the simple constituents of complex notions.&lt;ref name="PenguinDicP22"/&gt; An important aspect of British idealism was [[logical holism]] — the opinion that there are aspects of the world that can be known only by knowing the whole world. This is closely related to the opinion that [[Property (philosophy)#Relations|relations]] between items are ''internal relations'', that is, [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of the nature of those items. Russell, along with Wittgenstein, in response promulgated [[logical atomism]] and the doctrine of ''external relations'' — the belief that the world consists of ''independent'' facts.&lt;ref&gt;Baillie, James, "Introduction to Bertrand Russell" in ''Contemporary Analytic Philosophy, Second Edition'' (Prentice Hall, 1997), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell, during his early career, along with his collaborator [[Alfred North Whitehead]], was much influenced by [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925), who developed [[predicate logic]], which allowed a much greater range of sentences to be parsed into logical form than was possible using the ancient [[Aristotelian logic]]. Frege was also influential as a [[philosophy of mathematics|philosopher of mathematics]] in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. In contrast to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1891 book ''Philosophie der Arithmetik'', which argued that the concept of the [[cardinal number]] derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Willard, Dallas|title= Husserl on a Logic that Failed|journal= Philosophical Review|pages= 52–53|volume= 89|issue= 1|doi= 10.2307/2184863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frege argued that mathematics and logic have their own validity, independent of the judgments or mental states of individual mathematicians and logicians (which were the basis of arithmetic according to the "[[psychologism]]" of Husserl's ''Philosophie''). Frege further developed his philosophy of logic and mathematics in ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (1884) and ''The Basic Laws of Arithmetic'' ({{lang-de|Grundgesetze der Arithmetik}}, 1893–1903), where he provided an alternative to psychologistic accounts of the concept of number.

Like Frege, Russell argued that mathematics is reducible to logical fundamentals in ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903). Later, his book written with Whitehead, ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–1913), encouraged many philosophers to renew their interest in the development of [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]]. Additionally, Russell adopted Frege's predicate logic as his primary philosophical method, a method Russell thought could expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems. For example, the English word [[to be|"is"]] has three distinct meanings which predicate logic can express as follows:
* For the sentence 'the cat ''is'' asleep', the ''is'' of predication means that "x is P" (denoted as P(x)).
* For the sentence 'there ''is'' a cat', the ''is'' of existence means that "there is an x" (∃x).
* For the sentence 'three ''is'' half of six', the ''is'' of identity means that "x is the same as y" (x=y).

Russell sought to resolve various philosophical problems by applying such logical distinctions, most famously in his analysis of [[definite description]]s in "[[On Denoting]]" (1905).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|year=1905|title=On Denoting|journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]|volume=14|pages=473–93|url=http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Russell/rus_deno.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331212120/http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Russell/rus_deno.html|archivedate=2006-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideal language analysis&lt;!--Linked from 'Ludwig Wittgenstein', 'Template:Wittgenstein' and 'Linguistic philosophy'--&gt;===
{{main article|Linguistic philosophy}}
From about 1910 to 1930, analytic philosophers like Russell and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] emphasized creating an ideal language for philosophical analysis, which would be free from the ambiguities of ordinary language that, in their opinion, often made philosophy invalid. This philosophical trend can be termed "ideal-language analysis" or "formalism". During this phase, Russell and Wittgenstein sought to understand language (and hence philosophical problems) by using [[logic|formal logic]] to formalize the way in which philosophical [[statement (logic)|statements]] are made. Wittgenstein developed a comprehensive system of logical atomism in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' ({{lang-de | Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung}}, 1921). He thereby argued that the universe is the totality of actual states of affairs and that these states of affairs can be expressed by the language of first-order predicate logic. Thus a ''picture'' of the universe can be construed by means of expressing atomic facts in the form of atomic propositions, and linking them using [[logical operator]]s.

===Logical positivism===
{{Main article|Logical positivism}}
During the late 1920s, to 1940s, a group of philosophers of the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[Berlin Circle]] developed Russell and Wittgenstein's formalism into a doctrine known as "[[logical positivism]]" (or logical empiricism). Logical positivism used formal logical methods to develop an empiricist account of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Carnap, R.|title= The Logical Structure of the World|publisher= Felix Meiner Verlag|year= 1928|lccn= 66013604|isbn= 0-8126-9523-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Hans Reichenbach]], along with other members of the Vienna Circle, claimed that the truths of logic and mathematics were [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and those of science were verifiable empirical claims. These two constituted the entire universe of meaningful judgments; anything else was nonsense. The claims of ethics, aesthetics and theology were consequently reduced to pseudo-statements, neither empirically true nor false, and therefore meaningless. In reaction to what he considered excesses of logical positivism, [[Karl Popper]]'s insisted on the role of [[falsifiability|falsification]] in the philosophy of science—although his general method was also part of the analytic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Popper, Karl R.|title= The Logic of Scientific Discovery|publisher= Routledge|year= 2002 | isbn= 0-415-27844-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]] in 1933, many members of the Vienna and Berlin Circles fled to Britain and America, which helped to reinforce the dominance of logical positivism and analytic philosophy in Anglophone countries.

Logical positivists typically considered philosophy as having a very limited function. For them, philosophy concerned the clarification of thoughts, rather than having a distinct subject matter of its own. The positivists adopted the [[verification principle]], according to which every meaningful statement is either [[Analytic proposition|analytic]] or is capable of being verified by experience. This caused the logical positivists to reject many traditional problems of philosophy, especially those of [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]], as meaningless.

===Ordinary-language analysis===
{{Main article|Ordinary language philosophy}}

After [[World War II]], during the late 1940s and 1950s, analytic philosophy became involved with ordinary-language analysis. This resulted in two main trends. One continued Wittgenstein's later philosophy, which differed dramatically from his early work of the ''Tractatus''. The other, known as [[Ordinary-language philosophy|"Oxford philosophy"]], involved [[J. L. Austin]]. In contrast to earlier analytic philosophers (including the early Wittgenstein) who thought philosophers should avoid the deceptive trappings of natural language by constructing ideal languages, ordinary-language philosophers claimed that ordinary language already represents many subtle distinctions not recognized in the formulation of traditional philosophical theories or problems. While schools such as logical positivism emphasize logical terms, supposed to be universal and separate from contingent factors (such as culture, language, historical conditions), ordinary-language philosophy emphasizes the use of language by ordinary people. The most prominent ordinary-language philosophers during the 1950s were the aforementioned Austin and [[Gilbert Ryle]].

Ordinary-language philosophers often sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing them to be the result of misunderstanding ordinary language. Examples include Ryle, who tried to dispose of "[[Ghost in the machine|Descartes' myth]]", and Wittgenstein.

==Contemporary analytic philosophy==
Although contemporary philosophers who self-identify as "analytic" have widely divergent interests, assumptions, and methods—and have often rejected the fundamental premises that defined analytic philosophy before 1960—analytic philosophy today is usually considered to be defined by a particular style,&lt;ref name="LeiterWeb"/&gt; characterized by precision and thoroughness about a specific topic, and resistance to "imprecise or cavalier discussions of broad topics".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

During the 1950s, logical positivism was challenged influentially by Wittgenstein in the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] in "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", and Sellars in ''[[Wilfrid Sellars|Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind]]''. After 1960, Anglophone philosophy began to incorporate a wider range of interests, opinions, and methods.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Still, many philosophers in Britain and America still consider themselves "analytic philosophers".&lt;ref name="Searle03P1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeiterWeb"/&gt; They have done so largely by expanding the notion of "analytic philosophy" from the specific programs that dominated Anglophone philosophy before 1960 to a much more general notion of an "analytic" style.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/analytic.htm |title=Analytic Philosophy Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date= |accessdate=2018-04-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703212901/http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/analytic.htm |archivedate=2009-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of the history is far from universally accepted, and its opponents{{who|date=April 2018}} would say that it grossly downplays the role of Wittgenstein during the 1960s and 1970s.

Many philosophers and historians have attempted to define or describe analytic philosophy. Those definitions often include an emphasis on conceptual analysis: [[A.P. Martinich]] draws an analogy between analytic philosophy's interest in conceptual analysis and analytic chemistry, which aims to determine chemical compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to analytic philosophy|year=2001|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=0-631-21415-1|pages=1–5|editor=[[A.P. Martinich]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven D. Hales described analytic philosophy as one of three types of philosophical method practiced in the West: "[i]n roughly reverse order by number of proponents, they are phenomenology, ideological philosophy, and analytic philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hales|first=Steven D.|title=Analytic philosophy : classic readings|year=2002|publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0-534-51277-1|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scott Soames]] agrees that clarity is important: analytic philosophy, he says, has "an implicit commitment—albeit faltering and imperfect—to the ideals of clarity, rigor and argumentation" and it "aims at truth and knowledge, as opposed to moral or spiritual improvement [...] the goal in analytic philosophy is to discover what is true, not to provide a useful recipe for living one's life". Soames also states that analytic philosophy is characterised by "a more piecemeal approach. There is, I think, a widespread presumption within the tradition that it is often possible to make philosophical progress by intensively investigating a small, circumscribed range of philosophical issues while holding broader, systematic questions in abeyance".&lt;ref name=Soames&gt;{{cite book |last=Soames|first=Scott|title=The dawn of analysis|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-11573-7|pages=xiii-xvii|edition=2nd print., 1st paperb. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of the most important and active topics and subtopics of analytic philosophy are summarized by the following sections.

===Philosophy of mind and cognitive science===

Motivated by the logical positivists' interest in verificationism, [[logical behaviorism]] was the most prominent [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]] of analytic philosophy for the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, George, "Behaviorism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/behaviorism/]&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorists tended to opine either that statements about the mind were equivalent to ''statements about'' behavior and dispositions to behave in particular ways or that mental states were directly equivalent to behavior and dispositions to behave. Behaviorism later became much less popular, in favor of [[Identity theory of mind|type physicalism]] or [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], theories that identified mental states with brain states. During this period, topics of the philosophy of mind were often related strongly to topics of [[cognitive science]] such as [[modularity of mind|modularity]] or [[Psychological nativism|innateness]]. Finally, analytic philosophy has featured a certain number of philosophers who were [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualists]], and recently forms of property dualism have had a resurgence; the most prominent representative  is [[David Chalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=dualism |title=Dualism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Searle]] suggests that the obsession with the philosophy of language during the 20th century has been superseded by an emphasis on the [[philosophy of mind]],&lt;ref&gt;Postrel and Feser, February 2000, ''Reality Principles: An Interview with John R. Searle'' at {{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/27599.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929023644/http://www.reason.com/news/show/27599.html |archivedate=2008-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which functionalism is currently the dominant theory. In recent years, a central focus of research in the philosophy of mind has been [[consciousness]]. While there is a general consensus for the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Ethics in analytic philosophy===

There is a position that analytic philosophy shirked ethical commitments as it maintained its apolitical and conservative positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What is Analytic Philosophy?|last=Glock|first=Hans-Johann|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521872676|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed description of this claim holds that its focus on [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]] and [[empiricism]] meant that thinkers, particularly of the early analytic philosophy, had no enthusiasm for doing ethics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=5lK6DTadnaQC&amp;pg=PT213&amp;dq=%22analytic+philosophy%22+ethics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOl_Xz0OveAhUHfH0KHRijDgIQ6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22analytic%20philosophy%22%20ethics&amp;f=false|title=A Brief History of Analytic Philosophy: From Russell to Rawls|last=Schwartz|first=Stephen P.|date=2012-03-28|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118271728|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only during the emergence of ordinary language philosophers did ethics become an area for analytic philosophers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Philosophers working with the analytic tradition have gradually come to distinguish three major types of moral philosophy.
* [[Meta-ethics]] which investigates moral terms and concepts;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Key Terms in Ethics|last=Kuusela|first=Oskari|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2011|isbn=9781441166104|location=London|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Normative ethics]] which examines and produces normative ethical judgments;
* [[Applied ethics]] which investigates how existing normative principles should be applied to difficult or borderline cases, often cases created by new technology or new scientific knowledge.

====Meta-ethics====
Twentieth-century meta-ethics has two origins. The first is G. E. Moore's investigation into the nature of ethical terms (e.g., good) in his ''Principia Ethica'' (1903), which identified the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. Along with Hume's famous is/ought distinction, the naturalistic fallacy was a major topic of investigation for analytical philosophers.

The second is in logical positivism and its attitude that statements which are unverifiable are meaningless. Although that attitude was adopted originally to promote scientific investigation by rejecting grand metaphysical systems, it had the side effect of making (ethical and aesthetic) value judgments (as well as religious statements and beliefs) meaningless. But because value judgments are of major importance in human life, it became incumbent on logical positivism to develop an explanation of the nature and meaning of value judgements. As a result, analytic philosophers avoided normative ethics, and instead began [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] investigations into the nature of moral terms, statements, and judgments.

The [[logical positivist]]s opined that statements about [[Value (ethics)|value]]—- including all ethical and aesthetic judgments—- are [[non-cognitivism|non-cognitive]]; that is, they cannot be objectively verified or falsified. Instead, the logical positivists adopted an [[emotivism|emotivist]] theory, which was that value judgments expressed the attitude of the speaker. For example, in this view, saying, "Killing is wrong", is equivalent to saying, "Boo to murder", or saying the word "murder" with a particular tone of disapproval.

While non-cognitivism was generally accepted by analytic philosophers, emotivism had many deficiencies, and evolved into more sophisticated non-cognitivist theories such as the [[expressivism]] of [[Charles Stevenson]], and the [[universal prescriptivism]] of [[R. M. Hare]], which was based on J. L. Austin's philosophy of [[speech acts]].

These theories were not without their critics. [[Philippa Foot]] contributed several essays attacking all these theories. [[J. O. Urmson]]'s article "On Grading" called the is/ought distinction into question.

As non-cognitivism, the is/ought distinction, and the naturalistic fallacy began to be called into question, analytic philosophers showed a renewed interest in the traditional questions of moral philosophy. Perhaps the most influential being [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], whose monograph ''Intention'' was called by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] "the most important treatment of action since Aristotle".&lt;ref&gt;From the cover of the 2000 Harvard University Press edition of ''Intention''.&lt;/ref&gt; A favorite student and friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein, her 1958 article "Modern Moral Philosophy" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the philosophical lexicon, declared the "is-ought" impasse to be unproductive, and resulted in a revival of virtue ethics.

====Normative ethics====
The first half of the 20th century was marked by skepticism toward, and neglect of, normative ethics. Related subjects, such as social and political philosophy, aesthetics, and [[philosophy of history]], became only marginal topics of English-language philosophy during this period.

During this time, [[utilitarianism]] was the only non-skeptical type of ethics to remain popular. However, as the influence of logical positivism began to decrease mid-century, analytic philosophers had renewed interest in ethics. [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s 1958 "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" sparked a revival of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Virtue Ethics|virtue ethical]] approach and [[John Rawls]]'s 1971 ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' restored interest in [[Kantian]] ethical philosophy. Today, contemporary normative ethics is dominated by three schools: [[utilitarianism]], virtue ethics, and [[deontology]].

====Applied ethics====
A significant feature of analytic philosophy since approximately 1970 has been the emergence of [[applied ethics]]—- an interest in the application of moral principles to specific practical issues. The philosophers following this orientation view ethics as involving humanistic values, which involve practical implications and applications in the way people interact and lead their lives socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophical Perspectives on Communalism and Morality in African Traditions|last=Ikuenobe|first=Polycarp|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2006|isbn=9780739111314|location=Oxford|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytic philosophy of religion===

In ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion'', Harris noted that
{{quote|
analytic philosophy has been a very heterogeneous 'movement'.... some forms of analytic philosophy have proven very sympathetic to the philosophy of religion and have actually provided a philosophical mechanism for responding to other more radical and hostile forms of analytic philosophy.&lt;ref name=harris2001&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=James Franklin |title=Analytic philosophy of religion |date=2002 |publisher=Kluwer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=1-4020-0530-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Rx2Qf9ieFKYC}} (432 pages) (volume 3 of Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion, ISSN 1568-1556)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}
}}

As with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of [[philosophy of religion]], largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists) the subject as part of [[metaphysics]] and therefore meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;(a notable exception is the series of [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael B. Forest]]'s 1934–36 [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']] articles involving the Christian doctrine of creation and the rise of modern science).&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of logical positivism renewed interest in philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers like [[William Alston]], [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Robert Merrihew Adams]], [[Richard Swinburne]], and [[Antony Flew]] not only to introduce new problems, but to re-study classical topics such as the nature of [[miracle]]s, theistic arguments, the [[problem of evil]], (see [[existence of God]]) the rationality of belief in [[God]], concepts of the nature of God, and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Michael et al. (2003). ''Reason and Religious Belief''&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga, Mackie and Flew debated the logical validity of the ''free will defense'' as a way to solve the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, John L. (1982). ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God''&lt;/ref&gt; Alston, grappling with the consequences of analytic [[philosophy of language]], worked on the nature of religious language. Adams worked on the relationship of faith and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert M. (1987). ''The Virtue of Faith And Other Essays in Philosophical Theology''&lt;/ref&gt; Analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for a number of philosophically-sophisticated theistic arguments, like those of the [[reformed epistemology|reformed epistemologists]] like Plantinga.

Analytic philosophy of religion has also been preoccupied with Wittgenstein, as well as his interpretation of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Creegan, Charles. (1989). ''Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard: Religion, Individuality and Philosophical Method''&lt;/ref&gt; Using first-hand remarks (which was later published in ''Philosophical Investigations'', ''Culture and Value'', and other works), philosophers such as [[Peter Winch]] and [[Norman Malcolm]] developed what has come to be known as ''contemplative philosophy'', a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the "Swansea tradition," and which includes Wittgensteinians such as [[Rush Rhees]], Peter Winch, and [[D. Z. Phillips]], among others. The name "contemplative philosophy" was first coined by D. Z. Phillips in ''Philosophy's Cool Place'', which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein's "Culture and Value."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, D. Z. (1999). ''Philosophy's Cool Place.'' Cornell University Press. The quote is from Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'' (2e): "My ideal is a certain coolness. A temple providing a setting for the passions without meddling with them.''&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation was first labeled, "Wittgensteinian Fideism," by Kai Nielsen but those who consider themselves Wittgensteinians in the Swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein's considered position; this is especially true of D. Z. Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=fideism |title=Fideism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to this interpretation, [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] and D. Z. Phillips became two of the most prominent philosophers on Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Kai and D.Z. Phillips. (2005). ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political philosophy===

====Liberalism====
Current analytic political philosophy owes much to [[John Rawls]], who in a series of papers from the 1950s onward (most notably "Two Concepts of Rules" and "Justice as Fairness") and his 1971 book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', produced a sophisticated defence of a generally liberal egalitarian account of distributive justice. This was followed soon by Rawls's colleague [[Robert Nozick]]'s book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', a defence of [[free-market]] [[libertarianism]]. [[Isaiah Berlin]] also had a lasting influence on both analytic political philosophy and [[Liberalism]] with his lecture the ''[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]''.

During recent decades there have also been several critiques of liberalism, including the [[feminism|feminist]] critiques of [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]], the [[communitarianism|communitarian]] critiques of [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (although neither of them endorses the term), and the [[multiculturalism|multiculturalist]] critiques of [[Amy Gutmann]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. Although not an analytic philosopher, [[Jürgen Habermas]] is another important—- if controversial—- author of contemporary analytic political philosophy, whose social theory is a blend of social science, Marxism, [[neo-Kantianism]], and American [[pragmatism]].

[[Consequentialist libertarianism]] also derives from the analytic tradition.

====Analytical Marxism====
Another development of political philosophy was the emergence of the school of [[analytical Marxism]]. Members of this school seek to apply techniques of analytic philosophy modern social science such as [[rational choice theory]] to clarify the theories of [[Karl Marx]] and his successors. The best-known member of this school is [[G. A. Cohen]], whose 1978 work, ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'', is generally considered to represent the genesis of this school. In that book, Cohen used logical and linguistic analysis to clarify and defend Marx's materialist conception of history. Other prominent Analytical Marxists include the economist [[John Roemer]], the social scientist [[Jon Elster]], and the sociologist [[Erik Olin Wright]]. The work of these later philosophers have furthered Cohen's work by bringing to bear modern social science methods, such as rational choice theory, to supplement Cohen's use of analytic philosophical techniques in the interpretation of Marxian theory.

Cohen himself would later engage directly with Rawlsian political philosophy to advance a [[socialist]] theory of justice that contrasts with both traditional Marxism and the theories advanced by Rawls and Nozick. In particular, he indicates Marx's principle of [[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].

====Communitarianism====
[[Communitarian]]s such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Michael Walzer]], and [[Michael Sandel]] advance a critique of Liberalism that uses analytic techniques to isolate the main assumptions of Liberal individualists, such as Rawls, and then challenges these assumptions. In particular, Communitarians challenge the Liberal assumption that the individual can be considered as fully autonomous from the community in which he lives and is brought up. Instead, they argue for a conception of the individual that emphasizes the role that the community plays in forming his or her values, thought processes and opinions.

===Analytic metaphysics===
{{Main article|Metaphysics}}

One striking difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century. Philosophers such as [[David Kellogg Lewis]] and [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]] developed elaborate theories on a range of topics such as universals, causation, possibility and necessity, and abstract objects.

Among the developments that resulted in the revival of metaphysical theorizing were [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s attack on the [[analytic proposition|analytic-synthetic distinction]], which was generally considered to weaken [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]'s distinction between existence questions internal to a framework and those external to it.&lt;ref&gt;S. Yablo and A. Gallois, ''Does Ontology Rest on a Mistake?'', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes, Vol. 72, (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;229–261+263-283 [http://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/om.pdf first part] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912125408/http://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/om.pdf |date=2011-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Important also for the revival of metaphysics was the further development of [[modal logic]], including the work of [[Saul Kripke]], who argued in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' and elsewhere for the existence of [[essence]]s and the possibility of [[Alethic modal logic|necessary]], [[a posteriori]] truths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dean Zimmerman|Zimmerman, Dean W.]], "Prologue" in ''Oxford Studies in Metaphysics, Volume 1'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Metaphysics remains a fertile topic of research, having recovered from the attacks of [[A.J. Ayer]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]]. Although many discussions are continuations of old ones from previous decades and centuries, the debate remains active. The philosophy of fiction, the problem of empty names, and the debate over existence's status as a property have all become major concerns, while perennial issues such as free will, possible worlds, and the [[philosophy of time]] have been revived.&lt;ref&gt;Everett, Anthony and Thomas Hofweber (eds.) (2000), ''Empty Names, Fiction and the Puzzles of Non-Existence.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inwagenetall1998&gt;Van Inwagen, Peter, and Dean Zimmerman (eds.) (1998), ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Science has also had an increasingly significant role in metaphysics. The theory of special relativity has had a profound effect on the philosophy of time, and quantum physics is routinely discussed in the free will debate.&lt;ref name=inwagenetall1998/&gt; The weight given to scientific evidence is largely due to widespread commitments among philosophers to [[scientific realism]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]].

===Philosophy of language===
{{Main article|Philosophy of language}}
Philosophy of language is a topic that has decreased during the last four decades, as evidenced by the fact that few major philosophers today treat it as a primary research topic. Indeed, while the debate remains fierce, it is still strongly influenced by those authors from the first half of the century: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]].

In [[Saul Kripke]]'s publication ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', he argued influentially that flaws in common theories of proper names are indicative of larger misunderstandings of the metaphysics of necessity and possibility. By wedding the techniques of modal logic to a causal theory of reference, Kripke was widely regarded as reviving theories of essence and identity as respectable topics of philosophical discussion.

Another influential philosopher, [[Pavel Tichý]] initiated Transparent Intensional Logic, an original theory of the [[logical analysis]] of [[natural language]]s – the theory is devoted to the problem of saying exactly what it is that we learn, know and can communicate when we come to understand what a sentence means.

===Philosophy of science===
{{Main article|Philosophy of science}}
Reacting against both the verificationism of the logical positivists as well as the critiques of the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]], who had suggested the [[falsifiability]] criterion on which to judge the demarcation between science and non-science, discussions of [[philosophy of science]] during the last 40 years were dominated by [[social constructivism|social constructivist]] and [[cognitive relativism|cognitive relativist]] theories of science. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] with his formulation of [[paradigm shift]]s and [[Paul Feyerabend]] with his [[epistemological anarchism]] are significant for these discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Glock 2008, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[philosophy of biology]] has also undergone considerable growth, particularly due to the considerable debate in recent years over the nature of [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Hull, David L. and [[Michael Ruse|Ruse, Michael]], "Preface" in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. xix &amp; xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Dennett and his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', which defends [[Neo-Darwinism]], stand at the foreground of this debate.&lt;ref&gt;Lennox, James G., "Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism" in Sakar and Plutynski (eds.), ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Biology'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2008), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology===
{{Main article|Epistemology}}
Owing largely to [[Gettier]]'s 1963 paper "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", epistemology resurged as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years. A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier's examples presented to the traditional justified true belief model of knowledge, including developing [[Theory of justification|theories of justification]] in order to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified true belief model. Other and related topics of contemporary research include debates between [[internalism and externalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Bonjour, Laurence, "Recent Work on the Internalism—Externalism Controversy" in Dancy, Sosa, and Steup (eds.), ''A Companion to Epistemology, Second Edition'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; basic knowledge, the nature of [[evidence]], the value of knowledge, [[epistemic luck]], [[virtue epistemology]], the role of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuitions]] in justification, and treating knowledge as a primitive concept.

===Aesthetics===
{{Main article|Aesthetics}}
As a result of attacks on the traditional aesthetic notions of beauty and sublimity from [[post-modern]] thinkers, analytic philosophers were slow to consider art and aesthetic judgment. [[Susanne Langer]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Langer]], ''Feeling and Form: A Theory of Art'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nelson Goodman]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nelson Goodman]], ''Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 John Locke lectures.&lt;/ref&gt; addressed these problems in an analytic style during the 1950s and 1960s. Since Goodman, aesthetics as a discipline for analytic philosophers has flourished.&lt;ref&gt;Kivy, Peter, "Introduction: Aesthetics Today" in ''The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2004), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Rigorous efforts to pursue analyses of traditional aesthetic concepts were performed by [[Guy Sircello]] in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in new analytic theories of love,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''Love and Beauty.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; sublimity,&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]] "How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible?" ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Vol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp.&amp;nbsp;541–550&lt;/ref&gt; and beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Sircello]], ''A New Theory of Beauty.'' Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auckland Anniversary Day''' is a [[Public holidays in New Zealand|public holiday]] observed in the northern half of the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], being the area's [[provincial anniversary day]]. It is observed throughout the historic [[Auckland Province]], even though the [[provinces of New Zealand]] were abolished in 1876. The modern area of observation includes all of [[Auckland Region|Auckland]], [[Northland Region|Northland]] (where it is known instead as Northland Day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/public-holidays-and-work/public-holidays-and-anniversary-dates/|title=Public holidays and anniversary dates|website=New Zealand Government|language=en-GB|access-date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Waikato]], [[Bay of Plenty Region|Bay of Plenty]] and [[Gisborne Region]]s, as well as some parts of the [[Manawatu-Wanganui Region|Manawatu-Wanganui]] and [[Hawke's Bay Region]]s north of the [[39th parallel south|39th parallel]]. The holiday usually falls on the Monday closest to 29 January, the anniversary of the arrival of [[William Hobson]], later the first Governor of New Zealand, in the [[Bay of Islands]] in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1h29/hobson-william Hobson, William]". Dictionary of New Zealand Biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Auckland Anniversary Day was established by Governor Hobson's direction, over [[Willoughby Shortland]]'s signature, in 1842. ''[[The New Zealand Gazette|The New Zealand Government Gazette]]'' of 26 January 1842 (Volume 2, 4th edition) carried a notice stating,&lt;ref name="city of the seas" /&gt; {{Quotation|Saturday, the 29th instant, being the SECOND ANNIVERSARY of the establishment of the Colony, His Excellency the Governor has been pleased to direct that day to be held as a GENERAL HOLIDAY on which occasion the Public Offices will be closed.}}

The choice of 29 January appeared strange, as Hobson himself pronounced that it was on the following day that he proclaimed British Sovereignty in New Zealand. 30 January 1840 was the day that the [[Union Jack]] was flown on the masthead of the ''Herald'', the ship that brought Hobson to the Bay of islands, and that the flag was saluted by guns. By all accounts, 30 January should have been chosen for the anniversary day.&lt;ref name="city of the seas"&gt;{{cite book |ref = harv |last = Reed |first = A. W. |authorlink = Alexander Wyclif Reed |title = Auckland, the city of the seas |year = 1955 |publisher = A.H. &amp; A.W. Reed |location = Wellington | page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, there was no capacity for arranging anniversary celebrations, as the [[Capital of New Zealand|capital]] was in the process of being shifted from [[Okiato]] to [[Auckland]]. In 1842, 30 January fell on a Sunday. These days holidays are sometimes being "Mondayised" and the Auckland anniversary day was "Saturdayised" when it was created in 1842.&lt;ref name="city of the seas" /&gt;

The Honourable [[Daniel Pollen]], who was [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Premier]] in 1875–1876 and a member of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], was determined to have this inaccuracy rectified. Upon his request, a joint committee of the Legislative Council and the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was tasked to prepare a report. On 11 September 1894, the committee's report recommended for the anniversary date to be shifted to 30 January, and that it apply as an anniversary of all of New Zealand, as it was the founding of the nation. The [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]], however, saw no need to change any of the existing arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pollen |first1=Daniel |authorlink1=Daniel Pollen |title=The Anniversary Holiday |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH18941207.2.12.1 |accessdate=15 July 2015 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=XXXI |issue=9688 |date=7 December 1894 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parliamentary Notes |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP18940917.2.47 |accessdate=15 July 2015 |work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=XLVIII |issue=67 |date=17 September 1894 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, Auckland Anniversary Day has been the first day that state and state integrated schools outside of the former Auckland Province can open for the year (the last day being 7 February). However, as schools are not permitted to open on public holidays, schools in the former Auckland Province cannot open until the day after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/EducationInNewZealand/SchoolTermsAndHolidays/SchoolTermsArchive.aspx |title= School terms and holidays archive  – School terms and holidays |publisher= New Zealand Ministry of Education |accessdate= 24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/EducationInNewZealand/SchoolTermsAndHolidays/SummaryAndNotes.aspx |title= Explanatory notes – School terms and holidays |publisher= New Zealand Ministry of Education |accessdate= 24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14498">'''Beef Trust''', in the context of [[American burlesque]], was a [[chorus line]] composed of large and reportedly beautiful women known as Billy Watson's "Beef Trust."  Use of the phrase in [[American burlesque]] was adopted after the turn of the [[20th century]] (around 1909) by Billy Watson ''([[né]]'' Isaac Levy; 1852–1945), a comedian, theater manager, and [[Repertory theatre|stock company]] entrepreneur.
== History ==
Watson branded the name "Beef Trust" to represent a burlesque act featuring large beautiful women ''({{linktext|e.g.}}'' "Three Tons of Women") who performed in his burlesque musical [[revue|revues]].  The act became nationally known as "Billy Watson's 'Beef Trust.'" The phrase "Beef Trust," in [[burlesque]], was exclusive to Watson's show; and the phrase – in connection with Watson's shows – was not [[pejorative]].  That is, the phrase was "founded on a belief that beauty was based on plumpness."&lt;ref name="NYPost 1937 Apr 17" /&gt; Watson conceived and introduced the "Beef Trust" show in an era that followed a sobering reality encapsulated in a 1906 novel, ''[[The Jungle]]'' – [[Upton Sinclair]]'s [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] of the [[Union Stock Yards|Chicago stockyards]],&lt;ref name="Omaha-World-Herald 1945 Feb 11" /&gt; which followed a 1905 Supreme Court decision in favor of the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Government]] against ''[[Swift &amp; Co. v. United States]]'' – a decision that destroyed a [[monopolistic]] [[consortium]] (or [[syndicate]]) of large meatpacking concerns, led by the "Big Six" ([[JBS USA|Swift]], [[Armour and Company|Armour]], [[Morris &amp; Company|Morris]], [[Cudahy Packing Company|Cudahy]], [[Thomas E. Wilson|Wilson]], and Schwartzchild), known as a [[Beef Trust]].

'''''Krausemeyer's Alley'''''

Watson debuted his Beef Trust act – "a chorus of thirty of the largest women ever seen on stage" – May 17, 1909, at the Bijou Theatre, Philadelphia, as an addition to his popular three-act vaudeville skit, ''Krausemeyer's Alley''&lt;ref name="Copyright D13633 1908" /&gt; – a comedy that he had been producing, in various renditions, since 1903, when he introduced it with another of his popular skits, ''Life in Japan.'' The play was originally in two acts:&lt;ref name="NYClipper 1912" /&gt;
&lt;ol type="I" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Krausemeyer's Alley"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Krausemeyer's Christening"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

'''Billy Watson's Chicken Trust'''

From about 1916 to about 1928, Watson produced the "Chicken Trust," a [[chorus line]] composed thin and reportedly beautiful women.  They toured with his show on the Mutual Burlesque circuit.

'''Watson's legacy in burlesque'''

With respect to Watson's legacy in the world of burlesque, specifically his drawing power, [[Sime Silverman]], founding editor of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, declared him a burlesque institution – one that "must be accepted as a foundation of the [[Columbia Amusement Company|Western Burlesque Wheel]]," &lt;ref name="Variety 1912 Nov 29" /&gt; which was also known as the "Empire Burlesque Circuit," of which, Watson was part owner.

'''Common confusion with another Billy Watson'''

Billy Watson of this article is not to be confused with Sliding Billy Watson ''(né'' William Shapiro; 1876–1939), a popular vaudeville comedian.&lt;ref name="Sliding Billy Watson confusion" group=lower-alpha /&gt; &lt;ref name="NYClipper 1911 Feb 18" /&gt;

'''Coates and Grundy's Watermelon Trust'''

At least one other notable [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] show, that of Coates and Grundy, used the "trust" concept; ''{{linktext|to wit}}:'' Coates and Grundy "Watermelon Trust," which ran from about 1900 to 1914.  It started as one of two skits in a show {{nowrap| ... }} the other skit being the "Kissing Trust."  The show was part of a three-day engagement at the Academy of Music in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], October 15, 16, and 17, 1900, featuring James Grundy, Susie Grundy, Sherman Coates, Lulu Coates, and Tenny Russell.  The show was put on by Matt Flynn's Big Sensation Burlesque Company. The two skits featured James Grundy, Susie Grundy, Sherman Coates (billed as Thomas Coates), Lulu Coates, and Tenny Russell.&lt;ref name="Sherman-Coates-bio" group=lower-alpha /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rochester-Democrat 1900 Dec 4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilmington-Morning-News 1900 Oct 16" /&gt;

"The Watermelon Trust" is also the name of a popular [[United States|American]] song composed by Harry C. Thompson, who dedicated it to Coates and Grundy.  Thompson composed it in the style of a [[Slow drag (dance)|slow drag]].  The song was copyrighted in 1906 and published by Barron &amp; Thompson Co., a New York music publishing firm of Ted S. Barron ''(né'' Theodore S. Barron; 1879–1943)&lt;ref name="LI Star-Journal 1943 Nov 28" /&gt; and the composer, Harry Chester Thompson (1876–1947).&lt;ref name="Watermelon Trust, sheet music, 1906" /&gt;

== Historical context of the phrase ==
Prevalent sometime in the mid-1880s, industry trusts, in the [[United States]] – roughly described as unincorporated [[consortium]]s; that is, [[Trust (business)|trusts]] composed of powerful industry concerns – [[Collusion|colluded]] in large-scale market manipulation schemes that were deemed to be [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive]] ''({{linktext|i.e.}},'' injurious to the public).  To stem this practice, a landmark [[United States Code|Federal statute]], the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], was passed by the [[51st United States Congress|51st Congress]] in 1890.

Billy Watson's "Beef Trust" burlesque was not technically a trust. Rather, it was a [[wiktionary:contemporaneous|contemporaneous]] phrase {{nowrap| ... }} [[double entendre]]d [[wiktionary:satire|satirical]] [[word play]] that essentially branded a popular segment of Watson's production that featured large, beautiful women.&lt;ref name="Asbury-Park-Sunday-Press 1942 Aug 16" /&gt;

However, there were trusts within the theater industry.  [[York University]] theater scholar Marlis Schweitzer in her 2015 book, ''Transatlantic Broadway: The Infrastructural Politics of Global Performance,'' highlights examples of {{linktext|warring}} vaudeville trusts across Europe and the U.S. ''({{linktext|circa}}'' 1897). Schweitzer states that, "The formation of syndicates and trusts across various sectors of the theater industry sparked protests among theater artists, journalists, and rival managers."&lt;ref name="Schweitzer 2015" /&gt;

Syndicates and trusts in the theater industry at the turn of the [[20th-century]] should not be confused with the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] [[Theatres Trust]], a national initiative enacted in 1976 to protect and promote theatre.

The '''Birnirk culture''' was a prehistoric [[Inuit]] culture of the [[Alaska North Slope|north coast]] of [[Alaska]], dating from the sixth century A.D. to the twelfth century A.D.&lt;ref name="Gibbon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Guy|last2=Ames|first2=Kenneth|title=Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia |date=1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780815307259 |pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Birnirk culture first appeared on the American side of the Bering Strait, descending from the Old Bering Sea/Okvik culture and preceding the [[Thule (people)|Thule culture]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bockstoce|first1=John|title=The Archaeology of Cape Nome, Alaska|date=1979|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|isbn=9780934718271|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is distinguished by its advanced [[harpoon]] and marine technology.&lt;ref name="Gibbon" /&gt;
A [[burial mound]] of the Birnirk culture was discovered in the town of [[Wales, Alaska|Wales]]; 16 more have been found in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Utqiagvik]] at the "[[Birnirk Site]]," which is now a [[National Historic Landmark]]. An ancient Birnirk village has been found at present-day [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Ukpiaġvik]].

== Culture ==
[[File:Paglagivsi ukpiegvik.jpg|thumb|right|Paglagivsi sign in Utqiagvik, Alaska]]

The Birnirk people lived in small single family dwellings containing either a long or short entrance that led to a single room with sleeping platforms. Houses lacked open fireplaces; instead, heat and light were provided by stone and clay lamps.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturtevant|first1=William C.|title=Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 5: Arctic|date=February 21, 1985|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|isbn=978-0160045806|page=91|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birnirk settlements are thought to have been small, with only a few families living in a settlement at a time.&lt;ref name="Gibbon" /&gt; As such, the concept of the Birnirk people whaling is often debated. Most communities involved in whaling require several crews, which would have been difficult for the Birnirk as they had such small settlements.&lt;ref name="Gibbon" /&gt; However, a whaling harpoon found in Utqiagvik, along with artifacts derived from whale parts found in other sites (baleen, whale bones, and the like) suggest that the Birnirk people were involved in some form of whale hunts.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant" /&gt; They were also known to hunt seals, caribou, birds, and fish using a variety of tools.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant" /&gt;

== Tools ==
A multitude of Birnirk instruments have been found. They were skilled seal hunters, known for their use of innovative equipment, such as ice scratchers to lure seals over frozen waters. They are characterized by the style of the harpoons they used for hunting seals and other marine animals; the heads of the harpoons were self-pointed and had a "single lateral barb and an opposing chipped-stone side blade inset".&lt;ref name="Gibbon" /&gt; In addition to their harpoons, the Birnirk people were known for their use of ground slate weapons. These weapons include knives, blades, arrows, and spears, usually utilized in hunting terrestrial animals.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant" /&gt;

[[File:G 134, Sjonhem.JPG|170px|thumb|right|alt=Runestone from Gotland|The 11th-century [[Varangian runestones#Gotland|runestone G134]] referring to ''Blakumen'' (Sjonhem cemetery, [[Gotland]], Sweden)]]
'''''Blakumen''''' or '''''Blökumenn''''' were a people mentioned in Scandinavian sources dating from the 11th through 13th centuries. The name of their land, '''''Blokumannaland''''', has also been preserved. [[Victor Spinei]], [[Florin Curta]], Florin Pintescu and other historians identify them as [[Romanians]] (variation of the exonym [[Vlachs|Vlach]]), while [[Omeljan Pritsak]] argues that they were [[Cumans]]. [[Judith Jesch]] adds the possibility that the terms meant "black men", the meaning of which is unclear. Modern historians identify ''Blokumannaland'' as the lands south of the [[Lower Danube]] which were inhabited by Vlachs in the Middle Ages, adding that the term may refer to either [[Wallachia]] (to the north of the Danube) or [[Africa]] in the modern [[Icelandic language]].

==''Blakumen'' on runestone G134==

The only preserved example of the variant ''Blakumen'' of the ethnonym was an inscription on a [[runestone]] in the Sjonhem cemetery in [[Gotland]] in Sweden.{{sfn|Pintescu|2001|p=260}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=303}} The forms of the runes on the memorial stone suggest that it was raised in approximately 1050 AD.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=54}}{{sfn|Pritsak|1981|p=373}} According to its inscription, a [[Varangian]] couple named Hróðvísl and Hróðelfr set up the stone in memory of one of their sons, Hróðfúss, who had been treacherously killed by ''Blakumen'' while traveling abroad.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=54}}{{sfn|Pritsak|1981|p=373}}{{sfn|Jesch|2001|pp=257&amp;ndash;258}} Although the inscription does not contain more information about the crime, Spinei expands on the inscription, arguing that Hróðfúss was murdered by Vlachs in the regions east of the [[Carpathian Mountains]].{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=54}} Curta proposes that Hróðfúss was a merchant traveling towards [[Constantinople]], who was attacked and killed by Vlachs north of the [[Lower Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=303}} Jesch likewise suggests that Hróðfúss was a merchant "on a voyage abroad", and assumes that he was murdered by local merchants who betrayed his trust.{{sfn|Jesch|2001|pp=96, 257&amp;ndash;258}} Jesch translates ''Blakumen'' as Vlachs,{{sfn|Jesch|2001|pp=96, 257&amp;ndash;258}} confronting their treachery with their untrustworthiness as claimed by [[Kekaumenos]].{{sfn|Jesch|2001|p=258, note 44}} Jesch also allows for the possibility that the term may have meant "black men",{{sfn|Jesch|2001|pp=257&amp;ndash;258}} in which case the meaning is unclear.{{sfn|Jesch|2001|p=257}}  Pritsak refuses to identify the ''Blakumen'' in the inscription with Vlachs, instead stating that they were [[Cumans]], whose migration towards the westernmost regions of the [[Pontic steppes]] began around the time when the memorial stone was erected.{{sfn|Pritsak|1981|pp=344, 373}} Spinei counters this view on account of the fact that several mentions of the ''Blakumen'' or ''Blökumen'' (for instance in the Eymund's Saga) occur in contexts taking place decades before the earliest appearance of the Cumans in the Pontic steppe.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=106}} Spinei also says that if understood as meaning "Black Cumans", then the term is not concordant with the Varangian ethnic terminology (derived from either Germanic or East-Slavic naming traditions), that it is not attested in mirror forms in other languages (such as *''cumani nigri'' in Latin or *''mauro Koumanoi'' in Greek), and that the juxtaposition of a Scandinavian adjective and a proper name of Greek or Latin origin (at the expense of the German ''Walven'' designating Cumans) to produce ''Blakumen'' ("black Cumans") and ''Blokumannaland'' ("the land of the black Cumans") is highly improbable.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=107}}
{{Quote|Hróðvísl and Hróðelfr, they had stones set up in memory of [their] three sons. This one in memory of Hróðfúss. Blakumen betrayed him on an expedition. God help Hróðfúss' soul.

==''Blökumenn'' in the ''Flatey Book''==
''Blökumen'' are mentioned in the ''[[Flateyjarbók]]'', an [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] manuscript from the late 14th century, which preserved a 13th-century [[hagiography|biography]] of [[Olaf II of Norway|King Olaf of Norway]].{{sfn|Pintescu|2001|p=260}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=303}} This work contains a [[Eymundar þáttr hrings|separate chapter]] on the adventures of a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] prince, Eymund, at the court of Prince Jarizleifr in [[Novgorod]].{{sfn|Pintescu|2001|p=260}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=105}} The chapter narrates that Eymund informed Jarizleifr of the departure of Jarizleifr's brother, Burizlaf, to Tyrkland, and added that Burizlaf was preparing to attack Jarizleifr with a huge army formed by ''Tyrkir'', ''Blökumen'' and other peoples.{{sfn|Pintescu|2001|p=260}} Curta, Spinei and other scholars identify Jarizleifr with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], and Burizlaf with [[Sviatopolk I of Kiev]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=303}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|pp=104&amp;ndash;105}} They argue that the reference to the ''Tyrkir'' and ''Blökumen'' proves that Sviatopolk I hired [[Pechenegs]] and Vlachs when he decided to go to war with Yaroslav.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=303}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|pp=104&amp;ndash;105}} Furthermore, they propose that the ''Blökumenn'' of the ''Flatey Book'', like the ''Blakumen'' of the runic inscription from Gottland, were Vlachs from [[Moldavia]] or [[Wallachia]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=303}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=105}}

{{Quote|"It was easier for [Burizlaf] to lose his banner than his life," said Eymund, "and I understood that he escaped and has been in Tyrkland over the winter. Now he means to lead another army against [Jarizleifr]. He's gathered an unbeatable army with Tyrkir, Blökumen, and a good many of other nasty people, and I've also heard that he's quite likely to give up his Christian faith and hand over both kingdoms to these unpleasant people should he manage to take [[Kievan Rus'|Russia]] away from you [Jarizleifr]".|''[[Eymundar þáttr hrings|Eymund's Saga]]''{{sfn|Pintescu|2001|p=260}}&lt;ref&gt;''Eymund's Saga'' (ch. 8.), pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==''Blokumannaland''==
''Blokumannaland'' is a territory mentioned in [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Heimskringla]]'' ("The Circle of the World") from the 13th century.{{sfn|Pintescu|2001|p=261}} The book narrates how the Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], referred to by the name Kirjalax, invaded ''Blokumannaland'' where he fought against pagan tribes.{{sfn|Pintescu|2001|p=261}} Since these pagans have not been identified, there is disagreement as to the actual date of the Byzantine invasion. For instance, Spinei identifies the events prescribed in the ''Heimskringla'' with the [[Battle of Levounion]] of 1091 AD,{{sfn|Pintescu|2001|p=261}} which ended with the catastrophic defeat of the Pechenegs by the Byzantines.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=120}} He argues that ''Blokumannaland'' refers to a territory inhabited by Vlachs south of the Lower Danube.{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=106}} On the other hand, Sandaaker proposes that the battle took place in 1040 AD, while the latest date of 1122 AD was proposed by Ellis Davidson and Blöndal.{{sfn|Pintescu|2001|p=261}} Alexandru Madgearu says that Sturluson anachronistically mentioned the lands south of the Danube as ''Blokummanaland'', because the latter term referred to the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in Sturluson's time.{{sfn|Madgearu|2013|p=162}} In the modern Icelandic language, the term ''Blokumannaland'' may refer to either [[Wallachia]] or [[Africa]].{{sfn|Pintescu|2001|p=261}}

{{Quote|The following happened in [[Byzantine Empire|Greece]], the time when King Kirjalax ruled there and was on an expedition against Blokumannaland. When he arrived at the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Pézína Plains]], a heathen king advanced against him with an irresistible host. They had with them a company of horsemen, and huge waggons with embrasures on top.|[[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Heimskringla]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Snorri Sturluson: Heimskringla'' (chapter 21.), p. 787.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Bobojon Ghafurov''' (18 December 1908 – 12 July 1977) ([[Tajik alphabet|Tajiki]]: Бобоҷон Ғафуров) or '''Babadzan Gafurovich Gafurov''' ({{lang-ru|Бободжан Гафурович Гафуров}}) was a [[Tajikistan|Tajik]] [[historian]], [[academician]], and the author of several books published in Russian and Tajik, including ''History of Tajikistan'' and ''The Tajiks''. 

== Biography== 
Ghafurov, the son of poet [[Roziya Ozod]],&lt;ref name="faraj.tj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faraj.tj/index.php/tj/sijosat/792-bobo1207on-1170afurov-musulmoni-asil.html |title=Бобоҷон Ғафуров – мусулмони асил |publisher=faraj.tj |date= |accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in the village of Isfisar near [[Khujand]] in [[Tajikistan]]. He received his PhD from the Institute of History of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences#The USSR Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]] in [[Moscow]] in 1941 with a dissertation on "History of the Isma’ili Sect".&lt;ref name=bashiri&gt;Iraj Bashiri, [http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/TajikFigures/TajikFigures.pdf ''Prominent Tajik Figures of the Twentieth Century''], International Borbad Foundation, Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan, Dushanbe, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghafurov's book ''The Tajiks'' (''Tojikon'') is especially influential in modern Tajikistan. Instead of accepting that [[Tajiks]] were simply [[Uzbeks]] who "forgot their language", as Uzbek nationalists commonly argue, ''The Tajiks'' argues that Uzbeks were [[Turkification|Turkified]] from the original [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] population of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Muslims in Central Asia: Expressions of Identity and Change|first=Jo-Ann|last=Gross|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1992|pages=51-53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1944 to 1946, he was the Second Secretary and, from August 1946 to 24 May 1956, he was the [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan|First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan]].&lt;ref name=bashiri/&gt;&lt;ref name=unep&gt;{{

'''Dakkar''' was a [[Somali people|Somali]] historical town located in modern day of [[Somali Region]] in [[Ethiopia]].

==History==
It was the second capital of the medieval [[Adal Sultanate]], after the polity moved its initial headquarters from [[Zeila]] in modern-day northwestern [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Lewispd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I. M.|title=A Pastoral Democracy: A Study of Pastoralism and Politics Among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa|year=1999|publisher=James Currey Publishers|isbn=0852552807|pages=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eK6SBJIckIsC&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G.W.B. Huntingford]] suggests that Dakkar might be the same as the modern [[Chinhahsan]], which is located at the edge of the [[Marar plain]] 15 miles NW of [[Jijiga]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W.B.

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn is related in chapter 18 ([[Surat al-Kahf]], "The Cave") of the Quran. This chapter was revealed to Muhammad when his tribe, Quraysh, sent two men to discover whether the Jews, with their superior knowledge of the scriptures, could advise them on whether Muhammad was a true prophet of God. The rabbis told them to ask Muhammad about three things, one of them "about a man who travelled and reached the east and the west of the earth, what was his story". "If he tells you about these things, then he is a prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit." (Verses [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an! scope="row"|18:83-98]]).

The verses of the chapter reproduced below show Dhul-Qarnayn traveling first to the Western edge of the world where he sees the sun set in a muddy spring, then to the furthest East where he sees it rise from the ocean, and finally northward to a place in the mountains where he finds a people oppressed by Gog and Magog:

==The Alexander Romance and Dhul-Qarnayn==
[[File:Alexander-Coin.jpg|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]] of Alexander the Great shown wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]].]]

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn has its origins in legends of [[Alexander the Great]] current in the Middle East in the early years of the Christian era. According to these legends the [[Scythians]], the descendants of [[Gog and Magog]], once defeated one of Alexander's generals, upon which Alexander built a wall in the [[Caucasus mountains]] to keep them out of civilised lands (the basic elements of the legend are found in [[Flavius Josephus]]). The [[Alexander Romance]] went through much further elaboration in subsequent centuries before eventually finding its way into the Quran through a Syrian version.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122-123}}

Alexander was already known as "the two-horned one" in these early legends.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57}} The reasons for this are somewhat obscure: the scholar [[al-Tabari]] (839-923 CE) held it was because he went from one extremity ("horn") of the world to the other,{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.3}} but it may ultimately derive from the image of Alexander wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]], as popularised on coins throughout the [[Hellenistic]] Near East.{{sfn|Pinault|1992|p=181 fn.71}} The wall may have reflected a distant knowledge of the [[Great Wall of China]] (the 12th century scholar al-[[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Idrisi]] drew a map for [[Roger of Sicily]] showing the "Land of Gog and Magog" in [[Mongolia]]), or of various [[Sassanid Persia]]n walls built in the [[Caspian area]] against the northern barbarians, or a conflation of the two.{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=39}}

Dhul-Qarneyn also journeys to the western and eastern extremities ("qarns", tips) of the Earth.{{sfn|Wheeler|2013|p=96}} In the west he finds the sun setting in a "muddy spring", equivalent to the "poisonous sea" which Alexander found in the Syriac legend. {{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the Syriac original Alexander tested the sea by sending condemned prisoners into it, but the Quran changes this into a general administration of justice.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the east both the Syrian legend and the Quran have Alexander/Dhul-Qarneyn find a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}}

"Qarn" also means "period" or "century", and the name Dhul-Qarnayn therefore has a symbolic meaning as "He of the Two Ages", the first being the mythological time when the wall is built and the second the age of the end of the world when Allah's [[shariah]], the divine law, is removed and Gog and Magog are to be set loose.{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=38}} Modern Islamic apocalyptic writers, holding to a literal reading, put forward various explanations for the absence of the wall from the modern world, some saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are present but invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|p=205-206}}

==Dhul Qarnayn in later literature==

Dhul-Qarnayn the traveller was a favourite subject for later writers. In one of many Arabic and [[Persian literature|Persian]] versions of the [[Alexander the Great in legend|meeting of Alexander with the Indian sages]], the poet and philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]] (Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazālī, 1058–1111) wrote of how Dhul-Qarnayn came across a people who had no possessions but dug graves at the doors of their houses; their king explained that they did this because the only certainty in life is death. Ghazali's version later made its way into the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]''.{{sfn|Yamanaka|Nishio|2006|p=103-105}}

The [[Sufism|Sufi]] poet [[Rumi]] (Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī, 1207-1273), perhaps the most famous of medieval Persian poets, described Dhul Qarnayn's eastern journey. The hero ascends [[Mount Qaf|Mount Qof]], the "mother" of all other mountains (identified with the [[Alborz]] mountains on the northern border of [[Iran]]), which is made of emerald and forms a ring encircling the entire Earth with veins under every land. At Dhul Qarnayn's request the mountain explains the origin of [[earthquakes]]: when God wills, the mountain causes one of its veins to throb, and thus an earthquake results. Elsewhere on the great mountain Dhul Qarnayn meets [[Israfil|Esrafil]] (the [[archangel Raphael]]), standing ready to blow the trumpet on the [[Day of Judgement]].{{sfn|Berberian|2014|p=118-119}}

The Malay-language ''[[Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain]]'' traces the ancestry of several Southeast Asian royal families, such as the [[Sumatra]] [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] royalty,&lt;ref&gt;Early Modern History {{ISBN|981-3018-28-3}} page 60&lt;/ref&gt; from Iskandar Zulkarnain,&lt;ref name="(Malaysia)1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Balai Seni Lukis Negara (Malaysia) |title=Seni dan nasionalisme: dulu &amp; kini |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZL-fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain&amp;dq=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain |year=1999 |publisher=Balai Seni Lukis Negara}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Raja [[Rajendra Chola]] (Raja Suran, Raja Chola) in the ''[[Malay Annals]]''.&lt;ref name="TasaiDjamari2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=S.

==People identified with Dhul-Qarnayn==
[[File:100_manat._Türkmenistan,_2009_a.jpg|thumb|[[Oghuz Khan]] pictured with two horns as Zulqarnayn on a 100 [[Turkmenistan]] [[Turkmenistan manat|manat]] banknote.]]
{{also|Cyrus the Great in the Quran}}
Muslim and other commentators have identified Dhul Qarnayn with [[Alexander the Great in the Quran|Alexander the Great]],{{sfn|Netton|2006|p=72-73}} but some have objected that this cannot be so: Alexander lived only a short time, whereas Dhul-Qarnayn lived for 700 years as a sign of God's blessing; Alexander behaved very badly while Dhul-Qarnayn was a paragon; and Dhul-Qarnayn worshiped [[Allah|only one god]], while Alexander worshiped many.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.2}} Other candidates have been suggested:

*[[Cyrus the Great]], the 6th century BCE [[Achaemenid Persia]]n conqueror.
*[[Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr|Imru'l-Qays]] (died 328 CE), a prince of the [[Lakhmids]] of southern Mesopotamia, an ally first of Persia and then of Rome, celebrated in romance for his exploits.{{sfn|Ball|2002|p=97-98}}
*"[[Messiah ben Joseph]]", a fabulous military saviour expected by [[Yemenite Jew]]s and associated in folk-lore with [[Dhu Nawas]], a semi-legendary 6th century Yemenite king.{{sfn|Wasserstrom|2014|p=61-62}}

[[File:Dorothy Popenoe.png|thumb|'''Dorothy Popenoe''' reading her morning paper.]]
'''Dorothy Popenoe''' (born '''Dorothy Kate Hughes'''; June 1899 in [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford]], [[Middlesex]], England – December 1932) was an [[English people|English]] [[archaeologist]] and [[botanist]].

She attended the Welsh Girls' School in Ashford until the beginning of [[World War I]] when she joined the [[English Land Army]]. After the war, she worked at the [[Kew Garden]] in [[London, England]] as an assistant to Dr. [[Otto Knapf]] until 1923 when she was invited by [[Agnes Chase]] to join the staff of the [[United States National Herbarium]] in the Office of Foreign Plant Introduction. She conducted numerous studies of cultivated [[bamboo]]. Once there, she met and married [[Wilson Popenoe]], the agricultural explorer and later gave birth to their five children. 

In 1925, her husband accepted a position with the [[United Fruit Company]] as the director of agricultural experiments and moved the family to [[Tela]] on the Atlantic Coast of [[Honduras]]. 

While in Honduras, Popenoe developed an interest in archaeology and worked on several Honduran archaeological sites including in the Maya fortress of [[Tenampua]] in 1927 and [[Cerro Palenque]]. Between 1928 and 1932 she excavated in the [[pre-Columbian]] cemetery at [[Playa de los Muertos]]. 

However she could not complete her work because in December 1932, she ate an unripe, uncooked [[akee]] fruit, which is believed to have poisoned her and as a result she died. 

The results of her excavations at Playas de los Muertos were published posthumously in 1934. &lt;ref&gt;Jstor. 2011. Popenoe, Dorothy Kate (1899-1932). http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000048385. (Accessed February 29, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beware Tales of Deadly Plants|work=The Ledger (Lakeland, Florida)|date=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Doris Stone]] included her analysis of the materials Popenoe excavated in her 1941 work "Archaeology of the North Coast of Honduras."

'''Emile Touma''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: إميل توما, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: אמיל תומא, March 16, 1919 – Aug. 27, 1985), was a Palestinian and [[Israeli Arab]] political historian, journalist and theorist.

Emile was born in [[Haifa]] to an [[Orthodox Christian]] family in 1919. He attended the Orthodox School in [[Haifa]], then went to [[Jerusalem]] to the [[St. George's School, Jerusalem|St. George's School]] to complete his high school studies. He enrolled in [[Cambridge University]] but left it in 1939 when [[World War II]] started. In that year he joined the [[Palestine Communist Party]]. In 1944 Touma, [[Fuad Nassar]] and [[Emile Habibi]] established a new newspaper, ''[[Al-Ittihad (Israeli newspaper)|Al-Ittihad]]'', which published its first edition on 14 May 1944.

In January 1947 Touma travelled to a conference of Communist parties of the British Empire in London, where he argued against [[1947 UN Partition Plan|partition of Palestine]].&lt;ref name=Shindler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shindler|first1=Colin|title=Israel and the European Left|date=2012|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|page=133|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested in Lebanon in 1948. In 1949 he returned to [[Haifa]] and continued working as editor-in-chief of ''Al-Ittihad''. In 1965 he joined the eastrization foundation in [[Moscow]] where he got his PhD in History for his dissertation on [[Arab nationalism]],  "The March of the Arab Peoples and the Problems of Arab Unity" ("مسيرة الشعوب العربية ومشاكل الوحدة العربية")

In 1942, along with Dr. [[Haidar Abdel-Shafi]], and the late [[Mukhlis Amer]], Habibi and [[Mufid Nashashibi]], Touma was a founder of the [[Palestinian National Liberation League]]. He wrote 15 books and hundreds of articles about politics, history and culture.

He was married to Chaia Touma, an Israeli ceramic artist of Jewish background, originally from Moldova.

==Commemoration==
*The [[Emil Touma Institute for Palestinian and Israeli Studies]], established in 1986, is named for him. 
*In 2004 a street was named for him in Haifa's [[Wadi Nisnas]].

'''''Fairbottom Bobs''''' is a [[Newcomen engine|Newcomen-type]] [[beam engine]] that was used in the 18th century as a [[steam pump|pumping engine]] to drain a [[colliery]] near [[Ashton-under-Lyne]]. It is probably the world's second-oldest surviving [[steam engine]].{{efn-lr|The [[Newcomen Memorial Engine]] of 1725 at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] is generally considered to be the oldest survivor.}} The engine was installed at Cannel Colliery at [[Fairbottom]] near Ashton-under-Lyne around 1760.&lt;ref name="Crowley" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became known locally as ''Fairbottom Bobs''.{{efn-lr|Crowley&lt;ref name="Crowley" /&gt; name it "Fairbottom Bob".}}

The engine's origin is unclear.&lt;ref name="NRC, Norbury" &gt;{{harvp|Nevell|Roberts|Champness|2004|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was possibly first installed at [[Norbury, Greater Manchester|Norbury]] Coal Works about 9 miles to the west&lt;ref name="Bryan" /&gt; from where the ''[[Manchester Mercury]]'' for 9 October 1764 carried an advertisement for a 'Fire Engine'{{efn-lr|[[Fire Engine (beam engine)|'Fire Engine']] was a common contemporary term for a Newcomen engine (i.e. any engine) around this period. The name survives in place- and pub names.}} for sale. Its cylinder dimensions matched the Fairbottom engine.{{efn-lr|Cylinder dimensions were not standardised on early engines, yet as the cast cylinder represents the main investment in an engine they would remain constant over its lifetime. The cylinder dimensions are the crucial identification factor for many early engines, c.f. [[Old Bess (beam engine)|''Old Bess'']].}}&lt;ref name="NRC, Norbury" /&gt;

The engine's design and construction have been described as "primitive".&lt;ref name="Crowley" /&gt; It had a power rating of 11&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower]]. Its cylinder has an {{convert|28|in}} bore and {{convert|8|ft}} stroke, driving a water pump with a {{convert|8|in}} bore that could raise water from a depth of 240&amp;nbsp;ft at a rate of 14 strokes per minute.&lt;ref name="Bryan" /&gt; The timber beam consisted of single wooden [[king post]] with [[wrought iron]] straps and wooden arch heads at each end. Iron chains linked the beam to the piston rods. An auxiliary arch head drove the engine's air pump.&lt;ref name="Crowley" /&gt; The beam was supported on a pillar of dressed stone resembling a thick wall or narrow pyramid, rather than on the wall of an [[house-built engine|engine house]], a feature found on other engines of this age but rare later.&lt;ref name="Crowley" /&gt; Although foundations and stone floors survive on its site, there is no evidence of an [[House-built engine|engine house]] or roof to protect the engine from the weather.&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;

As was common for mine drainage, pumping at one pit could drain water across a number of pits. The water produced was used to maintain water levels in the [[Ashton Canal]] by draining into the [[Fairbottom Branch Canal]] at Fennyfield Bridge, just south of the engine.&lt;ref name="NRC, closure" &gt;{{harvp|Nevell|Roberts|Champness|2004|pages=87–88, 91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801 the canal company was approached to contribute to the costs of its refurbishment, work that may have been carried out by [[Bateman and Sherratt]] engine builders of Manchester. The original pit appears to have been worked out in the 1820s, although others nearby were working as 'Fairbottom Pits'. Draining the old mine workings and supplying water to the canal kept the engine working after the Cannel Colliery closed until the engine was abandoned in 1826&lt;ref name="NRC, closure" /&gt; or 1827.&lt;ref name="Bryan" &gt;{{Cite book

== Preservation ==
Fairbottom Bobs is preserved at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=GG&gt;{{Citation |title=Chamber Colliery Co|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/The_Basic_Industries_of_Great_Britain_by_Aberconway:_Chapter_VII#Chamber_Colliery_Co |publisher=Grace's Guide|accessdate= 17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine and its site were considered [[Antiquarian#Antiquaries and historians|antiquarian]] by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref &gt;{{harvp|Nevell|Roberts|Champness|2004|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the site taken in 1886 showed it in a reasonable state of preservation. When [[Henry Ford]] was collecting exhibits [[The Henry Ford|for his new museum]] in 1927 a major theme for the museum was 'Americana' but he also sought older industrial archaeological exhibits from Europe. His agent, Herbert F. Morton, found the engine although it had been derelict for a hundred years and was in poor condition. Its owner [[Roger Grey, 10th Earl of Stamford|Lord Stamford]] gave the engine to be preserved in the museum. The engine and its masonry were dismantled and re-assembled in the museum. Its wooden beam was too rotten to be preserved and a replacement was made.&lt;ref name="Bryan" /&gt; Its [[wagon boiler]] was also acquired by the museum&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt; but the engine is now displayed with a [[haystack boiler]] from another engine, similar to one believed to have been used originally.&lt;ref name="Bryan" /&gt;

Some features on the Fairbottom site remain in situ including the chimney base. Archaeological digs took place in 1982, 1990 &amp; 2000 to investigate the remains.&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;

'''Sir George Carew''' (died [[circa|ca.]] 1613) was an English diplomat and historian.

==Life==
He was the second son of [[Thomas Carew (MP for Saltash)|Thomas Carew]] of [[Antony, Cornwall|Antony]] and brother of [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]]. He was educated at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and entered the [[Inns of Court]] before travelling abroad. At the recommendation of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], who conferred on him the honour of a [[knighthood]], he was appointed secretary to [[Christopher Hatton|Sir Christopher Hatton]]. Later, having been promoted to a Mastership in [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]], he was sent as ambassador to the King of [[Poland]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He sat for St. Germans in 1584, for Saltash in 1586, 1588, 1593, and for St. Germans in 1597 and 1601. The honour of knighthood was conferred upon him at Whitehall 23 July 1603.{{sfn|Courtney|1887}}

==Family==
He married Thomazine, the daughter of Sir [[Francis Godolphin (1540–1608)|Francis Godolphin]] and his  first wife  Margaret  Killigrew.{{sfn|Courtney|1887}}

==Writings==
During the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] he was employed in negotiations with [[Scotland]] and for several years was ambassador to the court of France. 
On his return he wrote a ''Relation of the State of France'', written in the classical style of the Elizabethan age and featuring sketches of the leading persons at the court of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]. 
It appears as an appendix to [[Thomas Birch]]'s ''Historical View of the Negotiations between the Courts of England, France and Brussels, from 1592 to 1617'', 1749.&lt;ref group=note&gt;''An historical view of the negotiations between the courts of England, France, and Brussels, from the year 1592 to 1617 : Extracted chiefly from the MS. State-Papers of Sir Thomas Edmondes, Knt. Embassador in France, and at Brussels, and Treasurer of the Household to the Kings James I. and Charles I. and of Anthony Bacon, Esq; brother to the Lord Chancellor Bacon. To which is added, a relation of the state of France, with the characters of Henry IV. and the principal persons of the court, drawn up by Sir George Carew, upon his return from his Embassy there in 1609, and addressed to King James I. Never before printed''. London: for A. Millar&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Relation of the State of Polonia''===
''A Relation of the State of [[Poland|Polonia]]'' is a work produced c.1600 that has been attributed to Carew: in the edition ''Res Polonicae ex archivo Musei Britannici''; (Georgio Carew communiter adscribitur); eddit Carolus H. Talbot. 2 vols. Romae: Institutum Historicum Polonicum, 1965–1967&lt;ref group=note&gt;Also: ''Ein englischer Gesandtschaftsbericht über den polnischen Staat zu Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts.

'''George L. Cowgill''' (December 19, 1929 – July 31, 2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publishingarchaeology.blogspot.com/2018/07/george-cowgill-1929-2018-personal-view.html|title=Publishing Archaeology: George Cowgill, 1929-2018, a personal view|last=Smith|first=Michael E.|authorlink=Michael E. Smith|date=2018-07-31|website=Publishing Archaeology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[anthropologist]] and [[archaeologist]]. He was  a professor of anthropology at [[Arizona State University]] from 1990-2005, and research professor emeritus from 2005 until his death. He received his PhD from [[Harvard]] in 1963 with a dissertation on The Post-Classic Period in the Southern Maya Lowlands. Most of his career has been devoted to research at the ancient Mexican city of [[Teotihuacán]]. He taught at [[Brandeis University]] between 1960 and 1990. Cowgill has made important contributions in a number of areas, including the archaeology of [[Mesoamerica]], the comparative study of early states and cities, and quantitative methods in archaeology.

==Early life==
George Cowgill and his twin brother, linguist [[Warren Cowgill]] (d. 1985), were born near Grangeville, [[Idaho]] in 1929. Along with his brother, George Cowgill graduated from [[Stanford University]] in 1952 with a degree in physics.

==Career==
Cowgill was selected as the 1992 Distinguished Lecturer in Archaeology by the [[American Anthropological Association]]. In 2004 he was awarded the
Alfred Vincent Kidder Award of the American Anthropological Association for his contributions to the archaeology of the Americas. This is one of the most prestigious awards in the field of archaeology.

Cowgill's major archaeological fieldwork and analysis was centered on Teotihuacán.  With [[René Millon]],  Cowgill spent years systematically mapping the city of Teotihuacán in the [[Valley of Mexico]] near modern [[Mexico City]]. In the 1960s he compiled an extensive database of the artifacts collected in the survey. This was one of the first large-scale archaeological databases, and it continues to be used for research today. In the late 1980s, Cowgill co-directed excavations at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid at Teotihuacán with Saburo Sugiyama and Rubén Cabrera. Several of Cowgill's published articles on Teotihuacán are among the most important syntheses of archaeological information on this ancient city.

George Cowgill was also a pioneering researcher in the use of computers, databases, and quantitative methods in archaeology. He published important methodological papers on seriation (a quantitative method for determining the chronology of sites and artifacts) and on artifact classification. He and his students produced innovative studies of the spatial organization of Teotihuacán as determined from his artifact database. They were able to measure the extent of the city and track its growth and decline through the centuries for the first time.

Cowgill made a number of major contributions to the comparative study of ancient states and cities. His 1975 work on demography and population growth helped reorient archaeological studies of ancient population trends, and served to link the study of ancient demography to demographic trends in the modern world. He co-edited an influential 1988 book on the collapse of ancient states and empires. Cowgill also published important works on ancient cities around the world and their comparative analysis.

'''Gonzague de Reynold''' (1880–1970) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] writer, historian, and right-wing political activist. 
Over the course of his six-decade career, he wrote more than thirty books outlining his traditionalist Catholic and Swiss nationalist worldview. 

De Reynold won the [[Schiller Prize]] in 1955, and was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] six times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=12271 |title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With René de Weck and [[Léon Savary]], he formed the ''troika'' of Fribourg writers of the early twentieth century. 

==Life==
A member of the minor Fribourgeois nobility, de Reynold was born at his family's sixteenth-century chateau in [[Cressier, Fribourg|Cressier]]. He studied at [[Collège Saint-Michel]], the [[Sorbonne]], and the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]] before returning to Switzerland to teach philosophy and French literature at the [[University of Bern]] and the [[University of Fribourg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yuYGInXG-CIC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq= Baroque New Worlds edited by Lois Parkinson Zamora and Monika Kaup, pg 102]&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistently "sceptical of liberal democracy and scathing about modernity in all its forms", de Reynold devoted his life to the promotion of Swiss nationalist and right-wing, traditionalist Catholic causes.&lt;ref name= "Shine"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Shine| first = Cormac| title = Papal Diplomacy by Proxy?

Although mostly active in Swiss affairs, in de Reynold's view his Fribourgeois, Swiss, Catholic, and European identities were inextricably linked, and he devoted two decades of his career to international affairs in service of this belief. He served as the Swiss delegate to and ''rapporteur'' of the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]], a body of the [[League of Nations]] and precursor to [[UNESCO]], from its inception in 1922 to its demise in 1939.&lt;ref name= Grandjean/&gt; Along with other prominent Catholics at the League, including [[Oskar Halecki]] and Secretaries-General [[Eric Drummond]] and [[Joseph Avenol]], de Reynold used his position to promote the interests and values of the [[Holy See]] and the Catholic Church, in opposition to the more prevalent secular tendencies within the international organisation.&lt;ref name= Shine/&gt;

'''Hugo Ball''' ({{IPA-de|bal|lang}}; 22 February 1886 – 14 September 1927) was a German author, poet, and essentially the founder of the [[Dada]] movement in European art in Zürich in 1916. Among other accomplishments, he was a pioneer in the development of [[sound poetry]].

== Life and work ==
Hugo Ball was born in [[Pirmasens]], Germany, and was raised in a middle-class Catholic family.&lt;ref name=Diary&gt;Ball, Hugo (1974). ''Flight Out of Time: A Dada Diary by Hugo Ball''. trans. Ann Raimes. New York: Viking Press. {{ISBN|0-670-31841-8}}. {{ISBN|0-670-31841-8}}, {{ISBN|0-670-31841-8}}, {{ISBN|0-670-31841-8}}, {{ISBN|0-670-31841-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied sociology and philosophy at the universities of [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]] (1906–1907). In 1910, he moved to Berlin in order to become an actor and collaborated with [[Max Reinhardt]]. At the beginning of World War I, he tried joining the army as a volunteer, but was denied enlistment for medical reasons. After witnessing the invasion of Belgium, he was disillusioned, saying: "The war is founded on a glaring mistake, men have been confused with machines." Considered a traitor in his country, he crossed the frontier with the cabaret performer and poet [[Emmy Hennings]], whom he would marry in 1920, and settled in Zürich, Switzerland. There, Ball continued his interest in [[anarchism]] and in [[Mikhail Bakunin]] in particular; he also worked on a book of translations of works by Bakunin, which never got published. Although interested in anarchist philosophy, he nonetheless rejected it for its militant aspects, and viewed it as only a means to his personal goal of socio-political enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;"I have examined myself carefully. I could never bid chaos welcome, blow up bridges, and do away with ideas. I am not an anarchist." ''Flight out of Time'', Introduction. University of California Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Hugo Ball created the [[Dada Manifesto]], making a political statement about his views on the terrible state of society and acknowledging his dislike for philosophies in the past claiming to possess the ultimate truth. The same year as the ''Manifesto'', in 1916, Ball wrote his poem "{{lang|de|Karawane}}," a poem consisting of nonsensical words. The meaning, however, resides in its meaninglessness, reflecting the chief principle behind Dadaism. Some of his other best known works include the poem collection ''{{lang|de|7 schizophrene Sonette}}'', the drama ''{{lang|de|Die Nase des Michelangelo}}'', a memoir of the Zürich period ''Flight Out of Time: A Dada Diary'', and a biography of [[Hermann Hesse]], entitled ''{{lang|de|Hermann Hesse. Sein Leben und sein Werk}}'' (1927).

As co-founder of the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in Zürich, he led the Dada movement in Zürich and is one of the people credited with naming the movement "Dada," by allegedly choosing the word at random from a dictionary. His companion and future wife, Emmy Hennings, was also a member of Dada.

His involvement with the Dada movement lasted approximately two years. He then worked for a short period as a journalist for ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Die Freie Zeitung|de}}'' in Bern. After returning to Catholicism in July 1920, Ball retired to the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Ticino]], where he lived a religious and relatively poor life with Emmy Hennings. He contributed to the journal ''[[Hochland (magazine)|Hochland]]'' during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehring|first=Reinhard|title=Carl Schmitt: A Biography|year=2014|publisher=Polity|isbn=0-7456-5224-7|pages=151–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also began the process of revising his diaries from 1910 to 1921, which were later published under the title ''Die Flucht aus der Zeit'' (Flight Out of Time). These diaries provide a wealth of information concerning the people and events of the Zürich Dada movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theartstory.org/artist-ball-hugo.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Sant'Abbondio]], Switzerland, of stomach cancer on 14 September 1927.&lt;ref name=Diary /&gt;

His poem "Gadji beri bimba" was later adapted to the song "[[I Zimbra]]" on the 1979 [[Talking Heads]] album ''[[Fear of Music]]''; he received a writing credit for the song on the track listing. A voice-cut-up collage of his poem "Karawane" by German artist [[Kommissar Hjuler]], member of [[Boris Lurie]]'s [[NO!art]] movement, was released on an LP on the Greek Shamanic Trance label in 2010. "Karawane" was also set to music in 2012 by Australian composer [[Stephen Whittington]] as an "anti-[[song cycle]]" of seventeen song—one for each line of the poem—lasting approximately two minutes each.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|TFLKgpaBbNw|"Karawane," Robert Macfarlane and Stephen Whittington}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same poem and its historical context was used by [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] for his 28-minute composition for mixed choir and orchestra, ''[[Karawane]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/49670 ''Karawane'' (2014)], details and analysis, [[Chester Music]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Il-yeon''' (or '''Iryeon''') (1206–1289) was a Buddhist monk and All-Enlightened National Preceptor (보각국사, 普覺國師) during the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty of Korea.  His birth name was Kim Gyeong-myeong (金景明), and his [[courtesy name]] was Hoe-yeon (晦然).

He became a monk at [[Muryangsa]] Temple at the age of nine, and passed the [[Korean Buddhism#Seon|Seon]] [[gwageo|national examination]] at 22; at 54 he was given the rank of Great Teacher.  When he was seventy-eight, King [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo|Chungnyeol]] offered him a position of rank and tried to make him National Preceptor, but Iryeon declined.  The king again appointed him National Preceptor, and Iryeon came down to the capital [[Kaesong]] (then Gaegyeong), but soon returned to the mountains on the pretext that his aged mother was sick.  On the eighth day of the seventh month in 1289, he held an interview with various monks, and then died.

Iryeon is known as a prolific writer, and according to the inscription on his tombstone he wrote some 80 volumes on Buddhist topics.  But today only one book of his survives:  the ''[[Samguk Yusa]]'', which is not mentioned in the inscription at all.

'''Jaabaali Maharshi''' (also known as Jabali Rishi) was a Hindu saint and philosopher, and there were other saints and philosophers that have descended from him. The city of [[Jabalpur]] is named after him.

He descended from [[Satyakama Jabala]], the son of a maidservant who was Sudra by caste. Satyakama was given the [[upadhyaya]] ceremony by a sage named [[Gautama]], upon which he became a Brahmin. Jabala means "''cowherder''."

==Life==
Jaabaali spent many years meditating on the banks of the [[Narmada River]]. The cave and marble rocks in this area were sometimes used as shelters. Jaabaali lived and practiced [[tapas]] in the sacred location of [[Tirumala]], a place known today as "Jabali Theertham", near [[Tirupati]]. People now visit this place to solve serious Graha Doshas and worship the Gods [[Hanuman]] and [[Ganesha|Vigneswara]].

==Descendents==
Jaabaali gotra is briefly used among [[Brahmin]]s in South India. Gotra is a man's descendents from the grandson onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ooc6AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=jabali+gotra&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i8CZ7QbmkA&amp;sig=EAL_-m3Esd2XtWWcnQ-PO-EaAxg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7lXrU_uVOsHt8AW2_oKwDg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=jabali%20gotra&amp;f=false|title=The Early Brahmanical System of Gotra and Pravara|work=google.com.au|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jabali gotra lineage follows [[Bhargava]] -&gt; [[Pravaras|pravaram]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trsiyengar.com/id138.shtml |title=Srivaishnavam, Gothra Pattika, Gotra or DNA?

==Jabalis in history==

===Jabali of the Valmiki Ramayana===
The Ramayana of Valmiki was altered later to depict Jabali as a Charvaka Nastik or a Buddhist, however both Charvaka and the Gautama Buddha had come generations or centuries after Rama, as Rama is claimed in Buddhist scriptures as a past incarnation of the Gautama Buddha. In the altered Ramayana, Rama strongly opposes and targets atheists as seen in Ayodhya Kanda of Ramayana, which reads, "atheists (nastikavadins) are fools who think they to be wise and who are experts in leading people to doom and ruin." Dasharatha’s council of priest-ministers headed by a religious authority, Sage Vasishtha, included sage Jabali, a materialist and atheist. Charvaka philosophy of atheism and materialism was widely discussed within Hinduism.

Rama strongly condemns atheism, but [[Dasharatha]]’s council of ministers included Jabali, who is a proclaimed Naastik. Bauddhavatara was accepted during the period. Hence, followers of atheism enjoyed the same privileges as the religious followers. The Indian Government recognizes Buddhism, which is considered Nastic by Hindu Orthodoxy and enjoys the privileges of secularism and religious tolerance provisions under the law.

In Ramayana after performing last rites to Dasharatha, Bharata proceeds to the forest where Rama lives and begs him repeatedly to come back to Ayodhya and assume the responsibilities of a king, though it would call for breaking his promise given to his father to take care of the welfare of the citizens of Ayodhya, which is a priority for him. He finds strong support from Jaabaali, one of the members of Dasharatha's council of priests. Jaabaali, with his non-ethical Naastikavaada (Atheistic arguments), tries to convince Rama that it would be fitting and proper within the framework of Kshatriya Dharma to do so. Rama became quite upset by his distorted arguments and wrong council. His outburst is as follows.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I denounce the action of my father who picked up (as his consular priest) you (Jaabaali), a staunch unbeliever, who has not only stayed away from the path of righteousness but also whose mind is set on wrong path (opposed to the dharmic Vedic path), (nay) who is moving about (in the world) with such an ideology (conforming to the doctrine of Chaarvaaka, who believes only in the world of sensual pleasures) as has been set forth in your foregoing speech.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is well known fact that a follower of Buddha (condemning the Vedas) deserves to be punished precisely in the same way as a thief (inasmuch as heretic robs people of their faith); and know an unbeliever (a follower of Chaarvaaka philosophy) to be on par with Buddha. Therefore (amongst such unbelievers) he who is most tamable should undoubtedly be so punished in the interest of the people; for no other cause should a wise man (even) stand face to face with an unbeliever (but should shun him).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Mentions in Balakanda ====
Then King Dasharatha said to his best minister Sumantra, "Let the Vedic scholars and ritual conductors like Sages Suyajna, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali, and Kaashyapa, along with the family priest Vashishta, as well as other Vedic Brahmans that are there, they all be invited swiftly..."

===Jabali of the Jabali Upanishad===
In the ''[[Jabali Upanishad]]'', Jabali tells the [[Pasupata]] philosophy about [[Jiva]] ("pasu") and Tsa (Pasupati).

Jabali wrote "Jabala Upanishad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dharmicscriptures.org/Jaabaali%20Upanishad.pdf |title=Jabali Upanishad |publisher=Dharmicscriptures.org|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celextel.org/upanishads/atharva_veda/|title=Upanishads - Atharva Veda|author=|work=Celextel.org|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the story of Satyakama Jabali from Samaveda-Chandogyopanishad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vedaravindamu.wordpress.com/2011/09/23/satyakaamuni-katha-the-story-of-satyakaama-jaabaali/|title=1.13 – Satyakaamuni Katha(సత్యకాముని కథ): The story of Satyakama Jabali - vedāravindamu|work=Vedāravindamu|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explains the true form of “maatru” devata, the duties a woman has to perform before she takes up the seat of “maatru” devata. It involves the relationship between the three forms or bodies of mother and child (gross, subtle and causal). It covers the true form of [[satya]] and how satya is the first step for attaining “Brahma Vidya”.  It also covers the true form of “[[gotra]]”.

This is an excerpt of Jabali literature explaining one of the duties a woman has to perform before she takes up the seat of "maatru" devata:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jaabali lived in a small shack of sticks and straws - a menage of crocks and clay-pot, where one earned out of hands and ate out of bracts. She threw a few twigs of firewood under the three stones and blew hard on them to kindle the fire. Then, she put a pail of water on the stove for heating. Those blasted twigs - they would burn, and go out quickly, belching smoke. The smoke would rise and spread everywhere. It would reach her eyes, and hurt them. So, she sat near the stove, she reflected. She had to keep on putting in the twigs of sorrow, just to keep alive. Only then could she expect a little warmth of happiness, and a flame of hope to rise. At times, sorrows and anguish wouldn't budge off from her neck, like the wet twigs - no matter how hard she blew upon them, the fire would fail to rise. It brought a dizziness to her mind, and tears to her eyes. The whole future seemed to plunge into darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Satyakaam and Jabali Amitabh and Vijay Diwan|title=Indian Literature|volume=43|date=1999|pages=45–50|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|jstor=23342845}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jabali of Nellitirtham (Sri Somanatheshwara Cave Temple)===
Jabali Maharshi Brindavana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nellitheertha.com/nelli-desc.htm|title=Description of the Temple-Sri Kshetra Nellitheertha|work=Nellitheertha.com|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was recently constructed at Sri Somanatheshwara Cave temple, [[Nellitheertha]], [[Karnataka]]. The Nellitheertha Somanatheshwara Cave temple is a holy temple in South Kanara. The main deity of the temple is Sri Somanatheshwara (Shiva), but it also honors [[Ganapati]] and Jabali Maharshi himself. In typical Tulu-nadu tradition, the temple also has its set of “Bhootas“. Bhootas are considered as the “Ganas” or warrior-assistants of the demigods. The main bhootas of the Nellitheertha temple are Pili-Chamundi (Pili means Tiger in Tulu), Kshetrapala, Raktheshwari and Doomavathy.

===Jabali of Venkatachala Hill, [[Tirumala]]===
The temple here in Jamalpuram, Telangana is known as Jabali Tirtha. It is here that a Jabali Rishi performed penance and worshiped Vishnu. There is also a ''Venkatachala Purana'', which was compiled. At this pilgrimage centre, Vishnu today is worshiped as Lord Venkatachala.

===Jabali of Papavinasam Thirtham===
A Jabali had also meditated and performed penance here.

Papavinasam Theertham is around 2 miles from [[Tirumala]] and is a beautiful waterfall. Like the Venkatachala Hill, at this pilgrimage centre, Vishnu today is worshiped as Lord Venkatachala. [[Hanuman]] is also worshiped here.

===Jabali of Jalore===
There was also a Jabali of Jalore, Rajasthan, of whom little is known. The city Jalore used to be known as Jabalipura.

===Jabali of Valad===
Jabali of this village in Gujarat had a daughter named Bala, who is said to have founded the village and after her it became known as "Balapuri", and eventually as "Balad" and "Valad."

There is still an idol of Saint Jabali in the village.&lt;ref&gt;P. 416 ''Gujarat State Gazetteers: Gandhinagar'' By Gujarat (India)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adhram of Madhavtirth is also situated here.

Until joining the [[Harvard University]] faculty in 2011, '''Jeffrey Schnapp''' was the director of the Stanford Humanities Lab from its foundation in 1999 through 2009. At [[Stanford University]] he occupied the Pierotti Chair in Italian Literature and was professor of French &amp; Italian, Comparative Literature, and German Studies. Though primarily based in the field of Italian studies, he has played a pioneering role in several areas of transdisciplinary research and led the development of a new wave of [[digital humanities]] work. His research interests extend from antiquity to the present, encompassing the material history of literature, the history of 20th-century architecture and design, and the cultural history of science and engineering. Trained as a Romance linguist, Schnapp is the author or editor of twenty five books and a large corpus of essays on authors such as Virgil, Dante, [[Hildegard of Bingen]], Petrarch, Machiavelli, and [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and on topics such as late antique patchwork poetry, futurist and dadaist visual poetics, the cultural history of coffee consumption, glass architecture, and the iconography of the pipe in modern art. His book ''Crowds'' was the recipient of the Modernist Studies Association prize for best book of 2006.

At Harvard, he is the Carl Pescosolido Professor of Romance and Comparative Literatures, teaches on the faculty of the Department of Architecture at the [[Graduate School of Design]], and serves as faculty co-director of the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society]]. He is the founder/faculty director of metaLAB (at) Harvard: an "idea foundry, knowledge design laboratory, and production studio" founded in early 2011. 

Schnapp was the co-editor of the Johns Hopkins University Press quarterly ''[[Modernism/modernity]]'', the official journal of the Modernist Studies Association, up through the end of 2014. He is also a guest curator who has collaborated with several leading museums: among them, the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]], the [[Cantor Arts Center]], the [[Wolfsonian-FIU]], the [[Triennale di Milano]], and the Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio. His [[Trento]] Tunnels project — a 6000 sq. meter pair of superhighway tunnels at the entrance to the Northern Italian city of Trent, repurposed as an experimental history museum, has undergone several editions since 2008: among them, "I Trentini e la Grande Guerra (Il popolo scomparso/la sua storia ritrovata)" (2008-2009), "Storicamente ABC" (2010-2011), and "Ski Past" (2012). "Panorama of the Cold War," carried out with Elisabetta Terragni (Studio Terragni Architetti) and Daniele Ledda (XY comm), was exhibited in the Albanian Pavilion of the 2012 Venice Biennale of Architecture and in Erasmus Effect – Architetti italiani all’estero / Italian Architects Abroad at the [[MAXXI]] (Dec. 2013-April 2014). He also served as exhibition project consultant for BZ ’18-’45, a documentation center built under Marcello Piacentini’s [[Bolzano Victory Monument]] open to the public since July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Obermair | first = Hannes | contribution = Monuments and the City—an almost inextricable entanglement | editor = Matthias Fink ''et al.'' | title = Multiple Identitäten in einer „glokalen Welt“—Identità multiple in un "mondo glocale"—Multiple identities in a "glocal world" | pages = 88—99 | publisher = [[Eurac Research]] | place = Bozen-Bolzano| year = 2017 | isbn = 978-88-98857-35-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective June 2015, he assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of [[Piaggio]] Fast Forward&lt;ref&gt;http://www.piaggiofastforward.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, a Cambridge-based company devoted to developing innovative solutions to the transportation challenges of the contemporary world. Piaggio Fast Forward is a subsidiary of the Milan-based Piaggio Group, known throughout the world for iconic vehicles like the Vespa and iconic brands like Aprilia and Moto Guzzi. Piaggio Fast Forward’s first generation of robotic vehicles has received extensive worldwide coverage on radio and television, including in forums such as the Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, Wired, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, CNN Tech, SlashGear, Dezeen, and Endgadget.

==metaLAB==
In February 2011, Schnapp founded a new laboratory at Harvard under the aegis of the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]]: metaLAB (at) Harvard with his collaborators James Burns, Daniele Ledda, Kara Oehler, Gerard R. Pietrushko, and Jesse Shapins. It addresses "networked culture." MetaLAB has established a leading position in the field of experimental arts and humanities. Its personnel has evolved over the years and it currently defines itself as "a concept foundry, knowledge-design lab, and process studio proposing new forms for the networked arts, humanities, and sciences." The About page of its website reads: "Digging through dark abundance of media, material, and data collections, metaLAB embraces the processual artifacts buried within the lives of digital and physical objects. As the stories of these objects constellate with a shift from the micro to the macro, they prompt research challenges and opportunities that expose common galaxies for the academy, industry, and the public sphere. To demonstrate and translate unearthed histories and unmapped patterns, metaLAB research inquiries mature as expressive provocations that strive to make invisible connections visible. With a team composed variously of scholars, writers, designers, developers, and filmmakers, metaLAB projects manifest as experiments in publication, pedagogy, and curation showcased in print, on the web, and in exhibited spaces. By combining traditional modes of practice, metaLAB research infuses scholarship with the enterprising spirit of hacking, making, and artistic investigation."

===''The Library Beyond the Book''===
Schnapp's ''The Library Beyond the Book'' of 2013 (published in 2014), written with Matthew Battles, surveys elements of [[libraries]] potentially relevant to today's transitional [[digital era]]. It examines past mainstays such as [[Library#Buildings|buildings]], [[Stack (library architecture)|shelves]], [[Library catalog|catalogs]], access [[Library card|cards]], [[reference desk]]s, [[carrel desk]]s, and [[librarians]], and wonders how each might find new purpose in the near future. It discusses the importance of [[databases]], [[digital preservation]], [[mobile libraries]], [[serendipity]], [[cloister]]ing, and [[Real life#Related terminology|meatspaces]], and mentions initiatives such as Rio de Janeiro's [[Manguinhos Library Park]], the pop-up [[The People's Library|Occupy Wall Street Library]],  [[Chattanooga Public Library]]'s [[makerspace]], the [[Digital Public Library of America]], and London's [[Idea Store]].&lt;ref name="SchnappBattles2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeffrey T. Schnapp|author2=Matthew Battles|title=The Library Beyond the Book |year= 2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-72503-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of one reviewer, the authors "imagine six plausible scenarios for serving tomorrow’s diverse information consumers, situating libraries as everything from study shelters to civic institutions functioning as mobile libraries, reading rooms promoting social change, and/or event-driven knowledge centers."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Jerry P.

===''Cold Storage''===

Among metaLAB's recent experiments is "Cold Storage": an experimental web documentary (or so-called database documentary) made up of over 500 media objects developed in 2013-2015 as an “animated archive” and extension of the volume "The Library Beyond the Book," published in 2014 in the metaLABprojects series by Harvard University Press. The work was directed by Cristoforo Magliozzi and produced by Schnapp.

The '''Dr. John D. Cooper Archaeological and Paleontological Center''', or '''Cooper Center''', was established by OC Parks and [[California State University, Fullerton]] in order to conserve, archive and manage the Orange County [[Archaeology]] and [[Paleontology]] Collections, including six million fossils. The center opened in July 2011 and  is in [[Orange County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.ocregister.com/articles/fossils-644813-county-boxes.html|title=Orange County's fossils being cataloged and preserved|author=BRITTANY HANSON|date=10 December 2014|work=The Orange County Register|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kim Nichole Reed-Campbell''' (born June 6, 1975 in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jane Erikson | publisher = American valor | url = http://www.americanvalor.net/heroes/332 | title = Her plane shot up over Iraq, Air Force captain completed a dangerous flight to safety }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[United States Air Force]] officer and [[U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Ratings|Senior Pilot]] in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. She was decorated for piloting her [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] back to base in southern [[Iraq]] after taking heavy anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) damage in aerial combat over [[Baghdad]] during [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] in 2003. After her tour of duty in Iraq ended, Campbell gave lectures throughout the United States about her experience, including one at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]. Kim Campbell was promoted to the rank of Major in the autumn of 2006.

She is married to another A-10 pilot, Colonel Scott Campbell, whom she met at the Air Force Academy.

== Early life and education ==
Campbell is the daughter of the former mayor of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] (and former USAF [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]]) [[Chuck Reed]]. She joined the [[Civil Air Patrol]] as a cadet at age 13 and made her first solo flight in a civilian aircraft over San Jose at age 16.

She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in 1997 where she was the cadet wing commander, as was her father during his time as a cadet at the Air Force Academy, the first time that a father and daughter both served as cadet wing commander.&lt;ref name="reedc2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/02.20.03/reed-0308.html|title=Captain America's Rebellion |last= Gottlieb | first= Allie| date= 2003-02-20| publisher= Metroactive News| accessdate= 2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She holds a degree in International Security Studies from the [[University of Reading]], [[United Kingdom]], and a [[Master of Business Administration|Masters in Business Administration]] from [[Imperial College London]], United Kingdom, which she undertook while on a [[Marshall Scholarship]].

==April 2003 incident==
During a mission over Baghdad on April 7 2003, her aircraft suffered damage. "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as we were on our way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud...  I lost all [[hydraulics]] instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs."  She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling because there was no way I wanted to eject over Baghdad."  With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had no doubt in my mind I was going to land that airplane."  Landing was tricky: "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Wounded+Warthog%3A+an+A-10+Thunderbolt+II+pilot+safely+landed+her...-a0116518790| title = Wounded Warthog: an A-10 Thunderbolt II pilot safely landed her "Warthog" after it sustained significant damage from enemy fire|author=Jason Haag |date=2004-04-01 |work =Combat Edge |via=thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=2014-12-23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kim campbell damage a10.jpg|thumb|caption|Kim Campbell's A-10 suffered extensive damage.]]
For this action in aerial combat she was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (USA)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref name = "reeddfc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=42653 |title=Kim N.

On the ground it was discovered that her A-10 had sustained damage to one engine and to the redundant hydraulic systems, disabling the flight controls, landing gear and brakes, and horizontal stabilizer. A detailed inspection revealed hundreds of holes in the airframe and that large sections of the stabilizer and hydraulic controls were missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/events/eventDetail.cfm?eventID=133 |title=GE Aviation Lecture.

The '''Kingdom of Judah''' ({{lang-he-n|מַמְלֶכֶת יְהוּדָה}} ''Mamléḵeṯ Yehudāh''; {{lang-akk|𒅀𒌑𒁕𒀀𒀀}} ''Ya'uda''; {{lang-arc|𐤁‬𐤉‬𐤕‬𐤃𐤅‬𐤃}} ''bytdwd'') was an [[Iron Age]] kingdom of the [[Southern Levant]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] depicts it as the successor to a [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]], but historians are divided about the veracity of this account. In the 10th and early 9th centuries BCE, the territory of Judah appears to have been sparsely populated, limited to small rural settlements, most of them unfortified.&lt;ref name=mazar&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/2503754 |title=Archaeology and the Biblical Narrative: The Case of the United Monarchy |journal=Pp. 29-58 In: One God – One Cult - One Nation.

Significant academic debate exists around the character of the Kingdom of Judah. Little archaeological evidence of an extensive, powerful Kingdom of Judah before the late 8th century BCE has been found; [[Nimrud Tablet K.3751]], dated c. 733 BCE, is the earliest known record of the name Judah (written in [[Assyrian cuneiform]] as Yaudaya or KUR.ia-ú-da-a-a).&lt;ref name=Pitcher&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tu02muKUVJ0C&amp;pg=PA229 |title=The Pitcher is Broken: Memorial Essays for Gösta W.

Archaeologists of the [[Biblical Minimalism|minimalist school]] doubt the extent of the Kingdom of Judah as depicted in the Bible. Around 1990–2010, an important group of archaeologists and biblical scholars formed the view that the actual Kingdom of Judah bore little resemblance to the biblical portrait of a powerful monarchy. These scholars say the kingdom was no more than a small tribal entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5008984 |title=The keys to the Kingdom |first=Asaf |last=Shtull-Trauring |newspaper=Haaretz |date=6 May 2011 |quote=...an important group of archaeologists and biblical scholars formed the view that in reality the kingdom of David and Solomon bore little resemblance to the biblical portrait of an extensive, powerful, united monarchy. This view derives primarily from the fact that no 10th century BCE archaeological finds exist that could corroborate claims of the existence of a magnificent biblical kingdom extending from Be'er Sheva in the south to Dan in the north. Accordingly, these scholars and archaeologists conclude that the so-called kingdom was no more than a small tribal entity, meager in substance and sparse in population, which did not extend beyond the boundaries of Jerusalem and its immediate surroundings. |access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unearthed" /&gt;

However, [[Yosef Garfinkel]] has written in a preliminary report published by the [[Israeli Antiquities Authority]] that finds at the [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]] site support the notion that an urban society already existed in Judah in the late 11th century BCE.&lt;ref name=khirbet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1989 |title=Khirbat Qeiyafa 2010–2011: Preliminary Report |volume=124 |year=2012 |work=Israel Antiquities Authority |date=19 April 2012 |access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other archaeologists say that the identification of Khirbet Qeiyafa as an Israelite settlement is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israeli Archaeologists Find Ancient Text |agency=Associated Press |date=30 October 2008 |first=Matti |last=Friedman |newspaper=AOL news |url=http://news.aol.com/article/israeli-archaeologists-find-ancient-text/233027?icid=100214839x1212506023x1200749390 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103152712/http://news.aol.com/article/israeli-archaeologists-find-ancient-text/233027?icid=100214839x1212506023x1200749390 |archive-date=3 November 2008 |access-date=12 October 2018 |quote=The finds have not yet established who the residents were, says Aren Maier, a Bar Ilan University archaeologist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/archaeological-find-stirs-debate-on-david-s-kingdom-1.5220630 |title=Archaeological Find Stirs Debate on David's Kingdom |work=Haaretz |date=9 May 2012 |access-date=12 October 2018 |quote=Prof. Nadav Na'aman, a historian and archaeologist at Tel Aviv University, discounts Garfinkel and Ganor's conclusions. "These are beautiful finds but they are not special in that similar ones have been found in various places, and they should therefore not be connected in any way to the ark," nor to the Temple in Jerusalem, says Na'aman. (...) He said he found the combination on one of the items of lions and doves very interesting. "The dove is connected to a fertility goddess, and this combination hints that the model belonged to a cultic site of a fertility goddess. I think Qeiyafa was a Canaanite site that had no connection to Jerusalem," he added.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of Jerusalem in the 10th century BCE is a major subject of debate.&lt;ref name="mazar"/&gt; The oldest part of Jerusalem and its original urban core is the City of David, which does not show evidence of significant Israelite residential activity until the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qjkz_8EMoaUC&amp;pg=PA302#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Biblical History and Israel's Past: The Changing Study of the Bible and History |first1=Megan Bishop |last1=Moore |first2=Brad E. |last2=Kelle |date=17 May 2011 |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |access-date=12 October 2018|isbn=9780802862600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unique administrative structures such as the [[Stepped Stone Structure]] and the [[Large Stone Structure]], which originally formed one structure, contain material culture dated to Iron I.&lt;ref name="mazar"/&gt; On account of the apparent lack of settlement activity in the 10th century BCE, Israel Finkelstein argues that Jerusalem in the century was a small country village in the Judean hills, not a national capital, and Ussishkin argues that the city was entirely uninhabited. Amihai Mazar contends that if the Iron I/Iron IIa dating of administrative structures in the City of David are correct, (as he believes) "Jerusalem was a rather small town with a mighty citadel, which could have been a center of a substantial regional polity."&lt;ref name="mazar"/&gt;

== Biblical narrative ==
{{See also|History of ancient Israel and Judah}}
{{History of Israel}}
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the kingdom of Judah resulted from the break-up of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel]] (1020 to about 930 BCE) after the northern tribes refused to accept [[Rehoboam]], the son of [[Solomon]], as their king. At first, only the [[tribe of Judah]] remained loyal to the [[Davidic line|house of David]], but soon after the [[tribe of Benjamin]] joined Judah. The two kingdoms, Judah in the south and [[kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] in the north, coexisted uneasily after the split until the destruction of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] by [[Assyria]] in c. 722/721.

The major theme of the Hebrew Bible's narrative is the loyalty of Judah, and especially its kings, to [[Yahweh]], which it states is the God of [[Israelites|Israel]]. Accordingly, all the kings of Israel and almost all the kings of Judah were "bad", which in terms of Biblical narrative means that they failed to enforce [[monotheism]]. Of the "good" kings, [[Hezekiah]] (727–698 BCE) is noted for his efforts at stamping out [[idolatry]] (in this case, the worship of [[Baal]] and [[Asherah]], among other traditional Near Eastern divinities),&lt;ref name="Borowski"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholar.cc.emory.edu/scripts/ASOR/BA/Borowski.html |title=''Hezekiah's Reforms and the Revolt against Assyria'' |archive-date=23 July 1997 |first=Oded |last=Borowski |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970723115326/http://scholar.cc.emory.edu/scripts/ASOR/BA/Borowski.html |access-date=12 October 2018}}, Emory University, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; but his successors, [[Manasseh of Judah]] (698–642 BCE) and Amon (642–640 BCE), revived idolatry, drawing down on the kingdom the anger of Yahweh. King [[Josiah]] (640–609 BCE) returned to the worship of Yahweh alone, but his efforts were too late and Israel's unfaithfulness caused God to permit the kingdom's destruction by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Siege of Jerusalem (587 BCE)]].

However it is now fairly well established among academic scholars that the Biblical narrative is not an accurate reflection of religious views in either Judah or particularly Israel during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Appearance of Pantheon in Judah |page= 27 |first=Lowell K. |last=Handy |title=The Triumph of Elohim |editor-first=Diana Vikander |editor-last=Edelman |publisher=W.

=== Relations with the Northern Kingdom ===
{{Kings of Judah}}
For the first sixty years, the kings of Judah tried to re-establish their authority over the northern kingdom, and there was [[Jeroboam's Revolt|perpetual war]] between them. [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and Judah were in a state of war throughout [[Rehoboam]]'s seventeen-year reign. Rehoboam built elaborate defenses and strongholds, along with fortified cities. In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, [[Shishak]], [[pharaoh]] of [[Egypt]], brought a huge army and took many cities. In the [[sack of Jerusalem (10th century BC)|sack of Jerusalem (10th century BCE)]], Rehoboam gave them all of the treasures out of the temple as a tribute and Judah became a vassal state of Egypt.

Rehoboam's son and successor, [[Abijah of Judah]] continued his father's efforts to bring Israel under his control. He fought the [[Battle of Mount Zemaraim]] against [[Jeroboam]] of Israel and was victorious with a heavy loss of life on the Israel side. According to the [[books of Chronicles]], Abijah and his people defeated them with a great slaughter, so that 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell slain&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|13:17|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which Jeroboam posed little threat to Judah for the rest of his reign and the border of the [[tribe of Benjamin]] was restored to the original tribal border.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|13:20|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abijah]]'s son and successor, [[Asa of Judah]], maintained peace for the first 35 years of his reign,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|16:1|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which time he revamped and reinforced the fortresses originally built by his grandfather, Rehoboam. 2 Chronicles states that at the [[Battle of Zephath]], the Egyptian-backed chieftain [[Zerah]] the [[Ethiopia]]n and his million men and 300 chariots was defeated by Asa's 580,000 men in the Valley of Zephath near [[Maresha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|14:9–15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible does not state whether Zerah was a pharaoh or a general of the army. The Ethiopians were pursued all the way to [[Gerar]], in the coastal plain, where they stopped out of sheer exhaustion. The resulting peace kept Judah free from Egyptian incursions until the time of [[Josiah]] some centuries later.

In his 36th year, Asa was confronted by [[Baasha of Israel]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; who built a fortress at Ramah on the border, less than ten miles from Jerusalem. The result was that the capital was under pressure and the military situation was precarious. Asa took gold and silver from the Temple and sent them to [[Ben-Hadad I]], king of [[Aram-Damascus]], in exchange for the Damascene king canceling his peace treaty with Baasha. Ben-Hadad attacked Ijon, Dan, and many important cities of the [[tribe of Naphtali]], and Baasha was forced to withdraw from Ramah.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|16:2–6|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asa tore down the unfinished fortress and used its raw materials to fortify [[Geba (city)|Geba]] and [[Mizpah in Benjamin]] on his side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|16:1–7|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asa's successor, [[Jehoshaphat]], changed the policy towards Israel and instead pursued alliances and co-operation with the northern kingdom. The alliance with [[Ahab]] was based on marriage. This alliance led to disaster for the kingdom with the battle of [[Ramoth-Gilead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|22:1–33|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then entered into an alliance with [[Ahaziah of Israel]] for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with [[Ophir]]. But the fleet that was then equipped at [[Ezion-Geber]] was immediately wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the cooperation of the king of Israel, and although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|20:35–37|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|22:48–49|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently joined [[Jehoram of Israel]] in a war against the [[Moab]]ites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful, with the Moabites being subdued. However, on seeing [[Mesha]]'s act of offering his own son in a [[human sacrifice]] on the walls of [[Al-Karak|Kir-haresheth]] filled Jehoshaphat with horror and he withdrew and returned to his own land.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|3:4–27|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jehoshaphat]]'s successor, [[Jehoram of Judah]] formed an alliance with Israel by marrying [[Athaliah]], the daughter of [[Ahab]]. Despite this alliance with the stronger northern kingdom, [[Jehoram of Judah|Jehoram]]'s rule of Judah was shaky. [[Edom]] revolted, and he was forced to acknowledge their independence. A raid by [[Philistines]], [[Arabs]] and Ethiopians looted the king's house and carried off all of his family except for his youngest son, [[Ahaziah of Judah]].

=== Clash of empires ===
[[File:Stamped-bulla seal-side.jpg|thumb|Stamped bulla of a servant of King Hezekiah used to seal a papyrus document]]
After [[Hezekiah]] became sole ruler in c. 715 BCE, he formed alliances with [[Ashkelon]] and [[Egypt]], and made a stand against [[Assyria]] by refusing to pay tribute.&lt;ref name="Peter J pp 255–256"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter J. |last=Leithart |author-link=Peter J.

({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:13|HE}}) Hezekiah paid three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold to Assyria – requiring him to empty the temple and royal treasury of silver and strip the gold from the doorposts of [[Solomon's Temple]]. ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:14–16|HE}})&lt;ref name="Peter J pp 255–256"/&gt; However, [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem|Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;James B.

During the long reign of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]] (c. 687/686 – 643/642 BCE),&lt;ref name=Thiele&gt;{{cite book |first=Edwin |last=Thiele |title=The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1951 |isbn=978-0-8254-3825-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judah was a vassal of Assyrian rulers – Sennacherib and his successors, [[Esarhaddon]]&lt;ref name=Bright&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Bright |author-link=John Bright |isbn=9780664220686 |page=311 |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&amp;pg=PA311#v=onepage&amp;q=assyrian%20records%2C%20manasseh%2C%20esarhaddon&amp;f=false |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |title=A History of Israel |access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashurbanipal]] after 669 BCE. Manasseh is listed as being required to provide materials for [[Esarhaddon]]'s building projects, and as one of a number of vassals who assisted [[Ashurbanipal]]'s campaign against Egypt.&lt;ref name=Bright /&gt;

When [[Josiah]] became king of Judah in c. 641/640 BCE,&lt;ref name=Thiele /&gt; the international situation was in flux. To the east, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] was beginning to disintegrate, the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] had not yet risen to replace it, and [[Egypt]] to the west was still recovering from Assyrian rule. In this power vacuum, Judah was able to govern itself for the time being without foreign intervention. However, in the spring of 609 BCE, [[Pharaoh]] [[Necho II]] personally led a sizable army up to the [[Euphrates]] to aid the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].&lt;ref name="Coogan261"&gt;{{bibleref|2Kings|23:29|9}}
* {{cite book |last=Coogan |first=Michael David |authorlink=Michael Coogan |title=The Oxford History of the Biblical World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFhvECwNQD0C&amp;pg=PA261#v=onepage&amp;q=josiah%20%22book%20of%20kings%22%20assyria&amp;f=false |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195139372 |page=261 |access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the coast route [[Via Maris]] into [[Syria]] at the head of a large army, Necho passed the low tracts of [[Philistia]] and [[Sharon plain|Sharon]]. However, the passage over the ridge of hills which shuts in on the south of the great [[Jezreel Valley]] was blocked by the Judean army led by Josiah, who may have considered that the Assyrians and Egyptians were weakened by the death of the pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] only a year earlier (610 BCE).&lt;ref name="Coogan261"/&gt; Presumably in an attempt to help the Babylonians, Josiah attempted to block the advance at [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]], where a fierce [[battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|battle]] was fought and where Josiah was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|23:29|HE}}, {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|35:20–24|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Necho then joined forces with the Assyrian [[Ashur-uballit II]] and together they crossed the Euphrates and lay siege to [[Harran]]. The combined forces failed to capture the city, and Necho retreated back to northern [[Syria]]. The event also marked the disintegration of the Assyrian Empire.

On his return march to [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in 608 BCE, Necho found that [[Jehoahaz of Judah|Jehoahaz]] had been selected to succeed his father, Josiah.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|23:31|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Necho deposed Jehoahaz, who had been king for only three months, and replaced him with his older brother, [[Jehoiakim]]. Necho imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver (about 3{{fraction|3|4}} tons or about 3.4 metric tons) and a talent of gold (about {{convert|34|kg}}). Necho then took [[Jehoahaz of Judah|Jehoahaz]] back to Egypt as his prisoner,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|36:1–4|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; never to return.

[[Jehoiakim]] ruled originally as a vassal of the Egyptians, paying a heavy tribute. However, when the Egyptians were defeated by the Babylonians at [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]] in 605 BCE, Jehoiakim changed allegiances, paying tribute to [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon]]. In 601 BCE, in the fourth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar unsuccessfully attempted to invade [[Egypt]] and was repulsed with heavy losses. This failure led to numerous rebellions among the states of the [[Levant]] which owed allegiance to Babylon. Jehoiakim also stopped paying tribute to Nebuchadnezzar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drshirley.org/hist/hist05.html |title=The Divided Monarchy - ca. 931 - 586 BC |first=Dr. |last=Rollinson |access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took a pro-Egyptian position. Nebuchadnezzar soon dealt with these rebellions. According to the [[Babylonian Chronicles]], after invading "the land of Hatti (Syria/Palestine)"&lt;ref&gt;No 24 WA21946, The Babylonian Chronicles, The British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Geoffrey |last=Wigoder |title=The Illustrated Dictionary &amp; Concordance of the Bible |publisher=by Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 599 BCE, he lay [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|siege to Jerusalem]].

Nebuchadnezzar pillaged both Jerusalem and the [[Temple of Jerusalem|Temple]], carting all his spoils to Babylon. [[Jeconiah]] and his court and other prominent citizens and craftsmen, along with a sizable portion of the Jewish population of Judah, numbering about 10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford History of the Biblical World |editor-first=Michael D. |editor-last=Coogan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; were deported from the land and [[Babylonian Captivity|dispersed]] throughout the [[Babylonian Empire]]. ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:14|HE}}) Among them was [[Ezekiel]]. Nebuchadnezzar appointed [[Zedekiah]], Jehoiakim's brother, king of the reduced kingdom, who was made a tributary of Babylon.

Despite the strong remonstrances of [[Jeremiah]] and others, Zedekiah revolted against Nebuchadnezzar, ceasing to pay tribute to him and entered into an alliance with Pharaoh [[Apries|Hophra]]. In 589 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II returned to Judah and again [[siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|besieged Jerusalem]]. During this period, many Jews fled to surrounding [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], [[Edom]] and other countries to seek refuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|40:11–12|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city fell after a siege which lasted either eighteen or thirty months&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malamat |first1=Abraham |title=The Last Kings of Judah and the Fall of Jerusalem: An Historical – Chronological Study |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |year=1968 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=137–156 |jstor=27925138 |quote=The discrepancy between the length of the siege according to the regnal years of Zedekiah (years 9–11), on the one hand, and its length according to Jehoiachin's exile (years 9–12), on the other, can be cancelled out only by supposing the former to have been reckoned on a Tishri basis, and the latter on a Nisan basis. The difference of one year between the two is accounted for by the fact that the termination of the siege fell in the summer, between Nisan and Tishri, already in the 12th year according to the reckoning in Ezekiel, but still in Zedekiah's 11th year which was to end only in Tishri.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nebuchadnezzar again pillaged both Jerusalem and the Temple,&lt;ref name=Ezra&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezra|5:14|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he destroyed them both.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:10–13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; After killing all of Zedekiah's sons, with the possible exception of one,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng |title=The Book of Helaman, Chapter 8 |access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nebuchadnezzar took Zedekiah to Babylon,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:10–11|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting an end to the independent Kingdom of Judah. According to the [[Book of Jeremiah]], in addition to those killed during the siege, some 4,600 people were deported after the fall of Judah.&lt;ref name=Jer52&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:29–30|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 586 BCE much of Judah was devastated, and the former kingdom suffered a steep decline of both economy and population.&lt;ref name="Grabbe2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Grabbe |first=Lester L. |author-link=Lester L.

Jerusalem apparently remained uninhabited for much of the 6th century,&lt;ref name="Grabbe2004"/&gt; and the centre of gravity shifted to Benjamin, the relatively unscathed northern section of the kingdom, where the town of [[Mizpah in Benjamin|Mizpah]] became the capital of the new Babylonian province of [[Yehud (Babylonian province)|Yehud]] for the remnant of the Jewish population in a part of the former kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=Philip R.

[[Gedaliah]] was appointed governor of the Yehud Medinata, supported by a [[Babylonia]]n guard. The administrative centre of the province was [[Mizpah in Benjamin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:22–24|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|40:6–8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; not Jerusalem. On hearing of the appointment, many of the Judeans that had taken refuge in surrounding countries were persuaded to return to Judah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kgvsheE1xFEC&amp;pg=PT124&amp;dq=Gedaliah+return#v=onepage&amp;q=Gedaliah%20return&amp;f=false |title=The Prophetic Literature: Interpreting Biblical Texts Series |first=Marvin A. |last=Sweeney |publisher=Abingdon Press |year=2010|isbn=9781426730030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, before long Gedaliah was assassinated by a member of the royal house, and the Chaldean soldiers killed. The population that was left in the land and those that had returned fled to Egypt fearing a Babylonian reprisal, under the leadership of Yohanan ben [[Kareah]], ignoring the urging of the prophet [[Jeremiah]] against the move. ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:26|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|43:5–7|HE}}) In Egypt, the refugees settled in [[Migdol]], [[Tahpanhes]], [[Noph]], and [[Pathros]], ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|44:1|HE}}) and Jeremiah went with them as a moral guardian.

The numbers that were deported to Babylon and those who made their way to Egypt and the remnant that remained in the land and in surrounding countries is subject to academic debate. The [[Book of Jeremiah]] reports that 4600 were exiled to [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name="Jer52"/&gt; The [[Books of Kings]] suggest that it was ten thousand, and later eight thousand.

In 539 BCE the [[Achaemenid Empire]] conquered Babylonia and allowed the exiles to return to [[Yehud Medinata]] and rebuild the Temple, which was completed in the sixth year of Darius (515 BCE) ({{bibleverse||Ezra|6:15|HE}}) under [[Zerubbabel]], the grandson of the second to last king of Judah, [[Jeconiah]]. Yehud Medinata was a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to [[Alexander the Great]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7999">[[File:LesTempliersDailliez.JPG|thumb|"Les Templiers", Laurent Dailliez.]]
'''Laurent Dailliez''' (died 1991) was a French history doctor who graduated from [[Ecole pratique des hautes études]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalis.fr/corpus_auteur-encyclopedie/121/4270/encyclopedie/Laurent_DAILLIEZ.htm Encyclopedia Universalis short bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a researcher in [[medieval]] studies at the [[CNRS]], a historian of the [[Crusades]], and a specialist of the [[Knights Templar]]. Among other books, he wrote "Les Templiers". Dailliez was also the author of the article on the Templars in the leading French language encyclopedia, [[Encyclopedia Universalis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/R172401/TEMPLIERS.htm "Templiers" article in the Encyclopedia Universalis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
Dailliez is mentioned in the bibliography of the French specialist of the Knight Templars [[Alain Demurger]], and referenced repeatedly from his book ''Jacques de Molay, dernier grand maitre du Temple'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;Demurger, ''Jacques de Molay'', p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; Dailliez's collection of the Templar's ''Rule'' was used in the bibliography of ''The Real History Behind the Templars'' by [[Sharan Newman]].  Newman noted that many versions of the ''Rule'' were available, but chose the Dailliez version since it was in both Old French and Modern French. Some work by Dailliez is also referenced in ''Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain'' by Joseph F. O'Callaghan. Daillez is referenced by [[Malcolm Barber]] in the bibliography and notes of his book ''The New Knighthood- A History of the Order of the Temple'' for his book on the rule of the Templars; in ''Ivanhoe'' (Penguin Classics) by Walter Scott and Graham Tulloch; in ''Les Chevaliers teutoniques'' by Henry Bogdan for his book on the Teutonic Knights; in "Monasticon Praemonstratense: Id Est, Historia Canoniarum Atque Circariarum : 2 Parts" by Norbert Backmund for his work on the Abbaye Notre-Dame D'Huveaune.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=Dailliez&amp;x=11&amp;y=19 Amazon.com search for "Dailliez"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various works of Dailliez are also referenced in ''De tempeliers: de tempelorde tijdens de kruistochten en in de Lage landen'' J. Hosten (Dutch); ''The Crusades and the Military Orders'' by József Laszlovszky, Zsolt Hunyadi; ''The "polytyque Churche": Religion and Early Tudor Political Culture, 1485-1516'' by Peter Iver Kaufman; ''Europa an der Wende vom 11. Zum 12. Jahrhundert'' by Klaus Herbers and Werner Goez; 
''Knighthoods of Christ: Essays on the History of the Crusades'' by Norman Housley and Malcolm Barber, ''Tournament'' by [[David Crouch (historian)|David Crouch]]; ''Il mezzogiorno normanno-svevo e le crociate'' by Giosuè Musca for his work ''Les Templiers en Flandre''; ''Historia, clima y paisaje'' by Antonio López Gómez for his work on ''The order of Montesa''; ''Crusader Archaeology: The Material Culture of the Latin East'' by Adrian J. Boas; ''Saint Blaise: Evêque de Sébaste, Arménie mineure'' by Armand Tchouhadjian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?q=Dailliez Google books search for "Dailliez"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Demurger complained that Dailliez usually does not provide references for his work,&lt;ref&gt;"L. Dailliez, Jacques de Molay..., p. 21, cites a chronicle and a large map of Cyprus ad annum 1292, with no reference, as is usually the case with this author." Demurger, p. 231, footnote #46 to Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; and also accused him of taking "mischievous pleasure in muddying the waters," such as by asserting the claim that [[Jacques de Molay]], Grand Master of the [[Knights Templar]], had been a general in the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army and participated in an attack on [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;"Laurent Dailliez (who has taken mischievous pleasure in muddying the waters) affirms that [in 1299] Jacques de Molay was one of the three generals in the Mongol army, and would have had the honour of victoriously entering the Holy City." Demurger, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Demurger elsewhere highlighted some mistakes made by Dailliez, saying an assertion was "false but held as true by Dailliez, who is usually more serious."&lt;ref&gt;"...this assertion, false but held as true by Dailliez, who is usually more serious" (''Last Templar'', p.279)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the 2012 documentary film|the 2015 video game|Life Is Strange}}
'''''Life Is Strange''''' is a 2012 American documentary film of interviews giving an [[oral history]] portrait of the life of pre-World War II European Jews by filmmaker Isaac Hertz. The film juxtaposes the childhood memories of interviewees with archival footage. Interviewees include Israeli president [[Shimon Peres]], author [[Uri Orlev]], academics, Nobel laureates, and friends of the filmmaker, [[Walter Kohn]], [[Robert J. Aumann]], Alain Jakubowicz, Sammy Grundwerg, Ron Samuels, Zachary Cirino, Chaim Hertz, Arianne Brown, Artem Zuev and Jean-Michel Guirao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/30/entertainment/la-et-mn-life-is-strange-capsule-20120831 |title=Review: An oddly effective 'Life Is Strange' |date=August 30, 2012 |first=Sheri |last=Linden |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/holocaust-oral-histories-are-shared-in-the-shapeless-life-is-strange-6440735 |title=Holocaust Oral Histories are Shared in the Shapeless ''Life Is Strange'' |first=Chris |last=Klimek |publisher=[[The Village Voice]] |date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[Mesoamerica]]n [[pyramid]]s or ceremonial structures. In most cases they are not true pyramids.  There are hundreds of these done in many different styles throughout [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]. These were made by several [[pre-Columbian]] cultures including the [[Olmecs]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Toltecs]], and [[Aztecs]]. In most cases they were made by city states that created many structures in the same style. The style for each city state is usually different. These are usually made out of stone and mortar but some of the earliest may have been made out of clay.

'''Maria Reiche''' (15 May 1903 – 8 June 1998) was a German-born Peruvian [[mathematician]], [[archaeologist]], and [[technical translation|technical translator]]. She is known for her research into the [[Nazca Lines]], which she first saw in 1941&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; together with American historian [[Paul Kosok]]. Known as the "Lady of the Lines", Reiche made the documentation, preservation and public dissemination of the Nazca Lines her life's work.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/15/world/maria-reiche-95-keeper-of-an-ancient-peruvian-puzzle-dies.html|title=Maria Reiche, 95, Keeper of an Ancient Peruvian Puzzle, Dies|last=Jr|first=Robert McG Thomas|date=1998-06-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although her work gained limited scholarly recognition, Maria Reich was widely recognized as the curator of the lines and lived nearby to protect them. She received recognition as Doctor Honoris Causa by the Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria in Lima. Reiche helped gain national and international attention for the Nazca Lines; Peru established protection, and they were designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/700|title=Lines and Geoglyphs of Nasca and Palpa|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following her death, her former home in Nazca was adapted as a museum, the ''Museo Maria Reiche''. She is honored as the namesake of [[Maria Reiche Neuman Airport]] in Nazca, and of some fifty schools and other institutions in Peru.{{Cn|date=May 2018}} The 115th anniversary of her birth was commemorated with a [[Google Doodle]] in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kionasmith/2018/05/15/tuesdays-google-doodle-celebrates-nazca-line-archaeologist-maria-reiche/#3f91bc5719ef|title=Tuesday's Google Doodle Celebrates Nazca Line Archaeologist Maria Reiche|last=Smith|first=Kiona N.|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/15/17353242/maria-reiche-nazca-lines-peru-science-google-doodle|title=Today’s Google Doodle celebrates the scientist who studied the mysterious desert lines of Peru|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/maria-reiches-115th-birthday|title=Maria Reiche’s 115th Birthday|last=|first=|date=2018-05-15|website=Google Doodles Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
[[File:Maria Reiche 1910 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|upright=0.7|Reiche in 1910]]
Maria Reiche was born in [[Dresden]] on 15 May 1903. She studied mathematics, astronomy, geography and foreign languages at the [[Dresden Technical University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianer-welt.de/sued/nazca/nazca-reiche.htm|title=Indianer-Welt: Nazca - Biographie: Maria Reiche|website=www.indianer-welt.de|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; She learned to speak [[multilingualism|five languages]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In 1932 as a young woman, she went to Peru to work as a [[governess]] and tutor for the children of the German consul in [[Cusco]]. In 1934, while still in Cusco, she accidentally stabbed herself with a cactus and lost a finger to [[gangrene]]. 

In 1939, she became a teacher in [[Lima]] and also worked on scientific translations.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; When [[World War II]] broke out that year, Reiche stayed in Peru. The next year she met American Paul Kosok, who was researching ancient irrigation systems in the country. She assisted him with making arrangements in the country, including a flight in 1941 by which she first saw the lines and figures of Nazca from the air.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maria"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nazcaresources.com/MariaReiche.html|title=Maria and the Stars of Nazca|website=www.nazcaresources.com|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They collaborated for years on further studies of these earthworks, trying to determine how they were made and, with more difficulty, for what purpose.

==Nazca lines==
In 1940, Reiche became an assistant to [[Paul Kosok]], an American historian from [[Long Island University]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]], who was studying ancient irrigation systems in Peru.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

In June 1941 Kosok noticed lines in the desert that converged at the point of the [[winter solstice]] in the Southern Hemisphere. Together he and Reiche began to map and assess the lines for their relation to astronomical events. Later Reiche found lines converging at the [[summer solstice]] and developed the theory that the lines formed a large-scale celestial calendar.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/maria-reiche-nazca-lines-peru-incas-german-mathematician-google-doodle-a8351876.html|title=Who was the German governess obsessed with the mystery of Peru's Nazca Lines?|date=2018-05-15|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1946, Reiche began to map the figures represented by the Nazca Lines and determined there were 18 different kinds of animals and birds. 

After Kosok left in 1948, after his second study period in Peru, Reiche continued the work and mapped the area. She used her background as a mathematician to analyze how the Nazca may have created such huge-scale figures. She found these to have a mathematical precision that was highly sophisticated. Reiche theorized that the builders of the lines used them as a sun [[calendar]] and an [[observatory]] for [[astronomy|astronomical]] cycles.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;
[[File:Maria_Reiche_Nazca.jpg|thumb|left|Wax figure of Reiche in her former home, now a museum dedicated to her work]]

Because the lines can be best seen from above, she persuaded the [[Peruvian Air Force]] to help her make aerial photographic surveys. She worked alone from her home in Nazca. Reiche published her theories in the book ''The Mystery on the Desert'' (1949, reprint 1968). She believed that the large drawing of a giant monkey represented the constellation now called [[Ursa Major|Ursa Major (Great Bear)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her book had a mixed response from scholars. Eventually scholars concluded that the lines were not chiefly for astronomical purposes, but Reiche's and Kosok's work had brought scholarly attention to the great resource. Some researchers believe that the lines were made as part of worship and religious ceremonies related to the "calling of water from the gods."&lt;ref name="Peru"&gt;[http://www.discover-peru.org/the-nazca-lines/ "The Nazca Lines"], Peru Cultural Society, accessed 27 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiche used the profits from the book to campaign for preservation of the Nazca desert and to hire guards for the property and assistants for her work. Wanting to preserve the Nazca Lines from encroaching traffic, after one figure was cut through by the [[Pan American Highway]] government development, Reiche spent considerable money in the effort to lobby and educate officials and the public about the lines. After paying for private security, she convinced the government to restrict public access to the area. She sponsored construction of a tower near the highway so that visitors could have an overview of the lines to appreciate them without damaging them. Reiche contributed to the lines becoming a World Heritage site in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1977, Reiche became a founding member of [[South American Explorers]], a non-profit travel, scientific and educational organization. She was on the organization's advisory board and was interviewed for the ''South American Explorer'' on the lines' significance and importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saexplorers.org/sites/default/files/magazine/9/sae-mag-9c-maria-reiche.pdf|title=Bean Sprouts New Theory|accessdate=16 February 2013}} ''South American Explorer'', January 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Reiche's partner was Amy Meredith, who helped her in her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fembio.org/biographie.php/frau/biographie/maria-reiche/|title=FemBio - Frauen-Biographieforschung: Maria Reiche|website=www.fembio.org|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiche's health deteriorated as she aged. She used a wheelchair, suffered from skin ailments, and lost her sight. In her later years, she also suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]]. At the age of 90 she published &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Contributions to Geometry and Astronomy in Ancient Peru&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;.'' Maria Reiche died of [[ovarian]] [[cancer]] on 8 June 1998,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in an Air Force Hospital in Lima. Reiche was buried with her sister near Nazca with official honors.

===Early history and foundation===

[[Indigenous Australians]] have lived in the Melbourne area for an estimated 31,000 to 40,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Presland, ''The First Residents of Melbourne's Western Region'', (revised edition), Harriland Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-646-33150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|European settlers]] arrived in the 19th-century, under 2,000 [[hunter-gatherer]]s from three [[Kulin|regional tribes]]—the [[Wurundjeri]], [[Bunurong|Boonwurrung]] and [[Wathaurong]]—inhabited the area.&lt;ref name="rbg.vic.gov.au"&gt;[http://www.rbg.vic.gov.au/__data/page/1062/Indig.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908132608/http://www.rbg.vic.gov.au/__data/page/1062/Indig.pdf|date=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Presland, ''Aboriginal Melbourne: The Lost Land of the Kulin People'', Harriland Press (1985), Second edition 1994, {{ISBN|0-9577004-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an important meeting place for the clans of the [[Kulin]] nation alliance and a vital source of food and water.&lt;ref name="settlement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="merrimerri"&gt;Isabel Ellender and Peter Christiansen, ''People of the Merri Merri. The Wurundjeri in Colonial Days'', Merri Creek Management Committee, 2001 {{ISBN|0-9577728-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first British settlement in Victoria, then part of the [[penal colony]] of [[New South Wales]], was established by Colonel [[David Collins (governor)|David Collins]] in October 1803, at [[Sullivan Bay, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]], near present-day [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sorrento]]. The following year, due to a perceived lack of resources, these settlers relocated to [[Van Diemen's Land]] (present-day [[Tasmania]]) and founded the city of [[Hobart]].
It would be 30 years before another settlement was attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Button | first = James| title = Secrets of a forgotten settlement| work = The Age | publisher = Fairfax | location=Melbourne| date = 4 October 2003|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/03/1064988393029.html?from=storyrhs| accessdate =19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Batman signs treaty artist impression.jpg|thumb|left|A late 19th-century artist's depiction of [[John Batman]]'s [[Batman's Treaty|treaty]] with a group of [[Wurundjeri]] elders]]
In May and June 1835, [[John Batman]], a leading member of the [[Port Phillip Association]] in Van Diemen's Land, explored the Melbourne area, and later claimed to have [[Batman's Treaty|negotiated a purchase]] of {{convert|600000|acre|km2}} with eight Wurundjeri elders.&lt;ref name="settlement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="merrimerri"/&gt; Batman selected a site on the northern bank of the [[Yarra River]], declaring that "this will be the place for a village" before returning to Van Diemen's Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Annear|first=Robyn|year=2005|title=Bearbrass: Imagining Early Melbourne|location=Melbourne, Victoria|publisher=Black Inc|page=6|isbn=1863953973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1835, another group of Vandemonian settlers arrived in the area and established a settlement at the site of the current [[Immigration Museum, Melbourne|Melbourne Immigration Museum]]. Batman and his group arrived the following month and the two groups ultimately agreed to share the settlement, initially known by the native name of Dootigala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Melbourne |volume=18 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32937146 |title=Melbourne's Godfather. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |volume=50, |issue=14,996 |location=Western Australia |date=14 July 1934 |accessdate=20 September 2017 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1836 and 1842, Victorian Aboriginal groups were largely dispossessed of their land by European settlers.&lt;ref&gt;James Boyce, 1835: The Founding of Melbourne and the Conquest of Australia, Black Inc, 2011, page 151 citing Richard Broome, "Victoria" in McGrath (ed.), Contested Ground: 129&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1844, there were said to be 675 Aborigines resident in squalid camps in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;James Boyce, 1835: The Founding of Melbourne and the Conquest of Australia, Black Inc, 2011, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; The British Colonial Office appointed five [[Protector of Aborigines|Aboriginal Protectors]] for the Aborigines of Victoria, in 1839, however their work was nullified by a land policy that favoured [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] who took possession of Aboriginal lands.&lt;ref&gt;James Boyce, 1835: The Founding of Melbourne and the Conquest of Australia, Black Inc, 2011, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; By 1845, fewer than 240 wealthy Europeans held all the pastoral licences then issued in Victoria and became a powerful political and economic force in Victoria for generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;James Boyce, 1835: The Founding of Melbourne and the Conquest of Australia, Black Inc, 2011, page 163&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Letters patent]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], issued on 25 June 1847, declared Melbourne a city.&lt;ref name="MilesLewis25"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Miles|title=Melbourne: the city's history and development|edition=2nd|publisher=City of Melbourne |location=Melbourne|year=1995|page=25|isbn=0-949624-71-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 1851, the Port Phillip District separated from New South Wales to become the Colony of Victoria, with Melbourne as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;

{{further|Victorian gold rush}}
[[File:Canvas town south melbourne victoria 1850s.jpg|thumb|South Melbourne's "Canvas Town" provided temporary accommodation for the thousands of migrants who arrived each week during the 1850s gold rush.]]
The discovery of gold in Victoria in mid-1851 sparked [[Victorian gold rush|a gold rush]], and Melbourne, the colony's major port, experienced rapid growth. Within months, the city's population had nearly doubled from 25,000 to 40,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="gold1850"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sbs.com.au/sbsmain/gold/story.html?storyid=49

An influx of intercolonial and international migrants, particularly from Europe and China, saw the establishment of slums, including [[Chinatown, Melbourne|Chinatown]] and a temporary "tent city" on the southern banks of the Yarra. In the aftermath of the 1854 [[Eureka Rebellion]], mass public-support for the plight of the miners resulted in major political changes to the colony, including improvements in working conditions across mining, agriculture, manufacturing and other local industries. At least twenty nationalities took part in the rebellion, giving some indication of immigration flows at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hagan, Kate (3 December 2006).

With the wealth brought in from the gold rush and the subsequent need for public buildings, a program of grand civic construction soon began. The 1850s and 1860s saw the commencement of [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]], the [[Old Treasury Building, Melbourne|Treasury Building]], the [[Old Melbourne Gaol]], [[Victoria Barracks, Melbourne|Victoria Barracks]], the [[State Library of Victoria|State Library]], [[University of Melbourne]], [[Melbourne GPO|General Post Office]],  [[Immigration Museum, Melbourne|Customs House]], the [[Melbourne Town Hall]],  [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Patrick's]] cathedral, though many remained uncompleted for decades, with some still not finished {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}}.

The layout of the inner suburbs on a largely one-mile grid pattern, cut through by wide radial boulevards and parklands surrounding the central city, was largely established{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} in the 1850s and 1860s. These areas rapidly filled with the ubiquitous terrace houses, as well as with detached houses and grand mansions, while some of the major roads developed as shopping streets. Melbourne quickly became a major finance centre, home to several banks, the [[Melbourne Mint|Royal Mint]], and (in 1861) Australia's first [[Australian Securities Exchange|stock exchange]].&lt;ref name="caslon"&gt;

In 1855, the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] secured possession of its now famous ground, the [[MCG]]. Members of the [[Melbourne Football Club]] codified [[Australian football]] in 1859,&lt;ref&gt;Pennings, Mark (2012).

Connor Court Publishing Pty Ltd. {{ISBN|9781921421471}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1861, the first [[Melbourne Cup]] race was held. Melbourne acquired its first public monument, the [[Burke and Wills expedition|Burke and Wills]] statue, in 1864.

With the gold rush largely over by 1860, Melbourne continued to grow on the back of continuing gold-mining, as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of Victoria (especially wool) and with a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs. An extensive radial railway network spread into the countryside from the late 1850s. Construction started on further major public buildings in the 1860s and 1870s, such as the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]], [[Government House, Melbourne|Government House]], and the [[Queen Victoria Market]]. The central city filled up with shops and offices, workshops, and warehouses. Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks. The Aboriginal population continued to decline, with an estimated 80% total decrease by 1863, due primarily to introduced diseases (particularly [[smallpox]]&lt;ref name="rbg.vic.gov.au"/&gt;), frontier violence and dispossession of their lands.

===Land boom and bust===
[[File:Melbourne international exhibition 1880.jpg|thumb|Lithograph of the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]]-listed [[Royal Exhibition Building]], built to host the [[Melbourne International Exhibition (1880)|Melbourne International Exhibition]] of 1880]]
The 1880s was a decade of extraordinary growth, when consumer confidence, easy access to credit, and steep increases in land prices led to an enormous amount of construction. During this 'land boom', Melbourne reputedly became the richest city in the world,&lt;ref name="RobertCervero320"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cervero|first=Robert B.|title= The Transit Metropolis: A Global Inquiry|publisher=Island Press|year=1998|location=Chicago|page=320|isbn=1-55963-591-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest after London in the [[British Empire]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The decade began with the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880, held in the large purpose-built [[Royal Exhibition Building|Exhibition Building]]. In 1880 a telephone exchange was established and in the same year the foundations of [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's]], were laid; in 1881 electric light was installed in the Eastern Market, and in the following year a generating station capable of supplying 2,000 incandescent lamps was in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3807950 | title = The Story of Melbourne | work = Argus |location = Melbourne, Australia | date = 9 September 1926 | accessdate = 24 January 2012 | page = 8 Supplement: An Historic Souvenir|publisher = National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885 the first line of the [[Melbourne cable tramway system]] was built, becoming one of the world's most extensive systems by 1890.

[[File:Federal Coffee Palace Melbourne.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Federal Coffee Palace]], one of many grand hotels erected during the boom]]
In 1885, visiting English journalist [[George Augustus Henry Sala]] coined the phrase "Marvellous Melbourne", which stuck long into the twentieth century and is still used today by Melburnians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/09/1073437468105.html | title = He came, he saw, he marvelled | first = James | last = Button | work = The Age | publisher = Fairfax | date = 10 January 2004 | accessdate = 7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melbourne's land boom reached a peak in 1888, fuelled by consumer confidence and escalating land value.&lt;ref name="University1"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Land Boomers | first = Michael  | last = Cannon  | publisher = Melbourne University Press; Cambridge University Press | year = 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the boom, large commercial buildings, [[coffee palace]]s, [[terrace house|terrace housing]] and palatial mansions proliferated in the city.&lt;ref name="University1"/&gt; The establishment of a hydraulic facility in 1887 allowed for the local manufacture of elevators, resulting in the first construction of high-rise buildings;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/marvellous/powered/lifts.asp |title=Marvellous Melbourne – Introduction of the Hydraulic Lift |publisher= Museum Victoria |accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the [[APA Building]], amongst the world's tallest commercial buildings upon completion in 1889.&lt;ref name="University1"/&gt; This period also saw the expansion of a major radial rail-based transport network.&lt;ref name="Miles47"&gt;{{cite book  | year = 1995
 | first = Lewis | last =  Miles  | title = Melbourne the city's history and development | publisher = City of Melbourne | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, the Exhibition Building hosted a second event  even larger than the first, the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, spurring construction of numerous hotels including the 500 room [[Federal Hotel, Melbourne|Federal Hotel]], The Palace Hotel in Bourke Street (both since demolished), and the doubling in size of the [[Hotel Windsor (Melbourne)|Grand (Windsor)]].

A brash [[boosterism]] that had typified Melbourne during this time ended in the early 1890s with a severe economic depression, sending the local finance and property industries into a period of chaos&lt;ref name="University1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="localhistories"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/melbourne.html | title = A Brief History of Melbourne | last = Lambert | first = Tim | publisher= Local Histories | accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which 16 small "land banks" and building societies collapsed, and 133 limited companies went into liquidation. The Melbourne financial crisis was a contributing factor in the [[Economic history of Australia|Australian economic depression of the 1890s]] and the [[Australian banking crisis of 1893]]. The effects of the depression on the city were profound, with virtually no new construction until the late 1890s.&lt;ref name="Britannica1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373808/Melbourne/12674/Growth-of-the-city|title=Melbourne (Victoria) – growth of the city | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica| accessdate = 29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="welovemelbourne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.we-love-melbourne.net/Melbourne-history.html | title=Fast Facts on Melbourne History | publisher = We Love Melbourne | accessdate = 29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===De facto Capital of Australia===
{{further|Federation of Australia}}
[[File:Opening of the first parliament.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Big Picture (painting)|The Big Picture]]'', the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia]] on 9 May 1901, painted by [[Tom Roberts]].]]
At the time of Australia's [[Federation of Australia|federation]] on 1 January 1901, Melbourne became the seat of government of the federation. The first federal parliament was convened on 9 May 1901 in the Royal Exhibition Building, subsequently moving to the Victorian Parliament House where it was located until 1927, when it was moved to [[Canberra]]. The [[Governor-General of Australia]] resided at [[Government House, Melbourne|Government House]] in Melbourne until 1930 and many major national institutions remained in Melbourne well into the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Miles113"&gt;Lewis, Miles ''(Melbourne the city's history and development)'' p. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war period===
In the immediate years after [[World War II]], Melbourne expanded rapidly, its growth boosted by [[post-war immigration to Australia]], primarily from Southern [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/origins/keydates.aspx?cid=13 |title=1961 – the Impact of Post-War Immigration  |publisher = Museum Victoria | accessdate = 21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the "Paris End" of Collins Street began Melbourne's boutique shopping and open air [[Coffeehouse|cafe]] cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/28/1053801445880.html | title = Boutique battle at Paris end of town |first = Misha | last= Ketchel  |work = Age  |publisher = Fairfax | date= 11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city centre was seen by many as stale—the dreary domain of office workers—something expressed by [[John Brack]] in his famous painting ''[[Collins St., 5 pm]]'' (1955).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipa.org.au/publications/1691/the-art-of-the-forgotten-people The art of the forgotten people] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313203932/http://ipa.org.au/publications/1691/the-art-of-the-forgotten-people |date=13 March 2016 }} by Tom Wilson&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orica House.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[ICI House]], a symbol of progress and modernity in post-war Melbourne]]
Height limits in the CBD were lifted in 1958, after the construction of [[ICI House]], transforming the city's skyline with the introduction of skyscrapers. Suburban expansion then intensified, served by new indoor malls beginning with [[Chadstone Shopping Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/gallery/image.php?id=802|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805185805/http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/gallery/image.php?id=802|deadurl=yes|title=Sorry, we can’t find the content you’re looking for - State Library o…|date=5 August 2012|archivedate=5 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post-war period also saw a major renewal of the CBD and [[St Kilda Road]] which significantly modernised the city.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Raphael Buckrich (1996) Melbourne's Grand Boulevard: the Story of St Kilda Road. Published State Library of Victoria&lt;/ref&gt; New fire regulations and redevelopment saw most of the taller pre-war CBD buildings either demolished or partially retained through a policy of [[Facadism#Melbourne|facadism]]. Many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era were also either demolished or subdivided.

To counter the trend towards low-density suburban residential growth, the government began a series of controversial public housing projects in the inner city by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]], which resulted in demolition of many neighbourhoods and a proliferation of high-rise towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first  = William | last= Logan | title = The Gentrification of inner Melbourne: a political geography of inner city housing | publisher = University of Queensland Press | year = 1985 | location = Brisbane, Australia | pages = 148–160 |url=| id = | isbn = 0-7022-1729-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, with the rapid rise of motor vehicle ownership, the investment in freeway and highway developments greatly accelerated the outward suburban sprawl and declining inner city population. The [[Henry Bolte|Bolte]] government sought to rapidly accelerate the modernisation of Melbourne. Major road projects including the remodelling of [[St Kilda Junction]], the widening of [[Hoddle Street]] and then the extensive [[1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan]] changed the face of the city into a car-dominated environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Millar | first = Royce | title = Road to ... where? | work=Age | publisher = Fairfax | date = 7 November 2005 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/road-to-where/2005/11/06/1131211946903.html | accessdate= 11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's financial and mining booms during 1969 and 1970 resulted in establishment of the headquarters of many major companies ([[BHP Billiton]] and [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]], among others) in the city. [[Nauru]]'s then booming economy resulted in several ambitious investments in Melbourne, such as [[Nauru House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shepherd|first=Dick|title=Hotel men expected to press for Govt. aid |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2eFUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0JADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6710,571748&amp;hl=en |accessdate=25 April 2011| work=Age | publisher = Fairfax | date=4 February 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melbourne remained Australia's main business and financial centre until the late 1970s, when it began to lose this primacy to Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/30/1072546531264.html?from=storyrhs

Melbourne experienced an economic downturn between 1989 and 1992, following the collapse of several local financial institutions. In 1992, the newly elected [[Jeff Kennett|Kennett]] government began a campaign to revive the economy with an aggressive development campaign of public works coupled with the promotion of the city as a tourist destination with a focus on major events and sports tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Saward | first = Joe | title = Interview – Judith Griggs | work = Grandprix | publisher = Inside F1 | date = 1 February 1996 | url = http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00208.html | accessdate = 14 May 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100117122653/http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00208.html | archive-date = 17 January 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the [[Australian Grand Prix]] moved to Melbourne from Adelaide. Major projects included the construction of a new facility for the [[Melbourne Museum]], [[Federation Square]], the [[Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre]], [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]] and the [[CityLink]] [[Toll road|tollway]]. Other strategies included the privatisation of some of Melbourne's services, including power and public transport, and a reduction in funding to public services such as health, education and public transport infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Miles206"&gt;Lewis, Miles ''Melbourne the city's history and development'' p203,205–206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Melbourne===
Since the mid-1990s, Melbourne has maintained significant population and employment growth. There has been substantial international investment in the city's industries and property market. Major inner-city urban renewal has occurred in areas such as [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[Port Melbourne]], [[Melbourne Docklands]] and more recently, [[South Wharf, Victoria|South Wharf]]. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], Melbourne sustained the highest population increase and economic growth rate of any Australian capital city in the three years ended June 2004.&lt;!--Update?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 24 March 2005

From 2006, the growth of the city extended into "green wedges" and beyond the city's [[urban growth boundary]]. Predictions of the city's population reaching 5 million people pushed the state government to review the growth boundary in 2008 as part of its Melbourne @ Five Million strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vic.gov.au/planningmelbourne |title=Delivering Melbourne's newest sustainable communities |work=Victoria Online |publisher=State of Victoria |date=21 September 2006 |accessdate=21 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604005014/http://www.vic.gov.au/planningmelbourne |archivedate=4 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Melbourne was less affected by the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] in comparison to other Australian cities.

==Geography==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
{{main|Geography of Melbourne}}
[[File:Greater Melbourne Map 4 - May 2008.png|thumb|Map of Melbourne and [[Geelong]] urban areas]]
Melbourne is in the southeastern part of mainland Australia, within the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Geologically, it is built on the confluence of [[Quaternary]] lava flows to the west, [[Silurian]] [[mudstone]]s to the east, and [[Holocene]] sand accumulation to the southeast along [[Port Phillip]]. The southeastern suburbs are situated on the [[Selwyn fault]] which transects [[Mount Martha, Victoria|Mount Martha]] and [[Cranbourne, Victoria|Cranbourne]].

Melbourne extends along the [[Yarra River]] towards the [[Yarra Valley]] and the [[Dandenong Ranges]] to the east. It extends northward through the undulating bushland valleys of the Yarra's tributaries—[[Moonee Ponds Creek]] (toward Tullamarine Airport), [[Merri Creek]], [[Darebin Creek]] and [[Plenty River]]—to the outer suburban growth corridors of [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]] and [[Whittlesea, Victoria|Whittlesea]].

The city reaches southeast through [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] to the growth corridor of [[Pakenham, Victoria|Pakenham]] towards [[West Gippsland]], and southward through the [[Dandenong Creek]] valley, the [[Mornington Peninsula]] and the city of [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]] taking in the peaks of [[Olivers Hill, Victoria|Olivers Hill]], Mount Martha and [[Arthurs Seat, Victoria|Arthurs Seat]], extending along the shores of Port Phillip as a single [[conurbation]] to reach the exclusive suburb of [[Portsea, Victoria|Portsea]] and [[Point Nepean]]. In the west, it extends along the [[Maribyrnong River]] and its tributaries north towards [[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]] and the foothills of the [[Shire of Macedon Ranges|Macedon Ranges]], and along the flat volcanic plain country towards [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]] in the west, [[Werribee]] at the foothills of the [[You Yangs]] [[granite]] ridge south west of the CBD. The Little River, and the township of the same name, marks the border between Melbourne and neighbouring Geelong city.

Melbourne's major bayside beaches are in the various suburbs along the shores of Port Phillip Bay, in areas like [[Port Melbourne]], [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], [[Elwood, Victoria|Elwood]], [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], [[Sandringham, Victoria|Sandringham]], [[Mentone, Victoria|Mentone]], [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]], [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]] and Werribee South. The nearest [[ocean surface wave|surf]] beaches are {{convert|85|km|mi|}} southeast of the Melbourne CBD in the back-beaches of [[Rye, Victoria|Rye]], [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sorrento]] and [[Portsea, Victoria|Portsea]].&lt;ref name="smhbeach"&gt;{{cite web | last=Russell |first=Mark

[[File:Brighton Beach, Melbourne 2003 (91593941).jpg|thumb|left|[[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton Beach]] after an autumn rainstorm. Melbourne is said to experience "four seasons in one day" due to its changeable weather.]]
Melbourne has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') with warm to hot summers and cool winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia | isbn=0-19-553393-3 |edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Linacre | first1 = Edward | last2 = Geerts  | first2= Bart | title = Climates and Weather Explained | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 1997 | page = 379 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mkZa1KLHCAQC&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;pg=PA379#v=onepage&amp;q= | isbn = 0-415-12519-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melbourne is well known for its [[southerly buster|changeable weather conditions]], mainly due to it being located on the boundary of hot inland areas and the cool southern ocean. This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong [[cold front]]s to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from [[gale]]s to [[thunderstorm]]s and [[hail]], large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, however, are usually very stable, but rather damp and often cloudy.

Port Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a "bay effect" similar to the "[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]" seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry. Overall, Melbourne is, owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Otway Ranges]], nonetheless drier than average for southern Victoria. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around {{convert|425|mm|in|0}} at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to {{convert|1250|mm|in|0}} on the eastern fringe at [[Gembrook, Victoria|Gembrook]]. Melbourne receives 48.6 clear days annually. Dewpoint temperatures in the summer range from {{convert|9.5|C|F}} to {{convert|11.7|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="Bureau"&gt;{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_086071|site_name=Melbourne Regional Office|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melbourne is also prone to isolated convective showers forming when a cold pool crosses the state, especially if there is considerable daytime heating. These showers are often heavy and can include hail, squalls, and significant drops in temperature, but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower. This can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day, giving Melbourne a reputation for having "four seasons in one day",&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_086071|site_name=Melbourne Regional Office|accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that is part of local [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&amp;pg=2325 |title=Welcome to Melbourne |publisher=City of Melbourne |accessdate=18 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719171215/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&amp;pg=2325 |archivedate=19 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest temperature on record is {{convert|-2.8|C|F}}, on 21 July 1869.&lt;ref name="snow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=123&amp;p_display_type=dailyDataFile&amp;p_startYear=1869&amp;p_c=-1481637067&amp;p_stn_num=86071 |title=Bureau of Meteorology – Climate Data Online |accessdate=6 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne city was {{convert|46.4|C|F}}, on [[Black Saturday bushfires|7 February 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_086071_All.shtml |title = Monthly climate statistics | publisher= Bureau of Meteorology | accessdate = 30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While snow is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city, it has not been recorded in the Central Business District since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 March 2009|title=BOM - Australian Climate Extremes|website=pandora.nla.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Streeton - Golden summer, Eaglemont - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'', painted in 1889 by [[Heidelberg School]] artist [[Arthur Streeton]], shows the then-rural suburb of [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] during an [[El Niño]] [[droughts in Australia|drought]]. The area has since undergone urbanisation as part of the city's continued sprawl outwards.]]
Like many urban areas, Melbourne faces environmental issues, many related to the city's large urban footprint and [[urban sprawl]] and the demand for infrastructure and services. One such issue is the impact of [[drought in Australia|drought]] on water supply. Periodic droughts and consistently high summer temperatures deplete Melbourne's water supplies, and climate change may exacerbate the long-term impact of these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melbournewater.com.au/content/water/water_storages/water_storages.asp?bhcp=1 |title=Water Storages: Water Report |publisher=Melbourne Water |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=21 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027040839/http://www.melbournewater.com.au/content/water/water_storages/water_storages.asp?bhcp=1 |archivedate=27 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[2000s Australian drought|Millennium drought]], the [[Steve Bracks|Bracks]] Government implemented [[Water restrictions in Australia|water restrictions]] and a range of other options including water recycling, incentives for household water tanks, [[greywater]] systems, water consumption awareness initiatives, and other water-saving and reuse initiatives. But as water storages continued to fall further measures were required; in June 2007 the Bracks Government announced the construction of the $3.1 billion [[Wonthaggi desalination plant]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Melbourne is typical of Australian capital cities in that after the turn of the 20th century, it expanded with the underlying notion of a 'quarter acre home and garden' for every family, often referred to locally as the [[Australian Dream]]. This, coupled with the popularity of the private automobile after 1945, led to the auto-centric urban structure now present today in the middle and outer suburbs. Much of [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] Melbourne is accordingly characterised by low density sprawl, whilst its inner city areas feature predominantly medium-density, transit-oriented urban forms. The city centre, Docklands, St. Kilda Road and Southbank areas feature high-density forms.

Melbourne is often referred to as Australia's garden city, and the state of Victoria was once known as ''the garden state''.&lt;ref name="Age3"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Public housing is usually provided by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]], and operates within the framework of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, by which federal and state governments provide housing funding.

Melbourne is experiencing high population growth, generating high demand for housing. This housing boom has increased house prices and rents, as well as the availability of all types of housing. [[Subdivision (land)|Subdivision]] regularly occurs in the outer areas of Melbourne, with numerous developers offering house and land packages. However, after 10 years{{when|date=October 2014}} of planning policies to encourage [[Medium-density housing|medium-density]] and [[High density housing|high-density]] development in existing areas with greater access to [[public transport]] and other services, Melbourne's middle and outer-ring suburbs have seen significant [[Brownfield land|brownfields]] redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urbanmelbourne.info/projectdatabase|title=Project Database|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Melbourne Collins Street Architecture.jpg|thumb|left|Modern skyscrapers set back from the street in order to preserve Victorian era buildings on [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]].]]
The city is recognised for its mix of modern architecture which intersects with an extensive range of nineteenth and early twentieth century buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fischer and Susan Marsden, ''Vintage Melbourne: beautiful buildings from Melbourne city centre'', East Street Publications, Bowden South Australia 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most architecturally noteworthy historic buildings include the [[World Heritage Site]]-listed [[Royal Exhibition Building]], constructed over a two-year period for the [[Melbourne International Exhibition (1880)|Melbourne International Exhibition]] in 1880, A.C. Goode House, a [[Gothic architecture|Neo Gothic]] building located on Collins Street designed by Wright, Reed &amp; Beaver (1891), [[William Pitt (architect)|William Pitt]]'s Venetian Gothic style Old Stock Exchange (1888), [[William Wardell]]'s Gothic Bank (1883) which features some of Melbourne's finest interiors, the incomplete [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]], [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's Cathedral]] (1891) and Ivan Lazarus (architect)'s [[Flinders Street Station]] (1909), which was the busiest commuter railway station in the world in the mid-1920s.&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au"&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/pict/list/vicgovrail.html Melbourne and scenes in Victoria 1925–1926 from Victorian Government Railways] From the National Library of Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

The city also features the [[Shrine of Remembrance]], which was built as a memorial to the men and women of Victoria who served in [[World War I]] and is now a memorial to all Australians who have served in war.

In 2018, the city contained a total of 667 high-rise buildings, 187 skyscrapers and a further 28 under construction and 60 planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/city/melbourne-australia |title=Emporis Skyline Ranking |publisher= Emporis Corporation. All rights reserved |accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the city's skyline the tallest in Australia. The CBD is dominated by modern office buildings including the [[Rialto Towers]] (1986), built on the site of several grand classical Victorian buildings, two of which — the Rialto Building (1889) designed by [[William Pitt (architect)|William Pitt]] and the Winfield Building (1890) designed by Charles D'Ebro and Richard Speight — still remain today and more recently high-rise apartment buildings including [[Eureka Tower]] (2006), which is listed as the [[List of tallest residential buildings in the world|13th tallest residential building in the world]] in January 2014.&lt;ref name=TallestRes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/List/tallest-residential-100-buildings |title=100 Tallest Residential Buildings in the World |work=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |access-date=3 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210210241/http://skyscrapercenter.com/List/tallest-residential-100-buildings |archivedate=10 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential architecture is not defined by a single architectural style, but rather an eclectic mix of houses, townhouses, condominiums, and apartment buildings in the metropolitan area (particularly in areas of urban sprawl). Freestanding dwellings with relatively large gardens are perhaps the most common type of housing outside inner city Melbourne. Victorian terrace housing, townhouses and historic [[Italianate]], [[Tudor revival]] and [[Georgian architecture|Neo-Georgian]] mansions are all common in neighbourhoods such as [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]].

Melbourne has a wide range of religious faiths, the most widely held of which is [[Christianity]]. This is signified by the city's two large cathedrals—[[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Patrick's]] (Roman Catholic), and [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's]] (Anglican).

==Governance==
[[File:Victoria Parliament House Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|[[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]]]]
The governance of Melbourne is split between the [[government of Victoria]] and the [[Local Government Areas of Victoria#Municipalities of Greater Melbourne|27 cities and four shires]] that make up the metropolitan area. There is no ceremonial or political head of Melbourne, but the [[Lord Mayor of Melbourne|Lord Mayor of the City of Melbourne]] often fulfils such a role as a first among equals,&lt;ref&gt;

Most other government services are provided or regulated by the [[government of Victoria|Victorian state government]], which governs from [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]] in [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]]. These include services associated with local government in other countries and include public transport, main roads, traffic control, policing, education above preschool level, health and planning of major infrastructure projects. The state government retains the right to override certain local government decisions, including urban planning, and Melburnian issues often feature prominently in state election.

==Infrastructure==
In 2012, Mercer Consulting ranked Melbourne's infrastructure 17th in the world, behind only one other Australian city, Sydney, which ranked 10th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = City Mayors: Best cities in the world|url = http://www.citymayors.com/features/quality_survey.html|website = www.citymayors.com|accessdate = 27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''movie palace''' (or '''picture palace''' in the United Kingdom) is any of the large, elaborately decorated [[movie theater]]s built between the 1910s and the 1940s. The late 1920s saw the peak of the movie palace, with hundreds opened every year between 1925 and 1930. With the advent of television, movie attendance dropped and many movie palaces were razed or converted into multiple screen venues or performing arts centers.

There are three architectural design types of movie palaces. First, the classical style movie palace, with its opulent, luxurious architecture; second, the [[atmospheric theatre]] which has an auditorium ceiling that resembles an open sky as a defining feature; and finally, the [[Art Deco]] theaters that became popular in the 1930s.

==Background==
Paid exhibition of motion pictures began on April 14, 1894, at Andrew M. Holland's phonograph store, located at 1155 Broadway in New York City, with the '''[[Kinetoscope]]'''. Dropping a nickel in a machine allowed a viewer to see a short motion picture, devoid of plot. The machines were installed in Kinetoscope parlors, hotels, [[department store]]s, bars and drugstores in large American cities. The machines were popular from 1894 to 1896, but by the turn of the century had almost disappeared as Americans rejected the solitary viewing experience and boring entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, ''The Show Starts on the Sidewalk'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1900, motion pictures became a small part of '''[[vaudeville]] theatres'''. The competitive vaudeville theatre market caused owners to constantly look for new entertainment, and the motion picture helped create demand, although the new form of entertainment was not the main draw for patrons. It was often used as a "chaser"—shown as the end of the performance to chase the audience from the theatre. These theatres were designed much like legitimate theatres. The [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] of these theatres was formal and ornate. They were not designed for motion pictures, but rather live stage performances.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, ''The Show Starts on the Sidewalk'', 16–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, the '''storefront theatre''' was born at [[Thomas Lincoln Tally]]'s Electric Theatre in Los Angeles. These soon spread throughout the country as empty storefronts were equipped with chairs, a [[Vitascope]] projector, a muslin sheet on which the motion picture was exhibited, darkened windows, and a box by the door to service as a ticket office (literally, the "box office".) Storefront theatres, supplied with motion pictures made in Chicago and New York, spread throughout America. These theatres exhibited a motion picture at a specific time during the day.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, ''The Show Starts on the Sidewalk'', 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Air domes''' also became popular in warm climates and in the summertime in northern climates. With no roof and only side walls or fences, the air domes allowed patrons to view motion pictures in a venue that was cooler than the stifling atmosphere of the storefront theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, ''The Show Starts on the Sidewalk'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|'''Nickelodeon''']] was born. Rather than exhibiting one program a night, the Nickelodeon offered continuous motion picture entertainment for five cents. They were widely popular. By 1910, Nickelodeons grossed $91 million in the United States. The Nickelodeons were like simple storefront theatres, but differed in the continuous showings and the marketing to women and families.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, ''The Show Starts on the Sidewalk'', 23–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''movie house''', in a building designed specifically for motion picture exhibition, was the last step before the movie palace. Comfort was paramount, with upholstered seating and climate controls. One of the first movie houses was Tally's Broadway Theater in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, ''The Show Starts on the Sidewalk'', 30–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

{{See also|Atmospheric theatre}}

The movie palace was developed as the step beyond the small theaters of the 1900s and 1910s. As motion pictures developed as an art form, theatre infrastructure needed to change. Storefront theatres and Nickelodeons catered to the busy work lives and limited budgets of the lower and middle classes. Motion pictures were generally only thought to be for the lower classes at that time as they were simple, short, and cost only five cents to attend. While the middle class regularly began to attend the Nickelodeons by the early 1910s the upperclass continued to attend stage theater performances such as the opera and big-time vaudeville.&lt;ref name="Enchanted Evenings"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://xroads.virginia.edu/~cap/palace/|title = Some Enchanted Evenings: American Picture Palaces|date = January 1998|accessdate = |website = Some Enchanted Evenings: American Picture Palaces|publisher = American Studies at the University of Virginia|last = Halnon|first = Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as more sophisticated, complex, and longer films featuring prominent stage actors were developed, the upperclass desires to attend the movies began to increase and a demand for higher class theaters began to develop.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Consuming Illusion, Illusions of Consumability: American Movie Palaces of the 1920s|last = Slowinska|first = Maria|date = 2005|journal = Amerikastudien|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nickelodeons could not meet this demand as the upperclass feared the moral repercussions of intermingling between women and children with immigrants. There were also real concerns over the physical safety of the Nickelodeon theaters themselves as they were often cramped with little ventilation and the nitrate film stock used at the time was extremely flammable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Spectacles of Conspicuous Consumption: Picture Palaces, War Profiteers and the Social Dynamics of Moviegoing in the Netherlands, 1914-1922|last = Van Der Velden|first = André|date = 2010|journal = Film History|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demand for an upscale film theater, suitable to exhibit films to the upperclass, was first met when the Regent Theater, designed by [[Thomas W. Lamb|Thomas Lamb]], was opened in February 1913, becoming the first ever movie palace.&lt;ref name="Enchanted Evenings" /&gt; However the theater's location in Harlem prompted many to suggest that the theater be moved to Broadway alongside the stage theaters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These desires were satisfied when Lamb built the [[Strand Theatre (Manhattan)|Strand Theatre]] on Broadway, which was opened in 1914 by [[Mitchel H. Mark]] at the cost of one-million dollars.&lt;ref name="Enchanted Evenings" /&gt; This opening was the first example of a success in drawing the upper middle class to the movies and it spurred others to follow suit. As their name implies movie palaces were advertised to, "make the average citizen feel like royalty."&lt;ref name="Enchanted Evenings" /&gt; To accomplish this these theaters were outfitted with a plethora amenities such as larger sitting areas, air conditioning, and even childcare services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = When Movie Palaces Reigned|last = Melnick|first = Ross|date = April 25, 2014|work = Hollywood Reporter|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1914 and 1922 over 4,000 movie palaces were opened. Notable pioneers of movies palaces include the [[Chicago]] firm of [[Rapp and Rapp]], which designed the [[Chicago Theatre|Chicago]], the [[Uptown Theatre (Chicago)|Uptown]], and the [[Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre|Oriental Theatres]]. [[Samuel Roxy Rothafel|S.L. "Roxy" Rothafel]], originated the deluxe presentation of films with themed stage shows. [[Sid Grauman]], built the first movie palace on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles']] [[Million Dollar Theater]], in 1918.

===Decline===
Following World War II movie ticket sales began to rapidly decline due to the widespread adoption of television and [[White flight|mass migration]] of the population from the cities, where all the movie palaces had been built, and into the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Chicago's Magnificent Movie Palaces|last = Bushnell|first = George|date = 1977|journal = Chicago History|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The closing of most movie palaces occurred after ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' in 1948, which ordered all of the major film studios to sell their theaters. Most of the newly independent theaters could not continue to operate on the low admissions sales of the time without the financial support of the major studios and were forced to close.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = THE PICTURE PALACE: ECONOMIC SENSE OR HOLLYWOOD NONSENSE?|last = Gomery|first = Douglas|date = 1978|journal = Quarterly Review of Film Studies|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were able to stay in business by converting to operate as [[Race film|race]] or [[Adult movie theater|pornography theaters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Southern Movie Palace: Rise, Fall, and Resurrection|last = Alley-Young|first = Gordon|date = 2005|journal = Southern Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal of the South|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Eberson specialized in the subgenre of "atmospheric" theatres.  His first, of the five hundred in his career, was the 1923 Majestic in [[Houston, Texas]].  The atmospherics usually conveyed the impression of sitting in an outdoor courtyard, surrounded by highly ornamented asymmetrical facades and exotic flora and fauna, underneath a dark blue canopy; when the lights went out, a specially designed projector, the Brenograph, was used to project clouds, and special celestial effects on the ceiling.

Lamb's style was initially based on the more traditional, "hardtop" form patterned on [[opera house]]s, but was no less ornate. His theaters evolved from relatively restrained neo-classic designs in the 1910s to those with elaborate baroque and Asian motifs in the late 1920s.

The movie palace's signature look was one of extravagant ornamentation. The theaters were often designed with an eclectic exoticism where a variety of referenced visual styles collided wildly with one another.  French Baroque, High Gothic, Moroccan, Mediterranean, Spanish Gothic, Hindu, Babylonian, Aztec, Mayan, Orientalist, Italian Renaissance, and (after the discovery of [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]]'s [[KV62|tomb]] in 1922) [[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian Revival]] were all variously mixed and matched.  This wealth of ornament was not merely for aesthetic effect.  It was meant to create a fantasy environment to attract moviegoers and involved a type of social engineering, distraction, and traffic management, meant to work on human bodies and minds in a specific way. Today, most of the surviving movie palaces operate as regular theaters, showcasing concerts, plays and operas.

First, these authors suggest that much of the evidence of peri-mortem trauma identified by Mirazón Lahr et al. is equally - if not more - likely to have occurred after deposition, that is, after the skeletons were buried, intentionally or otherwise. Second, Stojanowski et al. disagree over the interpretation of the site formation processes. Where Mirazón Lahr et al. see little evidence for intentional burial at the site, Stojanowski and colleagues argue that the bodies at Nataruk are mostly articulated, spatially organized, non-commingled, and preserve limited variation in body positioning, all of which are inconsistent with skeletons from well-documented massacre sites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Christian|last2=Lohr|first2=Christian|last3=Gronenborn|first3=Detlef|last4=Alt|first4=Kurt W.|date=2015-09-08|title=The massacre mass grave of Schöneck-Kilianstädten reveals new insights into collective violence in Early Neolithic Central Europe|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/36/11217|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=36|pages=11217–11222|doi=10.1073/pnas.1504365112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4568710|pmid=26283359}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{coord|2.70661|36.14191|display=title}}

It is unclear exactly what happened at the site, but Mirazón Lahr stand by their interpretation that it was a massacre, the result of an attack by another group of [[hunter-gatherers]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lahr|first=M.

==Turkana in the late [[Pleistocene]]–early [[Holocene]]==

10,000 years ago, Turkana was lush and fertile; [[Lake Turkana]] was much larger than it is today. Many sites from this time period have been found along the ancient shore of the lake. Nataruk is one of these sites, a temporary camp where a band of hunter-gatherers went to fish and hunt. The area has produced thousands of animal fossils: elephants, hippos, rhinos, giraffe, zebras, warthogs, buffaloes, antelopes, gazelles, primates, hyraxes, snakes, turtles, crocodiles and fish, as well as lions, hyaenas and wild dogs. The people of southwest Turkana at this time were hunters, gatherers, and fishers. Evidence for hunting and butchering animals has been found, along with hundreds of barbed bone harpoons used for fishing. Pottery has also been found from this time period, and was possibly used for keeping water, or fish, or berries, or even perhaps hippopotamus fat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==The discoveries at Nataruk==

In 2012, fragments of human bones were found on the surface at Nataruk, mixed with gravel, an area that is barren desert today. The survey of the site showed that Nataruk was exceptional not only in the number of exposed remains, but also in their distribution throughout a large area of ~200 x 100 m, forming clusters along a sandy ridge and on two mounts. By the time the excavations were completed, archaeologists had found the remains of 27 people—6 young children, 1 teenager and 20 adults. Twelve of the skeletons—7 men and 5 women—were found as they had died, unburied until they were covered by the shallow water of the lagoon.

Ten of these 12 skeletons show lesions caused by violence—in the head, neck, ribs, hands, and knees, all the parts of the skeleton most commonly involved in cases of violence. These include 2 cases of projectiles in direct association with the remains, one still embedded on the side of the skull, 2 cases of sharp-force trauma to the neck, 7 cases of blunt and/or sharp-force trauma to the head, 2 cases of blunt-force trauma to the knees and 1 to the ribs, and 2 cases of fractures to the hands, possibly caused while parrying a blow.

The lesions were caused by at least 3 types of weapons: projectiles (stone-tipped as well as sharpened arrows), by a weapon similar to a club, and by another close-proximity weapon, possibly a club or wooden handle with hafted sharp stone blades that caused deep cuts. Two individuals were found to have no lesions in the preserved parts of the skeleton, but the position of their hands suggests they may have been bound, including a young woman who was heavily pregnant at the time.

The site of Nataruk and the human remains it preserved were dated three different methods: radiocarbon, carried out by Rachel Wood at the Australian National University and Beta Analytic Inc., optically stimulated luminescence carried out by Jean-Luc Schwenninger at the University of Oxford, and Uranium-series by Rainer Grün, at Griffiths University, showing them to be between 10,500 and 9,500 years ago.

==Nataruk and the prehistory of warfare==

Warfare, or inter-group conflict, is today associated with one group of people wanting the territory, resources, or power held by another. Prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies were not sedentary and did not own land or have significant possessions, and their small numbers constrained the development of social hierarchies. Therefore, many scholars have argued that warfare only emerged after sedentism, farming, and more complex political systems arose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fry|first1=D. P.|last2=Soderberg|first2=P. |year=2013 |title=Lethal Aggression in Mobile Forager Bands and Implications for the Origins of War |journal=Science |volume=341 |issue=6143 |pages=270–273 |doi=10.1126/science.1235675 |url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6143/270 |pmid=23869015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this view has been disputed by other scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wrangham|first1=Richard W.|last2=Glowacki|first2=Luke |year=2012 |title=Intergroup Aggression in Chimpanzees and War in Nomadic Hunter-Gatherers|journal=Human Nature |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=5–29 |doi=10.1007/s12110-012-9132-1 |url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12110-012-9132-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Mirazón Lahr and colleagues' interpretations are correct, the findings at Nataruk suggest that inter-group conflict has a long history and was part of the life of hunter-gatherers.

Mirazón Lahr argues that this challenges our views of what are the causes of conflict; while it is possible that human prehistoric societies simply responded antagonistically to chance encounters with other groups, she believes that the event preserved at Nataruk was a deliberate attack by one group of hunter-gatherers on another. The evidence from Nataruk shows that the attacking party was carrying weapons that would not normally be carried while hunting and fishing. The lesions show that clubs of at least two sizes were used, indicating that more than one of the attackers were carrying them. The attack combined distance (arrows) and close-proximity (melee) weaponry (clubs, stone knives), suggesting premeditation and planning. Also, there are other examples, though isolated, of violent trauma in the early Holocene archaeological record of Southwest Turkana; one, discovered in the 1970s by archaeologist Larry Robbins, was found ~20&amp;nbsp;km north of Nataruk at the site of Lothagam; the other two were also discovered by the IN-AFRICA Project at a site close to Nataruk named Kalakoel 4. All three cases involved projectiles, one of the hallmarks of inter-group conflict. Finally, two of the projectiles found embedded in the human skeletons at Nataruk and in 2 of the other 3 cases of violent trauma in Southwest Turkana were made of obsidian, a rare stone in this area, suggesting that the attackers came from a different place. This shows that such attacks happened multiple times in at least three different locations within a relatively small area.

Regarding the motive for the attack, the hunter-gatherers that lived around Nataruk may have had valuable resources that were worth fighting for—water, game and its meat, fish, nuts, or indeed women and children, suggesting that two of the conditions associated with warfare among settled societies—territory and resources—were probably the same for these groups. In particular, that part of the basin would have had an extensive beach along a shallow lake shore that attracted land animals to water and also provided perfect fishing grounds, making it the perfect place to hunt and fish. In contrast, a few kilometres to the east and to the north, the ancient deltas of the [[Kerio River]] and [[Turkwel River]] would have been forested and more dangerous, while further to the east the mountains that separate [[Lake Turkana]] from the [[Suguta Valley]] reached into the water. So Nataruk was at the centre of the best hunting and fishing grounds in that part of the [[Turkana Basin]], and the hunter-gatherer communities there had access to much richer resources than others.

Mirazón Lahr argues that evolution is about survival, and that our species is no different from others in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://in-africa.org/discoveries-at-nataruk/|title = IN-AFRICA Project|date = 21 January 2016|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; When resources are insufficient, competing is part of surviving, and when groups thrive and expand over the territory of others, it can lead to conflict. In her view, the key to prehistoric conflict was probably population density: very low numbers may have inhibited warfare, while inter-group conflict may have been common in periods of food abundance and increased population density. These conditions were a recurrent part of our evolutionary history, making Nataruk extraordinary not because warfare was rare or because it is 10,000 years old, but because the evidence of inter-group violence rarely preserved in the archaeology of nomadic peoples. Unexpectedly, perhaps, those conditions arose when resources were plentiful.

==Nataruk and Jebel Sahaba==

The [[Qadan culture|Qadan]] graveyard at [[Jebel Sahaba]] (Site 117) is an extraordinary archaeological site. It was excavated by [[Fred Wendorf]] in the 1960s, who believed it to be of late Pleistocene-early Holocene age:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...Near the end of the 1965 excavations several members of the Finnish Expedition joined in the effort to excavate the graveyard. Three burials were cleared by the Finnish group, and one skull was taken to the [[National Museum of Finland]]. Forty-nine skeletons were uncovered at this time. Subsequent excavations were undertaken by Marks in October, 1966, and six more skeletons were found. A total of 58 skeletons were recovered from all three projects at the site. Most of these were in excellent condition, and included both males and females, infants and adults. Although radiocarbon dates are not available, on the basis of associated artifacts, plus tenuous geologic evidence, the skeletons are believed to date somewhere between 12,000 and 10,000 B.C. They are particularly significant in that they provide an unusual opportunity to examine a sizable population of Late Pleistocene age." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Prehistory of Nubia|last = Wendorf|first = F|publisher = Southern Methodist University Press|year = 1968|isbn = |location = |pages = 954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Antoine Zazzo has since carried out radiocarbon dating of the human remains using apatite,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zazzo|first1=Antoine|title=Bone and enamel carbonate diagenesis: A radiocarbon prospective|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=416|year=2014|pages=168–178|issn=0031-0182|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.05.006 |url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018214002399}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he stresses the ages obtained should be treated with caution "...because the reliability of the reference age, a bone collagen sample dated in the late 60's or very early 70's, i.e.well before the advent of modern purification techniques, and in a site where collagen preservation is very poor, remains questionable."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the combination of the dates obtained by Antoine, and Wendorf's own assessment of the likely age of the remains, are a strong indication that the age of the human remains in the cemetery must be either a little older or similar to that of Nataruk.

The similarity in age between the two sites makes the comparison of the violent events they preserve fascinating. Jebel Sahaba is a cemetery, in which 58 people were intentionally buried, all in the same position, and in relatively elaborate graves, with some graves either lined by vertical large stone slabs, or covered by horizontal ones. Twenty-three of the 58 people buried at Jebel Sahaba have evidence of having died violently, including embedded projectiles. However, several aspects make Jebel Sahaba very different from Nataruk, suggesting parallels between Jebel Sahaba and later Neolithic sedentary societies:

# the fact that there was a large cemetery, and one with architecture suggests that the community to whom those interred at Cemetery 117 lived in a settlement somewhere in the vicinity of the site, thus no longer as nomadic hunter-gatherers;
# the fact that some of the graves contain more than one skeleton (some with both adults and children) opens the possibility that each grave is an "event", and that the deaths record not a single violent encounter as in Nataruk, but recurrent attacks on the Jebel Sahaba community throughout a period of time, and that the community buried their dead after each attack, in their own cemetery;
# the fact that the bodies were buried, means that their own community had time after the events in which people died to prepare a grave, of the right size for the number of individuals, in some cases lining them with slabs, to bury them following their traditions, placing the bodies in the same flexed position with the face oriented in the same direction.

The differences between the two sites make what was discovered at Nataruk even more significant by establishing that inter-group violence can and did arise independent of whether populations were sedentary and had possessions that today are identified as valuable. All it needed was for the benefits of stealing from another group to outweigh the costs of fighting for therm.

The '''National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act''' of 2000 (NHLPA; Public Law 106-355; 16 U.S.C. 470w-7) is [[United States|American]] legislation creating a process for the transfer of federally owned [[lighthouse]]s into private hands. It was created as an extension of the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]].

==Background==
Maintenance of [[aid to navigation|aids to navigation]] had been assigned to the federal government from the beginning, first under the Department of the Treasury, and then under the U.S. Lighthouse Board (1852-1910) and its successor, the U.S. Lighthouse Service. In 1939 lighthouses were placed under the authority of the [[United States Coast Guard]], which also took over the manning of lights with keepers. Throughout this period the expense of maintaining and staffing lights was constantly stressed. Automation of lights began early in the twentieth century, and a major push in the early 1960s relieved all but a few lighthouses of their keepers.

Lighthouses are fairly high maintenance structures, being subject to marine air and the erosional effects of wave and ice. Unmanned structures were also found vulnerable to vandalism and theft. Therefore, automation of many lights led to their effective demolition. The [[screw-pile lighthouse]]s of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region were particularly vulnerable due to their wood construction, and only four of these survive out of the several dozen constructed; and of these, only the [[Thomas Point Shoal Light]] stands at its original location, the other three having been moved to museum settings.

The expense of maintaining the light''houses'' continued to drag on the coast guard budget. On the other hand, there is much sentimental and historical attachment to the lighthouses. Many surviving lighthouses are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. While some lighthouses have been transferred to museums, most are impossible to move.

==The Maine Lighthouse Program==
In the early 1990s, the [[Island Institute]] of [[Rockland, Maine]] approached the Coast Guard about acquiring the [[Heron Neck Light]] with the intent of restoring the keeper's house, which had been seriously damaged in a fire in 1989. Negotiations dragged on for several years before the institute took charge of the light in 1993; meanwhile, the Coast Guard had announced that it intended to dispose of seven other Maine lighthouses. In 1994 a working group, sponsored by the institute, worked out a program to allow expedited transfers of Maine lighthouses to private concerns, and in 1996 the Maine Lighthouse Program was passed into law by congress. This program was specifically intended to transfer properties to nonprofit groups who would maintain public access to the facilities. In the end twenty-eight light stations were disposed of through this program, which paved the way for the more comprehensive NHLPA.

==Provisions of the Act==
The NHLPA was enacted in 2000 as an amendment of the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]]. It establishes a multiple step process involving the [[United States Coast Guard]], the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA), and the [[National Park Service]].

The first step is the determination of the property as "excess to service requirements" by the Coast Guard and its identification as a historic structure. This determination is reported to the GSA and notice is given that application made be made for the structure. In this phase non-profit and/or historical organizations may apply; if application is made and accepted, the lighthouse is simply transferred to the applicant subject to compliance with requirements to maintain the light and make it available to the public. The NPS administers this section of the program.

If no suitable applications are received, GSA may put the structure up for sale at auction.

==History of the program==
A pilot program was initiated in the Fall of 2001 involving nine lighthouses, eight of which were transferred according to the provisions of the act:
*[[St. Augustine Light]]
*[[Tybee Island Light]]
*[[Little River Light]]
*[[Cheboygan River Range Front Light]]
*[[Munising Front Range Light]]
*[[Esopus Meadows Light]]
*[[Rondout Light]]
*[[Currituck Beach Light]]

(The ninth, the [[Sturgeon Point Light]], was eventually transferred to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in 2005.) The following fall the program was expanded, with nineteen additional lights offered. As of June 2007 74 lighthouses have been offered under the provisions of the act, with disposition as follows:

:*2 removed from program at USCG request
:*25 transferred
:*12 recommended for transfer
:*8 sold by GSA at auction
:*4 awaiting GSA disposal
:*10 in application
:*13 announced for availability in 2007

'''Sir Nicolas Cheetham''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCMG}} (8 October 1910 – 14 January 2002) was a British diplomat and writer.

==Career==
Nicolas John Alexander Cheetham (son of [[Milne Cheetham|Sir Milne Cheetham]], also a diplomat) was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. He entered the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|Diplomatic Service]] in 1934&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=34132 |page=1015 |date=12 February 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served at [[Athens]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Mexico City]] and [[Vienna]].

In 1948 Cheetham, in charge of the [[Allied Control Commission]] in Vienna, attended a meeting of the Anglo-Russian Society to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the [[Red Army]]. The Soviet commander-in-chief, General [[Vladimir Kurasov]], made a speech claiming that Britain and the USA had helped Hitler to prepare for war against the Soviet Union, and were plotting a war themselves. Cheetham and the American envoy, Sidney Mellon, got up and walked out. Afterwards, in answer to a question in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the Foreign Secretary, [[Ernest Bevin]], said that the Government fully endorsed Cheetham's action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS33900122&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0 House of Commons], ''The Times'', London, 26 February 1948, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheetham was [[Diplomatic rank|Minister]] to [[Hungary]] 1959–61,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=41936 |page=610 |date=22 January 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant [[Permanent Under-Secretary|Under-Secretary]] at the [[Foreign Office]] 1961–64, and [[Ambassador]] to [[Mexico]] 1964–68.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=43296 |page=3199 |date=14 April 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from the Diplomatic Service, Cheetham wrote historical books.

==Family==
In 1936, he married Jean Evison Corfe, daughter of Lt.-Col. Arthur Cecil Corfe. They had two sons. After a divorce, he married in 1960 Lady Mabel Kathleen Jocelyn (1915–1985), daughter of the 8th [[Earl of Roden]] and former wife of [[Brooke baronets|Sir Richard Brooke, 10th Baronet]] (who himself remarried Cheetham's former wife).

==Honours==
Cheetham was appointed [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]] in the [[New Year Honours]] of 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=39732 |supp=y |page=6 |date=1 January 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knighted KCMG in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=43343 |supp=y |page=4941 |date=13 June 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orderic Vitalis''' ({{lang-la|Ordericus Vitalis}}; 1075&amp;nbsp;– {{circa|lk=no|1142}}) was an [[English historians in the Middle Ages|English chronicler]] and [[Order of St. Benedictine|Benedictine]] monk who wrote one of the great contemporary [[chronicle]]s of 11th- and 12th-century [[Normandy]] and [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] England. Modern historians view him as a reliable source.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:M%C3%A9daillon_m%C3%A9morial_d%27Orderic_Vital.JPG|thumb|290px]]
==Background==
Orderic was born on 16 February 1075 in [[Atcham]], [[Shropshire]], England, the eldest son of a French priest, Odelerius of [[Orléans]], who had entered the service of [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]], and had received from his patron a chapel there. Orderic was one of the few monks who were of mixed parentage as his mother was of English heritage. When Orderic was five, his parents sent him to an English monk, Siward by name, who kept a school in the [[Shrewsbury Abbey|Abbey of SS Peter and Paul]] at [[Shrewsbury]].

At the age of eleven, Orderic was entrusted as an [[oblate]] to the [[Abbey of Saint-Evroul]] in the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which Montgomerie had formerly despoiled but, in his later years, was loading with gifts. The parents paid thirty [[Mark (money)|marks]] for their son's admission; he expresses the conviction that they imposed this exile upon him from an earnest desire for his welfare. Odelerius's respect for the monastic life is attested to by his own entry, a few years later, into a monastery which the earl had founded at his persuasion. Orderic, on the other hand, felt for some time, as he asserts, like [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] in a strange land. He did not know a word of French when he reached Normandy. His book, though written many years later, shows that he never lost his English cast of mind or his attachment to the country of his birth.

==Monastic life==
When Orderic reached the legal age for [[profession (religious)|profession]] as a monk, his monastic superiors gave him the [[religious name]] of "Vitalis" (after a member of the legendary [[Theban Legion]] of [[Christian martyrs]]) because they found a difficulty in pronouncing his unusual baptismal name. In the title of his great chronicle, he prefixes the old to the new name and proudly adds the epithet ''Angligena'' ("English-born").

Orderic's cloistered life was uneventful. He became a [[deacon]] in 1093, and a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] in 1107. He left his cloister on several occasions, speaking of having visited [[Croyland]], [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], [[Cambrai]] (1105) and [[Cluny Abbey]] (1132). He turned his attention at an early date to literature, and for many years appears to have spent his summers in the [[scriptorium]].

Orderic's first literary efforts were a continuation of [[William of Jumièges]]' ''Gesta normannorum ducum'', a broad history of the Normans and their dukes from the founding of Normandy, which Orderic carried forward into the early twelfth century.

At some time between 1110 and 1115,&lt;ref&gt;Dates from Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Orderic's superiors ordered him to write the history of Saint-Evroul. The work, the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' (''Ecclesiastical History''), grew under his hands until it became a general history of his own age. Saint-Evroul was a house of wealth and distinction. War-worn knights chose it as a resting place for their last years. It was constantly entertaining visitors from southern Italy, where it had established new foundations, and from England, where it had extensive possessions. Thus Orderic, though he witnessed no great events, was well-informed about them. In spite of a cumbrous and affected style, he is a vivid narrator; his character sketches are admirable as summaries of current estimates. His narrative is badly arranged and full of unexpected digressions, but he relays much invaluable information not provided by more methodical chroniclers. He throws a flood of light upon the manners and ideas of his own age, and sometimes comments with surprising shrewdness upon the broader aspects and tendencies of history. His narrative breaks off in the middle of 1141, though he added some finishing touches in 1142. He reports that he was then old and infirm (that year he would have reached the age of 67 years); he probably did not long survive the completion of his great work.

==The ''Historia Ecclesiastica''==
The ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', described as the greatest English social history of the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; falls into three sections:

1) Books i and ii give the history of Christianity from the [[birth of Christ]]. After 855 this becomes a bare catalogue of [[pope]]s, ending with the name of [[Innocent I]]. These books Orderic added in 1136–1141 as an afterthought to the original scheme.

2) Books iii through vi form a history of Saint-Evroul, the original nucleus of the work. Planned before 1122, they were mainly composed in the years 1123–1131. The fourth and fifth books contain long digressions on the deeds of [[William the Conqueror]] in Normandy and England. Before 1067 these are chiefly derived from two extant sources: [[William of Jumièges|William of Jumieges]]' ''Gesta Normannorum Ducum'' and [[William of Poitiers]]' ''Gesta Guillelmi''. For the years 1067–1071 Orderic follows the lost portion of the ''Gesta Guillelmi'', and is therefore of the first importance. From 1071, he begins to be an independent authority. Notices of political events in this part of his work are far less copious than in the later books.

3) Books vii through xiii relegate ecclesiastical affairs to the background. In this section, after sketching the history of France under the [[Carolingian]] and early [[Capet]] dynasties, Orderic takes up the events of his own times, starting from about 1082. He has much to say concerning the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]], the [[papacy]], the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Normans in Sicily and Apulia]] and the [[First Crusade]] (for which he follows [[Fulcher of Chartres]] and [[Baudri of Bourgueil]]). But his chief interest is in the histories of the three brothers: [[Robert Curthose|Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy]], [[William Rufus]] and [[Henry I of England]]. He continues his work, in the form of annals, up to the defeat and capture of [[Stephen of England]] at [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Lincoln]] in 1141.

The historian [[Marjorie Chibnall]] states that Orderic used now-lost ''[[pancartes]]'' (cartularies or collections of charters) of various Norman monastic houses as sources for his historical writings.&lt;ref name=Chibnall12&gt;Chibnall "Charter and Chronicle" ''Church and Government'' pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baron Péter Révay de Szklabina et Blathnicza''' (used aliases of his name include '''Révai''', '''Rewa''', '''Réva'''; 2 February 1568 &amp;ndash; 4 June 1622) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] nobleman, Royal Crown Guard for the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]], [[poet]], state official, [[soldier]] and [[historian]]. 
He was the grandson of [[Ferenc Révay]].

==Life==
Péter Révay was born in [[Sklabiňa|Szklabina]], a member of [[Révay|an old family]] from the [[Turiec|Turóc]] region. He was the third child of [[Mihály Révay]] and his mother Anna Bakics. He received his education in [[Bardejov|Bártfa]], [[Jihlava]], probably also in [[Vienna]], and between 1589 and 1591 in [[Strasbourg]], where he was awarded the title of a Master of Philosophy. In 1598 he became the hereditary county head (called a [[ispán|főispán]]) of the [[Turiec|Turóc]] [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|Comitatus]]. From 1601 he discharged the duties of a Royal Commissary. He became Royal Crown Guard in 1608. In 1610 he became the Royal Courtmaster, from 1615 the Chief Doormaster, and from 1619 a Tablemaster. He had a relatively wide-reaching knowledge of [[philosophy]] and [[history]], mastered the art of oration, several languages, built a rich library, and thanks to the above became a respected political and cultural personality. He fought in a war with the [[Ottoman empire]] ([[Esztergom]], [[Visegrád]], [[Fiľakovo|Fülek]], [[Nógrád]]). He also became one of the leading representatives of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] nobility, supporting sacral literature. He died in [[Trenčín|Trencsén]], but was buried in [[Martin, Slovakia|Turócszentmárton]].

==Work==
His poetry and historical works influenced the later [[Slovakia|Slovak]] historical literature and patriotic works. Révay started producing literature during his studies in [[Strasbourg]]. His first work (besides his master thesis) was published in 1592 (article ''De parricidio''(Grand Treason)). As one of the first historian in the territory of [[Hungary]], he argued for the ancientness of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. His works presented [[Hungary]] as a multi-national state. His correspondence with the officials of his county was conducted in a cultivated [[Slovak language|Slovak]].

==List of works==
*1591 - ''De laudibus Ciceronis'', a lecture advocating oration
*1591 - ''De quattuor virtutibus cardinalibus'', a tractate
*1591 - ''Disputatio de mutuo materiae''
*1592 - ''De parricidio'', article
*1613 - ''De sacra corona regni Hungariae ortu, virtuti, victoria, fortuna… brevis commentarius'', A discourse of the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]].
*1659 - ''De monarchia et sacra corona regni hungariae centuriae septem'' a more comprehensive work about the history of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]].

'''Robin Gerster''' (born 1953) is an Australian [[author]] and [[academic]]. He is a Professor at the School of Languages, Literatures, Cultures and Linguistics at [[Monash University]]. His major fields of expertise are the cultural histories of war and travel, and Western representations of [[Japan]]. As a postgraduate, he won the [[Australian War Memorial]]'s inaugural C.E.W. Bean Scholarship, for his research project on Australian war literature. The PhD thesis that emerged from this research was subsequently published as ''Big-noting: The Heroic Theme in Australian War Writing'', which remains the landmark study in its field. In 1988, it won [[The Age Book of the Year#Non-fiction Award|''The Age'' Book of the Year Award]] in the non-fiction category.

In the 1990s he held the Chair in Australian Studies at the [[University of Tokyo]] – an experience which led to the controversial travel book, ''Legless in Ginza: Orientating Japan'' (1999). His book, ''[[Travels in Atomic Sunshine|Travels in Atomic Sunshine: Australia and the Occupation of Japan]]'', won the [[New South Wales Premier's History Awards#The Australian History Prize|New South Wales Premier's Prize for Australian History]] in 2009, and was shortlisted for the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Non-Fiction Book Award]] and the [[Prime Minister's Prize for Australian History]].

'''Senicide''', or '''geronticide''', is the abandonment to death, [[suicide]], or killing of the [[Old age|elderly]].

== History ==
Societal views and legal repercussions have varied greatly in regards to senicide.

Van Hoof, writing in 1990, examines 87 reports of older people in classical antiquity who have committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Hoof, Anton;  ''From Autothanasia to Suicide.''  (London:  Routledge, 1990) 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these suicides, he claims 20 were motivated by impatience, 17 by humiliation, 12 by vanity, and ten by suffering.  Van Hoof also provides statistics for the manner of the suicide, both successful and unsuccessful.  Starvation was the most widely used, accounting for 18 of the 61 cases available.  Suicide via the use of weapons was second most prevalent making up 13 cases, followed by the use of poison in 11 cases.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hoof 35&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of various methods (seven different methods are reported in all) suggests that no particular technique was believed to be the most proper or entirely condemned.  However, that Athens had a law focusing on suicide by hanging indicates that this manner of suicide was especially disdained, perhaps because the death was intimately connected with a structure that could not be easily removed, such as a tree. Thus, the act of purification, should it be deemed necessary, would be more difficult to perform.

===Ancient Greece &amp; Rome===
Senicide as an institutionalized practice, however, seems to be much less common in ancient Rome and Greece.  Parkin provides eighteen cases of senicide which the people of antiquity believed to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, Tim;  ''Old Age in the Roman World.''  (Baltimore:  Johns Hopkins, 2003) 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these cases, only two of them occur within Greek society, one within Roman society, and the rest falling outside of these two cultures.  One example that Parkin provides is of the island of [[Keos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]].  Although many different variations of the Keian story exist, the legendary practice may have begun when the Athenians besieged the island.  In an attempt to preserve the food supply, the Keians voted for all people over 60 years of age to commit suicide by drinking hemlock.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin 264&lt;/ref&gt;  The other case of Roman senicide occurred on the island of [[Sardinia]], where human sacrifices of 70-years-old fathers were made by their sons to the titan [[Cronus]].

The case of institutionalized senicide occurring in Rome comes from a proverb stating that 60-year-olds were to be thrown from the bridge.  Whether or not this act occurred in reality was highly disputed in antiquity and continues to be doubted today.  The most comprehensive explanation of the tradition comes from Festus writing in the fourth century AD who provides several different beliefs of the origin of the act, including human sacrifice by ancient Roman natives, a Herculean association, and the notion that older men should not vote because they no longer provided a duty to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Parkin 267&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea to throw older men into the river probably coincides with the last explanation given by Festus. That is, younger men did not want the older generations to overshadow their wishes and ambitions and, therefore, suggested that the old men should be thrown off the bridge, where voting took place, and not be allowed to vote.

== Philosophical views on senicide ==
Ancient philosophical thoughts varied greatly in this respect.  [[Plato]] bifurcates suicide in ''Laws'': although killing oneself out of grief, misfortune, or state injunction is acceptable, to commit suicide “owing to sloth and unmanly cowardice” requires purification rituals and demands that the body be buried without an epitaph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0166;layout=;query=section%3D%231146;loc=9.873d Plato. Laws (9.873a).] 29 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] viewed suicide as an unjust act:  “when a man in violation of the law harms another (otherwise than in retaliation) voluntarily, he acts unjustly.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/mirror/classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.5.v.html Aristotle.  ''Nicomachean Ethics'' (5.11)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310214539/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/mirror/classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.5.v.html |date=2007-03-10 }}. 29 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, for a man to harm himself, Aristotle reasons, is an unjust act.

[[Pythagoreas|Pythagorean]] doctrine held that all creatures were being punished by the gods who imprisoned the creatures’ souls in a body.  Thus, any attempt to alter this punishment would be seen as a direct violation of the gods’ wills.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Robert; ''The Greek Way of Death''. (London:  Duckworth, 1985) 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fourth century BC, the [[Hippocratic Oath]] was developed and reads, “I will not give a fatal draught to anyone if I am asked, nor will I suggest any such thing.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1103798 ''The Guide to Life, the Universe, and Everything''.  BBC.  “The Hippocratic Oath.”] 29 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, euthanasia by means of a fatal draught was forbidden.  However, one of the most famous examples of deviation from this code occurred when the physician of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], a philosopher and tutor of [[Nero]], provided the scholar, who was 69 years old at the time, with poison for one of his many failed attempts at suicide.

== Religious views of senicide ==
The societies of antiquity viewed [[suicide]] and [[euthanasia]] very differently from modern culture.  Although factors such as better medical and psychological insight have affected contemporary society's view of suicide and euthanasia, much of the shift in opinion of these forms of death occurred because of the change in religion—that is, [[Greco-Roman]] society was dominated by pagan religions that did not categorically condemn suicide and euthanasia.

Many modern Christians do not accept the practice of suicide or senicide, holding that only God should have control over a person's life and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=15&amp;did=791388571&amp;SrchMode=3&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=6&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1162164751&amp;clientId=15403&amp;aid=1 Mystakidou, Kyriaki, Efi Parpa, Eleni Tsilika, Emmanuaela Katsouda &amp; Lambros Vlahos;  “The Evolution of Euthanasia and its Perceptions in Greek Culture and Civilization.”  ''[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]]'', vol. 48, no. 1 (2005), 95.] 21 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senicide by culture==
===Heruli===
The [[Heruli]] were a Germanic tribe during the [[Migration Period]] (about 400 to 800 CE). [[Procopius]] states in his work ''The Wars'', that the Heruli placed the sick and elderly on a tall stack of wood and stabbed them to death before setting the pyre alight.

=== Inuit ===
A common belief is that the [[Inuit]] would leave their elderly on the ice to die.&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2160/did-eskimos-put-their-elderly-on-ice-floes-to-die Did Eskimos put their elderly on ice floes to die?]''" The Straight Dope (May 4, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Senicide among the Inuit people was rare, except during famines.  The last known case of an Inuit senicide was in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;"Senilicide and Invalidicide among the Eskimos" by Rolf Kjellstr�m in Folk: Dansk etnografisk tidsskrift, volume 16/17 (1974/75)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Notes on Eskimo Patterns of Suicide" by Alexander H. Leighton and Charles C. Hughes in Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, volume 11 (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eskimos and Explorers, 2d ed., by Wendell H. Oswalt (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Ubasute]] (姥捨, abandoning an old woman), a custom allegedly performed in [[Japan]] in the distant past, whereby an infirm or elderly relative was carried to a mountain, or some other remote, desolate place, and left there to die. This custom has been vividly depicted in ''The Ballad of Narayama'' (a 1956 novel by [[Shichirō Fukazawa]], [[The Ballad of Narayama (1958 film)|a 1958 film]], and a [[The Ballad of Narayama (1983 film)|1983 film]]).

===Serbia===
{{main|Lapot}}

===Sweden===
{{main|Ättestupa}}
In Nordic folklore, the [[ättestupa]] is a cliff where elderly people were said to leap, or be thrown, to death. While the practice has no historical evidence, the trope has survived as an [[urban legend]], and a metaphor for deficient welfare for the elderly.

==Senicide in fiction==
Works of fiction which have dealt with senicide include:
*''[[The Old Law]]'', a 17th-century [[tragicomedy]] written by [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Rowley]], and Philip Massinger
*[[Anthony Trollope]]'s 1882 [[dystopia]]n novel, ''[[The Fixed Period]]''

*[[Shohei Imamura]]'s ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1983 film)|The Ballad of Narayama]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]] in [[1983 in film|1983]].

'''''The Rhetoric of Drugs''''' ({{lang-fr|Rhétorique de la drogue}}) in the original French title, is a 1990 work by French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. Derrida, interviewed, discusses the concept of "[[drug]]", and says that "Already one must conclude that the concept of drug is a non-scientific concept, that it is instituted on the basis of moral or political evaluations."&lt;ref&gt;Eng. 1995, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; In his philosophical-linguistic analysis, Derrida unmasks the socio-cultural mystifications made on the [[discourse]]s on drugs.

Derrida also discusses drug use by athletes. Exploring its confines, he says: "and what about women athletes who get [[pregnant]] for the stimulating, hormonal effects and then have an abortion after their event?"&lt;ref&gt;Eng. 1995, p.248 original: "Et la pratique des athlètes femmes qui provoquent une grossesse dont les effets endocriniens sont «dopants» et qui avortent après l’épreuve?"&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida discusses how the link between the rhetoric of drugs and the Western ideology. He also says that "[[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]] correctly point out that drug culture has always been associated with the West's other, with Oriental ethics and religion",&lt;ref name="p250"&gt;Eng. 1995, p.250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adorno and Horkheimer, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; and adds: "The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [...] is in itself a declaration of [[war on drugs]]."&lt;ref name="p250"/&gt;

==Editions==
This interview was made in 1989 and published more than one time as a journal article. It was included in the Derrida's 1992 book ''[[Points de suspension. Entretiens]]'', as section XIV. The English edition of ''Points de suspension. Entretiens'', titled ''[[Points: Interviews 1974-1994]]'' (1995), contained the interview at pp.&amp;nbsp;228–254, as the final part of the chapter ''Autobiophotographies''.

==Reactions==
[[Neurobiologist]] and anti-drug activist [[Rita Levi Montalcini]], which a few months earlier{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} was the protagonist of an anti-drug [[TV ad]] campaign, was bothered by Derrida's work and commented: "Those [substances] that we call drugs are substances that are well identified both on the pharmacological-botanical level and on the behavioural level".&lt;ref&gt;Corriere della Sera, March 1993:&lt;/ref&gt;

Quotes from Montalcini: &lt;blockquote&gt;"the quibbles of a philosopher!" accuses Rita Levi Montalcini, which was the protagonist, with [[Antonio Di Pietro|Di Pietro]] and [[Carlo Maria Martini|Archbishop Martini]], of last anti-drug publicity campaign. [...] Rita Levi Montalcini turns up her nose, bothered:  "it seems to me that this gentleman ( 'questo signore', an Italian mildly derogative expression ) amuses himself quibbling, in order to appear original. Those that we call drugs ( "stupefacenti", an Italian word that sounds somewhat more 'official' ) are substances that are well identified both on the pharmacological-botanical level and on the behavioural level. You can mythologize them as much as you want, but it has been proven, that they are not at all, means to reach an higher knowledge. On the contrary, they decrease cognitive ability and increase emotional responses. Neither Newton nor Einstein made their discoveries under the action of any drug".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Wojciech Karpiński''' (born 11 May 1943 in [[Warsaw]]) is a Polish writer, [[History of ideas|historian of ideas]] and literary critic.

== Life ==

Wojciech Karpiński was born 11 May 1943 in Poland, as a son to the architect [[Zbigniew Karpiński]] and grandson to [[Wojciech Zatwarnicki]] (1874–1948), who during World War II operated a [[HeHalutz]] farm on his estate in the Warsaw district of [[Czerniaków]], saving the lives of many Jews from the [[Warsaw ghetto]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Yitzhak Zuckerman]], ''A Surplus of Memory: Chronicle of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising'', Berkeley 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also nephew of the poet [[Światopełk Karpiński]].

Karpiński graduated from the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1966 with a degree in [[Romance languages]] and literatures and in 1967 became a lecturer. In the 1960s he started collaboration with the ''[[Kultura]]'' émigré monthly, and in 1970 began to write essays for it under various pen names to avoid persecution by Poland's Communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Danilewicz-Zielińska, ''Bibliografia. Kultura (1958–1973). Zeszyty Historyczne (1962–1973). Działalność wydawnicza (1959–1973)'', Paris 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s he began to travel to Western Europe, where he was able to meet the Polish émigré ‘outlaw writers’ he admired: [[Aleksander Wat]], [[Konstanty Jeleński|Konstanty A. Jeleński]], [[Józef Czapski]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Gustaw Herling-Grudziński]], [[Jerzy Stempowski]] and [[Czesław Miłosz]]; he embarked on promoting and interpreting their writings.&lt;ref&gt;Wojciech Karpiński, ''Ces livres de grand chemin'', Montricher 1992.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s he joined the [[Polish democratic opposition]]. He obtained his doctorate in 1970, and the same year was expelled from the university because his brother [[Jakub Karpiński]] had been sentenced by a court of the [[People's Republic of Poland]] in the [[Political repression|political trial]] of the [[Taternicy|so-called Tatra climbers]] (they were accused of smuggling forbidden books through the [[Tatra Mountains]]). In 1971–73 he worked for the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. In the mid-1970s he began to write for one of the few relatively independent publications in Poland, ''[[Tygodnik Powszechny]]'', about intellectual history and literature. In 1974 he became an editor of Poland's most important{{According to whom|date=November 2017}} literary monthly, [[Twórczość (monthly)|''Twórczość'']]. In 1975 he signed the [[Letter of the 59]] protesting changes in [[Constitution of Poland|Poland's constitution]] intended to subject Poland fully to the [[USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrzej Friszke]], ''Otwarty sprzeciw'', in: Znak 2011 nr 677.&lt;/ref&gt; He then joined [[Zdzisław Najder]] in creating the Alliance for Polish Independence—Polish democratic opposition underground think tank. Since 1975 he collaborated with the Polish Section of [[Radio Free Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrzej Friszke]], ''Opozycja polityczna w PRL 1945–1980'', London 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, together with [[Marcin Król]], he founded the independent journal ''[[Res Publica (journal)|Res Publica]]''.

Karpiński joined the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity trade union]] in 1980. In 1981 he travelled to the United States on a [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs|Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] grant. When [[Martial law in Poland|martial law was proclaimed in Poland]] on 13 December 1981, his name was on an official list of interned ‘extremist activists of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and other illegal organizations’ published by the government daily ''[[Trybuna Ludu]]'' (17 December 1981)—despite the fact that he was out of the country. In New York City he was one of the creators of the [[Committee in Support of Solidarity]].&lt;ref&gt;Antoni Dudek, Jan Skórzyński, Paweł Sowiński, Małgorzata Strasz, ''Opozycja w PRL: słownik biograficzny 1956–1989''. Vol. 3, Warsaw 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 he taught in the Department of Political Science of [[Yale University]]. In March 1982 he testified about repressions in Poland before the Foreign Relations Committee of the [[US Senate]]. In 1982–2002 he served as a member of the executive committee of the Paris-based Fund for Assistance to Independent Literature and Learning in Poland. Since 1982 he has been an editor of ''[[Zeszyty Literackie]]'', a journal launched in Paris during [[martial law in Poland]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

Karpiński moved to France in 1982, where in between 1982 and 2008 he worked as a researcher of the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris]]. He has taught at the [[University of Texas]] in Austin (1990) and [[New York University]] (1994–95, invited by [[Tony Judt]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jadwiga Czachowska, Alicja Szałagan, Współcześni Polscy pisarze i badacze literatury. Słownik biobibliograficzny. Vol. 4, Warsaw 1996; see also: [http://www.encysol.pl/wiki/Wojciech_Franciszek_Karpiński Online Encyclopedia of Solidarnosc]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

Karpiński made his writing debut in 1964 with an essay on [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]]. He went on to publish in ''[[Kultura]]'', ''Res Publica'', ''Tygodnik Powszechny'', ''[[Znak (publisher)|Znak]]'', ''Zeszyty Literackie'' and ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''.

In Poland, despite [[Censorship in the Polish People's Republic|Communist-era censorship]], Karpiński sneaked articles about banned émigré writers, including [[Gustaw Herling-Grudziński]], [[Konstanty Jeleński|Konstanty A. Jeleński]] and [[Witold Gombrowicz]], into official publications. He shepherded the publication of a volume of essays by Jerzy Stempowski and the first official edition of essays by Konstanty A. Jeleński to be published in the People's Republic of Poland{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

In 1974 Karpiński co-wrote ''Political figures of the 19th century'' with Marcin Król, which became one of the most discussed publications in the democratic opposition of the 1970s. He continued his reflections on political philosophy, democracy and freedom in ''Essays about freedom'' (1980), ''The Slavic quarrel'' (1981), ''Metternich's shadow'' (1982) and ''My private history of freedom'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;Wojciech Karpiński, ''Tło'', in : Wojciech Karpiński, Marcin Król, ''Od Mochnackiego do Piłsudskiego'', Warsaw 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 Karpiński launched a series of books about the intellectuals in the Polish émigré culture ([[Józef Czapski]], [[Czesław Miłosz]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Gustaw Herling-Grudziński]], [[Konstanty Jeleński|Konstanty A. Jeleński]], [[Jerzy Stempowski]], [[Aleksander Wat]]) with a [[Polish underground press|samizdat]] book ''In Central Park''. He also wrote about more universally-known writers and artists ([[Nicola Chiaromonte]], [[Balthus]], [[David Hockney]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]). His subsequent books included ''Outlaw books'' (1988), ''The Blazon of Exile'' (1982) and ''Faces'' (2012).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Two biographies of artists stand out in his work: a painterly and spiritual biography of [[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Van Gogh's pipe'' (1994), and a presentation of life and art of [[Józef Czapski]], the author's close friend for decades, ''A portrait of Czapski'' (1996). Karpiński wrote about Czapski in numerous essays, and edited a volume in French of Czapski's writings (''L'Art et la vie'', 2002). He has also written extensively about the painter and performer [[Krzysztof Jung]]. In 2016 he published ''Henryk'', a biography combining several literary genres, including the essay, reportage and diary, about Henryk Krzeczkowski.

''A memory of Italy'' devoted to art and culture of Italy appeared as a book in 1982, having initially come out in instalments in ''[[Twórczość]]''. After reading these essays, [[Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz]] dedicated his poem ''The Pope in Ancona''&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary East European Poetry: An Anthology'', Oxford University Press 1993, p. 103. See also: Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, ''Caravaggio'', in: ''Życie Warszawy'' 6–7 05 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; to Wojciech Karpiński. While working on it in Rome, Karpiński met Miriam Chiaromonte, widow of Italian writer [[Nicola Chiaromonte]], about whom he would subsequently write, edit his unpublished works and translate his work into Polish. Karpiński continued to write about the history of art and culture in travel essays, ''American shadows'' (1982) and ''Images of London'' (2014).&lt;ref&gt;Jan Zieliński, ''Leksykon polskiej literatury emigracyjnej'', Warsaw 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Karpiński's book-length interviews with [[Leszek Kołakowski]] and Alain Besançon appeared in the 1980s. He also wrote essays about Kołakowski for the volume ''The Blazon of Exile'' (1989) and gave the laudation for Kołakowski at the ceremony awarding him the [[Erasmus Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Laudation published in: ''European Liberty. Four Essays on the Occasion of the 25th Anniversary of the Erasmus Prize Foundation. Raymond Aron, Isaiah Berlin, Leszek Kołakowski, Marguerite Yourcenar'', The Hague 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

His essays were published in [[Jan Kott]]'s ''Four Decades of Polish Essays,''&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Kott]], ''Four Decades of Polish Essays'', Northwestern University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; a presentation of classic Polish essays of the 20th century.
