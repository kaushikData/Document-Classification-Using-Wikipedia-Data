In [[Linux]], and other [[Unix]]-like [[operating system]]s, the {{mono|/boot/}} [[Folder (computing)|directory]] holds files used in [[booting]] the operating system. The usage is standardized in the [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]].

== Contents ==
The contents are mostly Linux kernel files or [[boot loader]] files, depending on the boot loader, most commonly (on Linux) LILO or GRUB.

=== Linux ===
* &lt;code&gt;[[vmlinuz]]&lt;/code&gt; - the Linux kernel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ward | first = Brian | title = How Linux works what every superuser should know | publisher = No Starch Press | location = San Francisco | year = 2004 | isbn = 1593270356 | page = 219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;[[initrd.img]]&lt;/code&gt; – a temporary file system, used prior to loading the kernel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lombardo | first = John | title = Embedded Linux | publisher = New Riders | location = Indianapolis, Ind | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780735709980 | page = 17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;[[System.map]]&lt;/code&gt; – a symbol lookup table&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kopper | first = Karl | title = The Linux Enterprise Cluster build a highly available cluster with commodity hardware and free software | publisher = No Starch Press | location = San Francisco | year = 2008 | isbn = 1593270364 | page = 61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LILO ===
[[LILO (boot loader)|LILO]] creates and uses the following files:
* &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; – a key file, which records where files needed by LILO during boot are stored. Following kernel upgrades, this file must be regenerated by running the "map installer", which is {{mono|/sbin/lilo}} otherwise the system will not boot.
* &lt;code&gt;boot.''xxyy''&lt;/code&gt; – these 512-byte files are backups of [[boot sector]]s, either the [[master boot record]] (MBR) or [[volume boot record]] (VBR), created when LILO overwrites a boot sector. ''xx'' and ''yy'' are the major and minor device numbers in hex;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LILO-2.html#ss2.4 LILO mini-HOWTO: 2.4 How Can I Uninstall Lilo?]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the drive {{mono|sda}} has numbers 8, 0, hence its MBR is backed up to {{mono|boot.0800}} while the partition {{mono|sda3}} has numbers 8,3, hence its VBR is backed up to {{mono|boot.0803}}

LILO may also use other files, such as {{mono|message}} and also stores a non-boot configuration file in {{mono|/etc/lilo.conf}}

=== GRUB ===
[[GRUB]] stores its files in the subdirectory {{mono|grub/}} (so {{mono|/boot/grub/}}). These files are mostly modules ({{mono|.mod}}), with configuration stored in {{mono|grub.cfg}}.

== Location ==
{{mono|/boot/}} is often simply a directory on the main (or only) hard drive partition. However, it may be a separate partition. A separate partition is generally only used when bootloaders are incapable of reading the main filesystem (e.g. SILO does not recognize [[XFS]]) or other problems not easily resolvable by users.

The '''Al-Muthanna Club''' ({{lang-ar|نادي المثنى}}) was an influential [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] [[Fascism|fascist]] society established in [[Baghdad]] ca. 1935 to 1937 which remained active until May 1941, when the coup d'état of pro-[[Nazi]] [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] failed.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Party, Government and Freedom in the Muslim World: Three Articles Reprinted from the Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2d Ed., V. 3|date=1968|issue=pts. 49-50|publisher=E.

''Historical Dictionary of Iraq''. Lanham, Maryland, USA; Oxford, England, UK: Scarecrow Press, 2004. Pp. 167, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Later known as the ''National Democratic Party'', Nadi al-Muthanna was influenced by European fascism and controlled by radical Arab nationalists who, according to 2005's ''Memories of State'', "formed the core of new radicals" for a combined Pan-Arab civilian and military coalition.&lt;ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Islam"&gt;''[[The Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Volume 4, p. 125, by [[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb]], Johannes Hendrik Kramers, [[Bernard Lewis]], [[Charles Pellat]], [[Joseph Schacht]], 1954, [https://books.google.com/books?cd=5&amp;id=kIjrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=al-muthanna+club ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Memories of state"&gt;{{cite book|title=Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq|author=Davis, E.|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520235465|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4qRW5KpgDM4C&amp;pg=PA74|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sami Shawkat==
In 1938, as [[fascism]] in [[Iraq]] grew, Sami Shawkat, a known fascist and a [[pan-Arab]] nationalist, was appointed director-general of education.&lt;ref&gt;''Saddam Hussein and the crisis in the Gulf'' p. 73, Judith Miller, Laurie Mylroie, Biography &amp; Autobiography, Times Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The al-Muthanna club, under [[Germany|German]] ambassador [[Fritz Grobba]]'s influence, developed a youth organization, the [[al-Futuwwa]], modeled on [[Europe]]an [[fascist]] lines and on [[Hitler Youth]],&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1428511/You-boys-you-are-the-seeds-from-which-our-great-President-Saddam-will-rise-again.html|title='You boys you are the seeds from which our great President Saddam will rise again' - Telegraph|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was founded in 1939 by then director-general of Iraq's education (al-Muthanna's co-founder) [[pan-Arab]] activist [[Sami Shawkat]], and was under his guidance.

He is also famous for his 1933 speech "The Manufacture of Death", in which he preached for the highest calling of accepting death for the [[pan-Arabism]] cause, he argued that the ability to cause and accept death in pursuit of [[pan-Arab]] ideals was the highest calling. It has been said, that Shawkat's path (ideology and military youth movement), influenced the Popular Army and youth organizations of the [[Ba'ath Party|Baath]] Party, which appeared much later on.&lt;ref&gt;''Iran, Iraq, and the Arab Gulf States'', Joseph A. Kechichian, Gustave E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies, lgrave Macmillan, 2001, p. 84 [https://books.google.com/books?id=a31iy0HLymgC&amp;pg=PA84]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yunis al-Sabawi==
Yunis al-Sab'awi (يونس السبعاوي) (who translated [[Hitler]]'s book ''Mein Kampf'' into Arabic in the early 1930s) was active in the al-Muthanna club&lt;ref&gt;''Intellectual life in the Arab East, 1890–1939'', Center for Arab and Middle East Studies, American University of Beirut, 1981, p. 172 [https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=Uqy5AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=al-Muthana]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the leadership of the al-Futuwwa.&lt;ref name="ushmm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007277|title=The Farhud|publisher=ushmm.org|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was a deputy in the [[Iraq]]i government,&lt;ref&gt;''Documents on German foreign policy, 1918–1945: from the archives of the German Foreign Ministry'', H.M. Stationery Off., 1966, p. 566 [https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=pzsiAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=sabawi]&lt;/ref&gt; minister of economics.&lt;ref&gt;''Britain's informal empire in the Middle East: a case study of Iraq, 1929–1941'', Daniel Silverfarb, Oxford University Press US, 1986, p. 135 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WsgtN4uJsL8C&amp;pg=PA135]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shawkat, al-Sab'awi had developed strong anti-Jewish ([[anti-Semitic]]) sentiments, leading to the tragedy known in colloquial Iraqi Arabic as the (Mufti [[al-Husayni]]'s inspired&lt;ref name="crethiplethi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crethiplethi.com/remembering-the-farhud-the-mufti-inspired-krystallnacht-in-iraq/islamic-countries/iraq-islamic-countries/2010/|title=Remembering the Farhud &amp;#8211; the Mufti Inspired Krystallnacht in Iraq &amp;#124; Middle East, Israel, Arab World, Southwest Asia, Maghreb|publisher=crethiplethi.com|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Farhud]] (Pogrom), as a result, a mob led by al-Muthanna Club members and its youth organization attacked the [[Jewish]] community of Baghdad on June 1 and 2, 1941, killing and wounding many [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="Memories of state 2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq|author=Davis, E.|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520235465|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4qRW5KpgDM4C|page=70|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yunis al-Sabawi planned even a larger slaughter of Jews but it was avoided due to him being deported.&lt;ref name="midrash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midrash.org/articles/farhud/|title=The Farhud (Farhoud).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13946">'''Aradia''' is one of the principal figures in the American folklorist [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s 1899 work ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', which he believed to be a genuine religious text used by a group of [[paganism|pagan]] [[witchcraft|witches]] in [[Tuscany]], a claim that has subsequently been disputed by other folklorists and historians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; In Leland's ''Gospel'', Aradia is portrayed as a [[Messiah]] who was sent to Earth in order to teach the oppressed peasants how to perform witchcraft to use against the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the upper classes.

The folklorist [[Sabina Magliocco]] has theorised that prior to being used in Leland's ''Gospel'', Aradia was originally a supernatural figure in [[Italian folklore]], who was later merged with other folkloric figures such as the ''sa Rejusta'' of [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref&gt;Magliocco, Sabina (2009). 'Aradia in Sardinia: The Archaeology of a Folk Character' in ''Ten Years of Triumph of the Moon''. Hidden Publishing. Page 40 to 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of Leland's ''Gospel'', Aradia has become "arguably one of the central figures of the modern pagan witchcraft revival" and as such has featured in various forms of [[Modern paganism|Neopaganism]], including [[Wicca]] and [[Stregheria]], as an actual deity.&lt;ref&gt;Magliocco, Sabina (2009). 'Aradia in Sardinia: The Archaeology of a Folk Character' in ''Ten Years of Triumph of the Moon''. Hidden Publishing. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Raven Grimassi]], founder of the Wiccan-inspired tradition of Stregheria, claims that Aradia was a historical figure named ''Aradia di Toscano'', who led a group of "Diana-worshipping witches" in 14th-century Tuscany.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gri96|Grimassi 1996]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italian folklore==
The Italian form of the name ''[[Herodias]]'' is ''Erodiade''. It appears that Herodias, the wife of [[Herod Antipas]], in [[Christian mythology]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]], came to be seen as a spirit condemned to wander the sky forever due to her part in the death of [[John the Baptist]], permitted only to rest in treetops between midnight and dawn.

By the [[High Middle Ages]], this figure seems to have become attached to the train of nymphs of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], now also seen as a host of spirits flying through the night across the Italian countryside. Other names attached to the night flight of Herodias included ''Minerva'' and ''Noctiluca''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Ellen Guiley, The Encyclopedia of Witches and Witchcraft, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canon Episcopi|canon ''Episcopi'']] is a passage from the work ''De ecclesiasticis disciplinis'' by [[Regino of Prüm]] (written ca. 906). It became notable as a paragraph of [[canon law]] dealing with witchcraft by the 12th century. Regino reports that there were groups of  women who believed that they could go on night journeys where they would fly across the sky to meet Diana and her train. The name of Herodias is not present in the text as attributed to Regino, but in the version by [[Burchard of Worms]], written ca. 1012, the reference to Diana (''cum Diana paganorum dea'') was augmented by "or with Herodias" (''vel cum Herodiade'').&lt;ref&gt;Sabina Magliocco (2002). 'Who Was Aradia? The History and Development of a Legend' in ''The Pomegranate: The Journal of Pagan Studies'', Issue 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magliocco (2002) suggests that the legends surrounding this figure, known as ''Aradia'', ''Arada'' or ''Araja'', spread throughout various areas of Italy, and she traced records that showed that two beings known as ''s'Araja dimoniu'' (Araja the demon) and ''s'Araja justa'' (Araja the just) were found in [[Sardinia]]. Magliocco believed that the latter of these two figures, ''s'Araja justa'', was the antecedent of a supernatural witch-like figure known as ''sa Rejusta'' in Sardinian folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Magliocco, Sabina (2009). 'Aradia in Sardinia: The Archaeology of a Folk Character' in ''Ten Years of Triumph of the Moon''. Hidden Publishing. Page 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian historian of religion [[Mircea Eliade]] also noted that ''Arada'', along with ''Irodiada'', was a name used for a Romanian folkloric Queen of [[Zână|the Fairies]] (''Doamna Zînelor''), who he believed was a "metamorphosis of Diana". She was viewed as the patroness of a secretive group of dancers known as the [[calusari]] who operated up until at least the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade|Eliade, Mircea]] (February 1975). "Some Observations on European Witchcraft" in ''History of Religions'' Volume 14, Number 3. Page 160-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judika Illes]], in her ''Encyclopedia of Spirits'', noted: "Although venerated elsewhere in Europe, Herodias was especially beloved in Italy. She and Diana are the goddesses most frequently mentioned in witch-trial transcripts and were apparently worshipped together".&lt;ref&gt;Iles, Judika. ''Encyclopedia of Spirits: The Ultimate Guide to the Magic of Fairies, Genies, Demons, Ghosts, Gods &amp; Goddesses'' (2009). {{ISBN|978-0-06-135024-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leland's Aradia==
{{main|Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches|Witch-cult hypothesis}}
In 1899, the American folklorist [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] published ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', a book which he claimed was the religious text belonging to a group of Tuscan witches who venerated Diana as the Queen of the Witches. He also claimed that he had been given the book by a Tuscan woman named Maddalena, although historians such as [[Ronald Hutton]] have disputed the truth of these such claims.

''Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches'' begins with the tale of Aradia's birth to Diana and [[Lucifer]], who is described as "the god of the Sun and of the Moon, the god of Light (Splendour), who was so proud of his beauty, and who for his pride was driven from Paradise". Diana instructs Aradia to "go to earth below / To be a teacher unto women and men / Who fain would study witchcraft." When Aradia descends, she becomes the first of all [[witch]]es, and promises her students that "ye shall all be freed from slavery, / And so ye shall be free in everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Leland, Charles Godfrey | title=Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches | publisher =David Nutt | year=1899 | id= | isbn=1-56414-679-0 }} Chapter I&lt;/ref&gt;

Aradia is described as having continuing power to affect the world after she returns to the sphere of Diana. For example, in "A Spell to Win Love", the "Invocation to Diana" asks Diana to send her daughter Aradia to perform the magic.&lt;ref&gt;Leland, [[wikisource:Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches Chapter II|Chapter II]]&lt;/ref&gt; Leland's ''Aradia'' has a chapter containing folklore about the night assembly or banquet, titled "The Sabbat: Tregunda or Witch Meeting", which involves Diana.&lt;ref&gt;Leland, Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; Leland comments in the Appendix, "I also believe that in this Gospel of the Witches we have a trustworthy outline at least of the doctrine and rites observed at these meetings [the witches' Sabbat]. They adored forbidden deities and practised forbidden deeds, inspired as much by rebellion against Society as by their own passions."&lt;ref name="Appendix"&gt;Leland, Appendix&lt;/ref&gt;

Leland speculates that this folklore ultimately has roots in ancient Etruscan mythology.

Leland also equates Aradia with Herodias, explaining his speculation that Herodias was actually Lilith: "This was not ... derived from the Herodias of the [[New Testament]], but from an earlier replica of [[Lilith]], bearing the same name ... So far back as the sixth century the worship of Herodias and Diana by witches was condemned by a Church Council at Ancyra."&lt;ref&gt;Leland is referring to the Canon Episcopi.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pipernus]] and other writers have noted the evident identification of Herodias with Lilith.&lt;ref name="Appendix" /&gt; Historian [[Ronald Hutton]] suggests in ''Triumph of the Moon'' that this identification with Herodias was inspired by the work of [[Jules Michelet]] in ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton  | title=Triumph of the Moon | publisher =Oxford University Press | year=2000 | isbn=0-500-27242-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist and field folklorist [[Sabina Magliocco]], on the other hand, is willing to consider a connection between the [[Italian language|Italian]] Erodiade (Herodias), the  Cult of Herodias, the night assembly, and Aradia.&lt;ref&gt;
Magliocco, Sabina (2002). "Who Was Aradia?  The History and Development of a Legend", ''The Pomegranate'', volume 18, p. 5–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==
Aradia has become an important figure in [[Wicca]] as well as some other forms of Neo-Paganism. Some [[Wicca#Wiccan traditions|Wiccan traditions]] use the name ''Aradia'' as one of the names of the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Great Goddess]], [[Moon Goddess]], or "Queen of the Witches".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Farrar, Janet and Stewart | title=Eight Sabbats for Witches | publisher =Robert Hale | year=1983 | isbn=0-919345-26-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portions of Leland's text influenced the [[Gardnerian]] [[Book of Shadows]], especially the [[Charge of the Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, Doreen. ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] invoked Aradia as a moon goddess in the 1960s. [[Janet Farrar|Janet]] and [[Stewart Farrar]] used the name in their ''Eight Sabbats for Witches'' and ''The Witches' Way''.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, Janet and Stewart. ''Eight Sabbats for Witches'' (1981). {{ISBN|0-919345-26-3}}. ''The Witches Way'' (1984). {{ISBN|978-0-7090-1293-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aradia was invoked in spellcraft in Z. Budapest's ''The Holy Book of Women's Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Budapest, Z. ''The Holy Book of Women's Mysteris: Complete in One Volume'' (1980, 1989), First Wingbo edition 1989, pp. 23, 27, 44. {{ISBN|978-0-914728-67-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An entire website, the ''Goddess Aradia and Related Subjects'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Aradiagoddess.com/ Goddess Aradia and Related Subjects.] Retrieved 2009-12-27&lt;/ref&gt; is devoted to Aradia as a Wiccan goddess and a powerful spirit in Italian folklore.

Aradia is a central figure in [[Stregheria]], an "ethnic Italian" form of Wicca introduced by Raven Grimassi in the 1980s. Grimassi claims that there was a historical figure called "Aradia di Toscano", whom he portrays as the founder of a revivalist religion of Italian witchcraft in the 14th century. Grimassi claims that Leland's ''Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches'' is a "distorted Christianized version" of the story of Aradia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Stregheria.com FAQ | url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html | accessdate=October 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Pagan narratives of  Aradia include ''The Book of the Holy Strega'' (1981), by Raven Grimassi; ''The Gospel of Diana'' (1993), by Aidan Kelly; and ''Secret Story of Aradia'', by Myth Woodling (2001).&lt;ref&gt;Woodling, Myth (2001), [http://www.jesterbear.com/Aradia/secret.html ''Secret Story of Aradia''], from www.AradiaGoddess.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Aidan Kelly]], co-founder of the [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn]], distributed a document titled ''The Gospel of Diana'' (a reference to ''Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches''{{ref|Baldassare}}). The text contained a list of mother and daughter [[priest]]esses who had taught religious [[witchcraft]] through the centuries. Instead of Leland's goddess Diana and her messianical daughter Aradia, Kelly's text described mortal human beings. The priestesses' names alternated between ''Aradia'' and ''Diana''.{{ref|Kelly}} Magliocco describes the character of Aradia in Kelly's accompanying narrative as "a notably [[sexual desire|erotic]] character; according to her teachings, the [[Human sexual behavior|sexual]] act becomes not only an expression of the divine life force, but an act of resistance against all forms of oppression and the primary focus of [[ritual]]". Magliocco also notes that the text "has not achieved broad diffusion in contemporary Pagan circles".{{ref label|Magliocco|4|a}}

"In 2001, the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History received a Governor's Award in the Humanities."&lt;ref name="Wesley" /&gt;

Library renovations are planned, and are expected to be completed in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Home Page|url= http://www.afpls.org/aarl |publisher=Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American History and culture opened in May 1994 in its current location.&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt;
"Its core collection was formed at the Auburn Branch of the Carnegie Library of Atlanta."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; "This branch, opened in 1921, was Atlanta's first public library branch for African Americans."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; "Due to [[Jim Crow laws]], African Americans were denied public library service which began in 1902."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt;

"From 1921-1959, the Auburn Avenue Research Library provided educational and community programming and amassed its core collection called the Negro History Collection."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; "The collection grew to include bound copies of magazines, newspapers, and scholarly journals by, for, and about African Americans, including the Atlanta Daily World, Crisis, Journal of Negro Education, and Negro History Bulletin."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; The library closed in 1959.&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; After the library's closure, the Negro History Collection moved to the West Hunter Branch.&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; "This branch was built in 1949 to accommodate the demands for expanded public library service from the increasing numbers of African Americans who had migrated to Atlanta's west side."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt;

The collection moved again in 1970, to "where Central Library now stands at One Margaret Mitchell Square."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; "One year later, the collection was named the '''Samuel W. Williams Collection on Black America''', in honor of the Atlanta-based educator, theologian, and philosopher."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; "The collection remained at the main library until 1994, and was then moved to the newly built Auburn Avenue Research Library."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt;

"After fifteen years of operation, the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History had outgrown its space."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; "On November 4, 2008, Fulton County voters approved a library bond referendum, which included funds to enhance and expand the facility."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt;

==Divisions==

"The Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History consists of three divisions: Reference &amp; Research, Archives, and Program."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt;

===Reference &amp; Research===
"The Samuel W. Williams Collection forms the cornerstone of the reference and research division, which maintains a variety of textual and microform records, a noncirculating library of secondary sources, and a broad array of Web-accessible research databases for the study of African American culture and history and the [[African diaspora|African Diaspora]]."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt;

===Archives===
"The Archives division preserves and makes available unique historical records of enduring value related primarily to African American culture and history, with a concentration on local Atlanta history."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; "These primary sources include not only textual and special media records (cartographic records, graphic arts, still photographs, sound recordings, and moving images) but also art and artifacts, microforms, rare book collections, and textiles."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt;

===Program===
"The Program division supports the library's mission and serves the public through book discussions and readings, exhibitions, film screenings, lectures, seminars, tours, and workshops."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; "Through its cultural, educational, and scholarly programming—which is local, national, and transnational in scope—the program division helps interpret and highlight the institution's rich collections and provides outreach to the general public, as well as to Atlanta's academic community."&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt;

==Collections==

The sections of the Auburn Avenue Research Library's collection that are contained in the Archives Division include "the '''Art and Artifacts Collection''' which contains art and artifacts by and about peoples of African heritage throughout the world."&lt;ref name="Collections"&gt;{{cite web |title=Collections|url=http://www.afpls.org/aarlcollections|publisher=Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The collection contains contemporary works by African American artists, including works by [[Romare Bearden]], [[Charles White (artist)|Charles White]], [[James Van Der Zee]] and [[Ed Dwight]]."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt; "The Archives Division also includes the '''Archives and Manuscripts Collection''', which focuses on the history, literature, politics, and culture of [[African Americans in Atlanta|peoples of African descent in Atlanta]], the Southeast, the U.S. and the world."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt;

Other collections include "the '''Ephemeral Collection''' which contains resources in the following categories: calendars, dust jackets, family genealogical booklets, flags, maps, postcards, posters, sheet music, slave documents, yearbooks, vertical files, educational kits, black history month essays, funeral programs, coins, comic books, playbills, typescripts, buttons, recipes, autographs and stamps."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt;

The '''Moving Image and Recorded Sound Collection''' "provides audiovisual resources which document and interpret African American experiences in the city of Atlanta, the state of Georgia, the southeastern region of the U.S. and throughout the nation."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt;

The '''Oral History Collection''' "complements the Moving Image and Recorded Sound Collection."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt; "Preserved on videocassette tapes, audio cassette tapes and transcripts, and digital formats, this expanding collection seeks to enhance and make available collected oral histories of historical and significant cultural organizations, individuals, institutions and communities."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt;

The '''Pamphlet Collection''' "includes works published before 1865 in the United States; first editions by African American authors before 1930 and during the [[Harlem Renaissance]] and works published before 1901 in Europe, Africa, South America and the Caribbean, and publications of Black private presses."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt;

The '''Photographs and Prints Collection''' "contains both documentary and fine art photographs which document the history and culture of peoples of African descent as well as the work of photographers of African descent."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt;

The '''Rare Periodical and Newspaper Collection''' "contains mainly African American publications. A small percentage of the collection is composed of non-African American publications."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt; "The collection includes articles, photos, illustrations, newspapers and periodicals in bound volumes."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt;

'''Digital Collections'''

In 2010 the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History (AARL) and the [[Digital Library of Georgia]] (DLG) collaborated to digitize eleven archival collections.  AARL and DLG received funds from the [[National Historical Papers and Records Commission]] (NHPRC) to make Web-accessible late nineteenth- and mid-twentieth-century manuscript collections "that document the historical development of education for African Americans, primarily in the South, from the early 1860s to the early 1950s." [http://www.afpls.org/aarl Eleven collections] were digitized and are now available via the library website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afpls.org/aarl&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reference and Research Division "contains the '''print, digital and microform collections''' which includes an impressive list of Africana resources that provide unlimited access to full-text articles from current and past issues of scholarly Africana journals, popular African American magazines and international African journals."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt;

The "strengths of the (Auburn Avenue Research Library's) collection are Southern Civil Rights Movement, Southern African American Literature and History, General African and African American History and Literature, Atlanta and Georgia Vertical File Collections, Current and Historic African American Journals, Current and Historic African American Newspapers, Africana Children's Literature Collection, The Coretta Scott King Award Winning Children's Titles 1969 to current, Africana Cinema and Documentary Film Collections, and Subject Bibliographies highlighting AARL resources."&lt;ref name="Collections" /&gt;

'''BrainMaps''' is an [[NIH]]-funded interactive zoomable high-resolution digital [[brain atlas]] and [[virtual microscopy|virtual microscope]] that is based on more than 20 million megapixels (60 terabytes) of scanned images of serial sections of both primate and non-primate [[brain]]s and that is integrated with a high-speed [[database]] for querying and retrieving data about brain structure and function over the internet.

Currently featured are complete brain atlas datasets for the species ''[[Macaca mulatta]]'', ''[[Chlorocebus aethiops]]'', ''[[Felis silvestris catus]]'', ''[[Mus musculus]]'', ''[[Rattus norvegicus]]'', and ''[[Tyto alba]]''.

The project's [[principal investigator]] was [[UC Davis]] neuroscientist [[Ted Jones (neuroscientist)|Ted Jones]] from 2005 through 2011, after which the role was taken by W. Martin Usrey.

== Description ==
BrainMaps uses multiresolution image formats for representing massive brain images, and a dHTML/Javascript front-end user interface for image navigation, both similar to the way that [[Google Maps]] works for geospatial data.

BrainMaps is one of the most massive online neuroscience databases and image repositories and features the highest-resolution whole brain atlas ever constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mikula | first = S |author2=Trotts I |author3=Stone JM |author4=Jones EG  | date = 2007 | title = Internet-Enabled High-Resolution Brain Mapping and Virtual Microscopy | journal = NeuroImage | pmid = 17229579 | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–15 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.11.053 | pmc = 1890021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mikula | first = S |author2=Stone JM|author3=Jones EG | date = 2008 | title = BrainMaps.org - Interactive High-Resolution Digital Brain Atlases and Virtual Microscopy | journal = Brains Minds Media | pmid = 19129928 | volume = 3 | pages = bmm1426 | pmc = 2614326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Napoleon III, CDV by Disderi, 1859-retouch.jpg|thumb|right|1859 ''carte de visite'' of [[Napoleon III]] by [[André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri|Disdéri]], which popularized the CdV format]]

The '''''carte de visite'''''&lt;ref&gt;Also spelled ''carte-de-visite'' or erroneously referred to as ''carte de ville''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-fr|kaʁt də vizit|lang}}, [[visiting card]]), abbreviated '''CdV''', was a type of small photograph which was patented in [[Paris]] by photographer [[André Adolphe Eugène Disdéri]] in 1854, although first used by [[Louis Dodero]].&lt;ref&gt;Welling&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leggat&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually made of an [[albumen print]], which was a thin paper photograph mounted on a thicker paper card. The size of a ''carte de visite'' is {{convert|2.125|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} × {{convert|3.5|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} mounted on a card sized {{convert|2.5|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} × {{convert|4|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. In 1854, Disdéri had also patented a method of taking eight separate negatives on a single plate, which reduced production costs. The ''carte de visite'' was slow to gain widespread use until 1859, when Disdéri published Emperor [[Napoleon III]]'s photos in this format.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; This made the format an overnight success. The new invention was so popular it was known as "cardomania"&lt;ref&gt;Newhall&lt;/ref&gt; and it spread throughout Europe and then quickly to America and the rest of the world.

Each photograph was the size of a visiting card, and such photograph cards were traded among friends and visitors. Albums for the collection and display of cards became a common fixture in Victorian parlors. The immense popularity of these card photographs led to the publication and collection of photographs of prominent persons.

By the early 1870s, ''cartes de visite'' were supplanted by "[[cabinet card]]s", which were also usually albumen prints, but larger, mounted on cardboard backs measuring {{convert|4.5|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} by {{convert|6.5|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Cabinet cards remained popular into the early 20th century, when Kodak introduced the [[Brownie camera]] and home [[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]] photography became a mass phenomenon.

The ''carte de visite'' photograph proved to be a very popular item during the [[American Civil War]]. Soldiers, friends and family members would have a means of inexpensively obtaining photographs and sending them to loved ones in small envelopes. Photos of [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and other celebrities of the era became an instant hit in the North. People were not only buying photographs of themselves, but also collecting photographs of celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Marlis, and Joanne Zerdy. 2014.

{{Wiktionary|Christianism}}

'''''Christianism''''' means particular doctrines of Christianity made into a political system for the pursuit of worldly power, to be distinguished from Christianity&lt;ref&gt;
https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2009/11/christianity-vs-christianism-love-vs-power/193565/&lt;/ref&gt; in various forms of religious practices of denominations, such as [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[Mormonism]], etc. The more common term for describing the religion, and its followers, is [[Christianity]]. The word is analogous with [[Islamism]], in that both terms can mean either the system of beliefs overall, or, more recently, a specific movement within those religions focused on specific political goals. Christianist&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/christianist&lt;/ref&gt; and neo-Christianism&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/neo-christianism&lt;/ref&gt; are related terms.

The term is often used pejoratively, to describe the [[Christian right]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="safire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker05202005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Ruth|date=May 20, 2005|title=Onward, Christianist soldiers?|journal=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|location=Boston, Massachusetts|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0520/p18s04-hfes.html|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2005, [[William Safire]], language columnist for ''[[The New York Times]]'', attributed the term (in this novel usage) to blogger [[Andrew Sullivan]], who wrote on June 1, 2003, page 19,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2003/06/page/19/|title=2003  June « The Dish|work=andrewsullivan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I have a new term for those on the fringes of the religious right who have used the Gospels to perpetuate their own aspirations for power, control and oppression: Christianists. They are as anathema to true Christians as the Islamists are to true Islam." &lt;ref name="safire"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/magazine/15ONLANGUAGE.html|title=Isms and Phobias |last=Safire|first=William|date=May 15, 2005 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan later expanded on his usage of the term in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine column.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Andrew (May 7, 2006).[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1191826,00.html "My Problem with Christianism"], ''Time'', accessed January 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
The bloggers Tristero and [[David Neiwert]] used the term shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tristero.blogspot.com/2003_06_01_tristero_archive.html#200373904 When Semantic Differences Are Not: Part Two] Tristero, June 2, 2003, accessed January 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dneiwert.blogspot.ca/2003/06/how-about-christianism.html|title = How about Christianism?|website = Orcinus|last = Neiwert|first = David|date = June 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uses of the term can be found dating back to the seventeenth century, but these are unrelated to the meaning in its modern usage.&lt;ref name="safire" /&gt;

[[Domestic robot]]s can vary widely in their capabilities and tasks. [[Sensor]]s include: cliff or stair sensors, motion sensors, [[Ultrasonic sensor|ultrasonic object sensors]], dirt sensors, [[Infrared|IR]] sensors, and more. Intelligence varies also. Some have none while others can map out their environment and maneuver using complex [[algorithms]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12527">'''DNS zone transfer''', also sometimes known by the inducing DNS query type '''AXFR''', is a type of [[Domain Name System|DNS]] [[Database transaction|transaction]]. It is one of the many mechanisms available for administrators to [[distributed database|replicate]] DNS databases across a set of [[DNS server]]s. 

A zone transfer uses the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) for transport, and takes the form of a [[client–server]] transaction. The client requesting a zone transfer may be a slave server or secondary server, requesting data from a master server, sometimes called a primary server. The portion of the database that is replicated is a [[DNS zone|zone]].

Zone transfer comprises a preamble followed by the actual data transfer. The preamble comprises a lookup of the [[Start of Authority]] (SOA) resource record for the "zone apex", the node of the DNS namespace that is at the top of the "zone". The fields of this SOA resource record, in particular the "serial number", determine whether the actual data transfer need to occur at all. The client compares the serial number of the SOA resource record with the serial number in the last copy of that resource record that it has. If the serial number of the record being transferred is greater, the data in the zone are deemed to have "changed" (in some fashion) and the slave proceeds to request the actual zone data transfer. If the serial numbers are identical, the data in the zone are deemed not to have "changed", and the client may continue to use the copy of the database that it already has, if it has one.

The actual data transfer process begins by the client sending a query (opcode 0) with the special query type AXFR (value 252) over the TCP connection to the server. The server responds with a series of response messages, comprising all of the resource records for every domain name in the "zone". The first response comprises the SOA resource record for the zone apex. The other data follows in no specified order. The end of the data is signaled by the server repeating the response containing the SOA resource record for the zone apex.

Some zone transfer clients perform the SOA lookup of the preamble using their system's normal DNS query resolution mechanism. These clients do not open a TCP connection to the server until they have determined that they need to perform the actual data transfer. However, since TCP can be used for normal DNS transactions, as well as for zone transfer, other zone transfer clients perform the SOA lookup preamble over the same TCP connection as they then (may) perform the actual data transfer. These clients open the TCP connection to the server before they even perform the preamble.

The preceding describes full zone transfer. Incremental zone transfer differs from full zone transfer in the following respects:
* The client uses the special QTYPE IXFR (value 251) instead of the AXFR QTYPE.
* The client sends the SOA resource record for the zone apex that it currently has, if any, in the IXFR message, letting the server know which version of the "zone" it believes to be current.
* Though the server may respond in the normal AXFR manner with the full data for the zone, it may also instead respond with an "incremental" data transfer. This latter comprises the list of changes to the zone data, in zone serial number order, between the version of the zone that the client reported to the server as having and the version of the zone that is current at the server. The changes comprise two lists, one of resource records that are deleted and one of resource records that are inserted.  (A modification to a resource record is represented as a deletion followed by an insertion.)

Zone transfer is entirely client-initiated. Though servers can send a NOTIFY message to clients (that they have been informed about) whenever a change to the zone data has been made, the scheduling of zone transfers is entirely under the control of the clients. Clients schedule zone transfers initially, when their databases are empty, and thereafter at regular intervals, in a pattern controlled by the values in the "refresh", "retry", and "expire" fields in the SOA resource record of the zone apex.

==Limitations==
Though it is standardized, full-zone transfer being described as one of the possible database replication mechanisms in RFC 1034 and RFC 5936 (incremental zone transfer described in RFC 1995), zone transfer is the most limited of those database replication mechanisms. Zone transfer operates in terms of "[[Wire protocol|wire format]]" resource records, ''i.e.'' resource records as they are transferred using the DNS protocol. However, the schema of wire format resource records may not be identical to the database schema used by the [[Back-end database|back ends]] of the DNS servers themselves.

==Operational problems==

===Serial number changes===
The preamble portion of zone transfer relies on the serial number, and ''only'' the serial number, to determine whether a zone's data have changed, and thus whether the actual data transfer is required. For some DNS server packages, the serial numbers of SOA resource records are maintained by administrators by hand. Every edit to the database involves making two changes, one to the record being changed and the other to the zone serial number. This is a laborious process and one that is prone to error, with administrators either forgetting to change a serial number or changing a serial number incorrectly (such as decreasing it or increasing it by a huge amount).

Some DNS server packages have overcome this problem by automatically constructing the serial number from the last modification timestamp of the database file on disk. This is the case for [[djbdns]], for example. The operating system ensures that the last modification timestamp is updated whenever an administrator edits the database file, effectively automatically updating the serial number, and thus relieving administrators of the need to make two edits (in two different places) for every single change.

Furthermore, the paradigm of database replication for which the serial number check (and indeed zone transfer itself) is designed, which involves a single central DNS server holding the master version of the database with all other DNS servers merely holding copies, simply does not match that of many modern DNS server packages. Modern DNS server packages with sophisticated database back ends such as [[SQL]] servers and [[Active Directory]] allow administrators to make updates to the database in multiple places (such systems employ [[Multi-master replication]]), with the database back end's own replication mechanism handling the replication to all other servers. This paradigm simply does not match that of a single, central, monotonically increasing number to record changes, and thus is incompatible with zone transfer to a large extent. Modern DNS server packages with sophisticated database back ends often will create a "shim" serial number, simulating the existence of a single central place where updates are made, but this is at best imperfect.

Fortunately, for this and several reasons outlined later, DNS servers that use such sophisticated database back ends in general rarely use zone transfer as their database replication mechanism in the first place, and usually instead employ the vastly superior distributed database replication mechanisms that the back ends themselves provide.

===Serial number comparisons===
Serial number comparisons are intended to use [[Serial Number Arithmetic]] as defined in RFC 1982.  However, this was not clearly specified in RFC 1034, resulting in not all clients perform the serial number check, in the preamble, in the same way. Some clients check merely that the serial number supplied by the server is different from that known by the client, or non-zero. Other clients check that the serial number supplied by the server is within a given range of the serial number already known by the client. Yet other clients still perform the latter check and additionally check that the serial number supplied by the server is not zero.

===Multiple resource records===
Originally, in the actual data transfer each set of resource records for a single domain name and type was transferred in a separate response message from the server to the client. However, this is inefficient, and some DNS server software implemented optimizations, geared at allowing the response compression mechanism in the DNS protocol to reduce the total bandwidth requirements of data transfers, such as:
* performing "additional section processing" to include any "glue" resource record sets in the same response as an NS, SRV, or MX resource record set
* collecting all of the resource record sets relating to a single domain name together and sending them, if they fit, in a single response

Some clients were written to expect ''only'' the original response format, and would fail to perform data transfer if such optimizations were employed. Several DNS server packages thus have a configuration setting allowing administrators to specify the use of "single answer format" responses for those clients that require it.

===Exposure of data===
The data contained in a DNS zone may be sensitive from an operational security aspect. This is because information such as server hostnames may become public knowledge, which can be used to discover information about an organization and even provide a larger [[attack surface]]. In June 2017 the registrar responsible for russian top-level-domains accidentally enabled DNS zone transfers via AXFR which led to 5.6 millions records being accidentally exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://securitytrails.com/blog/russian-tlds|title=Wrong Bind Configuration Exposes the Complete List of Russian TLD's to the Internet|last=|first=|date=2018-03-14|work=SecurityTrails Blog|access-date=2018-04-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 a court in North Dakota, USA, ruled that performing a zone transfer as an unauthorized outsider to obtain information that was not publicly accessible constitutes a violation of North Dakota law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-spammer fined for accessing DNS records of private network|url=http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Anti-spammer-fined-for-accessing-DNS-records-of-private-network-735841.html|newspaper=The H|date=18 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9221">{{italic title}}'''''Dering v Uris and Others''''' was a 1964 English libel trial brought by Polish-born Dr Wladislaw Dering against the American writer [[Leon Uris]]. It was described as the first war crimes trial held in Britain at the time.

Dering alleged that Uris had libelled him in a footnote in his novel ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]'', which described his participation in medical experiments in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] during the [[Holocaust]]. The case was tried in the [[High Court of Justice]] before Mr Justice Lawton and a jury between April and May 1964. On 6 May, the jury returned a verdict for Dering, but awarded him contemptuous damages of one [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], the smallest coin in the currency. As a result, Dering became liable for the defendants' legal costs.

The trial attracted wide media coverage. In particular, ''[[The Times]]'' provided extensive coverage of the case, printing large portions of the testimony presented in court. The novel ''[[QB VII]]'' and [[QB VII (miniseries)|its 1974 miniseries adaptation]] are loosely based on this case.&lt;ref&gt;John Sutherland, ''Bestsellers: Popular Fiction of the 1970s'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;
==Background==
Dr Wladislaw Alexander Dering was a Polish doctor who was imprisoned at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] during the Second World War for resistance activities. After the war, he reached Britain, but was detained by the British government as an alleged war criminal, while the Polish government sought his extradition. In 1948, he was released, the [[Home Secretary]] having decided that there was insufficent evidence to support a ''prima facie'' case against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1948/sep/23/dr-wladislaw-dering|title=DR. WLADISLAW DERING HC Deb 23 September 1948 vol 456 cc1070-3|date=23 September 1948|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dering thereupon joined the Colonial Medical Service, running a hospital in [[Hargeisa]], British Somaliland. For his services, he was appointed an OBE in 1960. The same year, he returned to England and established a medical practice in North London.



After his return, his family drew his attention to a passage in the novel ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]'' by American author [[Leon Uris]]. The passage, on page 155, read:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here in Block X Dr. [[Eduard Wirths|Wirths]] used women as guinea pigs and Dr. [[Horst Schumann|Schumann]] sterilized by castration and X-ray and [[Carl Clauberg|Clauberg]] removed ovaries and Dr. Dehring performed 17,000 'experiments' in surgery without anaesthetics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dering issue writs for libel against Uris, his British publishers William Kimber &amp; Co Ltd, and the printers. The printers settled the case before the trial for £500 and an apology. Uris and William Kimber admitted the words at issue were defamatory against Dr Dering, but pleaded that the words were true in substance and in fact, save for some particularized exceptions.

== The trial ==
The trial opened in the [[High Court of Justice]] in London on 13 April 1964 before [[Frederick Lawton (judge)|Mr Justice Lawton]] and a jury. Colin Duncan QC (with [[Brian Neill]]) appeared for Dering, while [[Gerald Gardiner, Baron Gardiner|Lord Gardiner]] (with [[David Hirst (judge)|David Hirst]] and [[Louis Blom-Cooper]] represented for the defendants.

In court, Dering denied having carried out experimental operations. He claimed he removed prisoners' sexual organs because Schumann had asked Dering to assist him by removing the organs. He did not feel he could refuse, because he thought it was better for him to perform the operations than if they were performed by an untrained person. Furthermore, he claimed the organs he removed were already damaged, and that he removed them for the benefit of the prisoners' health. He also claimed he feared for his life if he did not comply with Schumann's request. Finally, he denied having operation without anaesthetics, and claimed that of the 17,000 operations he performed at Auschwith, only about 130 were not ordinary proper operations.

The defence admitted that the figure of 17,000 'experiments' was inflated, and that some anaesthetics was administered. However, they disputed Dering's claim that his life would have been in danger if he had not carried out the operations. They also disputed Dering's claim that the anaesthesia was effective. The defence presented a number of witnesses who had been operated upon by Dering, as well as prisoners-doctors who had worked with Dering. The doctors testifoed that they had refused the Nazi doctors' requests to assist them in their experiments, and had not been punished as a consequence.

One of the trial's most dramatic moments occured during the testimony of Dr Adélaïde Hautval, an imprisoned French psychiatrist who worked in the camp's hospital. She testified that she refused to assist the Nazi doctors in the experiments:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gardiner: As a result were you shot?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hautval: No&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Gardiner: Were you punished in any way?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hautval: No.&lt;/blockquote&gt;She then testified that she told Dr Wirths that performing the operations was against her conception of medicine.&lt;blockquote&gt;Hautval: He asked me, "Cannot you see that these people are different from you?" and I answered him that there were several people different from me, beginning from him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Gardiner: I shall not ask you again whether you were shot. Did Dr Wirths say anything further?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hautval: He never said anything.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The high court action lasted 19 days and cost £50-60,000. Dr Dering's share was said to be £30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Encounter-1964aug-00071|title=A H'penny &amp; the Truth Dr.Dering's Trial in London by Jack Winocour In Points of Compass Encounter, August 1964, pp. 71-88|date=13 September 2008|publisher=Sunday Times|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury awarded Dering a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] in damages, the smallest coin of the realm. Since publisher and author had paid a marginally larger token sum of £2 into court, Dering was liable for all the legal costs amounting to £25,000 from that point, due to court rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Encounter-1964aug-00071|title=A H'penny &amp; the Truth Dr.Dering's Trial in London by Jack Winocour In Points of Compass Encounter, August 1964, pp. 71-88|date=13 September  2008|publisher=Sunday Times|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dering died, however, leaving Kimber saddled with the heavy legal costs.

At a news conference held at the Howard Hotel by Uris and publisher Kimber, Uris is reported to have made a comment that future editions of ''Exodus'' would omit Dr Dering's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Encounter-1964aug-00071|title=A H'penny &amp; the Truth Dr.Dering's Trial in London by Jack Winocour In Points of Compass Encounter, August 1964, pp. 71-88|date=13 September 2008|publisher=Sunday Times|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uris and the publishers, William Kimber and Company, admitted that a paragraph in the book, referring to Auschwitz medical experiments, was defamatory to Dr Dering, but they also contended that it was true in substance, subject to certain qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1964/04/15/archive/london-court-told-poles-saved-some-auschwitz-inmates-from-death|title=London Court Told Poles Saved Some Auschwitz Inmates from Death|date=April 15, 1964|publisher=Sunday Times|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial received extensive coverage. Breaking with tradition whereby it only reported judgments, ''The Times'' Law Report sent two reporters to report on the trial. ''The Times''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' reports were later published in book form (''Auschwitz in England'', 1965). It was said that the newspaper's circulation rose for the first time since the end of the Second World War as a result of its coverage.



Uris had copied his data from ''Underground'' by Joseph Tennenbaum when he referred to doctors working in Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Encounter-1964aug-00071|title=A H'penny &amp; the Truth Dr.Dering's Trial in London by Jack Winocour In Points of Compass Encounter, August 1964, pp. 71-88|date=13 September 2008|publisher=Sunday Times|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex issue of Dr Dering's role—whether villain or hero—continued to be a subject of debate through 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.znak.org.pl/?lang1=uk&amp;page1=pressreview&amp;subpage1=pressreview00&amp;infopassid1=3785&amp;scrt1=sn|title=Was doctor Wladislaw Dering a hero or was he a criminal?

However they will not be given refugee status, unless the economic situation in their home country has led to generalised violence or seriously disturbed public order.

== Legality ==
People who intend to work in another country can obtain authorization to do so; some migrants may enter under false pretences, such as [[tourism]], or cross the border illegally ([[illegal immigrant]]). People who work legally in another country are often described as [[immigrant]]s or [[expatriate]]s.
 
Many countries have restrictions that prohibit people from entering the country to work unless they have been granted a [[Visa (travel)|visa]] which permits this. Persons who are believed to be trying to enter a country to obtain employment may be refused entry. Illegal immigrants and people who seek paid employment after entering the country without authorization to work may be subject to [[deportation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/migration/types_migration_rev4.shtml Types of migration: Economic Migration], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] estimates that [[remittance]]s totaled [[US$]]420 billion in 2009, of which $317 billion went to [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="worldbank"&gt;[http://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/ Remittance Prices Worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
With economic migration on a large scale, the majority of migrants are often working age people. This places a strain on the country that the migrants leave; as working age people exit the country, the elderly population remains - thus straining the economy. However, the advantage to this country could be a release of pressure on the current job market and resources. Looking at the nation that the migrants enter, the inflow of migrants is a source of cheap labour. In some cases, the immigrants in the country are skilled and looking for specialized jobs. The inflow of migrants could also bring about cultural diversity.&lt;ref name = BBC&gt;{{cite web | title =Effects of Migration | publisher = BBC | date= 2015 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/standard/geography/population/migration/revision/4/ | accessdate= November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor market==
Over the past ten years, migrants accounted for 47% of the increase in the work force in the United States and for over 70% of the increase in Europe, as reported by the [[OECD]] in 2012. Migrants fill important niches in the labor market, and contribute significantly to [[labour market flexibility|labor market flexibility]], especially in Europe. Recent studies from the OECD report that immigrants are playing a crucial role in the labor market: In the U.S. immigrants made up 22% of entries in the fast growing occupations and 15% in Europe (healthcare, STEM, etc.). Immigrants are also highly represented in the slowest growing occupations, making up approximately 28% of new entries in the U.S. and 24% in Europe. In the United States, these occupations are primarily in production and other industries that domestic workers would consider unattractive; in the absence of demand for these occupations, immigrant workers fill these sectors. In regard to [gross domestic product], the OECD finds that in OECD countries, the inflow of migrants has not greatly disrupted GDP: accounting for less than 0.5% change in GDP in negative or positive terms. Exceptions to this are Switzerland and Luxembourg, which have approximated a 2% net benefit in GDP due to migrants.&lt;ref name =OECD&gt;{{cite web | title = Migration Policy Debates | publisher= OECD | work= Migration | date = 2014 | url=http://www.oecd.org/migration/OECD%20Migration%20Policy%20Debates%20Numero%202.pdf | access-date= November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5470">[[File:Nefertiti 30-01-2006.jpg|thumb|Nefertiti Bust]]
The '''Egyptian Museum of Berlin''' ({{lang-de|Ägyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung}}) is home to one of the world's most important collections of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian artifacts, including the iconic [[Nefertiti Bust]]. Since October 2009, the collection is part of the reopened [[Neues Museum]] on Berlin's [[Museum Island]].

==History==
The museum originated in the 18th century from the royal art collection of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] kings of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/180755/Egyptian-Museum-and-Papyrus-Collection|title=Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander von Humboldt]] had recommended that an Egyptian section be created, and the first objects were brought to Berlin in 1828 under King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. Initially housed in [[Monbijou Palace]], the department was headed by the [[Trieste]] merchant Giuseppe Passalacqua (1797–1865), whose extensive collections formed the basis. A Prussian expedition to Egypt and Nubia led by [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] in 1842–45 brought additional pieces to Berlin.
[[File:Neues Museum Aegyptischer Hof.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian courtyard at the Neues Museum, lithograph by [[Eduard Gaertner]] (1862)]]
In 1850, the collections moved to its present-day home in the Neues Museum, built according to plans designed by [[Friedrich August Stüler]]. The Nefertiti Bust, discovered during the excavations by [[Ludwig Borchardt]] in [[Amarna]], was donated to the museum by the entrepreneur [[Henri James Simon]] in 1920; it quickly became its best-known exhibit. After World War II, during which the Neues Museum was heavily damaged by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]], the collections were divided between [[East Berlin|East]] and [[West Berlin]]. The main part remained in East Berlin and was displayed at the [[Bode Museum]], while those artifacts evacuated to [[West Germany]], including the Nefetiti Bust, returned to West Berlin. From 1967 to 2005, these items were housed vis-à-vis [[Charlottenburg Palace]]. The whole collection was reunited again after the [[Reunification of Germany]], when it returned to Museum Island.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

==Collection==
The collection contains artefacts dating from between 4000BC (the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic era]]) to the period of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]], though most date from the rule of [[Akhenaten]] (around 1340BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smb.spk-berlin.de/smb/sammlungen/details.php?lang=en&amp;objectId=2|title=Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection|publisher=Staatliche Museen zu Berlin|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous piece on display is the exceptionally well preserved and vividly [[Nefertiti bust|coloured bust of Queen Nefertiti]]. The collection was moved from [[Charlottenburg]] to the [[Altes Museum]] in 2005 and was rehoused within the newly reconstructed [[Neues Museum]] on Berlin's [[Museum Island]] in October 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14229">The '''Enfer''' ({{IPAc-en|ɒ̃|ˈ|f|ɜːr}}; {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃fɛʁ|lang}}, literally, ''Inferno'' or ''Hell'') is a special department of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris. It is a special collection of books and manuscripts of an erotic or pornographic character which, because of their rarity and value, may be seen only with authorization. The Enfer was established 1836-1844 and is one of the most famous [[Private Case]] collections. In 2013, the Enfer contained about 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century to the present.

== Meaning ==
The roots of the Enfer at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] date to the end of the 17th century. The catalogue, which was introduced in the then Bibliothèque du Roi ("Royal Library"), already separated "good" and "bad" books. In 1702, orthodox and heterodox theological treatises, literary and entertaining novels, love and adventure stories were given different [[Library classification]] press marks (or "call numbers"). By the mid-18th century, there were 24 "ouvrages licencieux" ("scandalous works"),&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue des livers imprimés de la Bibliothèque du Roy: Belles-Lettres, 1re–2e partie'', Paris 1750&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Pietro Aretino]]'s [[Whore dialogues|prostitute dialogue]] "Ragionamenti". These scandalous works were kept mostly in a special "cabinet" (a bookcase), and there are likely to have been fewer than 50 before the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 — although legal deposit was introduced  in 1537 by [[Francis I of France|François I]]. However, "ouvrages licencieux" were banned in France generally; so clandestine editions were printed in Holland or Switzerland and distributed and sold in secret. Such books found their way into the Royal Library only after seizures of banned books or, more rarely, as gifts or purchases. Such books were not made available to the reading public, although they appeared in library catalogues.

During the [[French Revolution]], the book collections of fleeing aristocrats and secularized monasteries contributed significantly to the growth of public libraries. However, as a result of strict censorship under [[Napoleon]], many banned books were destroyed. In the [[Bibliothèque nationale]] particularly notable books were first separated from the general library in 1795, and the foundations of the later Réserve (Rare Books collections) was established.  Between 1836 and 1844, the concept (not the press mark) "Enfer" appeared for the first time in the library inventories for morally-dubious writings. The library director, [[Joseph Naudet]], characterized these works as follows: "fort mauvais, mais quelquefois très précieux pour les bibliophiles, et de grande valeur vénale; cet enfer est pour les imprimés ce qu'est le Musée de Naples pour les antiques." ("extremely reprehensible from a book collector’s view but sometimes highly valuable and of great resale value; this hell is for the pamphlets, what the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Napels Museum]] is for ancient art.").&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Françoise Quignard, Raymond-Josué Seckel: ''L’Enfer de la Bibliothèque. Éros au secret.'' Paris 2007. Pg. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact circumstances under which this closed-collection of books was built up during the reign of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] are not known. Howeverm a significant influence was likely to have been the increasing prudery of the bourgeoisie in post-revolutionary France. By establishing a sequestered collection of erotic material, the ordinary reader was screened from works that were considered objectionable and detrimental to the moral health of readers.

== Name ==
The first collection of books called an Enfer is attributed to the [[Les Feuillants Abbey|Feuillants]] convent in Paris, on the [[Rue Saint-Honoré]]. These monks reportedly kept in the attic, ironically described as "hell", a large number of Protestant writings that had been given to the convent in 1652. The name apparently played on the fate that frequently befell the authors and readers of [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|forbidden and heretical works]] (i.e., burning). Collections of theological writings of a similar character, not always carrying this title, were widely used, most famously in the [[Vatican Library]].

At the time of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], at the latest, the word "enfer" was widely used to refer to a clandestine or sequestered collection. [[Pierre Larousse]]’s ''Encyclopedia Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle'' (Paris 1866-1877) defined the word as "endroit fermé d'une bibliothèque, où l'on tient les livres dont on pense que la lecture est dangereuse; exemple: l'Enfer de la Bibliothèque nationale." ("A closed area in a library, containing books whose reading is considered dangerous, for example: The 'hell' of the Bibliothèque nationale.").&lt;ref&gt;''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle''. Administration du grand dictionnaire universel, Paris 1866–1877, Vol. 7, pg. 557 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k205359t/f561.chemindefer]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the Bibliothèque nationale received a huge book collection from Auguste Lesouëf and his sister (whose married name was Smith); 34 of these items were given the press mark ''Enfer Smith-Lesouëf''. The prints and photographs of the Bibliothèque nationale also received a special press mark, if they were seen as morally questionable.

Other libraries separated their Erotica from their general collections, in a similar way to the [[Bibliothèque nationale]]. These libraries often used obscure collection names and press marks, such as The Private Case at the [[British Museum]], the *** (or ''Triple star'') collection at the [[New York Public Library]], the Δ (Greek Delta) collection in the [[Library of Congress]] and the Φ collection (Greek Phi) at the Bodleian Library.&lt;ref&gt;Dass die größte pornografische Sammlung in der Vatikanischen Bibliothek zu finden sei, ist allerdings eine weit verbreitete Legende.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inventory and cataloguing ==

After the establishment of the Enfer, the public were curious about which, and how many, works were contained in the collections. It was assumed to be a very impressive collection, as many books had been seized during the French [[Ancien Régime]], at the peak of literary libertinism, during the life of authors such as the [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirab|Comte de Mirabeau]], the [[Marquis de Sade]] or [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif|Rétif de la Bretonne]]. From 1848 to 1850, the Enfer was subject to a public attack, accused of the negligent loss of a large numbers of books. Two-thirds of original 600 books were rumoured to have been lost, not least because unsupervised young employees had acted as attendants. In fact, the library then had, at most, 150 books. The first supplementary volume of the ''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle'' of 1877 discuss the popular opinions about the Enfer:

"Il existe à la Bibliothèque nationale un dépôt qui n’est jamais ouvert au public; c’est l’Enfer, recueil de tous les dévergondages luxurieux de la plume et du crayon. Toutefois, le chiffre de ce recueil honteux n’est pas aussi élevé qu’on l’imagine généralement, puisque le nombre des ouvrages n'y est que de 340 et celui des volumes de 730. Mais il est bon de noter que cette catégorie ne comprend que les livres d’une obscénité révoltante, ceux qu’il est défendue de communiquer sous quelque prétexte que ce puisse être." 
("In the Bibliothèque nationale there is a stock that is not open to the public; it is the Enfer, the rendezvous of all the excesses of the pen and the pencil. However, the size this shameful collection is not as high as one generally imagines, as the number of books is only 340 and the volumes only 730. But it is good to note that this category includes only the repulsive obscene books, those that are forbidden to circulate under any pretext.")&lt;ref&gt;''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle''. Administration du grand dictionnaire universel, Paris 1866–1877, Suppl. 1, pg. 366 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k398030/f365.chemindefer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enfer experienced renewed growth during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], particularly due to the tightened censorship. In 1865 and 1866, the collection grew by more than 330 items; in 1876, there were 620 titles, of which more than half originated from seizures. In 1886, the collection had increased to slightly more than 700, including many cheap reprints of Libertine novels from the [[Ancien Régime]]. The Enfer remained virtually inaccessible. To be allowed to consult one of his books a strongly-reasoned application needed to be made to the head office, and the decision of a committee was required.

Between 1876 and 1886, the original press mark for the Enfer, which had been in use since the late 17th century, was replaced with ''Y2''. This press mark is used in 1896 in the general catalogue of the Bibliothèque nationale. From 1909 to 1913, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and others prepared, without the support or knowledge of library management, a special bibliographic catalog, which recorded 854 titles and described the works. (The library had managed to stop the first, less well disguised start, made by the linguist Robert Yve-Plessis after 1900.) Apollinaire's catalog was issued in an edition of 1,500 copies, a second edition of 1919 sold 2,000 copies, clearly showing the scale of the public interest in the Enfer. The 1978 catalog of the Enfer by [[Pascal Pia]] added around 700 titles.

== Repurposing ==
The work of Apollinaire and Pias contributed largely to publicising the Enfer and the literature it contains. The stock of the Enfer was enlarged in the 20th century mainly through acquisitions from ordinary bookstores. In the 1980s, the renowned publishing firm [[Fayard]] published a seven-volume collection of out-of-copyright novels held in the Enfer, with contemporary photographs and explanatory introductions. Book historians are concerned with the material that is preserved in the Enfer, while new cultural historians study the pre-revolutionary pornography found in it. A prominent example is [[Robert Darnton]], who points to the emancipatory potential of the texts in which social and religious criticism are often embedded in moral transgressions.

The development of the book market, changing moral standards and the widespread repeal of censorship regulations have changed the character of the Enfer. Through the mass availability of erotic and pornographic works it has lost a sense of purpose. Already in 1909, serial fiction was kept in it to protect it against theft. The further growth of this cheaply-produced literature led, in 1932, to a separate press mark within the collection, replaced between 1960-69 by two more specific signatures of the general catalog, which in turn were abandoned without being replaced.

The Bibliothèque nationale closed the Enfer press mark in 1969, but opened it again in 1983, for practical reasons; for librarians and library users, it was easier to find all the erotic works under a single press mark. The acquisition policy of the Bibliothèque nationale is, however, no longer based only on genre. While efforts are made to continue collecting erotic material, the decisive factor now is rarity or bibliophilic quality. Besides older works that were missing from the Enfer, contemporary and foreign books are added to the Enfer. By 2013, the collection had grown to 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ online catalogue of the Bibliothèque nationale] lists 2,706 entries, of which around 100 are empty (accessed on 9 February 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1977, access to the Enfer is no longer stricter than for the rest of the Réserve collections.

[[Image:Petrarch list of letter collections.jpg|thumb|''Epistolae familiares and Seniles''&lt;br /&gt; Venice: J. and G. de Gregorius, 1492]]
'''''Epistolae familiares''''' is the title of a collection of letters of [[Petrarch]] which he edited during his lifetime.  He originally called the collection ''Epistolarum mearum ad diversos liber'' (''"a book of my letters to different people"'') but this was later shortened to the current title.

Petrarch discovered the text of [[Cicero]]’s letters in 1345, which gave him the idea to collect his own sets of letters. It wasn't until four or five years later however, that he actually got started. He collected his letter correspondence in two different time periods. They are referred to as ''Epistolae familiares'' and ''Seniles''.

''Epistolae familiares'' (a.k.a. '''''Familiar Letters''''') was largely collected during his stay in [[Provence]] about 1351 to 1353, however was not ultimately completed until 1359 when he was in [[Milan]]. Petrarch had this collection of letters copied onto [[parchment]] in 1359 by a certain ''ingeniosus homo et amicus'' with another complete copy done in 1364. He added letters in 1366, bringing his first collection of letters to 350. He broke these down and sorted them into 24 volumes. This first collection of letters called ''Epistolae familiares'' were actually written between the years 1325 and 1366 (the first translation into English was done by historian [[James Harvey Robinson]] in 1898 in his book ''The First Modern Scholar and Man of Letters'').

In January 1350 Petrarch wrote a lengthy letter to his dear friend ("Socrates" as Petrarch liked to call him) dedicating the collection to him. He requests his friend to keep the letters safely out of sight of the censors and critics.&lt;ref name="[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2852733"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2852733 JSTOR: ''On the Evolution of Petrarch's Letter to Posterity'' by Ernest H. Wilkins; Speculum, Vol. 39, No. 2 (Apr., 1964), pp. 304-308 ] {{doi|10.2307/2852733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has since been discovered that Socrates was the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] and [[music theory|music theorist]] [[Lodewijk Heyligen]] whose acquaintance Petrarch had made in the circle of [[Giovanni Colonna (cardinal, 1295-1348)|cardinal Giovanni Colonna]] in [[Avignon]].&lt;ref name="[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/mefr_0223-4874_1918_num_37_1_7137"&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/mefr_0223-4874_1918_num_37_1_7137 Sur le Socrate de Pétrarque.

==Letters of Seniles==
Petrarch begun a second collection of letters in 1361, also known as '''''Letters of Old Age'''''. It contains 128 letters written between 1361 and 1373.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2855561 JSTOR A New Fragment of Petrarch's Epistolae Seniles by K. V. Sinclair; Speculum, Vol. 40, No. 2 (Apr., 1965), pp. 323-325 ] {{doi|10.2307/2855561}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also broken down and sorted into volumes (18 books). The final letter, the first and only of the 18th book is his incomplete '''''Letter to Posterity'''''. Some English translations of this collection of letters that are out of copyright are available [http://petrarch.petersadlon.com/seniles.html here]&lt;ref name="tanslation"&gt;translation into English were done by historian [[James Harvey Robinson]] (New York: G.P.

Bernardo, formerly Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Italian and Comparative Literature, State University of New York at Binghamton.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.italicapress.com/index265.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Letter to Posterity]]
*[[Birthday of alpinism|Ascent of Mont Ventoux]]

== Litterae variae ==
There are many letters that Petrarch lost or did not keep a copy of. Others he destroyed the originals of for fear they would bring much criticism to his larger collection. There is a collection of 59 of these letters by [[Giuseppe Fracassetti]].

== Sine nomine ==
This special set (''[[Book Without A Name]]'') of letters Petrarch was too fond of to let out of his hands of some nineteen letters was kept out of the main body of ''Familiar Letters'' to give respect to the papacy and the controversial lavish lifestyle practiced at Avignon. Liber sine nomine is an epitome of this same work in one ''volume without a title'' (which is 19 letters).

In '''''Ex Parte Dittmarn''''' is an important case in the [[Law of succession in South Africa|South African law of succession]]. The [[testator]]’s [[Will and testament|will]] provided that a farm should be sold by [[public auction]]. A sale was advertised, but the highest [[Bidding|bid]] was not considered high enough to be a true reflection of its [[Value (economics)|value]]. The farm was therefore withdrawn and sold out of hand for a price considerably higher than the bid. The court confirmed this sale to be valid, as sale by public auction would have resulted in serious loss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1063">In '''''Ex parte Slabbert''''', an important case in [[South African insolvency law]], the applicant applied for surrender of an estate. In the application, it appeared that the copy of the notice of surrender, required by section 4 of the Insolvency Act, had stated that the applicant’s statement of affairs would lie for inspection with the Master for a period of fourteen days from April 26. The date in the notice, however, was the 29th. In other words, there was a discrepancy with regard to the dates.

Because it was difficult to see how actual prejudice could occur in the circumstances, and still more difficult to see how it could have actually occurred, the court held that the application should be granted; in other words, that the defect did not invalidate the application.

The '''Internet Theatre Database''' ('''ITDb''') is an online database with information about [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[playwright]]s, [[actor]]s, [[theatre|legitimate theatre]], [[musical theatre]], [[Broadway theatre|Broadway shows]], and similar theatrical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=RM&amp;p_theme=rm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4E0F7F9D094AA&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Abundant web sites serve theater fans |last=Bornstein|first=Lisa |date=20 August 2000|work=Rocky Mountain News|accessdate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60884065.html?dids=60884065:60884065&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+22%2C+2000&amp;author=DON+SHIRLEY&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Cybertainment%3B+Mixed+Reviews+for+Theater-Related+Web+Sites&amp;pqatl=google|title=Cybertainment; Mixed Reviews for Theater-Related Web Sites|last=Shirley|first=Don| date=22 September 2000|work=Los Angeles Times - Los Angeles, Calif. |accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website is run by several volunteer theatre [[aficionado]]s, each contributing material as time permits. Somewhat similar to the [[Internet Broadway Database]], the site's creators endeavor to include theatre outside of [[New York City]] by indexing [[London]] and [[Off-Broadway]] productions, national tours, and regional theatre. Modelled on the considerably larger [[Internet Movie Database]], the site indexes by six categories: (1) show/play name; (2) people (actor, writer, or director); (3) theatre facility; (4) song title; (5) character/role; and (6) production role. Each day, the site also shows what well-known productions opened or closed on that date at important theatres in the past several decades.

{{Islamization}}
'''Islamization''' (also spelled '''Islamisation''', see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|spelling differences]]; {{lang-ar|أسلمة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|aslamah}}''), '''Islamicization'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamicization|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Islamicization|journal=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Islamification''' is the process of a society's shift towards Islam, such as found in [[Islam in Sudan|Sudan]], [[Pakistan]], [[History of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Iran]], [[Islam in Southeast Asia#Contemporary Islam in Southeast Asia|Malaysia]], or [[Islam in Algeria#After independence|Algeria]].&lt;ref name=ahmad-19&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=Charles|others=Anis Ahmad, Author of introduction |title=Islamization of Laws and Economy, Case Studies on Pakistan|date=1996|publisher=Institute of Policy Studies, The Islamic Foundation|page=19|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In contemporary usage, it may refer to the perceived imposition of an [[Islamist]] social and political system on a society with an indigenously different social and political background.

The English [[synonyms]], ''muslimization'' and ''[[arabization]]'', in use since before 1940 (e.g., ''Waverly Illustrated Dictionary'') convey a similar meaning. '''Muslimization''' has recently been used as a term coined to describe the overtly Muslim practices of new converts to the religion who wish to reinforce their newly acquired religious identity.&lt;ref name="Lindley-Highfield"&gt;Lindley-Highfield, M. (2008) '"Muslimization", Mission and Modernity in Morelos: the problem of a combined hotel and prayer hall for the Muslims of Mexico'. ''Tourism Culture &amp; Communication'', vol. 8, no. 2, 85–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|Spread of Islam}}
{{further|Islamic conquests|Islamization of Iran|Ilkhanate}}

===Arabization===
{{main|Arabization}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
Arabization describes a growing cultural influence on a non-Arab area that gradually changes into one that speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and/or incorporates [[Arab culture]]. It was most prominently achieved during the 7th-century Arabian [[Muslim conquests]] which spread the Arabic language, culture, and—having been carried out by Arabian Muslims as opposed to [[Arab Christian]]s or [[Arab Jewish tribes|Arabic-speaking Jews]]—the religion of [[Islam]] to the lands they conquered. The result: some elements of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] origin combined in various forms and degrees with elements taken from conquered civilizations and ultimately denominated "[[Arab]]", as opposed to "Arabian".

==Modern day (1970s to present)==
{{Cleanup|section|date=April 2011}}
Modern day Islamization appears to be a return of the individual to Muslim values, communities, and dress codes, and a strengthened community.&lt;ref name="Lapidus 11"&gt;Lapidus, p. 823&lt;/ref&gt;

Another development is that of [[transnational Islam]], elaborated upon by the French Islam researchers [[Gilles Kepel]] and [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]]. It includes a feeling of a "growing universalistic Islamic identity" as often shared by Muslim immigrants and their children who live in non-Muslim countries:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The increased integration of world societies as a result of enhanced communications, media, travel, and migration makes meaningful the concept of a single Islam practiced everywhere in similar ways, and an Islam which transcends national and ethnic customs.&lt;ref name="Lapidus 12"&gt;Lapidus, p. 828–30&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This does not necessarily imply political or social organizations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Global Muslim identity does not necessarily or even usually imply organized group action. Even though Muslims recognize a global affiliation, the real heart of Muslim religious life remains outside politics—in local associations for worship, discussion, mutual aid, education, charity, and other communal activities.&lt;ref name="Lapidus 12"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A third development is the growth and elaboration of transnational military organizations. The 1980s and 90s, with several major conflicts in the [[Middle East]], including the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], [[Afghanistan]] in the 1980s and 2001, and the three Gulf Wars ([[Iran–Iraq War|1980–89]], [[Gulf War|1990–91]], [[Iraq War|2003]]) were catalysts of a growing internationalization of local conflicts. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Figures such as [[Osama Bin Laden]] and [[Abdallah Azzam]] have been crucial in these developments, as much as domestic and world politics.&lt;ref name="Lapidus 12"/&gt;

===Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization of Pakistan===
{{main|Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization}}
On December 2, 1978, [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] delivered a nationwide address on the occasion of the first day of the [[Hijra year|Hijra]] calendar. He did this in order to usher in an Islamic system to Pakistan. In the speech, he accused politicians of exploiting the name of Islam, saying that "many a ruler did what they pleased in the name of Islam."

After assuming power the task that the government set to was its public commitment to enforce ''Nizam-e-Mustafa'' (Islamic System) a 180 degree turn from Pakistan's predominantly Common Law. As a preliminary measure to establish an Islamic society in Pakistan, General Zia announced the establishment of [[Sharia|Sharia Benches]]. Speaking about the jurisdiction of the Sharia Benches, he remarked, "Every citizen will have the right to present any law enforced by the government before the 'Sharia Bench' and obtain its verdict whether the law is wholly or partly Islamic or un-Islamic."

But General Zia did not mention that the Sharia Benches' jurisdiction was curtailed by the following overriding clause: "(Any) law does not include the constitution, Muslim personal law, any law relating to the procedure of any court or tribunal or, until the expiration of three years, any fiscal law, or any law relating to the collection of taxes and fees or insurance practice and procedure." It meant that all important laws which affect each and every individual directly remained outside the purview of the Sharia Benches. However, he did not have a smooth sailing even with the clipped Sharia Benches. The Federal Sharia Bench declared [[rajm]], or [[stoning]], to be un-Islamic; Ziaul Haq reconstituted the court, which then declared rajm as Islamic.

{{refimprove|date=May 2016}}
{{nihongo|'''Kuchisake-onna'''|口裂け女||"cleft mouth woman\Slit Mouth Woman "}} is a malevolent figure appearing in [[Japan]]ese ghost stories, possibly dating back to the [[Edo period]]{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. As a living serial killer, she approaches her victims with seemingly innocuous questions before killing them, usually with a pair of scissors.

==Mythology==
She is a woman who was [[mutilation|mutilated]] by her husband, and returns as a [[onryō|malicious spirit]]. When rumors of alleged sightings began spreading in 1979 around the [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], it spread throughout [[Japan]] and caused panic in many towns. There are even reports of schools allowing children to go home only in groups, escorted by teachers for safety,&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|Hy7LnTznkks|Severed Mouth Woman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of police increasing their patrols. Recent sightings include many reports in [[South Korea]] in 2004 about a woman wearing a red mask, who was frequently seen chasing children, and in October 2007, a coroner found some old records from the late 1970s about a woman who was chasing little children. She was then hit by a car, and died shortly after. Her mouth was ripped from ear to ear.&lt;ref name="The Mask of Reason"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maskofreason.wordpress.com/the-book-of-mysteries/know-your-ghosts/eastern-asia/kuchisake-onna/|title=Kuchisake Onna &amp;#124; The Mask of Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some stories describe her as a former patient of a mental asylum, a more common story describes that in the Heian period, her husband found out that she was having an affair with another samurai. He used a sword to cut her mouth from ear to ear and asked, "Who will think you are beautiful now?"&lt;ref name="The Mask of Reason" /&gt;

===The original legend===
[[Image:Kuchisake-onna conversation diagram.svg|right|thumb|400px|Diagram of likely conversations with Kuchisake-onna according to the modern legend.]]
According to the legend, she covers her mouth with a cloth mask, a fan, or a scarf.

The woman will ask a potential victim "Am I pretty?" If they answer yes, she will remove her mask and ask them again in a girly voice. If the potential victim answers yes or screams, she will slash the victim from ear to ear so that the victim resembles her. If they answer no, she will walk away, only to follow her victim home and brutally murder them that night. Said reaction also occurs if you say no before she removes her mask.

To avoid this fate, several people during the Edo period claimed that they gave her confusing answers like average and so-so or threw money or hard candy at her, buying themselves time to run away and lose her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yokai.com/kuchisakeonna/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603210415/http://yokai.com/kuchisakeonna/ |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern legend===
According to the legend, she walks around wearing a surgical mask.

The woman will ask a potential victim "Am I pretty?" If they answer no, she will kill them with a pair of scissors, which she carries in her pocket. If they answer yes, she will pull away the mask, revealing that [[Glasgow smile|her mouth is slit from ear to ear]], and ask, "How about now?" If they answer no, she will cut her unfortunate victim in half. If the person answers yes, then she will slit his/her mouth so it resembles her mouth. It is impossible to run away from her, as she will simply reappear in front of the victim. 

When the legend reappeared in the 1970s, rumors of ways to escape also emerged. Some sources say she can also be confused by the victim answering her question with ambiguous answers, such as "You are average" or "So-so". Another method is to flip her questions towards her, such as asking her "Do you think ''I'm'' pretty?" Unsure of what to do, she will give a person enough time to escape while she is lost in thought. Another escape route is to tell her one has a previous engagement; she will pardon her manners and excuse herself. In some variations of the tale, she can be distracted by [[fruit]] or [[Candy|candies]] thrown at her which she will then pick up, thus giving the victim a chance to run.

=== Backstory ===
Kuchisake-Onna, as told commonly, was a beautiful, young woman that lived in a village of Japan. She would roam around the village, and ask the folks, "Am I pretty?", to which they would reply with an enthusiastic "yes". This made her very confident in herself, and as she was married to an intelligent samurai, she believed that she would be able to get away with an affair with a noble soldier. But her husband found out, and in anger, asked the soldier, "Why her? Why my lady rather than all other women of the village?", to which he replied, "For she is the most beautiful of the village, I cannot pass up such an opportunity." The samurai adored his honesty, and acknowledged that he had the right response and reason. The soldier was poor after all, and had not had many positive things occur in his life. Although the soldier had proper intentions, the samurai's wife did not. She was the most beautiful woman of the village, and without that, she would be nothing. The samurai angrily took his sword upon her face, and slit her mouth from ear to ear, making her no longer beautiful. Soon after, she killed herself, and was banished to eternity of avenging her own pain.

{{Formation of Malaysia}}

The '''Malaysia Agreement''' or the '''Agreement relating to Malaysia between United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Federation of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore''' was the agreement which combined [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]], and [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]] with the existing states of the [[Federation of Malaya]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/35/section/1 Malaysia Act 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting union being named [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref name="Malaysia Act 1963"&gt;''See'': The UK Statute Law Database: the Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/all?title=malaysia%20act Malaysia Act 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957"&gt;''See'': The UK Statute Law Database: the Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&amp;PageNumber=72&amp;NavFrom=2&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1118475&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1118475&amp;filesize=15776 Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957 (c. 60)]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore later ceased to be a part of Malaysia, becoming an independent state on 9 August 1965.&lt;ref&gt;''See'': the [http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20563/volume-563-I-8206-English.pdf Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965] and the Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1966/29/contents Singapore Act 1966].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Malayan Union]] was established by the [[British Malaya]] and comprised the [[Federated Malay States]] of [[Perak]], [[Selangor]], [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Pahang]]; the [[Unfederated Malay States]] of [[Kedah]], [[Perlis]], [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]], [[Johor]]; and the [[Straits Settlements]] of [[Penang]] and [[Malacca]].  It came into being in 1946, through a series of agreements between the United Kingdom and Malayan Union.&lt;ref name="Federation of Malaya Agreement"&gt;''See'': Cabinet Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. 21 February 1956 [http://filestore.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pdfs/large/cab-129-79.pdf Federation of Malaya Agreement]&lt;/ref&gt; The Malayan Union was superseded by the [[Federation of Malaya]] on 1 February 1948, and achieved independence within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on 31 August 1957.&lt;ref name="Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957"/&gt;

After the end of the [[Second World War]], decolonisation became the societal goal of the peoples under colonial regimes aspiring to achieve self-determination hereinafter, the ''Special Committee on Decolonisation'' (also known as the ''U.N. Special Committee of the 24 on Decolonisation'', It reflected in the United Nations General Assembly's proclamation on 14 December 1960 of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples hereinafter, the '''Committee of 24''', or simply, the ''Decolonisation Committee'') was established in 1961 by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] with the purpose of monitoring implementation of the [[Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples]] and to make recommendations on its application.&lt;ref&gt;''See'': [https://www.un.org/Depts/dpi/decolonization/special_committee_main.htm the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonisation - Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The committee is also a successor to the former Committee on Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories. Hoping to speed the progress of decolonisation, the General Assembly had adopted in 1960 the [[:s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514|Resolution 1514]], also known as the "Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples" or simply "Declaration on Decolonisation". It stated that all people have a right to self-determination and proclaimed that colonialism should be brought to a speedy and unconditional end.&lt;ref&gt;''See'': [https://www.un.org/Depts/dpi/decolonization/history.htm History of U.N. Decolonisation Committee - Official U.N. Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Malaysia Agreement signed between Great Britain and the Federation of Malaya, Britain would enact an Act to relinquish sovereign control over Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo (now Sabah). This was accomplished through the enactment of the [[Malaysia Act 1963]], clause 1(1) of which states that on Malaysia Day, "Her Majesty’s sovereignty and jurisdiction in respect of the new states shall be relinquished so as to vest in the manner agreed".&lt;ref&gt;''See'': Section 1(1), Malaysia Act 1963, Chapter 35 (UK).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decolonisation, self-determination and referendum===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
The issue of self-determination with respect to the peoples of North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore formed the bedrock of yet another challenge to the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. Under the Joint Statement issued by the British and Malayan Federal Governments on 23 November 1961, clause 4 provided: ''Before coming to any final decision it is necessary to ascertain the views of the peoples. It has accordingly been decided to set up a Commission to carry out this task and to make recommendations ........''

In the spirit of ensuring that decolonisation was carried in accordance with the wishes of the peoples of North Borneo, the
British Government, working with the Federation of Malaya Government, appointed a Commission of Enquiry for North Borneo and Sarawak in January 1962 to determine if the people supported the proposal to create a Federation of Malaysia. The five-man team, which comprised two Malayans and three British representatives, was headed by [[Cameron Cobbold, 1st Baron Cobbold|Lord Cobbold]].&lt;ref&gt;Cobbold was Governor of the Bank of England from 1949 to 1961. The other members were [[Wong Pow Nee]], Chief Minister of Penang, [[Ghazali Shafie|Mohammed Ghazali Shafie]], Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [[Anthony Abell]], former Governor or Sarawak, and David Watherston, former Chief Secretary of the Federation of Malaya.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore, the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) sought merger with Malaysia on the basis of the strong mandate it obtained during the general elections of 1959 when it won 43 of the 51 seats. However, this mandate became questionable when dissension within the Party led to a split. In July 1961, following a debate on a vote of confidence in the government, 13 PAP Assemblymen were expelled from the PAP for abstaining. They went on to form a new political party, the [[Barisan Sosialis]], the PAP’s majority in the Legislative Assembly was whittled down as they now only commanded 30 of the 51 seats. More defections occurred until the PAP had a majority of just one seat in the Assembly. Given this situation, it would have been impossible to rely on the mandate achieved in 1959 to move forth with merger. A new mandate was necessary, especially since the [[Barisan Sosialis|Barisan]] argued that the terms of merger offered were detrimental to the Singapore people.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

While [[Brunei]] sent a delegation to the signing of the Malaysia Agreement, they did not sign as the [[Sultan of Brunei]] wished to be recognised as the senior ruler in the federation.&lt;ref name="Mathews2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mathews |first=Philip |title=Chronicle of Malaysia: Fifty Years of Headline News, 1963–2013 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=md9UAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9789671061749&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje7pysnorRAhUFWxoKHdQWAPsQ6AEIHDAA |year=February 2014 |publisher=Editions Didier Millet |isbn=978-967-10617-4-9 |pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September 1963, just 4 days before the new Federation of Malaysia was to come into being, the Government of the State of [[Kelantan]] sought a declaration that the Malaysia Agreement and Malaysia Act were null and void, or alternatively, that even if they were valid, they did not bind the State of Kelantan.{{according to whom?|date=May 2017}}{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The Kelantan Government argued that both the Malaysia Agreement and the Malaysia Act were not binding on Kelantan on the following grounds that the Malaysia Act in effect abolished the Federation of Malaya and this was contrary to the 1957 Federation of Malaya Agreement that the proposed changes required the consent of each of the constituent states of the Federation of Malaya – including Kelantan – and this had not been obtained.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

{{Redirect|Memoranda|the information manager software|Memoranda (software)}}

[[File:6-00 PM Energy Meeting (11-2-77) - NARA - 142151.tif|right|thumb|Memo written by a staff member during [[President Carter|President Carter's]] tenure in the White House.]]
A '''memorandum''' (abbrev.: '''memo'''; from [[Latin]] ''memorandum est'', "It must be remembered (that)...") is a note, [[document]] or other [[communication]] that helps the memory by recording events or observations on a topic such as may be used in a business [[office]]. The plural form of the Latin noun ''memorandum'' so derived is properly ''memoranda'', but if the word is deemed to have become a word of the English language, the plural ''memorandums'', abbreviated to ''memos'', may be used. (See also [[Agenda (meeting)|Agenda]], [[Corrigenda]], [[Addenda]]).

A memorandum can have only a certain number of formats; it may have a format specific to an office or institution. In law specifically, a memorandum is a record of the terms of a transaction or contract, such as a policy memo, [[memorandum of understanding]], [[memorandum of agreement]], or [[memorandum of association]]. Alternative formats include memos, briefing notes, reports, letters, binders, etc. They could be one page long or many. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. If the user is a [[Minister (government)|cabinet minister]] or a senior executive, the format might be rigidly defined and limited to one or two pages. If the user is a colleague, the format is usually much more flexible. At its most basic level, a memorandum can be a handwritten note to one's supervisor. In business, a memo is typically used by firms for internal communication, as opposed to [[Letter (message)|letters]] which are typically for external communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 113. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, we can consider memoranda as an upward communication process through which any complaint, issues, opinion, views and suggestion are put forward to the authorized level.

==Policy briefing note==
A specific type of memorandum is the '''policy briefing note''' (alternatively referred to in various jurisdictions and governing traditions as policy issues paper, policy memoranda, or cabinet submission amongst other terms), a document for transmitting [[policy analysis]] into the political [[decision making]] sphere. Typically, a briefing note may be denoted as either “for information” or “for decision”.

===Origins of term===
The origins of the term “briefing” lie in legal “briefs” and the derivative “military briefings”.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J.A. and E.S.C. Weiner (ed.) 1989. Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. OED Online. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===
The primary purpose of a briefing note “for decision” is to support decision making –  and also to “help (or sometimes influence) a decision-maker to make a better decision in a particular problem situation than he might otherwise have made without the analysis”.&lt;ref&gt;Quade, E.S. 1975. Analysis for public decisions. New York: [[Elsevier]]. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Other purposes that the briefing note can serve include: conveying information; informing decisions, making a request, providing a response to a question, making a suggestion, presenting an informal report, proposing a solution to a problem, or documenting a reference for future use.

===Structure===
As the communication mechanism of the policy analysis process, the briefing note should provide a coherent synopsis of a policy problem, identify different policy options for addressing the problem, articulate opposing perspectives and advocate a recommended option. The typical structure for a briefing note includes a description of the proposed policy; relevant background information; a discussion of key considerations (including implementation concerns, financial considerations, stakeholder impacts, and possible unanticipated consequences), a summary of arguments for and against the policy and a recommended decision. Policy documents that start with a proposal and assemble an argument that position are more accurately referred to as a government [[white paper]]. A government [[green paper]] which raises a policy option and is meant to open a dialogue on the proposal is more similar in tone to a briefing note than is a [[white paper]].

===Quality criteria===
There is no universal standard for a briefing note, but it is generally understood to be a concise, coherent summary of a public policy problem with a clearly articulated logic for following a recommended course of action. ”Next to a political nose, and a logical brain, the most important skill of the good treasury [person] resides in [their] fine drafting hand. The concise, coherent and penetrating note is the final expression of all other talents.”&lt;ref&gt;Heclo, H. and Rahul Vaidya 1974. The Private Government of Public Money. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In many Westminster / Whitehall governance settings, policy analysts are expected to analyze the issue and write the briefing note from a neutral public service perspective. However, the briefing note “for decision” must contain a recommendation, acknowledging that “to say anything of importance in public policy requires value judgments, which must be explained and justified”.&lt;ref&gt;Majone, G. 1989. Evidence, Argument, and Persuasion in the Policy Process. New Haven, CT: [[Yale University Press]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

* Descriptive metadata describes a resource for purposes such as discovery and identification. It can include elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.
* Structural metadata is metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships and other characteristics of digital materials. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february97/cnri/02arms1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327015501/http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february97/cnri/02arms1.html |archivedate=27 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Metadata was traditionally used in the [[library catalog|card catalogs]] of [[library|libraries]] until the 1980s, when libraries converted their catalog data to digital databases. In the 2000s, as digital formats were becoming the prevalent way of storing data and information, metadata was also used to describe digital data using [[metadata standards]].

The first description of "meta data" for computer systems is purportedly noted by MIT's Center for International Studies experts David Griffel and Stuart McIntosh in 1967: "In summary then, we have statements in an object language about subject descriptions of data and token codes for the data. We also have statements in a meta language describing the data relationships and transformations, and ought/is relations between norm and data." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Tobias|date=2017-11-23|title=Metadaten und OER: Geschichte einer Beziehung (Metadata and OER: [hi]story of a relationship)|url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:16929/|journal=Synergie. Fachmagazin für Digitalisierung in der Lehre|language=de-DE|volume=04|doi=10.17613/m6p81g|issn=2509-3096|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different metadata standards for each different discipline (e.g., [[museum]] collections, [[digital audio file]]s, [[website]]s, etc.). Describing the [[Content (media)|contents]] and [[Context (computing)|context]] of data or [[computer file|data files]] increases its usefulness. For example, a [[HTML editor|web page]] may include metadata specifying what software language the page is written in (e.g., HTML), what tools were used to create it, what subjects the page is about, and where to find more information about the subject. This metadata can automatically improve the reader's experience and make it easier for users to find the web page online.&lt;ref name="Practices in Using Metadata"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/dcc/bestpractices/chapter_11_structuralmetadata.html | title=Best Practices for Structural Metadata | publisher=University of Illinois | date=15 December 2010 | accessdate=17 June 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624011712/http://www.library.illinois.edu/dcc/bestpractices/chapter_11_structuralmetadata.html | archivedate=24 June 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[CD]] may include metadata providing information about the musicians, singers and songwriters whose work appears on the disc.

A principal purpose of metadata is to help users find relevant information and discover resources. Metadata also helps to organize electronic resources, provide digital identification, and support the archiving and preservation of resources. Metadata assists users in resource discovery by "allowing resources to be found by relevant criteria, identifying resources, bringing similar resources together, distinguishing dissimilar resources, and giving location information."&lt;ref name = Understanding_Metadata/&gt; Metadata of telecommunication activities including [[Internet]] traffic is very widely collected by various national governmental organizations.

== Definition ==
# Metadata means "data about data". Although the "meta" prefix (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] preposition and [[prefix]] μετά-) means "after" or "beyond", it is used to mean "about" in epistemology. Metadata is defined as the data providing information about one or more aspects of the data; it is used to summarize basic information about data which can make tracking and working with specific data easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

But if given the context that this database is a log of a book collection, those 13-digit numbers may now be identified as [[ISBN]]s - information that refers to the book, but is not itself the information within the book. The term "metadata" was coined in 1968 by Philip Bagley, in his book "Extension of Programming Language Concepts" where it is clear that he uses the term in the ISO 11179 "traditional" sense, which is "structural metadata" i.e. "data about the containers of data"; rather than the alternative sense "content about individual instances of data content" or metacontent, the type of data usually found in library catalogues.&lt;ref name=Bagley&gt;{{Cite journal

== Types ==
While the metadata application is manifold, covering a large variety of fields, there are specialized and well-accepted models to specify types of metadata. [[Francis Bretherton|Bretherton]] &amp; Singley (1994) distinguish between two distinct classes: structural/control metadata and guide metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Structural metadata'' describes the structure of database objects such as tables, columns, keys and indexes. ''Guide metadata'' helps humans find specific items and are usually expressed as a set of keywords in a natural language. According to [[Ralph Kimball]] metadata can be divided into 2 similar categories: technical metadata and business metadata. ''Technical metadata'' corresponds to internal metadata, and ''business metadata'' corresponds to external metadata. Kimball adds a third category, ''process metadata''. On the other hand, NISO distinguishes among three types of metadata: descriptive, structural, and administrative.&lt;ref name=NISO/&gt;

''Descriptive metadata'' is typically used for discovery and identification, as information to search and locate an object, such as title, author, subjects, keywords, publisher. ''Structural metadata'' describes how the components of an object are organized. An example of structural metadata would be how pages are ordered to form chapters of a book. Finally, ''administrative metadata'' gives information to help manage the source. Administrative metadata refers to the technical information, including file type, or when and how the file was created. Two sub-types of administrative metadata are rights management metadata and preservation metadata. ''Rights management metadata'' explains intellectual property rights, while ''preservation metadata'' contains information to preserve and save a resource.&lt;ref name=Understanding_Metadata&gt;{{cite book|last=National Information Standards Organization|title=Understanding Metadata|year=2004|publisher=NISO Press|location=Bethesda, MD|isbn=1-880124-62-9|url=http://www.niso.org/publications/press/UnderstandingMetadata.pdf|author2=Rebecca Guenther|author3=Jaqueline Radebaugh|accessdate=2 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107022958/http://www.niso.org/publications/press/UnderstandingMetadata.pdf|archivedate=7 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

Statistical data repositories have their own requirements for metadata in order to describe not only the source and quality of the data&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; but also what statistical processes were used to create the data, which is of particular importance to the statistical community in order to both validate and improve the process of statistical data production&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

An additional type of metadata beginning to be more developed is ''accessibility metadata''. ''Accessibility metadata'' is not a new concept to libraries; however, advances in universal design have raised its profile.&lt;ref name = "Beyene (2017)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beyene|first1=Wondwossen Mulualem|title=Metadata and universal access in digital library environments|journal=Library Hi Tech|date=2017|volume=35|issue=2|doi=10.1108/LHT-06-2016-0074}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213-214}} Projects like Cloud4All and GPII identified the lack of common terminologies and models to describe the needs and preferences of users and information that fits those needs as a major gap in providing universal access solutions.&lt;ref name = "Beyene (2017)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210-211}}. Those types of information are accessibility metadata.&lt;ref name = "Beyene (2017)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|214}} [http://Schema.org Schema.org] has incorporated several accessibility properties based on IMS Global Access for All Information Model Data Element Specification.&lt;ref name = "Beyene (2017)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|214}} The Wiki page [https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility WebSchemas/Accessibility] lists several properties and their values.

While the efforts to describe and standardize the varied accessibility needs of information seekers are beginning to become more robust their adoption into established metadata schemas has not been as developed. For example, while Dublin Core (DC)'s “audience” and MARC 21's “reading level” could be used to identify resources suitable for users with dyslexia and DC's “Format” could be used to identify resources available in braille, audio, or large print formats, there is more work to be done.&lt;ref name = "Beyene (2017)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|214}}

== Structures ==
Metadata (metacontent) or, more correctly, the vocabularies used to assemble metadata (metacontent) statements, is typically structured according to a standardized concept using a well-defined metadata scheme, including: [[metadata standards]] and [[Metadata modeling|metadata models]]. Tools such as [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]], [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesauri]], [[Data Dictionary|data dictionaries]], and [[Metadata registry|metadata registries]] can be used to apply further standardization to the metadata. Structural metadata commonality is also of paramount importance in [[data model]] development and in [[database design]].

=== Syntax ===
Metadata (metacontent) syntax refers to the rules created to structure the fields or elements of metadata (metacontent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/cathro3.html|title=Metadata: an overview|last=Cathro|first=Warwick|authorlink=Warwick Cathro|date=|year=1997|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222232625/http://www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/cathro3.html|archive-date=22 December 2009|dead-url=no|accessdate=6 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single metadata scheme may be expressed in a number of different markup or programming languages, each of which requires a different syntax. For example, Dublin Core may be expressed in plain text, [[HTML]], [[XML]], and [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common example of (guide) metacontent is the bibliographic classification, the subject, the [[List of Dewey Decimal classes|Dewey Decimal class number]]. There is always an implied statement in any "classification" of some object. To classify an object as, for example, Dewey class number 514 (Topology) (i.e. books having the number 514 on their spine) the implied statement is: "&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;book&gt;&lt;subject heading&gt;&lt;514&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This is a subject-predicate-object triple, or more importantly, a class-attribute-value triple. The first two elements of the triple (class, attribute) are pieces of some structural metadata having a defined semantic. The third element is a value, preferably from some controlled vocabulary, some reference (master) data. The combination of the metadata and master data elements results in a statement which is a metacontent statement i.e. "metacontent = metadata + master data". All of these elements can be thought of as "vocabulary". Both metadata and master data are vocabularies which can be assembled into metacontent statements. There are many sources of these vocabularies, both meta and master data: UML, EDIFACT, XSD, Dewey/UDC/LoC, SKOS, ISO-25964, Pantone, Linnaean Binomial Nomenclature, etc. Using controlled vocabularies for the components of metacontent statements, whether for indexing or finding, is endorsed by [[ISO 25964]]: "If both the indexer and the searcher are guided to choose the same term for the same concept, then relevant documents will be retrieved."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:25964:-1:ed-1:v1:en {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617031837/https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/ |date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly relevant when considering search engines of the internet, such as Google. The process indexes pages then matches text strings using its complex algorithm; there is no intelligence or "inferencing" occurring, just the illusion thereof.

=== Hierarchical, linear and planar schemata ===
Metadata schemata can be hierarchical in nature where relationships exist between metadata elements and elements are nested so that parent-child relationships exist between the elements.
An example of a hierarchical metadata schema is the [[Learning object metadata|IEEE LOM]] schema, in which metadata elements may belong to a parent metadata element.
Metadata schemata can also be one-dimensional, or linear, where each element is completely discrete from other elements and classified according to one dimension only.
An example of a linear metadata schema is the [[Dublin Core Metadata Initiative|Dublin Core]] schema, which is one dimensional.
Metadata schemata are often two dimensional, or planar, where each element is completely discrete from other elements but classified according to two orthogonal dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| archivedate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypermapping ===
In all cases where the metadata schemata exceed the planar depiction, some type of [[hypermap]]ping is required to enable display and view of metadata according to chosen aspect and to serve special views. Hypermapping frequently applies to layering of geographical and geological information overlays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXII/part4/kuebler51.pdf |title=THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A GEOLOGIC HYPERMAP PROTOTYPE |first1=Stefanie |last1=Kübler |first2=Wolfdietrich |last2=Skala |first3=Agnès |last3=Voisard |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003182157/http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXII/part4/kuebler51.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Granularity ===
The degree to which the data or metadata is structured is referred to as its [[Data granularity|"granularity"]]. "Granularity" refers to how much detail is provided. Metadata with a high granularity allows for deeper, more detailed, and more structured information and enables greater level of technical manipulation. A lower level of granularity means that metadata can be created for considerably lower costs but will not provide as detailed information. The major impact of granularity is not only on creation and capture, but moreover on maintenance costs. As soon as the metadata structures become outdated, so too is the access to the referred data. Hence granularity must take into account the effort to create the metadata as well as the effort to maintain it.

== Standards ==
International standards apply to metadata. Much work is being accomplished in the national and international standards communities, especially [[ANSI]] (American National Standards Institute) and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (International Organization for Standardization) to reach consensus on standardizing metadata and registries. The core metadata registry standard is [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 11179 Metadata Registries (MDR), the framework for the standard is described in ISO/IEC 11179-1:2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

(see [[ISO/IEC 11179]]). This standard specifies a schema for recording both the meaning and technical structure of the data for unambiguous usage by humans and computers. ISO/IEC 11179 standard refers to metadata as information objects about data, or "data about data". In ISO/IEC 11179 Part-3, the information objects are data about Data Elements, Value Domains, and other reusable semantic and representational information objects that describe the meaning and technical details of a data item. This standard also prescribes the details for a metadata registry, and for registering and administering the information objects within a Metadata Registry. ISO/IEC 11179 Part 3 also has provisions for describing compound structures that are derivations of other data elements, for example through calculations, collections of one or more data elements, or other forms of derived data. While this standard describes itself originally as a "data element" registry, its purpose is to support describing and registering metadata content independently of any particular application, lending the descriptions to being discovered and reused by humans or computers in developing new applications, databases, or for analysis of data collected in accordance with the registered metadata content. This standard has become the general basis for other kinds of metadata registries, reusing and extending the registration and administration portion of the standard.

The Geospatial community has a tradition of specialized [[geospatial metadata]] standards, particularly building on traditions of map- and image-libraries and catalogues. Formal metadata is usually essential for geospatial data, as common text-processing approaches are not applicable.

== Use ==

=== Photographs ===
Metadata may be written into a [[digital photo]] file that will identify who owns it, copyright and contact information, what brand or model of camera created the file, along with exposure information (shutter speed, f-stop, etc.) and descriptive information, such as keywords about the photo, making the file or image searchable on a computer and/or the Internet. Some metadata is created by the camera and some is input by the photographer and/or software after downloading to a computer. Most digital cameras write metadata about model number, shutter speed, etc., and some enable you to edit it;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=gurucamera.com|title=How To Copyright Your Photos With Metadata|url=https://gurucamera.com/copyright-photos-metadata/|work=Guru Camera|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630023616/https://gurucamera.com/copyright-photos-metadata/|archivedate=30 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; this functionality has been available on most Nikon DSLRs since the [[Nikon D3]], on most new Canon cameras since the [[Canon EOS 7D]], and on most Pentax DSLRs since the Pentax K-3. Metadata can be used to make organizing in post-production easier with the use of key-wording. Filters can be used to analyze a specific set of photographs and create selections on criteria like rating or capture time.

Photographic Metadata Standards are governed by organizations that develop the following standards. They include, but are not limited to:
* [[IPTC Information Interchange Model]] IIM (International Press Telecommunications Council),
* [[International Press Telecommunications Council|IPTC]] Core Schema for XMP
* [[Extensible Metadata Platform|XMP]] – Extensible Metadata Platform (an ISO standard)
* [[Exchangeable image file format|Exif]] – Exchangeable image file format, Maintained by CIPA (Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association) and published by JEITA (Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association)
* [[Dublin Core]] (Dublin Core Metadata Initiative – DCMI)
* PLUS (Picture Licensing Universal System).
* [https://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/schemas.html VRA Core] (Visual Resource Association)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VRA Core Support Pages|url=http://core.vraweb.org|website=Visual Resource Association Foundation|publisher=Visual Resource Association Foundation|accessdate=27 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409191705/http://core.vraweb.org/|archivedate=9 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunications ===
Information on the times, origins and destinations of phone calls, electronic messages, instant messages and other modes of telecommunication, as opposed to message content, is another form of metadata. Bulk collection of this [[call detail record]] metadata by intelligence agencies has proven controversial after disclosures by [[Edward Snowden]] of the fact that certain Intelligence agencies such as the [[NSA]] had been (and perhaps still are) keeping online metadata on millions of internet user for up to a year, regardless of whether or not they [ever] were persons of interest to the agency.

=== Video ===
Metadata is particularly useful in video, where information about its contents (such as transcripts of conversations and text descriptions of its scenes) is not directly understandable by a computer, but where efficient search of the content is desirable. This is particularly useful in video applications such as [[Automatic number-plate recognition|Automatic Number Plate Recognition]] and [[Vehicle recognition identification|Vehicle Recognition Identification]] software, wherein license plate data is saved and used to create reports and alerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/LPRStandards-TN_1012-508.pdf|title=System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER)|last=Homeland Security|first=|date=October 2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two sources in which video metadata is derived: (1) operational gathered metadata, that is information about the content produced, such as the type of equipment, software, date, and location; (2) human-authored metadata, to improve search engine visibility, discoverability, audience engagement, and providing advertising opportunities to video publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Creation ==
Metadata can be created either by automated information processing or by manual work. Elementary metadata captured by computers can include information about when an object was created, who created it, when it was last updated, file size, and file extension. In this context an ''object'' refers to any of the following:

* A physical item such as a book, CD, DVD, a paper map, chair, table, flower pot, etc.
* An electronic file such as a digital image, digital photo, electronic document, program file, database table, etc.

=== Data virtualization ===
{{main article|Data virtualization}}
Data virtualization has emerged in the 2000s as the new software technology to complete the virtualization "stack" in the enterprise. Metadata is used in data virtualization servers which are enterprise infrastructure components, alongside database and application servers. Metadata in these servers is saved as persistent repository and describe [[business object]]s in various enterprise systems and applications. Structural metadata commonality is also important to support data virtualization.

=== Statistics and census services ===
Standardization and harmonization work has brought advantages to industry efforts to build metadata systems in the statistical community.&lt;ref name="GløersenImprov11"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.50/2011/wp.11.e.pdf |format=PDF |title=Improving interoperability in Statistics - The impact of SDMX: Some Considerations |author=Gløersen, R. |publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |date=30 April 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaurilaMetadata12"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/NTTS2013fullPaper_182.pdf |format=PDF |title=Metadata system meeting requirements of standardisation, quality and interaction and integrity with other metadata systems: Case Variable Editor Statistics Finland |author=Laurila, S. |publisher=European Commission |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several metadata guidelines and standards such as the European Statistics Code of Practice&lt;ref name="ECEuropeanStat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/quality/european-statistics-code-of-practice |title=European Statistics Code of Practice |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO 17369:2013 ([[SDMX|Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange]] or SDMX)&lt;ref name="GløersenImprov11" /&gt; provide key principles for how businesses, government bodies, and other entities should manage statistical data and metadata.

=== Library and information science ===

Metadata has been used in various ways as a means of cataloging items in libraries in both digital and analog format. Such data helps classify, aggregate, identify, and locate a particular book, DVD, magazine or any object a library might hold in its collection. Until the 1980s, many library catalogues used 3x5 inch cards in file drawers to display a book's title, author, subject matter, and an abbreviated [[Alphanumeric|alpha-numeric]] string ([[call number]]) which indicated the physical location of the book within the library's shelves. The [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] employed by libraries for the classification of library materials by subject is an early example of metadata usage. Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, many libraries replaced these paper file cards with computer databases. These computer databases make it much easier and faster for users to do keyword searches. Another form of older metadata collection is the use by US Census Bureau of what is known as the "Long Form." The Long Form asks questions that are used to create demographic data to find patterns of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; [[library|Libraries]] employ metadata in [[library catalog]]ues, most commonly as part of an [[Library management system|Integrated Library Management System]]. Metadata is obtained by [[Library cataloguing#Cataloging rules|cataloguing]] resources such as books, periodicals, DVDs, web pages or digital images. This data is stored in the integrated library management system, [[Library management system|ILMS]], using the [[MARC standards|MARC]] metadata standard. The purpose is to direct patrons to the physical or electronic location of items or areas they seek as well as to provide a description of the item/s in question.

More recent and specialized instances of library metadata include the establishment of [[Digital library|digital libraries]] including [[eprint|e-print]] repositories and digital image libraries. While often based on library principles, the focus on non-librarian use, especially in providing metadata, means they do not follow traditional or common cataloging approaches. Given the custom nature of included materials, metadata fields are often specially created e.g. taxonomic classification fields, location fields, keywords or copyright statement. Standard file information such as file size and format are usually automatically included.&lt;ref name=solodovnik&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solodovnik | first1 = Iryna | year = 2011 | title = Metadata issues in Digital Libraries: key concepts and perspectives | journal = [[JLIS.it|JLIS.it: Italian Journal of Library, Archives and Information Science]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | publisher = University of Florence | doi = 10.4403/jlis.it-4663 | url = http://leo.cilea.it/index.php/jlis/article/view/4663 | accessdate = 29 June 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130616093855/http://leo.cilea.it/index.php/jlis/article/view/4663 | archivedate = 16 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Library operation has for decades been a key topic in efforts toward [[international standardization]].

=== In museums ===
Metadata in a museum context is the information that trained cultural documentation specialists, such as [[archivist]]s, [[librarian]]s, museum [[registrar (museum)|registrar]]s and [[curator]]s, create to index, structure, describe, identify, or otherwise specify works of art, architecture, cultural objects and their images.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zange |first=Charles S. |date=31 January 2015 |title=Community makers, major museums, and the Keet S'aaxw: Learning about the role of museums in interpreting cultural objects |url=http://mw2015.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/community-makers-major-museums-and-the-keet-saaxw-learning-about-the-role-of-museums-in-interpreting-cultural-objects/ |publisher=Museums and the Web |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104005603/http://mw2015.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/community-makers-major-museums-and-the-keet-saaxw-learning-about-the-role-of-museums-in-interpreting-cultural-objects/ |archivedate=4 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cataloging cultural objects: a guide to describing cultural works and their images.

==== Usage ====
Metadata is developed and applied within collecting institutions and museums in order to:
* Facilitate resource discovery and execute search queries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Create digital archives that store information relating to various aspects of museum collections and cultural objects, and serves for archival and managerial purposes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Provide public audiences access to cultural objects through publishing digital content online.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Standards ====
Many museums and cultural heritage centers recognize that given the diversity of art works and cultural objects, no single model or standard suffices to describe and catalogue cultural works.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, a sculpted Indigenous artifact could be classified as an artwork, an archaeological artifact, or an Indigenous heritage item. The early stages of standardization in archiving, description and cataloging within the museum community began in the late 1990s with the development of standards such as [[Categories for the Description of Works of Art]] (CDWA), Spectrum, [[CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model]] (CRM), [[Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO)]] and the [[CDWA Lite XML schema]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These standards use [[HTML]] and [[XML]] markup languages for machine processing, publication and implementation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules]] (AACR), originally developed for characterizing books, have also been applied to cultural objects, works of art and architecture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Standards, such as the CCO, are integrated within a Museum's [[Collections Management System]] (CMS), a database through which museums are able to manage their collections, acquisitions, loans and conservation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Scholars and professionals in the field note that the "quickly evolving landscape of standards and technologies" create challenges for cultural documentarians, specifically non-technically trained professionals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linked Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums: How to Clean, Link and Publish Your Metadata|last=Hooland|first=Seth Van|last2=Verborgh|first2=Ruben|publisher=Facet|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Most collecting institutions and museums use a [[relational database]] to categorize cultural works and their images.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Relational databases and metadata work to document and describe the complex relationships amongst cultural objects and multi-faceted works of art, as well as between objects and places, people and artistic movements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Relational database structures are also beneficial within collecting institutions and museums because they allow for archivists to make a clear distinction between cultural objects and their images; an unclear distinction could lead to confusing and inaccurate searches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Cultural objects and art works ====
An object's materiality, function and purpose, as well as the size (e.g., measurements, such as height, width, weight), storage requirements (e.g., climate-controlled environment) and focus of the museum and collection, influence the descriptive depth of the data attributed to the object by cultural documentarians.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The established institutional cataloging practices, goals and expertise of cultural documentarians and database structure also influence the information ascribed to cultural objects, and the ways in which cultural objects are categorized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, museums often employ standardized commercial collection management software that prescribes and limits the ways in which archivists can describe artworks and cultural objects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As well, collecting institutions and museums use [[Controlled vocabulary|Controlled Vocabularies]] to describe cultural objects and artworks in their collections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Getty Vocabularies]] and the [[Library of Congress controlled vocabularies|Library of Congress Controlled Vocabularies]] are reputable within the museum community and are recommended by CCO standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Museums are encouraged to use controlled vocabularies that are contextual and relevant to their collections and enhance the functionality of their digital information systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Controlled Vocabularies are beneficial within databases because they provide a high level of consistency, improving resource retrieval.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Metadata structures, including controlled vocabularies, reflect the [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] of the systems from which they were created. Often the processes through which cultural objects are described and categorized through metadata in museums do not reflect the perspectives of the maker communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Srinivasan |first=Ramesh |date=December 2006 |title=Indigenous, ethnic and cultural articulations of new media |url=http://ics.sagepub.com/content/9/4/497.abstract |journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies |volume=9 |issue=4 |doi=10.1177/1367877906069899 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018023354/http://ics.sagepub.com/content/9/4/497.abstract |archivedate=18 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Museums and the Internet ====
Metadata has been instrumental in the creation of digital information systems and archives within museums, and has made it easier for museums to publish digital content online. This has enabled audiences who might not have had access to cultural objects due to geographic or economic barriers to have access to them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the 2000s, as more museums have adopted archival standards and created intricate databases, discussions about [[Linked data|Linked Data]] between museum databases have come up in the museum, archival and library science communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Collection Management Systems (CMS) and [[Digital asset management|Digital Asset Management]] tools can be local or shared systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Digital humanities|Digital Humanities]] scholars note many benefits of interoperability between museum databases and collections, while also acknowledging the difficulties achieving such interoperability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Document metadata have proven particularly important in legal environments in which litigation has requested metadata, which can include sensitive information detrimental to a certain party in court. Using [[metadata removal tool]]s to "clean" or redact documents can mitigate the risks of unwittingly sending sensitive data. This process partially (see [[data remanence]]) protects law firms from potentially damaging leaking of sensitive data through [[electronic discovery]].

In Australia, the need to strengthen national security has resulted in the introduction of a new metadata storage law.&lt;ref&gt;Senate passes controversial metadata laws&lt;/ref&gt; This new law means that both security and policing agencies will be allowed to access up to two years of an individual's metadata, with the aim of making it easier to stop any terrorist attacks and serious crimes from happening.

=== In legislation ===

legislative metadata has been the subject of some discussion in [https://public.resource.org/law.gov/ law.gov] forums such as workshops held by the [[Legal Information Institute]] at the [[Cornell Law School]] on March 22 and 23, 2010. The documentation for these forums are titled, "Suggested metadata practices for legislation and regulations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wiki/lexcraft/suggested_metadata_practices_for_legislation_and_regulations|title=Suggested metadata practices for legislation and regulations|last=|first=|date=|website=Legal Information Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A handful of key points have been outlined by these discussions, section headings of which are listed as follows:

=== In healthcare ===
Australian medical research pioneered the definition of metadata for applications in health care. That approach offers the first recognized attempt to adhere to international standards in medical sciences instead of defining a proprietary standard under the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) umbrella. The medical community yet did not approve the need to follow metadata standards despite research that supported these standards.&lt;ref&gt;M. Löbe, M. Knuth, R.

=== In biomedical research ===
Research studies in the fields of [[biomedicine]] and [[molecular biology]] frequently yield large quantities of data, including results of [[genome]] or [[Metagenomics|meta-genome]] [[sequencing]], [[proteomics]] data, and even notes or plans created during the course of research itself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myneni|first=Sahiti|last2=Patel|first2=Vimla L.|date=2010-06-01|title=Organization of Biomedical Data for Collaborative Scientific Research: A Research Information Management System|journal=International Journal of Information Management|volume=30|issue=3|pages=256–264|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2009.09.005|issn=0268-4012|pmc=2882303|pmid=20543892}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The products of biomedical research are generally realized as peer-reviewed manuscripts and these publications are yet another source of data. Metadata for biomedical publications is often created by journal publishers and citation databases such as [[PubMed]] and [[Web of Science]]. The data contained within manuscripts or accompanying them as supplementary material is less often subject to metadata creation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evangelou|first=Evangelos|last2=Trikalinos|first2=Thomas A.|last3=Ioannidis|first3=John P.A.|date=2005|title=Unavailability of online supplementary scientific information from articles published in major journals|journal=The FASEB Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=14|pages=1943–1944|doi=10.1096/fj.05-4784lsf|pmid=16319137|issn=0892-6638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AlQuraishi|first=Mohammed|last2=Sorger|first2=Peter K.|date=2016-05-18|title=Reproducibility will only come with data liberation|url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/339/339ed7|journal=Science Translational Medicine|language=en|volume=8|issue=339|pages=339ed7|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf0968|issn=1946-6234|pmc=5084089|pmid=27194726}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though they may be submitted to biomedical databases after publication.

=== Data Warehousing ===
A [[data warehouse]] (DW) is a repository of an organization's electronically stored data. Data warehouses are designed to manage and store the data. Data warehouses differ from [[business intelligence]] (BI) systems, because BI systems are designed to use data to create reports and analyze the information, to provide strategic guidance to management.&lt;ref&gt;Inmon, W.H. Tech Topic: What is a Data Warehouse? Prism Solutions. Volume 1. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Metadata is an important tool in how data is stored in data warehouses. The purpose of a data warehouse is to house standardized, structured, consistent, integrated, correct, "cleaned" and timely data, extracted from various operational systems in an organization. The extracted data are integrated in the data warehouse environment to provide an enterprise-wide perspective. Data are structured in a way to serve the reporting and analytic requirements. The design of structural metadata commonality using a [[data modeling]] method such as [[entity relationship model]] diagramming is important in any data warehouse development effort. They detail metadata on each piece of data in the data warehouse. An essential component of a [[data warehouse]]/[[business intelligence]] system is the metadata and tools to manage and retrieve the metadata. [[Ralph Kimball]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} describes metadata as the DNA of the data warehouse as metadata defines the elements of the [[data warehouse]] and how they work together.

[[Ralph Kimball|Kimball]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimball|2008|pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to three main categories of metadata: Technical metadata, business metadata and process metadata. Technical metadata is primarily [[definition|definitional]], while business metadata and process metadata is primarily [[description|descriptive]]. The categories sometimes overlap.
* '''Technical metadata''' defines the objects and processes in a DW/BI system, as seen from a technical point of view. The technical metadata includes the system metadata, which defines the data structures such as tables, fields, data types, indexes and partitions in the relational engine, as well as databases, dimensions, measures, and data mining models. Technical metadata defines the data model and the way it is displayed for the users, with the reports, schedules, distribution lists, and user security rights.
* '''Business metadata''' is content from the data warehouse described in more user-friendly terms. The business metadata tells you what data you have, where they come from, what they mean and what their relationship is to other data in the data warehouse. Business metadata may also serve as a documentation for the DW/BI system. Users who browse the data warehouse are primarily viewing the business metadata.
* '''Process metadata''' is used to describe the results of various operations in the data warehouse. Within the [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] process, all key data from tasks is logged on execution. This includes start time, end time, CPU seconds used, disk reads, disk writes, and rows processed. When troubleshooting the ETL or [[Information retrieval|query]] process, this sort of data becomes valuable. Process metadata is the fact measurement when building and using a DW/BI system. Some organizations make a living out of collecting and selling this sort of data to companies - in that case the process metadata becomes the business metadata for the fact and dimension tables. Collecting process metadata is in the interest of business people who can use the data to identify the users of their products, which products they are using, and what level of service they are receiving.

=== On the Internet ===
The [[HTML]] format used to define web pages allows for the inclusion of a variety of types of metadata, from basic descriptive text, dates and keywords to further advanced metadata schemes such as the [[Dublin Core]], [[e-GMS]], and AGLS&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Australia, AGLS Metadata Standard, accessed 7 January 2010, {{cite web |url=http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/create-capture-describe/describe/AGLS/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054051/http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/create-capture-describe/describe/AGLS/index.aspx |archivedate=10 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; standards. Pages can also be [[geotagging|geotagged]] with [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]]. Metadata may be included in the page's header or in a separate file. [[Microformat]]s allow metadata to be added to on-page data in a way that regular web users do not see, but computers, [[web crawler]]s and [[search engine]]s can readily access. Many search engines are cautious about using metadata in their ranking algorithms due to exploitation of metadata and the practice of search engine optimization, [[Search engine optimization|SEO]], to improve rankings. See [[Meta element]] article for further discussion. This cautious attitude may be justified as people, according to Doctorow,&lt;ref&gt;Metacrap: Putting the torch to seven straw-men of the meta-utopia {{cite web |url=http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508200721/http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm |archivedate=8 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; are not executing care and diligence when creating their own metadata and that metadata is part of a competitive environment where the metadata is used to promote the metadata creators own purposes.

=== In broadcast industry ===
In [[broadcast]] industry, metadata is linked to audio and video [[broadcast media]] to:
* ''identify'' the media: [[Media clip|clip]] or [[playlist]] names, duration, [[timecode]], etc.
* ''describe'' the content: notes regarding the quality of video content, rating, description (for example, during a sport event, [[Index term|keywords]] like ''goal'', ''red card'' will be associated to some clips)
* ''classify'' media: metadata allows producers to sort the media or to easily and quickly find a video content (a [[TV news]] could urgently need some [[archiving|archive content]] for a subject). For example, the BBC have a large subject classification system, [[Lonclass]], a customized version of the more general-purpose [[Universal Decimal Classification]].

This metadata can be linked to the video media thanks to the [[Video server#Broadcast automation|video servers]]. Most major broadcast sport events like [[FIFA World Cup]] or the [[Olympic Games]] use this metadata to distribute their video content to [[TV station]]s through [[Index term|keywords]]. It is often the host broadcaster&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbs.tv/hostbroadcasting/ |title=HBS is the FIFA host broadcaster |publisher=Hbs.tv |date=2011-08-06 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117194534/http://www.hbs.tv/hostbroadcasting/ |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is in charge of organizing metadata through its ''International Broadcast Centre'' and its video servers. This metadata is recorded with the images and are entered by metadata operators (''loggers'') who associate in live metadata available in ''metadata grids'' through [[software]] (such as [[Multicam(LSM)]] or [[IPDirector]] used during the FIFA World Cup or Olympic Games).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evs-global.com/01/MyDocuments/CS_BOB_EVScontributon_0808_ENG.pdf |title=Host Broadcast Media Server and Related Applications |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102235256/http://www.evs-global.com/01/MyDocuments/CS_BOB_EVScontributon_0808_ENG.pdf |archivedate=2 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/worldcup/fifa-world-cup-techonlogy-0610/ |title=logs during sport events |publisher=Broadcastengineering.com |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116191929/http://broadcastengineering.com/worldcup/fifa-world-cup-techonlogy-0610/ |archivedate=16 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geospatial ===
Metadata that describes geographic objects in electronic storage or format (such as datasets, maps, features, or documents with a geospatial component) has a history dating back to at least 1994 (refer [https://web.archive.org/web/20061018013240/http://libraries.mit.edu/guides/subjects/metadata/standards/fgdc.html MIT Library page on FGDC Metadata]). This class of metadata is described more fully on the [[geospatial metadata]] article.

=== Ecological and environmental ===
Ecological and environmental metadata is intended to document the "who, what, when, where, why, and how" of data collection for a particular study. This typically means which organization or institution collected the data, what type of data, which date(s) the data was collected, the rationale for the data collection, and the methodology used for the data collection. Metadata should be generated in a format commonly used by the most relevant science community, such as [[Darwin Core]], [[Ecological Metadata Language]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml/eml-2.0.1/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423161141/http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml/eml-2.0.1/index.html|date=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Dublin Core]]. Metadata editing tools exist to facilitate metadata generation (e.g. Metavist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metavist.djames.net/ |title=Metavist 2 |publisher=Metavist.djames.net |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821202734/http://metavist.djames.net/ |archivedate=21 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercury: Metadata Search System]], Morpho&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp |title=KNB Data :: Morpho |publisher=Knb.ecoinformatics.org |date=2009-05-20 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113143228/http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Metadata should describe [[data provenance|provenance]] of the data (where they originated, as well as any transformations the data underwent) and how to give credit for (cite) the data products.

=== Digital music ===
When first released in 1982, Compact Discs only contained a Table Of Contents (TOC) with the number of tracks on the disc and their length in samples.[http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32801641/Morris_2012_-_Making_Music_Behave.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1477195681&amp;Signature=2TLmhapcR0M5eYsfMQ8FgG2TZa0%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMaking_music_behave_Metadata_and_the_dig.pdf]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkIaGZ0HWcMC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Fourteen years later in 1996, a revision of the [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Red Book]] standard added [[CD-Text]] to carry additional metadata.[http://web.ncf.ca/aa571/cdtext.htm] But CD-Text was not widely adopted. Shortly thereafter, it became common for personal computers to retrieve metadata from external sources (e.g. [[CDDB]], [[Gracenote]]) based on the TOC.

Digital [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] formats such as [[digital audio file]]s superseded music formats such as [[cassette tape]]s and [[CDs]] in the 2000s. Digital audio files could be labelled with more information than could be contained in just the file name. That descriptive information is called the '''audio tag''' or audio metadata in general. Computer programs specializing in adding or modifying this information are called [[tag editor]]s. Metadata can be used to name, describe, catalogue and indicate ownership or copyright for a digital audio file, and its presence makes it much easier to locate a specific audio file within a group, typically through use of a search engine that accesses the metadata. As different digital audio formats were developed, attempts were made to standardize a specific location within the digital files where this information could be stored.

As a result, almost all digital audio formats, including [[mp3]], broadcast wav and [[AIFF]] files, have similar standardized locations that can be populated with metadata. The metadata for compressed and uncompressed digital music is often encoded in the [[ID3]] tag. Common editors such as [[TagLib]] support MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MPC, Speex, WavPack TrueAudio, WAV, AIFF, MP4, and ASF file formats.

=== Cloud applications ===
With the availability of [[Cloud computing|cloud]] applications, which include those to add metadata to content, metadata is increasingly available over the Internet.

== Administration and management ==

=== Storage ===
Metadata can be stored either ''internally'',&lt;ref name=id3&gt;{{cite web
 |first       = Dan
 |last        = O'Neill
 |url         = http://id3.org
 |title       = ID3.org

 |df          = dmy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same file or structure as the data (this is also called ''embedded metadata''), or ''externally'', in a separate file or field from the described data. A data repository typically stores the metadata ''detached'' from the data, but can be designed to support embedded metadata approaches. Each option has advantages and disadvantages:
* Internal storage means metadata always travels as part of the data they describe; thus, metadata is always available with the data, and can be manipulated locally. This method creates redundancy (precluding normalization), and does not allow managing all of a system's metadata in one place. It arguably increases consistency, since the metadata is readily changed whenever the data is changed.
* External storage allows collocating metadata for all the contents, for example in a database, for more efficient searching and management. Redundancy can be avoided by normalizing the metadata's organization. In this approach, metadata can be united with the content when information is transferred, for example in [[Streaming media]]; or can be referenced (for example, as a web link) from the transferred content. On the down side, the division of the metadata from the data content, especially in standalone files that refer to their source metadata elsewhere, increases the opportunities for misalignments between the two, as changes to either may not be reflected in the other.

Metadata can be stored in either human-readable or binary form. Storing metadata in a human-readable format such as [[XML]] can be useful because users can understand and edit it without specialized tools.&lt;ref name=Sutter&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, text-based formats are rarely optimized for storage capacity, communication time, or processing speed. A binary metadata format enables efficiency in all these respects, but requires special software to convert the binary information into human-readable content.

=== Database management ===
Each relational database system has its own mechanisms for storing metadata. Examples of relational-database metadata include:
* Tables of all tables in a database, their names, sizes, and number of rows in each table.
* Tables of columns in each database, what tables they are used in, and the type of data stored in each column.
In database terminology, this set of metadata is referred to as the [[database catalog|catalog]]. The [[SQL]] standard specifies a uniform means to access the catalog, called the [[information schema]], but not all databases implement it, even if they implement other aspects of the SQL standard. For an example of database-specific metadata access methods, see [[Oracle metadata]]. Programmatic access to metadata is possible using APIs such as [[JDBC]], or SchemaCrawler.&lt;ref name=schemacrawler&gt;{{cite web

==In popular culture==

One of the first satirical examinations of the concept of Metadata as we understand it today is American Science Fiction author [[Hal Draper]]'s short story, [[MS_Fnd_in_a_Lbry]] (1961).
Here, the knowledge of all Mankind is condensed into an object the size of a desk drawer, however the magnitude of the metadata (e.g. catalog of catalogs of... , as well as indexes and histories) eventually leads to dire yet humorous consequence for the human race.
The story prefigures the modern consequences of allowing metadata to become more important than the real data it is concerned with, and the risks inherent in that eventuality as a cautionary tale.

The '''National Numismatic Collection''' is the national coin [[Cabinet (room)|cabinet]] of the [[United States]]. The collection is part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]].

==Overview==
The National Numismatic Collection is one of the world's largest collections of coins, paper currency, [[exonumia]] and related items. In total the collection contains over 1.6 million objects, including 450,000 coins, medals and decorations and 1.1 million pieces of paper money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/numismatics/ |title=The National Numismatic Collection |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant part of the collection came from the [[Chase Manhattan Bank Money Museum]] after it closed in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;http://numismatics.org/authority/chase_manhattan_bank_money_museum Retrieved 7 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Until 2004, the exhibit housing the Collection was the last surviving exhibit from the Smithsonian Museum of American History's original 1964 arrangement.  In late 2004, the exhibit was closed, and the Collection returned to the Smithsonian's vaults.  Only a few dozen of the Collection's most notable specimens remain on display today.

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

The '''National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands''' ({{lang-nl|Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging in Nederland}}, {{IPA-nl|nɑtsjoːˈnaːl soːʃaːˈlɪstisə bəˈʋeːɣɪŋ ɪn ˈneːdərlɑnt}}, NSB) was a [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[fascist]] and later [[Nazism|national socialist]] [[political party]]. As a parliamentary party participating in legislative elections, the NSB had some success during the 1930s. It remained the only legal party in the Netherlands during most of the [[Netherlands in World War II|Second World War]].

==Party history==
===1931–40===
The NSB was founded in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1931 during a period when several [[nationalist]], fascist and national socialist parties were founded. The founders were [[Anton Mussert]], who became the party's leader, and [[Cornelis van Geelkerken]]. The party based its program on Italian fascism and German national socialism, however unlike the latter before 1936 the party was not [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] and even had Jewish members.

In 1933, after a year of building an organization, the party organized its first public meeting, a ''[[Landtag|Landdag]]'' in Utrecht which was attended by 600 party militants. Here the party presented itself. After that the party's support began to grow. In the same year the government forbade civil servants to be members of the NSB.

In the provincial elections of 1935 the party gained 8 percent of the votes and two seats in the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]]. This result was achieved against the background of the economic hardship of the [[Great Depression]]. Mussert's image as a reliable politician and his pragmatism allowed him to unite the different types of fascism and contributed to the party's success. This was bolstered by the party's strong organization and its political strategy, which was not oriented towards violent revolution but a democratic legal take over of the country. By 1936 the party had begun holding annual mass meetings near [[Lunteren]] in Gelderland, and in 1938 it built the [[Muur van Mussert]] there, a wall which was supposed to be one element in a set of buildings and monuments inspired by the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] in [[Nuremberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cult.tpo.nl/2015/12/03/mini-docu-de-muur-van-mussert/|title=Mini-docu: De Muur van Mussert|last=Paternotte|first=Bas|date=3 December 2015|publisher=ThePostOnline|language=Dutch|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, under influence of [[Meinoud Rost van Tonningen]] the party became openly anti-semitic. Rost van Tonningen began to question Mussert's leadership with support of the German [[Nazi Party]], raising internal divisions within the party. This led to decreased support for the party and a strong [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] reaction of the political parties, trade unions and churches. In the [[Dutch general election, 1937|1937 general elections]] the party gained only 4 percent of the votes and four seats in the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]], however it increased its representation in the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] to five seats. In parliament the NSB MPs showed little respect for parliamentary procedures and rules. Many NSB MPs were called to order by the chairman of parliament for physical and verbal violence. In the provincial election of 1939 the party also gained 4 percent of the votes.

===1940–45===
After the [[Second World War]] broke out, the NSB sympathized with the Germans and advocated strict neutrality for the Netherlands. In May 1940, 800 NSB members and sympathizers were put in custody by the Dutch government,&lt;ref&gt;Jong 1956, p73.&lt;/ref&gt; after the German invasion. Soon after the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Dutch defeat]] on 14 May 1940, they were set free by German troops. In June 1940, Mussert delivered a speech in [[Lunteren]] in which he called for the Netherlands to embrace the Germans and renounce the [[Dutch Monarchy]], which had fled to London.

In 1940 the German occupation government had outlawed all socialist and communist parties; in 1941 it forbade all parties, except for the NSB. The NSB openly collaborated with the occupation forces. Its membership grew to about 100,000. The NSB played an important role in lower government and civil service; every new mayor appointed by the German occupation government was a member of the NSB. On the national level, Mussert had expected he would be made leader of an independent Dutch state allied to Germany; in reality, however, the Austrian national socialist [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] was in charge of an occupation government. Mussert had several meetings with [[Adolf Hitler]] in which he pleaded for an independent Netherlands, but he was unsuccessful. Although Seyss-Inquart had proposed that Mussert should be made [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]], he was only given the honorary title 'Leader of the Dutch People', and he was allowed to build a marginal State Secretariat, but he was given little or no actual power. His influence in the party waned at the expense of Rost van Tonningen and other more pro-German members. Beginning in the summer of 1943, many male members of the NSB were organized in the [[34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Landstorm Nederland|Landwacht]], which helped the government control the population.

On 4 September 1944, the Allied forces conquered [[Antwerp]] and the NSB expected the fall of the Netherlands to come soon. On 5 September, most of the NSB's leadership fled to Germany and the party's organization fell apart, on what is known as ''Dolle Dinsdag'' (Mad Tuesday).

After the German signing of surrender on 6 May 1945, the NSB was outlawed. Mussert was arrested the following day. Many of the members of the NSB were arrested, but only a few were convicted. Mussert was executed on 7 May 1946.

There were no attempts to continue the organization illegally.

{{Nazism sidebar}}

==Ideology and issues==
The NSB started out as a classical fascist party, which based itself on the principles of [[Führerprinzip|leadership]]. It wanted a fascist state with a compliant government, fascist order and state control. It put the "national interest" above the individual interest and the interest of social groups, ([[pillarization|pillars]]) that had characterized Dutch society. The party was anti-parliamentary and authoritarian. Its program, which was modeled on the program of the German Nazi Party, lacked reference to [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] or [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racist ideology]] of the Nazi Party. After 1936, under the influence of [[Meinoud Rost van Tonningen]], the party became more oriented towards the Nazi Party and took over its anti-semitic and racist ideas. It also began to sympathize with the aggressive foreign policy of Italy and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFcJZHow9pEC&amp;lpg=PA420&amp;ots=6b1sUWv0E5&amp;pg=PA420|title=The Nazi Party 1919-1945: A Complete History|first=Dietrich|last=Orlow|pages=420–422|publisher=[[Enigma Books]]|location=New York|year=2010|isbn=978-0-9824911-9-5|accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical demands of the NSB were: abolition of [[universal suffrage|individual voting rights]], [[corporatism]], a duty to work and serve in the army, limits on the freedom of the press, laws against [[strike (action)|strikes]]. It demanded a reunification of the Netherlands with [[Flanders]] and [[French Flanders]] in a [[Greater Netherlands]], which would also control a large colonial empire consisting of [[Belgian Congo]], [[Dutch East Indies]] and perhaps [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kroener|first1=Bernhard R.|last2=Müller|first2=Rolf-Dieter|last3=Umbreit|first3=Hans|title=Germany and the Second World War:Organization and mobilization of the German sphere of power. Wartime administration, economy, and manpower resources 1939-1941|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2000|page=390|isbn=0-19-822887-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This state would not be a part of Germany, but only an independent loyal ally to Germany.

==Rituals and symbols==
The NSB copied elements of the Italian Fascists and German Nazis. Like Mussolini's Fascists, the NSB uniforms included black shirts, and the Party adopted the Fascist salute. Since 1933 it used the salute "Hou Zee!", which, Anton Mussert said, connoted courage and referred to the glorious maritime history of the [[Dutch Republic]]. It also began using titles like ''Leider'' for Mussert (Leader; similar to [[Duce]] or [[Führer]]), ''Kameraad'' for men (comrade) and ''Kameraadske'' ('comradess', a [[neologism]]) for women. One party slogan was "Mussert or Moscow", evoking the Fascist defense against supposed Communist subversion.&lt;ref&gt;"Mussert, Anton" in ''Current Biography 1941'', p621.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Party later adopted the Nazi red and black colors and the [[swastika]] symbol, the original NSB flag used the [[Prince's Flag]]. A blue ''[[wolfsangel]]'' (a hooked symbol of a wolf trap) on a white disc was set against an orange field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fotw.net/flags/nl%7Dnsb.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership and support==
This table shows the results of the NSB in elections to the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] (lower house), the Senate, the States-Provincial, and the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter, is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election, these posts are normally taken by the party's leader. The membership of NSB is also represented. The House of Representatives then had 100 members.

===Municipal and provincial government===
Before 1940 the NSB held seats in [[States-Provincial|provincial]] and [[gemeenteraad|municipal legislatures]], but did not cooperate in any governments. After 1940 these legislatures stopped functioning and the NSB's role in local and provincial legislatures expanded. All newly appointed mayors were member of the NSB.

The following figure shows the election results of the provincial elections of 1935 and 1939, per province. It shows the areas where the NSB was strong, namely in South Holland, North Holland and Gelderland. The NSB was the strongest in Drenthe and Limburg. In 1935, it became the second largest party in Limburg. The party was weaker in Friesland, North Brabant and Zeeland.

In 1939, on the eve of the Second World War, the party lost nearly half of its provincial seats.

==Electorate==
The NSB drew its main support from the [[middle class]]: civil servants, farmers, business people and soldiers supported the party. Most of these people were not part of the strong pillarized organisations surrounding the socialist unions, and the [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Churches, instead they were often a loose member of the weaker liberal [[pillarization|pillar]], which was very diverse. The NSB party scored particularly well in [[Drenthe]], [[Gelderland]] and the towns of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] at the border with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].

==Party members==
Historians [[Lou de Jong]] and A.A. de Jonge have characterized NSB members as socially isolated opportunists who were motivated to join the NSB through a mix of opportunism, idealism and social connections.&lt;ref&gt;Josje Damsma, and Erik Schumacher, "De strijd om Amsterdam," ''[[BMGN|Bijdragen en Mededelingen betreffende de Geschiedenis der Nederlanden]]'' (2009) 124#3, pp 329-348&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
===Organizational structure===
The party was organized with Mussert serving as [[Partijvoorzitter|party chair]] and political leader. From September 1940 until its dissolution, Carolus Josephus Huygen served as Secretary General of the party. Yearly the party organized a ''[[landtag|Landdag]]'', where Mussert held a political speech.

===Associated organisations===
The NSB was surrounded by several party organizations. It published a weekly newspaper, ''[[Volk en Vaderland]]'' ("People and Fatherland"). Between 1931 and 1935 the party had its own paramilitary organization, the black uniformed ''[[Weerbaarheidsafdeling]]'' (WA), similar to the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' of the Nazi Party. It was refounded in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021622/detail_no_jsp_action_detail_imid_78393.html|title=De WA (Weerbaarheidsafdeling) van de NSB|work=[[Europeana]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also founded its own youth organization, ''[[Nationale Jeugdstorm]]'' (Youthstorm); a farmers' organization; and a daily newspaper, ''Het Nationale Dagblad'' (The National Daily).

In 1940 the NSB formed the [[Nederlandsche SS]] (Dutch SS), it had up to 7,000 members.

The term "NSB'er" has become synonymous with traitor in the Netherlands, and is used as an insult, especially in the context of ratting somebody out to authorities.

A grim joke after World War II, made by Dutch Resistance fighters, is that former NSB members insisted that their acronym actually stood for "Niet So [zo] Bedoeld" or "I didn't mean it" as they attempted to downplay their treachery.

NSBHouZeeDenHaag1941.jpg|HouZee&lt;br /&gt;(The Hague 1941)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Relationships to other parties===
The NSB was methodically isolated by other parties. Before the war the socialist [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] and ''[[Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen]]'' (Dutch Association of Trade Unions) coordinated counter-demonstrations and propaganda with a separate organization 'Freedom, Labour and Bread'.

'''PADICAT''' acronym for ''Patrimoni Digital de Catalunya'', in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; or Digital Heritage of [[Catalonia]], in English, is the [[Web archiving|Web Archive]] of Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.padicat.cat/en Official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Created in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Biblioteca de Catalunya |year=2005 |title= Memòria del plantejament del projecte PADICAT (Patrimoni Digital de Catalunya) |publisher=Biblioteca de Catalunya |publication-place=Barcelona |page= |url=http://www.recercat.net/handle/2072/1757 |accessdate=2012-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[National Library of Catalonia|Biblioteca de Catalunya]], the public institution responsible for collecting, preserving and distributing the bibliographic heritage, and the digital heritage by extension. Has the technological collaboration of the [[Center for Scientific and Academic Services of Catalonia]], (CESCA) for preserving and giving access to old versions of web pages published on the [[Internet]]. The Biblioteca de Catalunya, as the responsible of PADICAT, is member of the [[International Internet Preservation Consortium]] (IIPC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://netpreserve.org International Internet Preservation Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:D. padicat.jpg|thumbnail|PADICAT website 2011]]
PADICAT was born in 2005 following the trend of other [[National library|national libraries]] on web archives creation, and as an answer to the publication of the guidelines for the preservation of digital heritage&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= National Library of Australia |year=2003 |title= Guidelines for the preservation of digital heritage |publisher=UNESCO |publication-place=Canberra |page= |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001300/130071s.pdf |accessdate=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[UNESCO]]. There are many [[List of Web archiving initiatives|web archives running]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Llueca |first=Ciro |year=2005 |title= Webs sempre accessibles : les biblioteques nacionals i els dipòsits digitals nacionals |publisher= BiD: textos universitaris de biblioteconomia i documentació |publication-place= |page= |url= http://www2.ub.edu/bid/consulta_articulos.php?fichero=15lluec1.htm |accessdate=2012-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous began in 1996: the Swedish Kulturarw3;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.se/english/find/internet/websites/ Kulturarw3]&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian [[Pandora Archive|Pandora]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/ Pandora]&lt;/ref&gt; and the most popular repository, [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/index.php Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The analysis of these and other projects, made way to the planning of PADICAT project, following the common trend around the world of a hybrid model of functioning, complementing the regular capture of a whole geographical domain ([[.cat]] domain in this case), with selective actions, and expand these coverage to different social events that generate an intense activity in the network ([[Election|electoral campaigns]], for instance) or with thematic packages ([[museum]]s of Catalonia, Catalan [[Folk rock|folk-rock]] on the web, etc.). PADICAT complements all this with users contributions through the recommended webs.

In June 2005, the Biblioteca de Catalunya started the preliminary phase, of planning, in which a projects analysis was performed about existing resources, agents involved in production of web pages of Catalonia and legal issues that determine practices that want to do.

Based on parameters defined by the Biblioteca de Catalunya, on July 21, 2006, began to collect automatically websites likely to be part of the digital heritage of Catalonia. On September 11, 2006, coinciding with celebration of [[National Day of Catalonia]], PADICAT website was opened to the public, with about thirty web pages stored.

The 2006–08 period represents production phase, project plan pilot, PADICAT operation phase: systematic capture of web pages of Catalonia.

The 2009–2011 period, Biblioteca de Catalunya should be in an optimum position, whereby this system -a pioneer in [[Spain]] and a benchmark in [[Europe]]- operates at full capacity. Furthermore, have reached cooperation agreements with more than 450 institutions of all kinds and has warranted online open access to all collection.
On September 11, 2011, coinciding again with the National Day of Catalonia and with the fifth anniversary of its website, PADICAT has opened a new website version to access all deposited contents.

In November 2012, PADICAT has preserved 58,122 webs, 249.609 crawls, 349 million files and 13 [[Terabyte|TB]] of disk space. All of them are freely available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.padicat.cat/en/about-us/crawled-web-sites PADICAT]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission and functioning ==

=== Mission and objectives ===

The mission of PADICAT is to harvest, to process and to provide access to digital heritage of Catalonia born on the Internet.
Its objectives are:

* Massive compilation of [[.cat]] domain, thanks to the agreement with the [[Fundació puntCat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.padicat.cat/en/about-us/news-and-dissemination/news/cooperation-agreement-between-biblioteca-de-catalunya-and Cooperation agreement between the Biblioteca de Catalunya and fundació puntCAT, for the preservation of web pages, has been signed]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Systematic archiving of the web site production of Catalan organizations and companies.
* Promote lines of research through themed integration of digital resources related to specific events in Catalan public life, like [[political campaign]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Llueca |first=Ciro |last2=Cócera |first2=Daniel |last3=Torres |first3=Natàlia|year=2012 |title=A ritmo de tweet: archivando elecciones 2.0  |publisher= El profesional de la información |publication-place= |page= |url= http://www.padicat.cat/sites/default/files/ponencies/309-314.pdf |accessdate=2012-11-21 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Internet, online music phenomenon, or museums on the Internet.

After its birth (2005-2006), growth (2007-2008) and consolidation (2009-2011) phases, since 2012 is wanted to systematize its capacity for growth, with the goal of incorporating 75.700 versions of about 32.000 web sites per year, from:

* A biannual compilation from 30.000 domain .cat resources.
* A biannual compilation from 550 resources from more than 450 organizations with a cooperation agreement.
* A biannual compilation from the resources that users have recommended.
* A daily compilation  from a substantial part of 30 online serial publications.

In addition, there are four permanent work areas:

* Defining preservation strategies for the digital heritage born on the Internet. PADICAT provides periodic reports about Catalan web sites; it detects which formats are having illegibility problems; and identifies the most used languages, etc.
* Promoting lines of research by creating monographic collections with involvement of experts from every subject.
* Creating and maintaining a digital serials archive through the systematized capture of digital serials of Internet. Now, it consists of a representative sample about the kind and contents, selected among born digital, without analogical equivalent.
* Cooperating with other web archives, libraries, archives and museums, for giving an efficient answer to challenges on digital preservation and access into its resources.

=== Functioning ===

==== Software ====
[[File:Software ca.png|thumbnail|PADICAT software workflow schema]]
PADICAT is a system based on the implementation of several [[software]] that allow web pages to be collected, stored, organized, preserved and permanently accessed. Later to analysis phase and software test was determined that be used [[Heritrix]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Heritrix;jsessionid=6A591A4367120A974E1B0AD217FD354A Heritrix]&lt;/ref&gt; software, applied in most capture of digital resources projects. This is a software charge to compile web pages as the user sees when surf the Internet and store it in compressed files with [[ARC (file format)|ARC]] or [[Web ARChive|WARC]] extension. Then, Heritrix software is complemented by NutchWax,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/nutch/ NutcWax]&lt;/ref&gt; or by combination with [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hadoop.apache.org/ Hadoop]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wayback Machine|Wayback]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/wayback/ Wayback]&lt;/ref&gt; doing an indexing process to compiled information that will permit use these index for localize collection resources from query interfaces: Wera,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/projects/wera/ Wera]&lt;/ref&gt; that permits search from keywords through generated indexes by NutchWax; and Wayback, that lets consult by [[Uniform resource locator|URL]] in generated indexes by Hadoop and same Wayback.

Has been used Web Curator Tool&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/ Web Curator Tool]&lt;/ref&gt; software, developed by [[National Library of New Zealand]] and [[British Library]], as a document management system that permits allocate metadata to a significant part of collection, in order to integrate, in future, funds of deposit to search in other catalogs, from the Biblioteca de Catalunya or other institutions. Nowadays, websites are being cataloged through CAT,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Llueca |first=Ciro |last2=Cócera |first2=Daniel |last3=Torresa |first3=Natàlia|year=2010 |title= CAT (Curator Archiving Tool): improving access to web archives = CAT (Curator Archiving Tool): millorant l'accés als arxius web = CAT (Curator Archiving Tool): mejorando el acceso a los archivos web  |publisher= |publication-place= |page= |url= http://www.padicat.cat/sites/default/files/ponencies/padicat_iipc_2010_cat.pdf |accessdate=2012-11-21 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; a software expressly developed by CESCA technicians for the project.

==== Hardware ====
[[File:Cesca maquinari.jpg|thumbnail|PADICAT servers at CESCA]]
With regard to [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] that maintains system, there are six nodes HP ProLiant DL360 G4p, charge to collection and indexation tasks of web pages. In charge of results searching and viewing in web interface there is Linux cluster high-availability, with balance features of requests loads and error tolerance if there is a technical disaster of nodes that integrate platform. NetApp FAS3170 cabin presents 19TB of disk capacity via NFS to these nodes.

Nodes are connected with fibre to a [[Storage area network|Storage Area Network]] (SAN) and is complemented with saving system of data backup robot.

Is expected to include the deposited contents in PADICAT to COFRE&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Serra |first=Eugènia |last2=Pérez |first2=Karibel |last3=Llueca |first3=Ciro |year=2012 |title=La Biblioteca de Catalunya i l'accés al patrimoni digital  |publisher= MEI |publication-place= |page= |url= http://www.metodosdeinformacion.es/mei/index.php/mei/article/viewFile/IIMEI2-N2-005020/738 |accessdate=2012-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (COnservem per al Futur Recursos Electrònics), a high security preservation system created for the Biblioteca de Catalunya

[[Image:2-Perelman-Cyclopedia-Cigars.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Two editions of the ''Cyclopedia of Cigars'', (2006 and 2007).]]
The '''''Perelman's Pocket Cyclopedia of Cigars''''' is an annually published and updated reference of [[List of cigar brands|cigar brands]] available in the United States, including specifications and information regarding each [[cigar]], as well as basic cigar knowledge in general, such as [[Cigar#Wrappers|wrapper colours]] and [[Cigar#Size and shape|shapes and sizes]]. There is also an'' 'Almanac' ''section which includes a list of new brands and those that have been discontinued since the last edition, details about 'ancient' brands that are still in production, a list of unusual cigars (with [[multicolored]] wrappers, for example), a list of the smallest and largest cigars available (by length and [[ring gauge]]), and more.

==Editions==
It was first published in 1995 and contained 370 brands. The number of brands covered jumped to 659 in the 1997 edition, then to 1,144 in 1998, and then to an all-time high of 1,448 in 1999. The 15th edition (2009) has the second highest brand total ever and includes information on 1,360 brands (1,209 handmade, 75 machine made and 76 [[cigarillo|small cigars/cigarillos]])''.

===''Cyclopedia of Havana Cigars''===

There is a companion edition, the '''''Perelman's Pocket Cyclopedia of Havana Cigars''''' which is similar, but includes information solely on the [[Cuba]]n [[cigar]] brands. It is currently in its third edition (published 2005), but is not published every year (the 2nd edition was in 1998), and also includes information about how cigars are made in Cuba, a history of [[tobacco]] and Cuban brands, and details on [[Factory Name|vitolas]].

Both editions are written by [[Richard B. Perelman]].

The '''Pipe rolls''', sometimes called the '''Great rolls''',&lt;ref name=Brown54&gt;Brown ''Governance'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Great Rolls of the Pipe''', are a collection of financial records maintained by the English [[Exchequer]], or Treasury, and its successors. The earliest date from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833.&lt;ref name=Chrimes62&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; They form the oldest continuous series of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they are some of the earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived in a continuous series like the English.

They were the records of the yearly audits performed by the Exchequer of the accounts and payments presented to the Treasury by the sheriffs and other royal officials; and owed their name to the shape they took, as the various sheets were affixed to each other and then rolled into a tight roll, resembling a pipe, for storage. They record not only payments made to the government, but debts owed to the crown and disbursements made by royal officials. Although they recorded much of the royal income, they did not record all types of income, nor did they record all expenditures, so they are not strictly speaking a budget. The Pipe Roll Society, formed in 1883, has published the Pipe rolls up until 1224.

==Composition==
The Pipe rolls are named after the "pipe" shape formed by the rolled up [[parchment]]s on which the records were originally written.&lt;ref name=Coredon219/&gt; There is no evidence to support the theory that they were named pipes for the fact that they "piped" the money into the Treasury, nor for the claim that they got their name from resembling a wine cask, or [[Butt (volume)|pipe]] of wine.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt; They were occasionally referred to as the roll of the treasury, or the great roll of accounts, and the great roll of the pipe.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt;

The Pipe rolls are the records of the audits of the [[High Sheriff|sheriffs]]' accounts, usually conducted at [[Michaelmas]] by the [[Exchequer]], or English treasury.&lt;ref name=Warren73&gt;Warren ''Governance'' pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Charter Roll|chancery records]] began in the reign of King [[John of England]], they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government.&lt;ref name=Chrimes62/&gt; They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer.&lt;ref name=Chrimes62/&gt; They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered.&lt;ref name=RandS216&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rolls use an [[Accountancy|accounting system]], it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance until the end of the 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each [[shire]].&lt;ref name=Chrimes62/&gt; In their early form, they record all debts owed to the [[The Crown|Crown]], whether from [[Feudalism|feudal]] dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt.&lt;ref name=Warren76&gt;Warren ''Governance'' pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed.&lt;ref name=Bartlett198&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.&lt;ref name=Lyon262&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving Pipe roll, already in a mature form, dates from 1129–30,&lt;ref name=HenryI26/&gt;{{efn|The Pipe Roll of 31 Henry I is "the earliest surviving comprehensive account of royal income in European history" according to [[C. Warren Hollister]]&lt;ref name=HenryI26&gt;Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;}} and the continuous series begins in 1155–56,&lt;ref name=Coredon219&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; and continued for almost seven hundred years.&lt;ref name=Lyon112&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]], the Pipe rolls contributed to the centralisation of financial records by the [[Norman dynasty|Norman kings]] (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, did not have an equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s.&lt;ref name=Chibnall&gt;Chibnall ''Anglo-Norman England'' p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England,&lt;ref name=Memory136&gt;Clanchy ''Memory to Written Record'' p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear.&lt;ref name=Clanchy141&gt;Clanchy ''Memory to Written Record'' p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (reigned 1154–1189) and [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in France.&lt;ref name=Mason139&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason150&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the Norman rolls were started about the same time as the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they did start.&lt;ref name=Lyon220&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.&lt;ref name=Frame87&gt;Frame ''Political Development'' p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dialogus de Scaccario'' or ''[[Dialogue concerning the Exchequer]]'', written in about 1178, details the workings of the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created.&lt;ref name=Chrimes60/&gt; The ''Dialogue'' was written by [[Richard FitzNeal]], the son of [[Nigel (Bishop of Ely)|Nigel of Ely]], who was [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] for both [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] and Henry II of England.&lt;ref name=Warren73/&gt; According to the ''Dialogue'', the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the [[Clerk of the Pipe]] and later the clerk of the pells.&lt;ref name=Chrimes60&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; FitzNeal wrote his work to explain the inner workings of the Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used.&lt;ref name=Clanchy136&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dialogue'' also states that the Pipe rolls, along with [[Domesday Book]] and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.&lt;ref name=Clanchy151&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of income recorded on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king.&lt;ref name=Lyon164&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded.&lt;ref name=Enc266&gt;Loyn (ed.) ''Middle Ages'' p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock.&lt;ref name=Lyon163&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of [[danegeld|geld]], a form of land tax dating from [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon times]],&lt;ref name=Warren68&gt;Warren ''Governance'' p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld.&lt;ref name=Warren146&gt;Warren ''Governance'' p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Whether geld was abolished in 1161 or later is a matter of debate among historians.&lt;ref name=Warren146/&gt;}} By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the [[Assize Court|Assizes]], or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Warren111&gt;Warren ''Governance'' p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coredon23&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scutage]] payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.&lt;ref name=Hollister578&gt;Hollister "Significance of Scutage Rates" ''English Historical Review'' p. 578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict252&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary'' p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It is unclear if the recording of scutage in the Pipe rolls was an innovation during Henry II's reign, or if it is just mischance that the lone surviving Pipe roll prior to his reign does not record any scutage payments.&lt;ref name=1066page717&gt;Hollister "1066" ''American Historical Review'' p. 717&lt;/ref&gt; The 1130 Pipe roll does allude to scutage payments, it just does not record any payment made.&lt;ref name=Irony9&gt;Hollister "Irony of English Feudalism" ''Journal of British Studies'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although they recorded all income that came through the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, as well as more occasional income derived from feudal levies, [[Ward (law)|wardships]], and ecclesiastical vacancies.&lt;ref name=Mortimer42&gt;Mortimer ''Angevin England'' p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate.&lt;ref name=Bartlett164&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coredon237&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt; A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the [[Royal forest#Forest law|Forest Law]],&lt;ref name=Bartlett170&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared [[royal forest]].&lt;ref name=Bartlett239&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Bartlett159/&gt;

Expenditures were also subject to documentation in the Pipe rolls. Among the recorded expenditures are payments for carts and cart horses,&lt;ref name=Bartlett133&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; wages for royal servants, payments for improvements to royal manors and houses, royal gifts to persons,&lt;ref name=Bartlett171&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 171–174&lt;/ref&gt; hunting expenses,&lt;ref name=Bartlett239/&gt; payments to acquire a governmental office,&lt;ref name=Huscroft159&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; payments to mercenaries,&lt;ref name=Bartlett254&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; and the costs of bags and casks to transport [[Penny (English coin)|silver pennies]] about the kingdom.&lt;ref name=Bartlett373&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about other subjects besides revenues also is contained in the rolls, including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons.&lt;ref name=Heiser20&gt;Heiser "Castles, Constables and Politics" ''Albion'' p. 20 footnote 8&lt;/ref&gt; The Pipe rolls also allow the identification of the custodians of royal lands and castles.&lt;ref name=Heiser22&gt;Heiser "Castles, Constables and Politics" ''Albion'' p. 22 footnote 22&lt;/ref&gt; The clerks writing the rolls also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as [[William Longchamp]], who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.&lt;ref name=Heiser32&gt;Heiser "Castles, Constables and Politics" ''Albion'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain areas did not report their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These included the [[County palatine|palatinate]]s of [[County Durham|Durham]] and [[Cheshire|Chester]].&lt;ref name=Palatinate719&gt;Alexander "New Evidence" ''English Historical Review'' p. 719&lt;/ref&gt; The county of [[Cornwall]] also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, but it was not a palatinate.&lt;ref name=Palatinate724&gt;Alexander "New Evidence" ''English Historical Review'' p. 724 and footnote 2&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll.&lt;ref name=Barratt636&gt;Barratt "English Revenue of Richard I" ''English Historical Review'' p. 636&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous [[Easter]] to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.&lt;ref name=John836/&gt;

==History==
[[File:National Archives 2007 02 03.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], where the Pipe rolls are now held]]

Although the earliest Pipe roll dates from 1130, the 31st year of King Henry I's reign, it is clear that they were being produced by the Exchequer before then, as the 1130 roll is not an experiment. It shows no hesitancy in its use of accounts, or lack of continuity from previous years.&lt;ref name=Chrimes30&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; An extract from an earlier Pipe roll, from the 25th regnal year of Henry I or 1124, has been found in a 14th-century manuscript now in the [[Cotton Library]] at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=Hagger&gt;Hagger "Pipe Roll for 25 Henry I" ''English Historical Review''&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The extract is very short, but it shows that the Pipe rolls already recorded exemptions from [[danegeld]]. It is currently [[manuscript Tiberius]] E.vi part i.&lt;ref name=Hagger/&gt;}}  Exactly when the Pipe rolls began to be produced is debated amongst historians. Some hold that they date from Henry I's reign, whether early or late in the reign,&lt;ref name=Chrimes30/&gt; but others feel that they were introduced by King [[William I of England|William I]] (reigned 1066–1087).&lt;ref name=Clanchy151/&gt; The precursors of the records probably date to the Anglo-Saxon period, as the historian [[Pauline Stafford]] argues that financial records must have been kept in some form during the reigns of [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] (reigned 1016–1035), [[Ethelred the Unready|Æthelred II]] (reigned 978–1016), and [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar the Peaceable]] (reigned 959–975).&lt;ref name=Stafford149&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reference to the king's "rolls" in a [[writ]] from 1110, which purports to be a grant from Henry I to the abbot of [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] of ten [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]], but the writ may be a forgery, or parts of it may be genuine with some interpolations. As the writ only exists in a copy in a later [[cartulary]], and the Abbey of Westminster is also known to have forged a number of other writs or charters, the writ is not a solid source for royal rolls being kept as early as 1110.&lt;ref name=Clanchy137&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;

After the one surviving roll from Henry I's reign, no further Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from the reign of his successor, King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] (reigned 1135–1154). But by the second year of King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt; It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=RandS257&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' p. 257 footnote 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoshi&gt;Yoshitake "Exchequer in the Reign of Stephen" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 950–959&lt;/ref&gt; Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break in the last years of King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).&lt;ref name=Mortimer66&gt;Mortimer ''Angevin England'' pp. 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The 1213 roll does not exist, and the 1215 roll was compiled after John's death and is not contemporary with the actual financial investigation carried out in that year.&lt;ref name=John836&gt;Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' p. 836 footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The surviving Pipe roll from 1130 records an income of £24,500.&lt;ref name=Bartlett159&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is dwarfed by the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals £68,850.&lt;ref name=Huscroft102&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The income that they record in the early years of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about £10,000 to £15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to £20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about £30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only £8,000 in the early years, rising to £16,500 by 1225.&lt;ref name=Mortimer51&gt;Mortimer ''Angevin England'' p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.&lt;ref name=RandS260&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of King John, the Pipe rolls were growing unwieldy, as too many fines and fees were being recorded, making the finding of information in the rolls difficult. Eventually, after some experimentation, by 1206 a system was settled on whereby the actual detailed receipts were recorded in a set of ''receipt rolls'' and only aggregates were entered in the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Chrimes73&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; A further reform in 1236 resulted in debts being recorded in separate ''[[Estreat]] rolls'', and only the totals entered into the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Chrimes119&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In 1284 the ''[[Statute of Rhuddlan|Statutes of Rhuddlan]]'' were issued, which further reformed the accounting systems, and further reduced the detail contained on the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Chrimes148&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, a large number of unrecoverable debts were also removed from the rolls, a process that had also been attempted in 1270. The attempt in 1270 had marked old debts with a "d" and stipulated that they were not to be re-entered into future Pipe rolls unless they were paid off. But this had not worked, and so in 1284 old debts were to be recorded on a separate roll. The statutes in 1284 also laid out a procedure where debtors whose documentation of payment of debt that hadn't been accepted in the past would have that documentation accepted, thus helping to clear out some of the backlogged debts on the books.&lt;ref name=EdwardI242&gt;Prestwich ''Edward I'' pp. 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet more extraneous details were removed from the Pipe rolls under the ''Cowick Ordinance'' of June 1323,&lt;ref name=Chrimes181&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that [[Walter de Stapledon]] held the office of Treasurer.&lt;ref name=Plant59&gt;Prestwich ''Plantagenet England'' p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the ''Cowick Ordinance'' attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts.&lt;ref name=Buck246&gt;Buck "Reform of the Exchequer" ''English Historical Review'' p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of [[customs]] receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls.&lt;ref name=Graves473&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'' p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records.&lt;ref name=Plant208&gt;Prestwich ''Plantagenet England'' p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.&lt;ref name=Graves473/&gt;

In 1462, the exchequer was told to no longer summon for audit any farms or feefarms worth over 40 shillings per year, as these would be supervised by a newly appointed board of receivers or approvers.&lt;ref name=Wolffe2&gt;Wolfee "Management of English Royal Estates" ''English Historical Review'' p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pipe rolls series ended in 1834 when the office that was in charge of their creation, the Pipe Office, was abolished.&lt;ref name=Web&gt;"[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Pi/Pipe_Rolls.html Pipe rolls entry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231225308/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Pi/Pipe_Rolls.html |date=31 December 2009 }}" ''Websters Online Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
They were created by taking the shire, or other governmental districts, accounts and writing them on two strips of parchment, usually about {{convert|14|in|cm|sigfig=2}} wide.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt; The two pieces were then attached end to end to form one long sheet. Then, the various sheets from all the shires were piled together and affixed together at the top, and the resulting document would be rolled into a tight roll resembling a pipe.&lt;ref name=Coredon219/&gt; They were not formed into one long continuous roll, as the [[Patent Rolls]] were, however. The sheets for each county have a heading at the top giving the name of the county the account is for, in Latin. If more than one sheet was required for a county, the county name would be amended on secondary sheets to indicate the order the sheets were in.&lt;ref name=Ramsay&gt;Ramsay "Origin of the Name Pipe Roll" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 329–220&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes they are referred to, in [[Latin]], as ''magnus rotulus pipae''.&lt;ref name=Chrimes50&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Several sources for the actual idea of making the rolls as rolls have been suggested, including Jews, [[Adelard of Bath]], who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using rolls, or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician who may have been from Sicily.&lt;ref name=Clanchy140&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The rolls were written in Latin until 1733, except for a short time around 1650.&lt;ref name=NatArch&gt;National Archives ''[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/RdLeaflet.asp?sLeafletID=186&amp;j=1 Research Guides: Early Pipe Rolls, 1130–c.&amp;nbsp;1300]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of Henry II, a duplicate copy of the year's Pipe roll was made for the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], and was called the Chancellor's roll. This was created at the same time as the regular Pipe roll, and was written by a clerk of the Chancellor.&lt;ref name=Lyon261&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; The Chancellor rolls survive from 1163 to 1832, but are basically duplicates of the corresponding Pipe rolls, except for the occasional addition of a private charter or other material.&lt;ref name=Graves474/&gt;

==Influence on other records==
The example of the royal exchequer's records eventually influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe rolls are those of the [[Bishop of Winchester]], which are extant from 1208,&lt;ref name=Clanchy92/&gt; and form a continuous series from that date. They started under [[Peter des Roches]], who was also a royal clerk and administrator.&lt;ref name=Bartlett201&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; They record monies coming in as well as expenses and payments made, in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private rolls resembling the Pipe rolls are from monasteries. The household rolls, which closely resemble the Pipe rolls, for [[Eleanor of Leicester|Eleanor of England]], wife of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], survive for part of the year 1265.&lt;ref name=Clanchy92&gt;Clanchy ''Memory to Written Record'' pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies by historians==

A number of historians have studied the surviving Pipe rolls, using them as the basis for study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era.&lt;ref name=Mason148/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason157/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason162/&gt; A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns.&lt;ref name=Bartlett175&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work by [[Nick Barratt]] on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research.&lt;ref name=Barratt&gt;Barratt "English Revenue of Richard I" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 835–856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=John&gt;Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 835–855&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign.&lt;ref name=Bartlett175/&gt; The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking.&lt;ref name=Huscroft88&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges.&lt;ref name=Lyon191&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RandS176&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=John836a&gt;Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 836–837&lt;/ref&gt;

The lone surviving Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, has been a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include [[Judith Green (historian)|Judith Green]]'s search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites.&lt;ref name=Mason148&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, as well as on the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign.&lt;ref name=Mason157&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World''  p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[C. Warren Hollister]] used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.&lt;ref name=Mason162&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World''  p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pipe rolls from the 13th century onwards are less important for historical study because there are other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also kept by the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe rolls. Other surviving records were kept by the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Lyon330&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as [[William Shakespeare]]'s residence in the parish of [[St Helen's Bishopsgate]], and in [[Southwark]].&lt;ref name=Hales401&gt;Hales "London Residences of Shakespeare" ''Athenaeum'' pp. 401-402&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
[[File:Pipe roll 1174 record type.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Extract from the Pipe roll for [[Regnal years of English monarchs|21]] [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1174–5), as published by the Pipe Roll Society in 1897 using [[record type]].]]

The earliest Pipe rolls were published by the [[Record Commission]] in 1833 (the isolated roll of 1130) and the [[Public Record Office]] in 1844 (the rolls for 1155–58).&lt;ref name=Graves474/&gt; The Commission's edition of the 1130 roll has now been superseded by a new edition (with English translation) published by the Pipe Roll Society in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Green ''Great Roll of the Pipe''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 the Pipe Roll Society (a [[text publication society]]) was founded by the Public Record Office, on the initiative of [[Walford Dakin Selby]] and his colleague James Greenstreet, to establish a systematic publishing programme for the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=NatArch/&gt; It published its first volume in 1884, and has now published all the rolls from 1158 to 1224.&lt;ref name="PRS pubs"&gt;Pipe Roll Society "[http://www.piperollsociety.co.uk/page2.htm Pipe Roll Society Publications]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RHS PRS"&gt;{{cite web |author=Royal Historical Society |publisher=Royal Historical Society |url=http://5hm1h4aktue2uejbs1hsqt31.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/piperollsociety.pdf |title=Pipe Roll Society Publications |accessdate=11 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the continuous series, it has also published the roll for 1230. The rolls for 1241 were published in 1918 by the [[Yale University Press]].&lt;ref name=Graves474&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'', p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; Various county record societies have published parts of the rolls for various years that relate to their particular county. The Society's earliest volumes (to 1900) were printed in "[[record type]]", designed to produce a near-[[facsimile]] of the original manuscript, including its [[scribal abbreviation]]s. This policy was abandoned in 1903, and all volumes since have been published in normal type with abbreviations extended.&lt;ref name=Pipe1904&gt;Pipe Roll Society ''Great Roll of the Pipe'' pp. vii-viii&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pipe Roll Society has also published numerous related texts, including the Chancellor's Roll for 1196 and the Norman Pipe Rolls of Henry II.&lt;ref name="PRS pubs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RHS PRS"/&gt; Rolls for the Irish Exchequer and the Norman Exchequer have also been published.&lt;ref name=Graves475&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'' pp. 475–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, wild ravens were common throughout Britain, even in towns, the tower being within their natural range. When they were exterminated from much of their traditional range, including London, they could only exist at the tower in captivity and with official support. They are tanded to by an official [[Ravenmaster]]. Local legend puts the origin of the captive raven population at the time of King [[Charles II of England|Charles&amp;nbsp;II]] (reigned 1660–85). Some of the ravens at the tower were specially bred in [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name=leaflet2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-18611229|title=Tower of London's Jubilee raven released|publisher=BBC News|date=26 December 2015|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Legends ===
One of the earliest legends that connects the Tower with a raven is the tale of the [[Euhemerism|euhemerised]] [[Branwen#War against Ireland|mutually destructive battle against the Irish]] leader [[Matholwch]] who had mistreated the British princess [[Branwen]]. Branwen's brother [[Brân the Blessed]] (King of the Britons) ordered his followers to [[Decapitation|cut off his head]] and bury it beneath the White Hill (where the Tower now stands) facing out towards [[France]] as a talisman to protect [[United Kingdom|Britain]] from foreign invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sax|first=Boria|title=Medievalism, Paganism, and the Tower Ravens|url=http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/pom/article/view/3325|journal=Pomegranate: The International Juornal of Pagan Studies|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.1558/pome.v9i1.62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brân is the Welsh word for Raven, relating Brân's head being buried beneath the site of today's tower to the continued presence of ravens.

[[File:Place of Execution in Front of St. Peter’s Chapel.jpg|A view ({{circa|1900|lk=on}}) of [[Tower Green]], where historically a temporary scaffold was sometimes erected for executions, although these were usually carried out on [[Tower Hill]] outside the castle. Before the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, there were seven executions  on Tower Green.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Impey]] &amp; Geoffrey Parnell (2000). ''The Tower of London: The Official Illustrated History''. Merrell Publishers in association with [[Historic Royal Palaces]]. p.94&lt;/ref&gt;|thumb]]

Allegedly, at the execution of [[Anne Boleyn]] in 1536, "Even the ravens of the Tower sat silent and immovable on the battlements and gazed eerily at the strange scene. A Queen about to die!"&lt;ref name="The tower from within"/&gt; The ravens of the Tower supposedly behaved much worse during the execution of [[Lady Jane Grey]] in 1554, allegedly "pecking the eyes from the severed head" of the queen.&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;

In his article "How Ravens Came to the Tower of London", American author [[Boria Sax]] came to the conclusion that "the ravens were originally brought in to dramatise the alleged site of executions at the Tower".&lt;ref name=Sax2/&gt;

One legend attributes the start of the tradition of keeping ravens with clipped wings in the Tower of London to Charles II and to his royal astronomer [[John Flamsteed]], although there are versions of the legend that differ in their datials
.&lt;ref name=ravens/&gt;  According to one legend, John Flamsteed complained to Charles II that wild ravens were flying past his [[telescope]] and making it harder for him to observe the sky from his [[observatory]] in the White Tower. Flamsteed requested that the birds be removed, but Charles II refused to comply with this request.&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;&lt;ref name=ravens/&gt;

Another variation of this legend says that it was Charles II himself who disliked the wild ravens' droppings falling onto the telescope. The conversation with his astronomer that supposedly followed decided the fate not only of the ravens, but also of [[Greenwich]], where the [[Greenwich Observatory]] was commissioned by the King in 1675. In this version of the legend the King complained: {{quote|"These ravens must go!" he said. "But, Sire, it is very unlucky to kill a raven," replied Flamstead, "If you do that the Tower will fall and you will lose your kingdom, having only just got it back!" Charles, being a pragmatist, thought for a moment and said: "The Observatory must go to Greenwich and the ravens can stay in the Tower."&lt;ref name=Sax/&gt;}}

Yet another legend attributes the appearance of ravens in the Tower to the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Wild ravens, as well as [[pig]]s and [[kite (bird)|kite]]s, were the biggest [[scavenger]]s in [[medieval]] London.&lt;ref name="In Search of London"/&gt; Allegedly after the fire, survivors started persecuting ravens for scavenging, but Flamsteed explained to Charles II that killing all ravens would be a bad [[omen]], and that the kingdom would not outlive the last killed raven. Charles II then ordered six birds to be kept at the Tower.&lt;ref name=Fire/&gt;

=== Wild ravens in London ===
{{Main|Common raven}}
Wild ravens are native to Britain (and most other parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]) although in recent times breeding populations are mostly restricted to the wilder western upland areas of the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/r/raven/index.aspx |title= Raven|accessdate= 4 December 2010|publisher=Royal Society for the Protection of Birds }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite likely that ravens lived in and around the Tower centuries ago,{{cn|date=February 2018}} because until the 16th century, ravens lived in close proximity to people as well as in wild areas; they were welcomed in towns because their scavenging habits of feeding helped keep the streets clean. However, in later years wild ravens were viewed as a threat to livestock, and during the 19th century they were eliminated in many areas by systematic hunting and shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ravens-the-literary-birds-of-death-come-back-to-life-in-britain-524186.html|title=Ravens, the literary birds of death, come back to life in Britain|accessdate= 5 December 2010|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Michael|last=McCarthy|date=23 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last time ravens nested in the wild in London was in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in 1826, but the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] reported in 2004 that ravens had been observed nesting in the [[Home Counties]] around London, as close as 30 miles from the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1465062/Wild-ravens-could-nest-once-more-at-Tower.html|title=Wild ravens could nest once more at Tower|accessdate= 5 December 2010|work=Daily Telegraph | date=21 June 2004|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:13 London Town, page 9 (cropped).png|thumb|Ravens in the Tower of London, from ''London Town'' (1883)]]
The first two known depictions of ravens in the Tower of London both date from the year 1883. One is in a special edition of the newspaper ''The Pictorial World'' and the other is from the children's Book  ''London Town'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Felix Leigh |first1=Thomas Crane &amp; Ellen Houghton |title=London Town |url=https://archive.org/details/London_Town |publisher=Marcus Ward &amp; Co. |accessdate=14 July 2018 |date=1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Felix Leigh and illustrated by Thomas Crane and Elizabeth Houghton.&lt;ref&gt;Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, p. 50-53., .&lt;/ref&gt;

Sax found the one early mention of importation of captive ravens in the 1918 book ''The Tower from Within'' by George Younghusband. Younghusband stated that the ravens were provided by the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] (1841–1926). The second Earl of Dunraven had been a patron of the Druidic scholar, poet, and forger [[Iolo Morganwg]], who convinced the family that their castle in Glamorgan had been the original residence of the raven-god [[Brân the Blessed|Bran]], actually an early king. The Earls may have thought of the ravens as avatars of Bran, and wished to assert a spiritual claim over the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, p. 36-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Parnell, the official Tower of London historian and a member of the [[Royal Armouries]] staff, also believes that the allegedly ancient history of captive ravens at the Tower is just a legend that was created during the [[Victorian era]].  And during Parnell's research, despite the superstition that the Crown depends on the continued presence of the ravens, "[he] has found the blunt statement in the records 'there are none left'&amp;nbsp;– and yet the monarchy and the tower have more or less survived".&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; This alludes to a period right before the reopening of the Tower after World War II, when the only surviving ravens, the mated pair Mabel and Grip, disappeared from the Tower, perhaps eloping to a nearby wood. The story of their escape appeared in several local American papers.&lt;ref&gt;Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, p. 80-84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Parnell also believes that the first captive ravens may have been introduced to the Tower as [[pet]]s of the staff. After "[[The Raven]]" the famous [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[United States|American]] writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]] was first published in January 1845, the Western world became fascinated with the birds.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

Japanese novelist and scholar [[Natsume Sōseki]] who visited the Tower in 1900, wrote an account published in 1906 reporting a total of six ravens at the Tower as a central focus during and following an execution at the site; however, as Boria Sax points out, the writing style "blends fantasy, history, and present experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sax |first1=Boria |authorlink1=Boria Sax |title=How Ravens Came to the Tower of London |journal=Society &amp; Animals |date=1 July 2007 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=269–283 |doi=10.1163/156853007X217203 |issn=1063-1119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===
The first reference to an early version of the legend that Britain will fall if the ravens leave the Tower comes from July 1944, when ravens were used as unofficial spotters for enemy bombs and planes during [[the Blitz]] of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, pp. 62–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one raven was able to survive the wartime hardships, so [[Winston Churchill]], then prime minister, ordered more to bring the flock to the correct size. The Tower ravens are enlisted as soldiers of the Kingdom and were issued [[Police oath#United Kingdom|attestation cards]] in the same way as soldiers and police. As with soldiers, they can be [[military discharge|dismissed]] for [[conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline|unsatisfactory conduct]].&lt;ref name="In Search of London"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A Short History of the Tower of London"/&gt;

=== Recent events ===
Today the Tower's ravens are one of the attractions for tourists visiting the [[City of London]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;   However, visitors are advised not to feed the birds, and warned that a raven will bite if it feels threatened.&lt;ref name=ravens/&gt;

Since 1987, the Tower ravens have been the subject of a successful [[captive breeding]] programme. For example, over time, 17 chicks were successfully hatched and raised by a pair of ravens known as "Charlie" and "Rhys".&lt;ref name="The guardians of the Tower"/&gt; Charlie came to an unhappy end: he bit a [[bomb-sniffing dog]] (who was also named Charlie), and the dog grabbed the raven with his teeth. This dog bite killed the bird.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

While visiting the Tower in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waugh |first1=Paul |title=Putin visits Britain and is accorded all royal pomp, but... |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/putin-visits-britain-and-is-accorded-all-royal-pomp-but-chechen-protesters-question-the-circumstance-110156.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=9 November 2018 |date=24 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Putin]], the [[President of Russia]], is reported to have been impressed by one of the bird's verbal skills;  Thor greeted each person in his entourage with a "Good morning!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Nicola |last=Iseard |date =1 February 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/feb/01/darrick-coyle-life-travels |title=My life in travel |work=[[The Observer]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2006|global spread of H5N1 virus ("bird flu") in 2006]], the ravens of the Tower were taken inside, and lived in "custom-built aviaries".&lt;ref name="fox"/&gt;

In May 2013, two ravens were killed by a fox that managed to infiltrate the grounds, the only fox attack inside the walls ever recorded. The raven population was temporarily reduced to the minimum number of six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hardman |first1=Robert |title=Woe betide the next fox that tries to eat a Tower of London raven! |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2478685/After-predator-eats-Tower-London-ravens-ROBERT-HARDMAN-meets-belligerent-survivors.html |website=Mail Online |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd |accessdate=25 June 2018 |date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upgraded security measures were included in the plans for a major refurbishment of the raven accommodations, funded by the independent [[Historic Royal Palaces|Historic Royal Palaces organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bryant |first1=B en |title=Tower of London upgrades security after fox kills two ravens |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/10407729/Tower-of-London-upgrades-security-after-fox-kills-two-ravens.html |accessdate=26 June 2018 |date=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointed in 2011, current Ravenmaster Chris Skaife was caring for seven of the birds in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/meet-the-ravenmaster |title=Why the Tower of London has a ravenmaster — a man charged with keeping at least six ravens at the castle at all times |publisher=[[National Post]] |date=30 September 2018 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has reduced the amount of clipping of wings and feathers by a third to allow the ravens to fly, instead of merely hopping or gliding. He has allowed one of the birds, Merlina, to fly to the wharf on the Thames but she always returns due to the bonding with her keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/10/ravens-tower-of-london/568312/|title=The Brilliant, Playful, Bloodthirsty Raven|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During Skaife's tenure, only one raven, Munin, has escaped but was captured by a member of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/meet-the-ravenmaster |title=Why the Tower of London has a ravenmaster — a man charged with keeping at least six ravens at the castle at all times |publisher=[[National Post]] |date=30 September 2018 |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Care and diet ==
[[File:Tower of London -cages for ravens-8a-5Aug2004.jpg|thumb|The ravens' aviary in 2004]]
The ravens cannot fly because the [[flight feathers]] on one wing are [[Wing clipping|clipped]]. With a single wing clipped, they can only fly short distances to perch. Otherwise, as Boria Sax writes, [[tongue-in-cheek]]:
{{quote| The ravens are now treated almost like royalty. Like the Royals, the ravens live in a palace and are waited on by servants. They are kept at public expense, but in return they must show themselves to the public in settings of great splendour. So long as they abide by certain basic rules, neither Royals nor ravens have to do anything extraordinary. If the power in question is political and diplomatic, the Royals now have hardly more than the ravens. But the word "power" here can also mean the aura of glamour and mystery which at times envelops both ravens and monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Each Tower raven has a different [[Bird ringing|coloured band]] on one leg, to make it easier to identify individual birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/DestinationsUK/TowerRavens.htm |title= Her Majesty's Palace and Fortress the Tower of London, The Tower Ravens|accessdate= 4 December 2010|publisher=Historic-UK.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ravens in captivity in the Tower grounds have had lifespans of over 40 years.&lt;ref name="Boarman_Heinrich"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boarman| first=W.I.|author2=B. Heinrich|year=1999| title=Common Raven (''Corvus corax'')| journal=Birds of North America|volume=476|pages=1–32|doi=10.2173/bna.476|last3=Poole|first3=A.|last4=Gill|first4=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tower's ravens are given individual names, and are all under the care of the [[Yeomen Warders]]. The diet of the ravens is carefully maintained.  In 2007, the Ravenmaster Derek Coyle commented: "I buy fresh meat from [[Smithfield, London#The market|Smithfield]]&amp;nbsp;– liver, lamb, beef, chicken. And occasionally when I’m at my own place in Suffolk someone will give me some rabbit that’s been killed. If I see [[roadkill]] on the road, and it’s not been too badly mangled, I normally put it in a [[Bin bag|black bag]] and bring it back here. I give them biscuits as well, soaked in blood from the meat that I buy. And in winter I get them capsules of cod liver oil. I know they’re getting as much vitamins and oil as they possibly can. That’s why they look so healthy."{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Their diet consists of raw meat daily, usually liver, lambs' hearts and beef or pork trimming, and every other day includes boiled egg with shell and blood-soaked bird biscuits. Occasionally, rabbit parts with fur are added for roughage.  Once a week the birds are given a thorough check-over, and once every third week the [[Flight feather|lifting feathers]] on their right wings are trimmed to prevent them from flying away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stenlake |first1=Alison |title='I have a great relationship with the birds' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4098894.stm |website=BBC News |accessdate=31 October 2018 |date=22 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Raven stories ==
Most Londoners are fond of the ravens, but sometimes an individual bird will fall out of favour because of inappropriate behaviour. For example, "Raven George" lost his appointment to the Crown, and was retired to [[Wales]] for attacking and destroying [[television antenna|TV aerials]]. A special decree was issued about the incident:

{{quote|On Saturday 13th September 1986, Raven George, enlisted 1975, was posted to the [[Welsh Mountain Zoo]]. [[misconduct|Conduct unsatisfactory]], service therefore no longer required.&lt;ref name="THE TOWER RAVENS"/&gt;}}
In 1996, two more ravens fell out of favour and were dismissed from the Tower for "[[misconduct|conduct unbecoming]] Tower residents."&lt;ref name=dismissed/&gt;

Despite having their flight feathers clipped on one wing, sometimes the Tower ravens [[Desertion|desert]] their duties. In 1981, Grog the raven decided to leave the surroundings of the Tower for those of a [[pub]], after 21 years of faithful service to the Crown.&lt;ref name=ravens/&gt; In contrast, a raven named Mabel was kidnapped from the Tower soon after World War II, a mystery that has never been solved.&lt;ref name="The guardians of the Tower"/&gt;

Another story concerns the two ravens named "James Crow" and "Edgar Sopper". James Crow was a much-loved and long-lived raven. After noticing the commotion surrounding the other raven's death, Edgar Sopper decided he could "[[Apparent death|play dead]]" in order to bring more attention to himself. His trick was so convincing that the ravenmaster fully believed that Edgar Sopper had died. When the ravenmaster picked up the "corpse", Edgar bit the man's finger and "flapped off croaking huge raven laughs".&lt;ref name="A Short History of the Tower of London"/&gt; Likewise, "Merlin" is known for eliciting a commotion from visitors by occasionally playing dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wakefield|first1=Mary|title=Just how clever are ravens? I asked at the Tower of London|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/10/just-how-clever-are-ravens-i-asked-at-the-tower-of-london/|accessdate=24 May 2018|work=The Spectator|date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 a chaplain named Norman Hood died in his chamber on the Tower grounds. Former Assistant Ravenmaster Tom Trent has reported that the ravens appeared to be aware of the death, for they soon gathered on the Tower Green near the chapel, called out, and then became quiet,  as though to pay their respects. [[Corvid]]s have been widely reported to hold "funerals," in which they mourn and then cluster around a dead bird in silence.&lt;ref&gt;Sax, Boria. City of Ravens: London, Its Tower, and Its Famous Birds. London: Duckworth, 2011, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Smith v Smith'''''&lt;ref&gt;1947 (1) SA 474 (W).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in South African [[case law| law]], in particular in the area of civil procedure. It was heard and decided in the [[Witwatersrand]] Local Division by Millin J on 22 January 1947. An action for judgment on motion under Rule of Court 42, the case concerned the service of summons at the defendant's place of business, and specifically whether or not the definition of "place of business," in terms of Rule of Court 20, was met by the place at which the defendant is employed. In other words, could it be said of the employee of a business that his "place of business" was the place of that business? The court held that it could not. The plaintiff was represented by P. Cillie of Sasto &amp; Louis.

== Facts ==
A return of service on a defendant, cited as "a learner miner, No. 11 Shaft, Rand Leases," read as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is to certify that on 13th December, 1946, after failing to find defendant personally, I handed a copy of the summons to Mr. J. F., Chief Paymaster at Rand Leases G.M. Co., Florida, and at the same time explained the nature and exigency thereof to him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Judgment ==
Millin J found that a person employed by another at a certain place does not have his place of business at that place. He held, accordingly, that the service was bad.

A '''supplement''' is a publication that has a role secondary to that of another preceding or concurrent publication.

A follow-on [[publication]] complements its predecessor, either by bringing it up to date (e.g. the [[Index Catalogue]]), or by otherwise enhancing the predecessor's coverage of a particular topic or subject matter, as in the [[Tosefta]]. Supplements are particularly used in [[Video game|gaming]] hobbies.

A [[newspaper]] supplement, often a weekly section of its parent, usually has a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] or [[Sunday magazine]] format and covers wide-ranging and less time-critical subjects, as in ''[[The American Weekly]]'', [[Life (magazine)#LIFE 2004|the 2004 version of ''Life'']], and ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]''. Newspaper supplements became common in France and Germany in the mid to late 19th century—they were called ''feuilleton'' in French. In Chinese, they are called [[Fukan literary supplement|fukan]]. In Hebrew, they are called "[[Mussaf|musaf]]".

'''Advertising supplements''' periodically accompany corresponding newspapers and are prepared by the paper's [[advertising]] staff instead of its editorial staff. It is common for them to cover topics such as [[real estate]] and [[automobile]]s on behalf of the paper's frequent advertisers.

Some supplements are [[Corporate spin-off|spin-offs]] from a newspaper. They are sold separately and typically cover a specific topic, such as the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' and the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]''

Supplements found on some DVDs, HD DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs are more commonly known as special features, bonus features, or bonus material.

In education, supplemental materials are educational materials designed to accompany or expand on the information presented on course textbooks. These can include printed materials, CDs, websites, or other electronic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HEOA - Higher Education Opportunity Act|url=http://usm.maine.edu/books/heoa-highter-education-opportunity-act|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[academic publishing]], some journals publish supplements, which often either cover an industry-funded conference or are "symposia" on a given topic. These supplements are often subsidized by an external sponsor. Such supplements can have guest editors,&lt;ref name=ICMJE_recommendations_2015/&gt; are often not peer-reviewed to the same standard as the journal itself, and are more likely to use promotional language.&lt;ref name=judging_QJM_2002/&gt; Many journals do not publish sponsored supplements.&lt;ref name=COImedJ_PLOS_2010/&gt; Small-circulation journals are more likely to publish supplements than large, high-prestige journals.&lt;ref name=ghost_JAMA_1998/&gt; Such supplements create [[conflicts of interest in academic publishing]].

'''''The Night at the Museum''''', published in 1993, is a [[Children's literature|children's]] [[picture book]] written and illustrated by [[Croatia]]n illustrator [[Milan Trenc]]. This book is Trenc's best known title, and in 2006 was produced as a feature film titled ''[[Night at the Museum]]''. In 2006, the movie was novelized by Leslie Goldman as a [[young adult fiction|book for young adults]].

==Original storyline==
Trenc's original book, ''The Night at the Museum'', is a picture story book for [[children]] about Hector, a [[Security guard|night watchman]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. On his first night at the job, he wakes up to find all of the dinosaur skeletons have vanished. He finds nothing looking around the museum, [[Central Park]], and at the [[planetarium]] next door. Eventually Hector discovers that the dinosaurs come alive every night, and rather than keep the museum safe from the world outside, his job is to keep the world outside safe from the dinosaurs inside.
A re-release was later brought to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] with a "now a major motion picture" sticker on it. This version changes Hector's name to Larry to resemble the main character of the movie.

Goldman's version of the book, ''Night at the Museum'', is an expanded version of Trenc's story. However, in this story every exhibit in the museum comes to life. After Larry tells his son about the strange things he sees at work every night, the son spends a night at the museum and finds out that the stories his father tells him are true.

This version was included on the [[New York Times Best Seller list]] in 2007, and was featured in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', ''[[The New York Post]]'' and ''[[Newsday]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) ''[http://barronseduc.stores.yahoo.net/0764135767.html Night at the Museum].''

Theakston argued that the publication of the story breached his right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, that the activities had taken place in private and therefore should be treated as confidential and that there was no public interest in publication. The ''Sunday People'' argued that the publication of the story was in the public interest given the concern of the British Broadcasting Corporation to ensure that presenters of programmes aimed at younger people conduct themselves appropriately in public.

The court were skeptical of Theakston's assertion that he only realised that he was in a brothel when other prostitutes entered the room.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swanturton.com/ebulletins/archive/JKCSexandprivacy.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Macedonian Museums-84-Kentro Istorias Thess-372.jpg|180px|thumb|View from outside]]
The '''Thessaloniki History Centre''' was established by the [[Municipal Council]] of [[Thessaloniki]], the largest city in northern [[Greece]], in 1983, and has occupied its present premises (the gift of Anastasios and Ioulia Billis) in Ippodromiou Square since 1995.

The purpose of the Centre is to collect, rescue, record, and preserve printed, written, and audio-visual material relating to the history of the city and wider area of Thessaloniki. It also promotes and facilitates historical research relating to Thessaloniki and seeks to rouse the interest of foreigners in the modern city and its historical past. It is governed by an Advisory Committee made up of distinguished scholars.

The Centre has preserved the Municipal Archive and is classifying it, and has also acquired a number of private archives by gift or purchase. It has built up a history library, comprising 4,000 books, 3,000 photographs, 5,000 [[postcard]]s, posters, [[videocassette]]s, and historical maps.

It publishes its research work with periodic exhibitions illustrating the historical continuity of Thessaloniki and the wider area of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], organizes conferences and lecture series, and hosts events organized by other institutions with related interests. The History Centre also produces a scholarly journal titled ''Thessaloniki'', containing original scholarly articles, and books on Thessaloniki and its history.

The Centre intends to convert the citys archives into electronic form to make them more accessible to researchers, and to link up to the [[Internet]] so that information and knowledge about the history of Thessaloniki will be accessible to a wider public.

The '''V&amp;A Museum of Childhood''' in [[Bethnal Green]] in the [[East End of London]] is a branch of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (the "V&amp;A"), which is the United Kingdom's national museum of applied arts.

==History==
[[File:Opening of the Bethnal Green Museum 1872 ILN.jpg|thumb|right|The official opening of the Bethnal Green Museum by the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] in 1872.]]
The museum was founded in 1872&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/art41998&lt;/ref&gt; as the '''Bethnal Green Museum'''.   The iron structure reused a prefabricated building from [[Albertopolis]] which was replaced with some early sections of the modern V&amp;A complex.  The exterior of the building was designed by [[James William Wild]] in red brick in a [[Rundbogenstil]] (round-arched) style very similar to that in contemporary Germany.

The building was used to display a variety of collections at different times, including the works which can now be seen at the [[Wallace Collection]]. In the 1920s, it began to focus on services for children, and in 1974 the director of the V&amp;A, [[Roy Strong|Sir Roy Strong]], defined it as a specialist museum of childhood.

Of all the branches, the Bethnal Green Museum has the largest collection of childhood objects in the United Kingdom.

The mission of the museum is ''"To enable everyone, especially the young, to explore and enjoy the designed world, in particular objects made for and made by children."'' It has extensive collections of toys, childhood equipment and costumes, and stages a programme of temporary exhibitions.

The museum closed in October 2005 for the second phase of extensive renovations, costing £4.7 million. It reopened on 9 December 2006&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/art41998&lt;/ref&gt; with changes including a new front entrance, gallery, displays and café.

Inside the museum is a cast iron statue by [[John Bell (sculptor)|John Bell]] (1811–1896). It came originally from  [[the Great Exhibition]] of 1851.  "The Eagle slayer" shows a marksman shooting at an eagle which has slain the lamb that lies at his feet.&lt;ref&gt;accessed 8 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|205816|accessdate= 8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Vita Edwardi Secundi''''' ('''''Life of Edward II''''') is a [[Latin]] [[chronicle]] most likely written in 1326 by an unknown [[English historians in the Middle Ages|English medieval historian]] contemporary to [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. It covers the period from 1307 until its abrupt end in 1326.

The earliest surviving version of the Vita is a copy made by [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]] in 1729 from a manuscript lent to him by James West. The original is thought to have been burnt some years later along with many of West’s other papers. 
The manuscript is known to have come from the [[Benedictine]] Abbey of [[Malmesbury Abbey|Malmesbury]], but it is not known if the work was written there.

The author is unknown, but aspects of his character can be inferred from his work. 
He was a highly educated person, shown in his use of biblical quotations and knowledgeable references to the [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]] of the time. He was likely to have been of advanced age, due to both his apparent death in 1326 and his despair at “the young men of today.” 
A popular candidate for the authorship of the Vita is a lawyer from Herefordshire and clerk to the [[Earl of Hereford]]: [[John Walwayn]].
The most recent theory about the date in which it was written was put forward by [[Professor C.J. Given-Wilson]].

'''WWWJDIC''' is an online [[Japanese dictionary]] based on the electronic dictionaries compiled and collected by [[People of Australia|Australian]] academic [[Jim Breen]]. The main Japanese–English dictionary files ([[EDICT]]) contain around 170,000&lt;ref name="EDICT#1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Breen |first=Jim |title=The EDICT Dictionary File |url=http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/edict.html |accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; entries, and the [[ENAMDICT]] dictionary contains over 720,000&lt;ref name="EDICT#1" /&gt; Japanese surnames, first names, place names and product names. WWWJDIC also contains several specialized dictionaries covering topics such as life sciences, law, computing, engineering, etc.

For example sentences with Japanese words, WWWJDIC makes use of a sentence database from the [[Tatoeba]] project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?14 Example Sentence Management System]&lt;/ref&gt; largely based on the Tanaka Corpus. Unlike the original Tanaka Corpus, the sentences from the Tatoeba project are not [[public domain]], but are available under the non-restrictive [[Creative Commons Attribution|CC-BY]] license. The sentence collection contains over one hundred and fifty thousand sentence pairs in Japanese and English.

In addition to Japanese–English, the dictionary has Japanese paired with German, French, Russian, Hungarian, Swedish, Spanish and Dutch. However, currently there are no example sentences for these languages.

The dictionary is updated freely and may be copied under its own licence arrangements.

Several mirror sites of the main WWWJDIC also exist around the world. These sites update daily from the home site at the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group (EDRDG).

'''''We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks''''' is a 2013 American [[Independent film|independent]] [[documentary film]] about [[WikiLeaks|the organization]] started by [[Julian Assange]], and people involved in the collection and distribution of secret information and media by [[whistleblower]]s. It covers a period of several decades, and includes considerable background material.

==Synopsis==
The 1989 [[WANK (computer worm)|WANK]] worm attack on [[NASA]] computers, originally thought to threaten the [[Galileo spacecraft]], is depicted as the work of Australian hackers, including Assange. The founding of Wikileaks in 2006 is followed by coverage of several key events: its 2009–2010 leaks about the [[2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis|Icelandic financial collapse]], [[Bank Julius Baer vs. WikiLeaks|Swiss banking tax evasion]], [[Corruption in Kenya|Kenyan government corruption]], [[2006 Ivory Coast toxic waste dump|toxic-waste dumping]], [[Chelsea Manning|Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning]]'s communications with [[Adrian Lamo]], uploads to Wikileaks of the [[Iraq War documents leak|Iraq]] and [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghanistan]] war documents, [[United States diplomatic cables leak|diplomatic cables]], and video, exposure to the FBI by Lamo, and the accusations of sexual assault made against Assange. Interview subjects include&lt;!-- not really "cast", are they?--&gt; [[Julian Assange]], [[Heather Brooke]], James Ball, Donald Bostom, [[Nick Davies]], [[Mark Davis (journalist)|Mark Davis]], Jason Edwards, Timothy Douglas Webster, [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]], [[Adrian Lamo]], [[J. William Leonard]], Gavin MacFadyen, [[Smári McCarthy]], [[Iain Overton]], [[Kevin Poulsen]] and [[Vaughan Smith]].&lt;ref name="VarietyReview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Reviews:Sundance:''We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks'' (Documentary)|first=Peter |last=Debruge |date=January 28, 2013 |publisher=''Variety''|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117949111/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6En1cUd6p |archivedate=March 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;!-- for interviewees list, since couldn't find the film's main website or press materials yet --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''We Steal Secrets'' has been widely praised by film reviewers, with film review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] noting that 92% of critics have reviewed the film positively.&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |title=''We Steal Secrets: The Story of Wikileaks'' (2013) |publisher=RottenTomatoes.com |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/we_steal_secrets_the_story_of_wikileaks_2013/ |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless it has been criticized by journalists and professors including [[Chris Hedges]],&lt;ref name="WSSSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/we_steal_secrets_state_agitprop_20130602 |first=Chris |last=Hedges |authorlink=Chris Hedges |title='We Steal Secrets': State Agitprop |work=[[Truthdig]] |date=June 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexa O'Brien]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien |first=Alexa |url=http://www.alexaobrien.com/secondsight/wikileaks/bradley_manning/a_review_of_alex_gibney_we_steal_secrest_story_of_wikileaks.html |title=A review of Alex Gibney's 'We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks' |publisher=Alexaobrien.com |date=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Manne]]&lt;ref name="Manne-monthly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2013/july/1372600800/robert-manne/we-steal-secrets-alex-gibney-wikileaks-julian-assange |title=We Steal Secrets: Alex Gibney, WikiLeaks &amp; Julian Assange |first=Robert |last=Manne |work=[[The Monthly]] |date=July 2013 |issue=91 |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was interviewed in the documentary.

''The Hollywood Reporter'' writer David Rooney found the film to be a "tremendously fascinating story told with probing insight and complexity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=''We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks'' Sundance Review|date=January 23, 2013| first= David |last=Rooney |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/we-steal-secrets-story-wikileaks/review/414964}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Edelstein of ''New York Magazine'' wrote that the film is a "twisty, probing, altogether enthralling movie," adding that it is "a documentary with the overflowing texture of fiction." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Why the Whistle Blows: ''We Steal Secrets'' explains how Julian Assanges are made|date=May 19, 2013| first= David |last=Edelstein |work=[[New York magazine]] |url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/we-steal-secrets-before-midnight-2013-5/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Rea]] of the ''Philadelphia Inquirer,'' who calls the film "riveting and revelatory," notes that the director "lines up an A-list of experts, observers, cohorts, and adversaries, tracing how Assange's and Manning's worlds collide - virtually, and violently - and how a noble quest for transparency and truth turned into a tale of conspiracy and paranoia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title='We Steal Secrets': Fascinating, real-life WikiLeaks thriller |date=June 7, 2013| first= Steven |last=Rea |work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/movies/20130607__We_Steal_Secrets___Fascinating_real-life_WikiLeaks_thriller.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reviewers have noted that despite the film's strengths, some flaws remain.  In the UK ''Guardian'', Jeremy Kay gave the film 3 of 5 stars, asserting that, although the film explored facts and themes thoroughly and thoughtfully, and provided "insightful commentary" from government, media, and WikiLeaks insiders, the film revealed little about Assange, who remained unavailable to be interviewed by the director. Kay wrote, "It's probably too soon for a meaningful perspective on the WikiLeaks saga."&lt;ref name="KayJan23"/&gt; In ''Variety'', Peter Debruge found the film "dramatically lacking" a central core conflict, especially when compared with Gibney's previous work. Like Kay in ''The Guardian'', Debruge found Manning's story the most compelling part of the film.&lt;ref name="VarietyReview"/&gt;

''We Steal Secrets'' was among five films nominated for the 2013 [[International Documentary Association]] ABC News Videosource Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/we-steal-secrets-blackfish-espns-651517 |title='We Steal Secrets,' 'Blackfish,' ESPN's '30 for 30' Among International Documentary Association Award Nominees |date=October 29, 2013 |first=Hilary |last=Lewis |work=Hollywood Reporter }}&lt;!-- but lost to Trials of Mohammed Ali --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Manne]], who was interviewed in the film, considered it to be a "superficially impressive but ultimately myopic film". He detailed his criticism in ''[[The Monthly]]''.&lt;ref name="Manne-monthly"/&gt; Based on this article Manne and Gibney had a written debate.&lt;ref name="Manne-Gibney-monthly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/blog/robert-manne/2013/07/01/1372650669/we-steal-secrets-response-alex-gibney |title=''We Steal Secrets:'' A response from Alex Gibney |first=Robert |last=Manne |date=July 1, 2013 |work=The Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Truthdig]]'' review, journalist [[Chris Hedges]] called the film "agitprop for the security and surveillance state," adding that it "dutifully peddles the state's contention that WikiLeaks is not a legitimate publisher and that [[Chelsea Manning]], who passed half a million classified Pentagon and State Department documents to WikiLeaks, is not a legitimate whistle-blower."&lt;ref name="WSSSA"/&gt; ''Salon'' reporter Andrew O'Hehir claimed that many of Hedges's statements about the film are patently false, and that his "alarming accusations and peculiar misreadings of the film" are "an attempt to attack Gibney's integrity and sabotage his reputation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/06/11/is_alex_gibneys_wikileaks_film_state_agitprop/ |title=Is Alex Gibney's WikiLeaks film "state agitprop"? |first=Andrew |last=O'Hehir |work=Salon.com |date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks published a transcript of the film, annotated with comments, asserted to be corrections, by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/414585/wikileaks-releases-transcript-of-critical-us-film |title=WikiLeaks releases transcript of critical US film |agency=Agence France-Presse |work=[[Inquirer.net]] |location=Philippines |date=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WLtranscript"&gt;{{cite web|title=Annotated Transcript of "We Steal Secrets" by Alex Gibney|url=https://wikileaks.org/IMG/html/gibney-transcript.html|publisher=WikiLeaks |date=May 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Gibney responded that the transcript was incomplete, lacked Private Manning's words, and was from an unreleased, incomplete version of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jordanzakarin/alex-gibney-blasts-wikileaks-accuses-group-of-selectively-ed |title=Alex Gibney Blasts WikiLeaks, Accuses Group Of 'Selectively Editing' Transcript Of His Film |date=May 25, 2013|first=Jordan| last=Zakarin |work=BuzzFeed}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Gibney published his own annotated version of the WikiLeaks transcript, responding to the criticisms and assertions made by Assange and his supporters.&lt;ref name="AGtranscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alex-gibney-fires-back-at-657677 |title=Alex Gibney Fires Back at Julian Assange: 'People Are Finally Seeing the Darker Side' (Exclusive) |first=Gregg |last=Kilday |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=November 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The WikiLeaks Organization's Annotated Transcript, with Response from the Filmmakers |author=WeStealSecrets |publisher=AmazonAWS.com |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/westealsecrets/html/annotated-transcript-response.html |date=November 16, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the film's executive producer [[Jemima Khan]], ''We Steal Secrets'' was "denounced before seeing" by Assange,&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jemima Khan on Julian Assange: how the Wikileaks founder alienated his allies|first=Jemima |last=Khan|authorlink=Jemima Khan |date=February 6, 2013 |work=[[New Statesman]] |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/02/jemima-khan-julian-assange-how-wikileaks-founder-alienated-his-allies|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who tweeted "an unethical and biased title in the context of pending criminal trials. It is the prosecution's claim and it is false".&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt; Khan asserted the title was based on a quote in the film "from [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]], a former director of the CIA, who told Gibney that the US government was in the business of 'stealing secrets' from other countries".&lt;ref name="Khan"/&gt;

'''Xmas''' is a common [[abbreviation]] of the word ''[[Christmas]]''. It is sometimes pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|m|ə|s}}, but ''Xmas'', and variants such as ''Xtemass'', originated as handwriting abbreviations for the typical pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|m|ə|s}}. The "X" comes from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter ''[[Chi (letter)|Chi]]'', which is the first letter of the Greek word ''Χριστός'', which in English is "[[Christ]]".&lt;ref name=oed-x&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= X n. 10. |encyclopedia= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230945#eid14045485 |year= 2011|accessdate= 17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "-mas" part is from the Latin-derived [[Old English]] word for ''[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09790b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Liturgy of the Mass]. Retrieved 20 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, in 1977 New Hampshire Governor [[Meldrim Thomson]] sent out a press release saying that he wanted journalists to keep the "Christ" in Christmas, and not call it Xmas—which he called a "[[pagan]]" spelling of Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JYMuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lKEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=912,1874288&amp;dq=xmas+christmas+x&amp;hl=en "X-mas is 'X'ing out Christ'", ''The Montreal Gazette'', December 8, 1977, accessed February 10, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of "X" for "Christ"===
{{For|the article about the χρ symbol|Chi Rho}}

[[Image:Chirho.svg|thumb|upright|The [[labarum]], often called the Chi-Rho, is a [[Christian]] symbol representing [[Christ]].]]
The abbreviation of Christmas as "Xmas" is the source of disagreement among Christians who observe the holiday. 

The December 1957 ''News and Views'' published by the [[Church League of America]], a conservative organization co-founded in 1937 by George Washington Robnett,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://libweb.uoregon.edu/speccoll/guides/conservative.html |title= Subject Guide to Conservative and Libertarian Materials, in Manuscript Collections |publisher= University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacked the use of Xmas in an article titled "X=The Unknown Quantity". The claims were picked up later by [[Gerald L. K. Smith]], who in December 1966 claimed that Xmas was a "blasphemous omission of the name of Christ" and that "'X' is referred to as being symbolical of the unknown quantity."  Smith further argued that Jews introduced Santa Claus to suppress the New Testament accounts of Jesus, and that the United Nations, at the behest of "world Jewry", had "outlawed the name of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link= Morris Kominsky |last= Kominsky |first= Morris |year= 1970 |title= The Hoaxers: Plain Liars, Fancy Liars and Damned Liars |pages= 137–138 |isbn= 0-8283-1288-5}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, a well documented history of use of ''Χ'' (actually a [[Chi (letter)|chi]]) as an abbreviation for "Christ" (Χριστός) and possibly also a symbol of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ancient-symbols.com/christian_symbols.html |title= Christian Symbols and Their Descriptions |publisher= Ancient-symbols.com |date= |accessdate= 8 December 2008}}{{unreliable source?|date= December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/family/xmas.htm |publisher= tlc.howstuffworks.com |title= Why Is There a Controversy Surrounding the Word 'Xmas'? |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}{{unreliable source?|date= December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation appears on many Orthodox Christian religious icons.

Dennis Bratcher, writing for a website for Christians, states "there are always those who loudly decry the use of the abbreviation 'Xmas' as some kind of blasphemy against Christ and Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crivoice.org/symbols/xmasorigin.html |title=The Origin of "Xmas" |publisher=CRI/Voice |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are evangelist [[Franklin Graham]] and [[CNN]] journalist [[Roland S. Martin]]. Graham stated in an interview: &lt;blockquote&gt;"for us as Christians, this is one of the most holy of the holidays, the birth of our savior Jesus Christ. And for people to take Christ out of Christmas. They're happy to say merry Xmas. Let's just take Jesus out. And really, I think, a war against the name of Jesus Christ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0512/16/ltm.02.html American Morning: A Conversation With Reverend Franklin Graham], CNN (December 16, 2005). Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Roland Martin likewise relates the use of "Xmas" to his growing concerns of increasing commercialization and secularization of one of Christianity's highest holy days.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Roland (December 20, 2007). [http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/20/roland.martin/index.html Commentary: You can't take Christ out of Christmas], CNN. Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bratcher posits that those who dislike abbreviating the word are unfamiliar with a long history of Christians using X in place of "Christ" for various purposes.

The word "[[Christ]]" and its compounds, including "Christmas", have been abbreviated in English for at least the past 1,000 years, long before the modern "Xmas" was commonly used. "Christ" was often written as "Xρ" or "Xt"; there are references in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' as far back as 1021. This X and P arose as the [[uppercase]] forms of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] [[Chi (letter)|χ]] (Ch) and [[rho|ρ]] (R) used in ancient abbreviations for Χριστος (Greek for "Christ").&lt;ref name=oed-x/&gt; The [[labarum]], an amalgamation of the two Greek letters rendered as ☧,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Unicode]] character Chi Rho (U+2627)&lt;/ref&gt; is a symbol often used to represent Christ in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestant]], and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christian Churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christiansymbols.net/monograms_2.php Christian Symbols: Chi-Rho] ''Christian Symbols'', Doug Gray, Retrieved 2009-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') and the ''OED Supplement'' have cited usages of "X-" or "Xp-" for "Christ-" as early as 1485. The terms "Xtian" and less commonly "Xpian" have also been used for "Christian". The ''OED'' further cites usage of "Xtianity" for "Christianity" from 1634.&lt;ref name=oed-x/&gt; According to ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', most of the evidence for these words comes from "educated Englishmen who knew their Greek".&lt;ref name=mwdeu&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;pg=PA968&amp;dq=Xmas+usage&amp;ei=zVZWSa6FJY6syASeyKHRAw "Xmas" article], ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', Merriam-Webster, 1994, p 968, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-132-4}}, retrieved via Google Books, December 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Christian art, χ and χρ are abbreviations for Christ's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10488a.htm |title=Monogram of Christ |publisher=New Advent |date=1911-10-01 |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many manuscripts of the ''[[New Testament]]'' and [[icon]]s, Χ is an abbreviation for Χριστος,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 'X' Factor |author=Rev. Steve Fritz |date=December 22, 2012 |accessdate=December 25, 2012 |publisher=Lancaster Online |url=http://lancasteronline.com/article/local/794883_The--X--factor.html#ixzz2FyDSVafN}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is XC (the first and last letters in Greek, using the lunate [[sigma (letter)|sigma]]);&lt;ref&gt;''Church Symbolism: An Explanation of the more Important Symbols of the Old and New Testament, the Primitive, the Mediaeval and the Modern Church'' by Frederick Roth Webber (2nd. edition, 1938). {{OCLC|236708}}&lt;/ref&gt; compare IC for [[Jesus]] in Greek.

====Other uses of "X(t)" for "Chris(t)-"====
Other proper names containing the name "Christ" besides those mentioned above are sometimes abbreviated similarly, either as "X" or "Xt", both of which have been used historically,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.all-acronyms.com/XT./Christ/1136835 "Abbreviation: Xt." Date retrieved: 19 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., "Xtopher" or "Xopher" for "Christopher", or "Xtina" or "Xina" for the name "Christina".

In the 17th and 18th centuries, "Xene" and "Exene" were common spellings for the given name Christine. The American singer [[Christina Aguilera]] has sometimes gone by the name "Xtina". Similarly, [[Exene Cervenka]] has been a noted American singer-songwriter since 1977.

This usage of "X" to spell the syllable "kris" (rather than the sounds "ks") has extended to "xtal" for "[[crystal]]", and on [[florist]]s' signs to "xant" for "[[chrysanthemum]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=13693&amp;lastnode_id=0 |title=X |publisher=Everything 2 |date= |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though these words are not etymologically related to "Christ": "crystal" comes from a Greek word meaning "ice" (and not even using the letter χ), and "chrysanthemum" comes from Greek words meaning "golden flower", while "Christ" comes from a Greek word meaning "anointed".

==In popular culture==
In the animated television series ''[[Futurama]]'', which is set in the 31st century, Xmas {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|m|ə|s}} is the official name for the day formerly known as Christmas (which, in the episode "[[Xmas Story]]", is said to have become an "archaic pronunciation").

In the American version of the board game ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', players can draw a card from the [[Chance and Community Chest cards|Community Chest]] which reads: "Xmas fund matures. Collect $100".
