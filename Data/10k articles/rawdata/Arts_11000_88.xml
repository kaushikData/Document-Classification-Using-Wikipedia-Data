      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5251">'''Anchor Graphics''' is a non-profit fine art printshop and gallery in [[Chicago, Illinois]] that is part of the Art + Design Department at [[Columbia College Chicago]]. It was founded in 1990 by David Jones and Marilyn Propp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-06-07/entertainment/9606070202_1_drawings-etching-prints|title=Anchor Shows Printmaking Process As Well As Product|publisher=Chicago Tribune|first=Barbara B. |last=Buchholz|date=7 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for the quality of its prints as well as its educational programming.&lt;ref&gt;Second Sight: Printmaking in Chicago 1935-1995," by James Yood. Essays by Mark Pascale, James Yood, and David Mickenberg (Mary and Leigh Block Gallery, Northwestern University, 1996), p. 50 and 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=demo3&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://issuu.com/columbiacollegepubs/docs/demo3|first=Anne|last=Wiens|title=The Fine Print|journal=Demo3|publisher=Columbia College|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
For twenty years, Anchor provided free classes for high school students, and had an outreach program called Press on Wheels (POW) which brought [[printmaking]] into schools, galleries, museums, and community centers.&lt;ref name=demo3 /&gt; Workshops were open to students of all ages who learned to create handmade prints. During the Toulouse-Lautrec and Rembrandt exhibitions at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], a press was brought to the museum, and Anchor staff demonstrated the print processes and tools used by both artists. Ann Weins writes in DEMO 3, pages 24–28: "Anchor Graphics maintains an impressive schedule of classes, workshops, residencies, and lectures, all the while publishing exquisite, hand-pulled prints."&lt;ref name=demo3 /&gt;

The Artist-in-Residence Program was created to provide uninterrupted use of the shop by national and international printmakers for research and the development of new work. Scraping the Surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colum.edu/academics/anchor-graphics/Education/Lecture_Series/Past_Lectures/McCay_Lecture.html|title=Winsor McCay|work=colum.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; a free lecture series open to the public, presented talks by artists, curators, museum specialists, conservators, collectors, and others with an interest in prints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colum.edu/academics/anchor-graphics/Information/history.html|title=History|work=colum.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was funded by the Terra Foundation for American Art from 2006 - 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terraamericanart.org/grant/anchor-graphics-columbia-college/&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in [[Ukrainian Village, Chicago|Ukrainian Village]], and then Chicago's [[Ukrainian Village, Chicago|River North]], Anchor moved to the [[Chicago Loop|South Loop]] upon becoming a part of the Art + Design Department at [[Columbia College Chicago]] in 2006. According to [[David Mickenberg]], former director of the David Museum and Cultural Center, and of the [[Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art|Block Museum]] at [[Northwestern University]], " [Anchor's reputation] has to do with. . .  the balancing act between education and collaborative printmaking. . . "&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-06-25/news/0606240244_1_contemporary-artists-prints-david-jones|title=Dropping Anchor at Columbia|publisher=Chicago Tribune|first=Jeff |last=Huebner|date=25 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anchor provides Artist-in-Residencies, open studio time for the Chicago community, adult classes, and publishing and contract work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11777">A '''book curse''' was a widely employed method of discouraging the thievery of [[manuscript]]s during the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period.  The use of book curses dates back much further, to pre-Christian times, when the wrath of gods was invoked to protect books and scrolls.

Usually invoking threat of excommunication, or [[anathema]], the more creative and dramatic detail the better. Generally located in the first or last page of a volume as part of the [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], these curses were often considered the only defense in protection of highly coveted books and manuscripts. This was notably a time in which people believed in curses, which was critical to its effect, thus believing if you stole or ripped out a page, you were destined to die an agonizing death.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drogin|first1=Marc|title=Anathema!: Medieval Scribes and the History of Book Curses|date=1983|publisher=Allanheld &amp; Schram|location=United States|isbn=0839003013|edition=First|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

“If anyone take away this book, let him die the death; let him be fried in a pan; let the falling sickness and fever size him; let him be broken on the wheel, and hanged. Amen.”&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"/&gt;

==History==

===Ancient curses===
The earliest known book curse can be traced to [[Ashurbanipal]], [[King of Assyria]] from 668 to 627 BCE, who had the following curse written on many or all of the tablets collected at the library at [[Ninevah]], considered to be the earliest example of a systematically collected library:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=11| website=History of Information|title=Knowledge as Power: The Earliest Systematically Collected Library as Distinct from an Archive (668 BCE – 627 BCE)|accessdate=September 14, 2014| author=Norton, Jeremy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have transcribed upon tablets the noble products of the work of the scribe which none of the kings who have gone before me had learned, together with the wisdom of [[Nabu]] insofar as it existeth [in writing]. I have arranged them in classes, I have revised them and I have placed them in my palace, that I, even I, the ruler who knoweth the light of Ashur, the king of the gods, may read them. Whosoever shall carry off this tablet, or shall inscribe his name on it, side by side with mine own, may Ashur and Belit overthrow him in wrath and anger, and may they destroy his name and posterity in the land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another curse from Ninevah states: "Whoever removes [the tablet], writes his name in the place of my name, may Ashur and Ninlil, angered and grim, cast him down, erase his name, his seed, in the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Casson, L. |date=2001|title= Libraries in the ancient world|location= New Haven|publisher= Yale University Press|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other book curses were more discreet: “He who fears Anu, Enlil, and Ea will return it to the owner’s house the same day”, and “He who fears Anu and Antu will take care of it and respect it”.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;
Because these tablets were made of clay, and thus easily vandalized, there were specific curses to protect against such acts, such as: “In the name of Nabu and Marduk, do not rub out the text!”&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nabu]] was the Babylonian god of writing and wisdom, son of [[Marduk]] and Sarpanitu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lurker|first=Manfred|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Gods, Goddesses, Devils &amp; Demons|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203685259|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more detailed curse to prevent vandalism went as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;He who breaks this tablet or puts it in water or rubs it until you cannot recognize it [and] cannot make it to be understood, may Ashur, Sin, Shamash, Adad and Ishtar, Bel, Nergal, Ishtar of Ninevah, Ishtar of Arbela, Ishtar of Bit Kidmurri, the gods of heaven and earth and the gods of Assyria, may all these curse him with a curse that cannot be relieved, terrible and merciless, as long as he lives, may they let his name, his seed, be carried off from the land, may they put his flesh in a dog’s mouth”.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 2001, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Medieval curses===
In their medieval usage, many of these [[curse]]s vowed that harsh repercussions would be inflicted on anyone who appropriated the work from its proper owner.  The punishments usually included [[excommunication]], [[damnation]], or [[anathema]].  Excommunication was the lightest of the curses because, in the Medieval Catholic Church, it was a reversible state.  Both excommunication and anathema required identification of the guilty party as well as action on the part of the Church.  Damnation had the benefit of not requiring human intervention as it was a state that the Creator, not the Church, visited instantly upon the soul of the perpetrator.  All three types of curses were considered to be effective deterrents against the book thief.

At the time, these curses provided a significant social and religious penalty for those who would steal or deface books, which were all considered to be precious works before the advent of the [[printing press]]. Writes Stephen Greenblatt, in ''The Swerve: How the Word Became Modern'': “Books were scarce and valuable. They conferred prestige on the monastery that possessed them, and the monks were not inclined to let them out of their sight. On occasion monasteries tried to secure their possession by freighting their precious manuscripts with curses.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Greenblatt, Stephen| title=The Swerve: How the World Became Modern| page= 30| date=2011| publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company| isbn=9780393064476|url=http://wwnorton.tumblr.com/post/11405167849/book-thief-curse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One oft-quoted example of a book curse, purportedly from a [[Barcelona]] monastery, is actually fictional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=Jan 1, 2012|work= Times Higher Education |author=Higgins, Colin |title=Marx, Pandora &amp; the Tower of Porn| url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/416409.article|date=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; taken from the 1909 hoax ''The Old Librarian's Almanack'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The History of a Hoax: Edmund Lester Pearson, John Cotton Dana, and the Old Librarian's Almanack. | publisher=Beta Phi Mu | author=Wiegand, Wayne A. | year=1979 | authorlink=Wayne A. Wiegand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And what Condemnation shall befit the accurst Wretch (for he cannot justly claim the title of Man) who pilfers and purloins for his own selfish ends such a precious article as a Book? I am reminded of the Warning display'd in the Library of the Popish Monastery of San Pedro at Barcelona. This is the version English'd by Sir Matthew Manhan, who saw it writ in Latin in the Monastery, as he himself describes in his learn'd Book, ''Travels in Spanish Countries'', 1712.

The Warning reads thusly: "For him that stealeth a Book from this Library, let it change to a Serpent in his hand and rend him. Let him be struck with [[Palsy]], and all his Members blasted. Let him languish in Pain, crying aloud for Mercy and let there be no surcease to his Agony till he sink to Dissolution. Let Book-worms gnaw his Entrails in token of the Worm that dieth not, and when at last he goeth to his final Punishment let the Flames of Hell consume him for ever and aye.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Medieval scribes wrote most curses in the book's [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]. This was the one place in a medieval manuscript where a scribe was free to write what he wished, so book curses tend to be unique to each book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kKE97gvmWQcC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=book+curse+on+colophon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l1V6sZlRZ4&amp;sig=l2a3SQ72DkM3y6_lLJYDbRCjBrM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w4kVVOr0CLSKsQTgpoLoCQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=book%20curse%20on%20colophon&amp;f=false|title=The Scribes for Women's Convents in Late Medieval Germany| author=Cyrus, Cynthia J. |page=162| publisher=University of Toronto Press|date= 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Little Book of Curses and Maledictions for Everyday Use|author=Downton, Dawn Rae|publisher= Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|date= December 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goodspeed, Edgar Johnson |title= The Curse in the Colophon| publisher= Willett, Clark, &amp; Company|date=1935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally, a clever scribe would put a curse in the form of a rhyme:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Steal not this book my honest friend
             For fear the gallows should be your end,

             And when you die the Lord will say
             And where's the book you stole away?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|year=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|isbn=9781602397064|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marc Drogin’s book, ''Anathema! Medieval Scribes and the History of Book Curses'',&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"/&gt; has been paramount in further understanding the concept of book curses, particularly those from the medieval ages, as he compiled the largest collection of curses thus far. According to Drogin, book curses are evidence of how valuable books were to the scribes and scholars of those days. Drogin also goes to some length in explaining how books were made in the era of monastic scribes, illuminated manuscripts, and parchment. The physical labor and resources necessary in producing a single volume serves to explain why scribes were so inclined to take drastic measures to protect them. 


May the sword of anathema slay

If anyone steals this book away. 


''Si quis furetur'',

''Anathematis ense necetur''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"/&gt;
==Document curse==
A significant subset of the book curse is the document curse. These curses were employed in much the same way as the book curse, but with one significant difference; while book curses almost always protected a physical book, document curses were generally worded to protect the text of the document that contained them. They were often found in wills, grants, charters and sometimes in writs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Danet, Brenda  |author2=Bogoch, Bryna Bogoch |lastauthoramp=yes |title='Whoever Alters this, may God Turn His Face from Him on the Day of Judgment': Curses in Anglo-Saxon Legal Documents|journal= The Journal of American Folklore |volume=105|number=416 |date=Spring 1992|pages= 132–165; page142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Boy with a Spinning-Top''''' or '''''Child with a Teetotum''''' is a 1738 painting by [[Jean Siméon Chardin]], now in the [[Louvre]] in Paris, which acquired it in 1907.&lt;ref name="louvre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=10854|website=cartelfr.louvre.fr|title=Site officiel du musée du Louvre|accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is based on [[:File:Jean_Siméon_Chardin_-_Retrato_de_Auguste_Gabriel_Godefroy.jpg|a 1735 work]] now in the [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] and shows Auguste-Gabriel, son of the jeweller Charles Godefroy, contemplating a [[teetotum]] or [[spinning top]], in line with [[Age of Enlightenment]] ideas on childhood and play, especially those of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. On the table in the background are an inkwell, a pen and books, whilst a drawer in the table is open to show a [[porte-crayon]].

'''Byron Bay''' is a beachside town located in the [[Northern Rivers|far-northeastern corner]] of the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is located {{convert|772|km|mi|0}} north of [[Sydney]] and {{convert|165|km|mi|0}} south of [[Brisbane]]. [[Cape Byron]], a headland adjacent to the town, is the easternmost point of mainland Australia. At the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]], the town had a permanent population of 9,246.&lt;ref name="abs"/&gt; The town is in turn the nucleus of [[Byron Shire]], which had 31,556 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Census 2016 AUS|id=LGA11350|name=Byron Shire |accessdate=1 October 2018|quick=on}}[[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016050101/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/# |date=16 October 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of Europeans in Byron Bay began in 1770, when Lieutenant [[James Cook]] found a safe anchorage and named [[Cape Byron]] after a fellow sailor [[John Byron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Penny |editor1-first=Justine |editor1-last=Vaisutis |title=Lonely Planet: Australia |edition= 15|date=November 2009 |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |isbn= |page= 195 |chapter= New South Wales |quote= The Grandfather of the [...] poet Lord Byron was a renowned navigator in the 1760s, and Captain Cook named this spot after [...] him. (In the 1880s, when Europeans settled more permanently, streets were named for other English writers and philosophers. A star-struck clerk in Sydney thought the grandson was the one being honoured, and named the streets – and the town – after poets: [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first industry in Byron was cedar logging from the Australian red cedar (''[[Toona ciliata]]''). The timber industry is the origin of the word "shoot" in many local names – Possum Shoot, Coopers Shoot and Skinners Shoot – where the timber-cutters would "shoot" the logs down the hills to be dragged to waiting ships.&lt;ref name="early_settlement"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://byronbayhistoricalsociety.org.au/development-of-byron-bay/early-settlement/# |title=Byron Bay Historical Society: Early Settlement |access-date=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815012228/http://byronbayhistoricalsociety.org.au/development-of-byron-bay/early-settlement/# |archive-date=15 August 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Timber getting became insignificant after [[World War I]] and many former timber workers became farmers.

Gold mining of the beaches was the next industry to occur. Up to 20 mining leases set up on Tallow Beach to extract gold from the black sands around the 1870s.

Byron Bay has a history of primary industrial production ([[dairy]] factory,&lt;ref&gt;''Creamery Tramway at Byron Bay'' Longworth, Jim [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], October 1996, pp. 295–298.&lt;/ref&gt; [[abattoirs]], fishing, and [[whaling]] until 1963) and was a significant, but hazardous, sea port. The poet Brunton Stephens spoke of cattle grazing on the "mossy plains" of Cape Byron in a poem he penned in 1876.

The first [[jetty]] was built in 1886, and the railway was connected in 1894, and Cavvanbah became Byron Bay in 1894.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; Dairy farmers cleared more land and settled the area.

The town has several beaches which are popular for [[surfing]]. It is a resort popular with both domestic and international tourists, including [[backpacking (urban)|backpackers]], who travel along the Australian coast; the scenery also attracts skydivers. The area is also noted for its wildlife, with the [[whale watching]] industry a significant contributor to the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/byron-bay-area/byron-bay|title=Byron Bay|publisher=Visit NSW|accessdate=19 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208035053/http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/north-coast/byron-bay-area/byron-bay#|archive-date=8 December 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[oceanway]] runs from the centre of town to the Cape Byron lighthouse. This allows visitors to walk and cycle to the lighthouse.

Temperate and tropical waters merge at Byron Bay, making it a popular area for [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkelling]]. Most diving is done at [[Julian Rocks]] which is part of the recently established [[Cape Byron Marine Park]] and only a few minutes boat ride from Main Beach.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Byron Bay also lies close to subtropical rainforests, and areas such as the [[Nightcap National Park]] with the [[Minyon Falls]] are all within easy reach of the town.

Byron Bay is now also a popular destination for [[Schoolies week]] during late November and early December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/byron-bay-schoolies-put-gold-coast-to-shame-20091130-jzb8.html|title=Byron Bay Schoolies 'put Gold Coast to shame'|date=30 November 2009|publisher=[[Brisbane Times]]|access-date=29 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203103359/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/byron-bay-schoolies-put-gold-coast-to-shame-20091130-jzb8.html#|archive-date=3 December 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Byron Bay Railroad Company|Byron Bay Train]] service will operate as a shuttle between Byron Bay station in the Byron township and North Beach station. The privately run service operates on a 3 km section of the disused [[Murwillumbah railway line|Murwillimbah line]]. It is expected to open by Christmas 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/city-file/article/worlds-first-solar-powered-train-heads-byron-bay|title=The World’s First Solar-Powered Train Heads to Byron Bay|work=Broadsheet|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029121255/https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/city-file/article/worlds-first-solar-powered-train-heads-byron-bay#|archive-date=29 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Byron Bay railway station]] was a stop on the [[Murwillumbah railway line|Casino to Murwillumbah railway line]] until 2004. It was served by trains from Sydney and for various periods also by services originating at Casino that connected with expresses running between Sydney and South Brisbane. A 3.4&amp;nbsp;km section of the Murwillumbah railway line is to be rehabilitated in 2016 for a two car self-propelled diesel train planned to run from the town centre to the Elements of Byron resort and nearby attractions.

An earlier local train service, known as the Byron Bay Tram conveyed passengers from about 1928 until about 1954 between the railway station and the "new jetty" where connections were made with passenger carrying ships of the North Coast Steam Navigation Company. Motive power was a Simplex petrol locomotive, locally known as the "Green Frog", and the passenger vehicles comprised former Newcastle B2 class steam tram trailer 74B and former Sydney C class electric tram C37. After the trams stopped running both the cars went to a heritage tramway in Parramatta Park where 74B was destroyed by fire. The Simplex was built in Bedford England and went into service in 1923 shunting freight to and from the "old" jetty adjacent to the township and then to "new" jetty to the north when it was completed in 1928. Later it hauled whales from the jetty to the rendering down works, livestock to the meat works, mineral sands and meat wagons to the station for onward movement and regularly shunted Norco and other railway sidings and between these duties ran the passenger tramway until the coastal passenger shipping service stopped. The Simplex locomotive was retired in 1984 when the meat works closed and is now stored in a shed near the Kendall Street level crossing under the care of volunteers and the Byron Bay Council.

== Education ==
Byron Bay schools include Byron Bay Public School, [[Byron Bay High School]], St Finbarr's Primary School, Byron Bay Community School, and [[Cape Byron Rudolf Steiner School]].

== Sport and recreation ==
The Byron Bay Surf Club is the longest-standing current sports club; it has been one of Australia's leading surf clubs and has been in continuous operation for more than 105 years. The [[rugby league]] club the [[Byron Bay Red Devils]] and the [[Australian rules football]] team [[Byron Football Club|Byron Magpies]] are well known.

== In fiction ==

John Macgregor's 1986 novel ''[[Propinquity (novel)|Propinquity]]'' is partly set in Byron Bay and nearby [[Mullumbimby]]. The 2008/2009 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] drama series ''[[East of Everything]]'', written by [[Deb Cox]] and Roger Monk, is set in the fictional town of Broken Bay which is based on a somewhat more run-down version of Byron Bay and its surrounds, with much of the filming taking place in and around Byron Bay including obviously recognisable landmarks such as the lighthouse and local beaches. The town also features in the 2016 [[open world]] racing video game, ''[[Forza Horizon 3]]''.

'''''Calm Waters''''' is a 2013 large glass and paint installation by artist [[Katherine Bradford]]. It is located on the [[Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital|Eskenazi Health]] campus, near downtown [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], and is part of the [[Eskenazi Health Art Collection]].

== Description ==
''Calm Waters'' is a 2013 mixed-media [[Installation art|installation]] by artist Kathy Bradford, which consists of seven panels of ⅜-inch thick glass that sit several inches in front of a painted abstract pattern resembling waves in blue, gray, and teal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/calm-waters|title=Calm Waters {{!}} Public Art Archive|website=www.publicartarchive.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The glass panels consist of sand-carved clear laminated glass and clear, white, and gray etched glass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A technique known as glue-chipping, which creates a sparkle effect, is also used on the panels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The layered arrangement of glass and paint, which measures 77" x 238" overall, creates the illusion of both notable depth and change or movement as pedestrians walk past. Of the work's subject and purpose, the artist says:

“This imagery is of a large body of calm water with cloud reflections throughout the composition. This imagery is intended to transport the thoughts of the viewer, creating relaxation and calmness. Combining the art glass with the painted wall behind the glass surface creates multiple colors shifting throughout the composition. It is intended to intrigue the viewer and encourage further investigation.” -Kathy Bradford&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Historical information ==

=== Acquisition ===
''Calm Waters'' was commissioned by [[Eskenazi Health Art Collection|Eskenazi Health]] as part of a re-imagining of the organization's [[Eskenazi Health Art Collection|historical art collection]] and to support "the sense of optimism, vitality and energy" of its new [[Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital|campus]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-hospitals-use-the-healing-powers-of-public-art-1408404629|title=More Hospitals Use the Healing Powers of Public Art|last=Landro|first=Laura|date=2014-08-18|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eskenazihealth.edu/news/wishard-announces-first-group-of-artists-selected-for-eskenazi-health-art-program|title=Wishard Announces First Group of Artists Selected for Eskenazi Health Art Program|website=www.eskenazihealth.edu|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to its nationwide request for proposals, Eskenazi Health received more than 500 submissions from 39 states, which were then narrowed to 54 finalists by an independent jury.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each of the 54 proposals was assigned an area of the new hospital by Eskenazi Health's art committee and publicly displayed in the existing Wishard Hospital and online for public comment; more than 3,000 public comments on the final proposals were collected and analyzed in the final selection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/opinion/article_edd723f6-50ac-11e0-82d5-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Support Wishard's pursuit  of the highest art|work=Indianapolis Recorder Newspaper|access-date=2017-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Calm Waters'' is credited as "Dedicated with gratitude, Prof. N.L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7352">'''Chancellor and Patrick''' was a [[Melbourne]] based architecture firm, formed in 1953 and dissolved in 1981, is best known for their numerous houses from the mid 1950s to the mid 1960s, designed in their signature dynamic, expressive take on 'organic' architecture.

==The practice==
William Rex Patrick (born 28 October 1927) ventured into architecture at a young age, entering into articles at the office of Parnell and Pierce aged 14 for six months. He then studied at Brighton Technical School, went on to the Melbourne Technical College Architecture Course, and finally the School of Architecture at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1949.
David Chancellor (born 7 September 1926) studied civil engineering from 1943-45 at the Melbourne Technical College, served two years in the Navy, then went on to the School of Architecture at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1951. The two met at the firm [[Yuncken Freeman]] Brothers in late 1951, where they formed a close working relationship, submitting several competitions together. Chancellor set up his own firm in the distant beachside suburb of [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]] in 1952, and Patrick joined him formally in the middle of 1954, establishing the practice of Chancellor and Patrick. In 1958, they established a second office in [[South Yarra]], continued to prosper, and built up a practice that eventually employed 30 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Callister|first1=Winsome|title=Anchoring Identity: The architecture of Chancellor and Patrick 1950–1970 PhD Dissertation|date=2007|publisher=Monash University|url=http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/479135|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor and Patrick began with a variety of expressive houses, mostly holiday homes, on the [[Mornington Peninsula]], where the firm began. They soon developed their own distinctive style; an amalgam of features of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie and Usonian houses, the houses of Californian architect [[Harwell Hamilton Harris]], and their own innovations. They featured dynamic plans, emphasised by projecting intersecting wings or bays with expressed, overhanging gable or flat roofs, dramatic cantilevers, strong horizontals with occasional verticals, off-centre supports, expressed structure, butt-jointed corner windows, and integration with the landscape. Many can be found on the Peninsula, as well as many dotted around the 1950s and 60s suburbs and area of Melbourne, especially the Bayside suburbs. They are said to have designed (if not built) over 1000 houses in their career. Their houses of the late 1960s onwards were often larger, and evolved into brown brick, skillion roofed compositions, more ground hugging, and more in tune with the 'environmental' designs of their contemporaries.  Throughout their career, they also designed many non-residential projects, including a number of churches, pre-school buildings and a hospital, as well as banks and other commercial work. Their largest projects were the all the halls of residence at Monash University, and Chisholm College at La Trobe University.

==Notable projects==
===McCraith House===
[[File:McCraith House Dromana 2012.JPG|thumb|McCraith House]]
The [[McCraith House]], commonly known as the Butterfly House, was built on the sleepy bush blackboards&lt;ref name=abc&gt;ABC Sunday Arts: [http://www.abc.net.au/tv/sundayarts/txt/s1791154.htm "Butterfly House"], 19 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; of the Mornington Peninsula for Ellen and Gerald McCraith in 1954&lt;ref name=theage&gt;Dixon-Ward, Bin and Kate MacNeill: [http://www.theage.com.au/national/obituaries/rabbit-trader-who-loved-orchids-20090708-ddfg.html?page=-1 "Rabbit trader who loved orchids"], in ''[[The Age]]'', 9 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; by Chancellor and Patrick.  The McCraith House is an example of structural inspired modernism &lt;ref name=heritage&gt;Victorian Heritage Register: [http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/places/heritage/4654 "McCraith House"]&lt;/ref&gt; in Victoria in the 1950s with its cutting-edge design and ground-breaking structural engineering,&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; of triangular tubular steel framing system and butterfly roof. Positioned strategically on a stone-walled plinth overlooking Port Philip Bay,&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; the house remains in the same family, complete with original interiors, furniture and even crockery all of which was donated to RMIT in 2013, and the house now houses their writers in residence program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage award for modernist ‘Butterfly House’|url=https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2015/october/heritage-award-for-modernist-butterfly-house/|website=RMIT Australia|publisher=RMIT University|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ES&amp;A Bank Building===
The former '''ES&amp;A Bank Building''' was built on the corner of Elizabeth and Franklin Street, Melbourne, in 1959-60 by Melbourne architects Chancellor and Patrick.&lt;ref name=RAIA&gt;Royal Australian Institute of Architects RSTA Register08 – www.architecture.com.au/i-cms_file?page=4048/VicRegister08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended to be a 12-storey office tower, only the base banking chamber section was built at the time. The most distinctive features of the building are the massive rock-faced random coursed Dromana granite pier/wall sections, dominating the side elevation, topped by a thin floating slab roof projecting over the recessed front elevation. The space between the stone piers on the Franklin Street elevation is filled with a patterned, vertical ribbed concrete screen. The building is considered to display influences from International modernism, and the organic sensibilities of Frank Lloyd Wright as well as the Griffins.&lt;ref name=20th&gt;''Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Architecture'' Volume 1 A-F, R. Stephen Sennott p163&lt;/ref&gt; The extra floors were added in 2004, but as an apartment building with regular glass balconies, rather than the originally proposed solid masonry balconies projecting every second floor, and various changes to the original base section have infilled openings in the front facade, and undermined the floating qualities of the original roof.

===Freiberg House===
The [[Freiberg House]] was built in 1958-60 on a sloping site as a residence for the Freiberg family and is located at 26 Yarravale Road Kew, Victoria. Featured on the cover of Best Australian Houses (1961), edited by Neil Clerehan, the Freiberg house is a significant example of the work of Chancellor and Patrick. It features most of the hallmarks of their subsequent 1960s houses, such as projecting wings on a cruciform or pin-wheel plan, each with gable roofs, dramatic projecting cantilevered ends, overhanging eaves, expressed post-and-beam construction, off-center spaces under otherwise centered roofs, and a central solid spine, containing the entry and main stairs. It is also notable for having the first entirely native garden planned by Edna Walling, with whom Chancellor and Patrick was a long-time collaborator.

'''Hans Conrad Schumann''' (March 28, 1942 – June 20, 1998) was an [[East Germany|East German]] soldier who defected to [[West Germany]] during the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961.

==Early life==
Born in Zschochau, Saxony during the middle of [[World War II]], Schumann enlisted in the East German [[Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft|Bereitschaftspolizei]] (state police) following his 18th birthday. After three months' training in [[Dresden]], he was posted to a non-commissioned officers' college in [[Potsdam]], after which he volunteered for service in [[Berlin]].

==Defection to West Germany==
On 15 August 1961, the 19-year-old Schumann was sent to the corner of Ruppiner Straße and [[Bernauer Straße]] to guard the Berlin Wall on its third day of construction. At that time and place, the wall was only a single coil of [[concertina wire]]. From the other side, West Germans shouted to him, "''Komm' rüber!''" ("Come over!"), and a police car pulled up to wait for him. Schumann jumped over the barbed wire while dropping his [[PPSh-41]] submachine gun and was promptly driven away from the scene by the West Berlin police. West German photographer [[Peter Leibing]] photographed Schumann's escape. His picture has since become an iconic image of the [[Cold War]] era and featured at the beginning of the 1982 Disney film ''[[Night Crossing]]''. The scene, including Schumann's preparations, has also been filmed on 16-mm film from the same perspective.

Schumann was later permitted to travel from West Berlin to the main territory of [[West Germany]], where he settled in [[Bavaria]]. In 1962, he met and married his wife Kunigunde (Gunda) in the town of [[Günzburg]], whom he later had a son with in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;CONRAD SCHUMANN, 56, SYMBOL OF E. BERLIN ESCAPES; [NORTH SPORTS FINAL Edition]
Associated Press. Chicago Tribune. Chicago, Ill.: Jun 23, 1998. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; He took up a new job at a winery, and eventually at the Audi car assembly factory in [[Ingolstadt]] where he worked for nearly 30 years.

==Later life and death==
[[File:Mauerstreifen Schumann Berlin.jpg|thumb|Sculpture called ''Mauerspringer'' ("Wall jumper") by Florian and Michael Brauer and Edward Anders]]
[[File:SarahEwart-094.JPG|thumb|Schumann inspired graffiti on the [[East Side Gallery]]]]
After the fall of the Berlin Wall he said, "Only since 9 November 1989 [the date of the fall] have I felt truly free." Even so, he continued to feel more at home in Bavaria than in his birthplace, citing old frictions with his former colleagues, and was even hesitant to visit his parents and siblings in [[Saxony]]. On 20 June 1998, suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], he committed [[suicide]], [[hanging]] himself in his orchard near the town of [[Kipfenberg]] in [[Upper Bavaria]]. His body was found by his wife a few hours later.&lt;ref&gt;"Escaped soldier found hanged"
DENIS STAUNTON. The Guardian. Manchester (UK): Jun 22, 1998. p. K2&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the photograph of Schumann's "leap into freedom" was inducted into the [[UNESCO]] Memory of the World programme as part of a collection of documents on the fall of the Berlin Wall.&lt;ref&gt;Diekmann, Kai. ''Die Mauer. Fakten, Bilder, Schicksale''. München: Piper, 2011 ({{ISBN|978-3-492-05485-0}}), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German Commission for UNESCO, [http://www.unesco.de/mow-deutschland.html World Documentary Heritage in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monument==
A sculpture called ''Mauerspringer'' ("Walljumper") by Florian and Michael Brauer and Edward Anders could be seen close to the site of the defection,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/picturesoftheday/5939092/Pictures-of-the-day-30-July-2009.html?image=27 "Pictures of the day: 30 July 2009" ''The Telegraph'' (UK): Jul 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; but has since been moved to the side of a building on Brunnenstraße, several meters south of Bernauer Straße.

'''Emigre''', also known as Emigre Graphics, is a digital [[type foundry]], publisher and distributor of [[graphic design]] centered information based in [[Berkeley, California]], that was founded in 1984 by husband-and-wife team [[Rudy VanderLans]] and [[Zuzana Licko]].&lt;ref name="emigre.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emigre.com/AboutEmigre.php|title=About Emigre|website=www.emigre.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type foundry also published [[Emigre magazine|''Emigre'' magazine]] between 1984 and 2005.  Note that unlike the word ''[[émigré]]'', Emigre is officially spelled without accents.

==History==

Emigre was founded in 1984 as an independent [[foundry]], developing [[typeface]]s without an association to a typesetting equipment manufacturer. Coinciding with the advent of the [[Macintosh]] computer, Emigre took advantage of the new medium to design digital typefaces, as such they did not require the manufacturing infrastructure of a traditional type foundry. Licko began designing fonts that, rather than trying to imitate letterpress technology, capitalized on the idiosyncrasies of [[bitmap]] design and [[dot matrix printing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emigre.com/Licko.php|title=Emigre Fonts: Interview with Zuzana Licko|website=www.emigre.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later, [[vector graphics|vector-based design]].&lt;ref&gt;Bringhurst, Robert. ''The Elements of Typographic Style'', Hartley &amp; Marks (2004), page 134: "Licko has exploited the harsh economies of digital plotting routines, slicing from control point to control point not with a knife, file or chisel but with digitized straight lines."&lt;/ref&gt; The company is credited with being the first type foundry to design original fonts made on and for a computer.&lt;ref name="fastcodesign.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1661918/type-master-an-interview-with-emigres-rudy-vanderlans|title=Type Master: An Interview with Emigre’s Rudy VanderLans|date=15 July 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Through a good part of the late 1980s and most of the 1990s, some of the most cutting-edge typefaces were developed or released by Emigre. Its magazine, in the meantime, provided an outlet showcasing the potential of its typeface designs, and was well known for its graphical experimentation, criticism and essays on contemporary design.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Steven and Fili, Louise. ''Stylepedia: A Guide to Graphic Design Mannerisms, Quirks, and Conceits'', Chronicle Books (2006), page 121: "What ''Emigre'' initiated was co-opted by the new mainstream -- from fashion magazines to MTV. Stylistically ''Emigre'' was not just the standard bearer, it was the bearer of standards for experimental digital typography."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fastcodesign.com"/&gt; Many Emigre fonts belonged to what would later be described as the ''grunge typography'' movement, though others such as Licko's [[Mrs Eaves]] did not clearly fit into this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shetty|first1=Sharan|title=The Rise &amp; Fall of Grunge Typography|url=http://www.theawl.com/2012/08/grunge-typography|website=The Awl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigre was often criticized for rejecting standard design rules. [[Designer]] [[Massimo Vignelli]] was highly critical against Emigre and viewed their designs as a direct threat to [[Modernist]] ideals. Vignelli called Emigre a "typographic garbage factory," and to him, their work represented "the degradation of culture." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/1.05/emigre.html|title=Emigre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=3&amp;id=8|title=Emigre Essays|website=www.emigre.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite denunciation from traditionalists in the realm of design, Emigre became influential in the field. "People read best what they read most," was a manifesto that VanderLans and Licko held to when facing critics. Citing that what is deemed readable is only so because of the prevalence of a particular font.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books? id=LEuBNKx4hywC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%22people+read+best+what+they+read+most%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oiK_SQAGqx&amp;sig=1YgH4hLpN8zVd540l7MF7xrMAZU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BkzVTq6cOePr0gGctcTnAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22people%20read%20best%20what%20they%20read%20most%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Vignelli, even after strongly criticizing the work of Emigre, directly promoted Licko's font Filosofia, to which Licko responded, "Massimo's willingness to collaborate on our announcement reflects Emigre's ability to bridge different approaches." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiga.org/medalist-zuzanalickoandrudyvanderlans/|title=Zuzana Licko and Rudy VanderLans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Fine Art Society 9906158113.jpg|thumb|The Fine Art Society, London]]
The '''Fine Art Society''' is a gallery in Dundas Street in [[Edinburgh]]'s [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] (originally Bourne Fine Art, established 1978). The [[New Bond Street]], [[London]] gallery closed its doors in August 2018 after being occupied by The Fine Art Society since February 1876, the entrance facade of which was built in 1881 by [[Edward William Godwin]] (1833–1886).

==History==
Founded in 1876 by a group of like-minded men led by William Longman of the publishing family, [[Marcus Bourne Huish]] (1843–1904), lawyer, editor, writer and collector, who became the first Managing Director while at the same time editing ''[[The Art Journal]]''; and [[Archibald Stuart-Wortley (politician)|Archibald Stuart-Wortley MP]].  The gallery, first managed by Ernest Brown (later founder of [[Leicester Galleries]]) has for many years largely concentrated on British art and design from 1600 to the present day; with the Edinburgh premises specialising in Scottish art of the same period. The Edinburgh branch of the company is directed by Emily Walsh.  The Chairmen were all drawn from the Longman family until the death of Mark Longman in 1972. Since then only Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden KT (until 1998), Sir Angus Grossart (until 2016) and Robin Holland-Martin (current) have held the position. Only seven people have held the position of Managing Director in the past 139 years, the last being Pippa Stockdale.

The Fine Art Society has taken part in key international art fairs over the years, most notably at [[TEFAF]] Maastricht, Masterpiece, London, [[Frieze Masters]], London and at the [[London Original Print Fair]], whose founder and chairman, Gordon Cooke, is also the society's 19th and 20th century prints specialist. The society has also exhibited in art fairs in New York, Miami, Hong Kong, Paris and Dubai.

==Exhibitions==
The gallery is also known as the pioneer of the one-man exhibition, most famously that of [[James McNeill Whistler]]'s First Venice Set of etchings in December 1880; the gallery having sent Whistler to [[Venice]] in 1879 in part to enable him to escape from the issues following his libel action against [[John Ruskin]]. The commission was for Whistler to travel to Venice for three months to create a series of twelve etchings. Beguiled by the city, he stayed for fourteen months and completed approximately fifty etchings. Venice also inspired Whistler to make some hundred works in pastel, of which 53 were shown in the Venice Pastels exhibition in 1881. During Whistler's absence in Venice, the gallery showed his antagonist John Ruskin's private Collection of Watercolours by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and ran a subscription to pay for Ruskin's legal costs: a supreme exhibition of political sleight of hand. Other living exhibitors at the London premises included [[Sir John Everett Millais]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Burne-Jones]], [[Frank Brangwyn]], [[Walter Richard Sickert]], [[Walter Crane]], [[George Washington Lambert]], [[Henry Charles Brewer]] and [[Joseph Southall]], and more recently [[Leonard Rosoman]], Emma Sargent, [[Emily Young]], [[John Byrne (playwright)|John Byrne]], [[Alexander Stoddart]] and Geoffrey Clarke.  Of many memorial exhibitions held,  one was for [[Lady Alma Tadema]] in 1910.

A Contemporary gallery was created in 2005, originally managed by Toby Clarke, subsequently by [[Kate Bryan]], and most recently by Lee Cavaliere. Sara Terzi is now the Contemporary art specialist at the gallery. The Contemporary team have embraced the nineteenth and twentieth century heritage of the gallery and increased cross-cultural links, particularly in Asia, Australia and the US. Among the artists shown are [[Chris Levine]], Angela Palmer, [[Annie Kevans]], [http://thefineartsociety.com/artists/35-jacky-tsai/overview/ Jacky Tsai] and [http://thefineartsociety.com/artists/27-bartholomew-beal/overview/ Bartholomew Beal].

In October 2014 The Fine Art Society Contemporary staged the first exhibition to be held at the gallery across all 5 floors, 'What Marcel Duchamp Taught Me.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://howtospendit.ft.com/art/65691-what-marcel-duchamp-taught-me|title = What Marcel Duchamp Taught Me|website = How To Spend It|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/09/marcel-duchamp-exhibition-celebrate-father-conceptual-art|title = Marcel Duchamp: exhibition to celebrate father of conceptual art|last = Brown|first = Mark|date = 2014-10-09|last2 = correspondent|first2 = arts|newspaper = The Guardian|language = en-GB|issn = 0261-3077|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition featured artwork by 50 contemporary global artists including [[Peter Blake (artist)|Sir Peter Blake]], [[Cornelia Parker]], [[Gavin Turk]], [[Chris Levine]], [[Conrad Shawcross]], [[Keith Tyson]], [[Michael Craig-Martin]], [[Jonathan Yeo]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Idris Khan]], [[Annie Kevans]] and [[Charming Baker.]] The exhibition curated by [[Kate Bryan]] was one of the most successful in the history of the gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/artists-to-pay-respects-to-marcel-duchamp-in-new-exhibition-9773803.html|title = Artists to pay respects to the revolutionary Marcel Duchamp in new|website = The Independent|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marked 100 years since [[Marcel Duchamp]] created the [[Found object|readymade]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">The '''Forum AID Award''' is a [[Scandinavia|Nordic]] architecture and design award, given annually by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] magazine Forum AID. AID is an acronym for the three subject-matters of the magazine - Architecture, Interior design and Design - and it is also the three categories of the award. It is given to the designers of the "Best Building [interior design and design in the Nordic Countries" that year. The award was founded in 2004 and is presented at a ceremony in [[Stockholm]]

The selection process is carried out in two stages. Each Nordic country is represented through its selection committee. The task of the committees is to select the best objects in their respective countries or by their countrymen abroad. The committees choose freely from those objects that had been carried out during the period October 1, to September 30, the year before. The winner is chosen by an international jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.forumaid.com/eng/news/|title=News|publisher=Forum AID|accessdate=2009-05-09}}{{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hovnatanian''' family ({{lang-hy|Հովնաթանյաններ}}, ''Hovnat'anyanner'') was a prominent [[Armenians|Armenian]] family of painters. They include five generations from 17th to 19th centuries. Hovnatanians are originally from the village of [[Şurud|Shorot]], [[Alinja|Yernjak district]] in Nakhichevan (now [[Şurud]] village in [[Julfa Rayon]], [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], Azerbaijan).

They were based on Nakhichevan, [[Yerevan]], [[Tbilisi]], [[Ejmiatsin]], [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Persia]]. Most of their works are dedicated to Christianity like other works of their era.

The surname derives from ''Hovnatan'', the Armenian equivalent of [[Jonathan (name)|Jonathan]].

He drew a parallel to the [[Copernican Revolution#Immanuel Kant|Copernican revolution]] in his proposition that worldly objects can be intuited ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' ("beforehand"), and that [[intuition]] is therefore independent from [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective reality]].&lt;ref&gt;"We here propose to do just what [[Copernicus]] did in attempting to explain the celestial movements. When he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved round the spectator, he reversed the process, and tried the experiment of assuming that the spectator revolved... We may make the same experiment with regard to the intuition of objects. If the intuition must conform to the nature of the objects, I do not see how we can know anything of them ''a priori''. If, on the other hand, the object conforms to the nature of our faculty of intuition, I can then easily conceive the possibility of such an ''a priori'' knowledge." Kant, Immanuel. Translated by [[John Meiklejohn|J. M. D. Meiklejohn]], ''Critique of Pure Reason''.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant believed that [[reason]] is the source of [[morality]], and that [[aesthetics]] arise from a faculty of disinterested judgment. Kant's views continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy, especially the fields of [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[political theory]], and [[Aesthetics#Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis|post-modern aesthetics]].

In one of Kant's major works, the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|last2=Kitcher|first2=Patricia (intro.)|last3=Pluhar|first3=W. (trans.)|title=Critique of Pure Reason|publisher=Hackett|year=1996|location=Indianapolis |page=xxviii |isbn= |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; he attempted to explain the relationship between reason and human experience and to move beyond the failures of traditional philosophy and [[metaphysics]]. Kant wanted to put an end to an era of futile and speculative theories of human experience, while resisting the [[Philosophical skepticism|skepticism]] of thinkers such as [[David Hume]]. Kant regarded himself as showing the way past the impasse between [[rationalists]] and [[empiricists]] which philosophy had led to,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vanzo|first1=Alberto|title=Kant on Empiricism and Rationalism|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=30|issue=1|pages=53–74|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/59913}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely held to have synthesized both traditions in his thought.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

Kant was an exponent of the idea that [[perpetual peace]] could be secured through universal [[democracy]] and [[international cooperation]]. He believed that this would be the eventual outcome of [[universal history]], although it is not rationally planned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose]].&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of Kant's religious ideas continues to be the subject of philosophical dispute, with viewpoints ranging from the impression that he was an initial advocate of [[atheism]] who at some point developed an [[ontological argument]] for God, to more critical treatments epitomized by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], who claimed that Kant had "theologian blood"&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, [[The Antichrist (book)|''The Anti-Christ'']] (1895), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DcVl57jzP2gC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=%22theologian+blood%22+the+antichrist#v=onepage&amp;q=%22theologian%20blood%22%20the%20antichrist para. 10].&lt;/ref&gt; and was merely a sophisticated [[apologist]] for traditional [[Christian]] faith.{{efn|Nietzsche wrote that "Kant wanted to prove, in a way that would dumbfound the common man, that the common man was right: that was the secret joke of this soul."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche (trans. [[Walter Arnold Kaufmann]]), ''The Portable Nietzsche'', 1976, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These include the ''[[Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens|Universal Natural History]]'' (1755), the ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' (1788), the ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (1797), and the ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (1790), which looks at aesthetics and [[teleology]].

==Biography==
Kant's mother, Anna Regina Reuter&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url=http://www.koenigsberg-is-dead.de/I_Cosmopolis.html| title=Cosmopolis| publisher=Koenigsberg-is-dead.de| date=23 April 2001| accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1697–1737), was born in [[Königsberg]] (since 1946 the city of [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]]) to a father from [[Nuremberg]]. (Her surname is sometimes erroneously given as Porter.) Kant's father, Johann Georg Kant (1682–1746), was a German harness maker from [[Klaipėda|Memel]], at the time Prussia's most northeastern city (now [[Klaipėda]], [[Lithuania]]). Immanuel Kant believed that his paternal grandfather Hans Kant was of Scottish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Mortensen, Hans and Gertrud, ''Kants väterliche Ahnen und ihre Umwelt, Rede von 1952 in Jahrbuch der Albertus-Universität zu Königsberg'', Pr., Holzner-Verlag, Kitzingen, Main 1953, Vol. 3, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; While scholars of Kant's life long accepted the claim, there is no evidence that Kant's paternal line was Scottish; it is more likely that the Kants got their name from the village of Kantwaggen (today part of [[Priekulė, Lithuania|Priekulė]]) and were of [[Curonians|Curonian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Murray, "The Origin of Immanuel Kant's Family Name", ''Kantian Review'' '''13'''(1), March 2008, pp. 190-193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Kohlheim, Volker Kohlheim, ''Duden – Familiennamen: Herkunft und Bedeutung von 20.000 Nachnamen'', Bibliographisches Institut &amp; F. A. Brockhaus AG, Mannheim 2005, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was the fourth of nine children (four of whom reached adulthood).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freunde-kants.com/attachments/article/137/Bohnenrede%202015%20(de).pdf freunde-kants.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925124214/http://www.freunde-kants.com/attachments/article/137/Bohnenrede%202015%20%28de%29.pdf |date=25 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant was born on April 22, 1724 into a [[Prussia]]n [[Germans|German]] family of [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] faith in Königsberg, East Prussia. Baptized 'Emanuel', he later changed his name to 'Immanuel'&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 2001, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; after learning [[Hebrew]]. He was brought up in a [[Pietism|Pietist]] household that stressed religious devotion, humility, and a literal interpretation of the [[Bible]].{{Citation needed |date=June 2017}} His education was strict, punitive and disciplinary, and focused on [[Latin]] and religious instruction over mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 2001, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant maintained [[Christianity|Christian]] ideals for some time, but struggled to reconcile the faith with his belief in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kant-rel/|title=Immanuel Kant: Philosophy of Religion – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'', he reveals a belief in immortality as the necessary condition of humanity's approach to the highest morality possible.&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equip.org/article/immanuel-kant/|title=Immanuel Kant - Christian Research Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Kant was skeptical about some of the arguments used prior to him in defence of [[theism]] and maintained that human understanding is limited and can never attain knowledge about God or the [[soul]], various commentators have labelled him a philosophical [[agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;"While this sounds skeptical, Kant is only agnostic about our knowledge of metaphysical objects such as God. And, as noted above, Kant's agnosticism leads to the conclusion that we can neither affirm nor deny claims made by traditional metaphysics." Andrew Fiala, [[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]], ''Critique of Pure Reason'' – Introduction, page xi.

Common myths about Kant's personal mannerisms are listed, explained, and refuted in Goldthwait's introduction to his translation of ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is often held that Kant lived a very strict and disciplined life, leading to an oft-repeated story that neighbors would set their clocks by his daily walks. He never married, but seemed to have a rewarding social life — he was a popular teacher and a modestly successful author even before starting on his major philosophical works. He had a circle of friends with whom he frequently met, among them [[Joseph Green (merchant)|Joseph Green]], an English merchant in Königsberg.

A common myth is that Kant never traveled more than {{convert|16|km}} from Königsberg his whole life.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Rick. 2005. [https://philosophynow.org/issues/49/Kant_200_Years_On 'Kant 200 Years On']. ''Philosophy Now''. No. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, between 1750 and 1754 he worked as a tutor (''Hauslehrer'') in Judtschen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vorländer|first=Karl|url=http://www.textlog.de/35594.html|title=Immanuel Kant: Bei Pfarrer Andersch in Judtschen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now Veselovka, [[Russia]], approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km) and in Groß-Arnsdorf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vorländer|first=Karl|url=http://www.textlog.de/35593.html|title=Immanuel Kant: Bei Major von Hülsen in Arnsdorf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[Jarnołtowo]] near [[Morąg]] (German: Mohrungen), [[Poland]], approximately 145&amp;nbsp;km).

===Young scholar===
Kant showed a great aptitude for study at an early age. He first attended the [[Collegium Fridericianum]] from which he graduated at the end of the summer of 1740. In 1740, aged 16, he enrolled at the [[University of Königsberg]], where he spent his whole career.&lt;ref&gt;''The American International Encyclopedia'' (New York: J.J. Little &amp; Ives, 1954), Vol. IX.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the philosophy of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] under [[Martin Knutzen]] (Associate Professor of Logic and Metaphysics from 1734 until his death in 1751), a [[rationalism|rationalist]] who was also familiar with developments in British philosophy and science and introduced Kant to the new mathematical physics of [[Isaac Newton]]. Knutzen dissuaded Kant from the theory of [[pre-established harmony]], which he regarded as "the pillow for the lazy mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What the Tortoise Taught Us: The Story of Philosophy|last=Porter|first=Burton|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2010|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also dissuaded Kant from [[idealism]], the idea that reality is purely mental, which most philosophers in the 18th century regarded in a negative light. The theory of [[transcendental idealism]] that Kant later included in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' was developed partially in opposition to traditional idealism.

His father's stroke and subsequent death in 1746 interrupted his studies. Kant left Königsberg shortly after August 1748&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 2001, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;—he would return there in August 1754.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehn 2001, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a private tutor in the towns surrounding Königsberg, but continued his scholarly research. In 1749, he published his first philosophical work, ''[[Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces]]'' (written in 1745–47).&lt;ref&gt;Eric Watkins (ed.), ''Immanuel Kant: Natural Science'', Cambridge University Press, 2012: [http://assets.cambridge.org/97805213/63945/excerpt/9780521363945_excerpt.pdf "Thoughts on the true estimation..."].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early work===
Kant is best known for his work in the philosophy of ethics and metaphysics,&lt;ref name=iep&gt;{{cite web|title=Immanuel Kant: Metaphysics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantmeta/|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he made significant contributions to other disciplines. He won the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]] Prize in 1754 for his argument that the Moon's gravity would eventually cause its [[tidal locking]] to [[orbital resonance|coincide]] with the Earth's rotation.&lt;ref name="nebulous"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brush|first= Stephen G.|title=A History of Modern Planetary Physics: Nebulous Earth|date=28 May 2014|isbn=0521441714|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, he expanded this reasoning to the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]] in his ''[[Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens]]''.&lt;ref name="nebulous"/&gt;

[[File:Kant wohnhaus 2.jpg|thumb|Kant's house in Königsberg]]
In the ''Universal Natural History'', Kant laid out the [[Nebular hypothesis]], in which he deduced that the [[Solar System]] had formed from a large cloud of gas, a [[nebula]]. Kant also correctly deduced that the [[Milky Way]] was a [[galaxy|large disk of stars]], which he theorized formed from a much larger spinning gas cloud. He further suggested that other distant "nebulae" might be other galaxies. These postulations opened new horizons for astronomy, for the first time extending it beyond the Solar System to galactic and intergalactic realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamow|first=George|title=[[One Two Three... Infinity]]|location=New York|publisher=Viking P.|date=1947|pages=300ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]] (1867), Kant also made contributions to geology in his ''Universal Natural History'', and according to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] (1897), he made contributions useful to mathematicians and astronomers.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

From then on, Kant turned increasingly to philosophical issues, although he continued to write on the sciences throughout his life. In the early 1760s, Kant produced a series of important works in philosophy. ''[[The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures]]'', a work in logic, was published in 1762. Two more works appeared the following year: ''Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into Philosophy'' and ''[[The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God]]''. In 1764, Kant wrote ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'' and then was second to [[Moses Mendelssohn]] in a Berlin Academy prize competition with his ''Inquiry Concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality'' (often referred to as "The Prize Essay"). In 1766 Kant wrote ''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'' which dealt with the writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]. The exact influence of Swedenborg on Kant, as well as the extent of Kant's belief in [[mysticism]] according to ''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'', remain controversial.&lt;ref name="Myth of Disenchantment" /&gt; On 31 March 1770, aged 45, Kant was finally appointed Full Professor of Logic and Metaphysics (''Professor Ordinarius der Logic und Metaphysic'') at the University of Königsberg. In defense of this appointment, Kant wrote his [[inaugural dissertation]] (''Inaugural-Dissertation'') ''De Mundi Sensibilis atque Intelligibilis Forma et Principiis'' (''On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and the Intelligible World)''.&lt;ref name="RGT"&gt;Since he had written his last [[habilitation thesis]] 14 years earlier, a new habilitation thesis was required (see S. J. McGrath, Joseph Carew (eds.), ''Rethinking German Idealism'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2016, p. 24).&lt;/ref&gt; This work saw the emergence of several central themes of his mature work, including the distinction between the faculties of intellectual thought and sensible receptivity. To miss this distinction would mean to commit the error of [[subreption]], and, as he says in the last chapter of the dissertation, only in avoiding this error does metaphysics flourish.

The issue that vexed Kant was central to what 20th-century scholars called "the [[philosophy of mind]]". The flowering of the natural sciences had led to an understanding of how data reaches the brain. Sunlight falling on an object is reflected from its surface in a way that maps the surface features (color, texture, etc.). The reflected light reaches the human eye, passes through the cornea, is focused by the lens onto the retina where it forms an image similar to that formed by light passing through a pinhole into a [[camera obscura]]. The retinal cells send impulses through the [[optic nerve]] and then they form a mapping in the brain of the visual features of the object. The interior mapping is not the exterior object, and our belief that there is a meaningful relationship between the object and the mapping in the brain depends on a chain of reasoning that is not fully grounded. But the uncertainty aroused by these considerations, by optical illusions, misperceptions, delusions, etc., are not the end of the problems.

Kant saw that the mind could not function as an empty container that simply receives data from outside. Something must be giving order to the incoming data. Images of external objects must be kept in the same sequence in which they were received. This ordering occurs through the mind's intuition of time. The same considerations apply to the mind's function of constituting space for ordering mappings of visual and tactile signals arriving via the already described chains of physical causation.

It is often claimed that Kant was a late developer, that he only became an important philosopher in his mid-50s after rejecting his earlier views. While it is true that Kant wrote his greatest works relatively late in life, there is a tendency to underestimate the value of his earlier works. Recent Kant scholarship has devoted more attention to these "pre-critical" writings and has recognized a degree of continuity with his mature work.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., for example, Susan Shell, ''The Embodiment of Reason'' (Chicago, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work hiatus===
At age 46, Kant was an established scholar and an increasingly influential philosopher, and much was expected of him.

In correspondence with his ex-student and friend [[Markus Herz]], Kant admitted that, in the inaugural dissertation, he had failed to account for the relation between our sensible and intellectual faculties. He needed to explain how we combine what is known as sensory knowledge with the other type of knowledge{{mdash}}i.e. reasoned knowledge{{mdash}}these two being related but having very different processes.

Kant also credited [[David Hume]] with awakening him from a "dogmatic slumber".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics'', p 57 (Ak. 4:260)&lt;/ref&gt; Hume had stated that experience consists only of sequences of feelings, images or sounds. Ideas such as "cause", goodness, or objects were not evident in experience, so why do we believe in the reality of these? Kant felt that reason could remove this skepticism, and he set himself to solving these problems. He did not publish any work in philosophy for the next 11 years.

[[File:Immanuel Kant 3.jpg|thumb|Immanuel Kant]]

Although fond of company and conversation with others, Kant isolated himself, and resisted friends' attempts to bring him out of his isolation. It has been noted that in 1778, in response to one of these offers by a former pupil, Kant wrote:
{{quote|
Any change makes me apprehensive, even if it offers the greatest promise of improving my condition, and I am persuaded by this natural instinct of mine that I must take heed if I wish that the threads which the Fates spin so thin and weak in my case to be spun to any length. My great thanks, to my well-wishers and friends, who think so kindly of me as to undertake my welfare, but at the same time a most humble request to protect me in my current condition from any disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Kul-Want and Andrzej Klimowski, ''Introducing Kant'' (Cambridge: Icon Books, 2005).{{page needed|date=October 2011}} {{ISBN|1-84046-664-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Kant emerged from his silence in 1781, the result was the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Although now uniformly recognized as one of the greatest works in the history of philosophy, this ''Critique'' was largely ignored upon its initial publication. The book was long, over 800 pages in the original German edition, and written in a convoluted style. It received few reviews, and these granted it no significance. Kant's former student, [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] criticized it for placing reason as an entity worthy of criticism instead of considering the process of reasoning within the context of language and one's entire personality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Copleston|Copleston, Frederick Charles]]. ''The Enlightenment: Voltaire to Kant''. 2003. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to [[Christian Garve]] and [[Johann Georg Heinrich Feder]], he rejected Kant's position that space and time possessed a form that could be analyzed. Additionally, Garve and Feder also faulted Kant's Critique for not explaining differences in perception of sensations.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Brigitte. ''Kant's Early Critics: The Empiricist Critique of the Theoretical Philosophy''. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Its density made it, as Herder said in a letter to [[Johann Georg Hamann]], a "tough nut to crack", obscured by "all this heavy gossamer".&lt;ref&gt;''Ein Jahrhundert deutscher Literaturkritik'', vol. III, ''Der Aufstieg zur Klassik in der Kritik der Zeit'' (Berlin, 1959), p. 315; as quoted in Gulyga, Arsenij. ''Immanuel Kant: His Life and Thought.'' Trans., Marijan Despaltović. Boston: Birkhäuser, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Its reception stood in stark contrast to the praise Kant had received for earlier works, such as his ''Prize Essay'' and shorter works that preceded the first Critique. These well-received and readable tracts include one on the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake in Lisbon]] that was so popular that it was sold by the page.&lt;ref&gt;Gulyga, Arsenij. ''Immanuel Kant: His Life and Thought.'' Trans., Marijan Despaltović. Boston: Birkhäuser, 1987 pp. 28–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the change in course documented in the first Critique, his books sold well, and by the time he published ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'' in 1764 he had become a notable popular author.&lt;ref&gt;Gulyga, Arsenij. ''Immanuel Kant: His Life and Thought.'' Trans., Marijan Despaltović. Boston: Birkhäuser, 1987, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was disappointed with the first Critique's reception. Recognizing the need to clarify the original treatise, Kant wrote the ''[[Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics]]'' in 1783 as a summary of its main views. Shortly thereafter, Kant's friend Johann Friedrich Schultz (1739–1805) (professor of mathematics) published ''Erläuterungen über des Herrn Professor Kant Critik&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; der reinen Vernunft'' (Königsberg, 1784), which was a brief but very accurate commentary on Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason''.

Kant's reputation gradually rose through the latter portion of the 1780s, sparked by a series of important works: the 1784 essay, "[[What is Enlightenment?|Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]"; 1785's ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (his first work on moral philosophy); and, from 1786, ''[[Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science]].'' But Kant's fame ultimately arrived from an unexpected source. In 1786, [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]] published a series of public letters on Kantian philosophy. In these letters, Reinhold framed Kant's philosophy as a response to the central intellectual controversy of the era: the [[Pantheism Dispute]]. [[Friedrich Jacobi]] had accused the recently deceased [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (a distinguished dramatist and philosophical essayist) of [[Spinozism]]. Such a charge, tantamount to atheism, was vigorously denied by Lessing's friend [[Moses Mendelssohn]], leading to a bitter public dispute among partisans. The [[scandal|controversy]] gradually escalated into a debate about the values of the Enlightenment and the value of reason.

Reinhold maintained in his letters that Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' could settle this dispute by defending the authority and bounds of reason. Reinhold's [[Letter (message)|letters]] were widely read and made Kant the most famous philosopher of his era.

===Later work and death===
Kant published a second edition of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (''Kritik der reinen Vernunft'') in 1787, heavily revising the first parts of the book. Most of his subsequent work focused on other areas of philosophy. He continued to develop his moral philosophy, notably in 1788's ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' (known as the second ''Critique'') and 1797's ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]''. The 1790 ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (the third ''Critique'') applied the Kantian system to aesthetics and [[teleology]]. It was in this critique where Kant wrote one of his most popular statements, ''"it is absurd to hope that another Newton will arise in the future who will make comprehensible to us the production of a blade of grass according to natural laws"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=861|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792, Kant's attempt to publish the Second of the four Pieces of ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason]]'', in the journal ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', met with opposition from the King's [[censorship]] commission, which had been established that same year in the context of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="DerridaKantCensorship"/&gt; Kant then arranged to have all four pieces published as a book, routing it through the philosophy department at the University of Jena to avoid the need for theological censorship.&lt;ref name="DerridaKantCensorship"&gt;Derrida ''Vacant Chair'' p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; This insubordination earned him a now famous reprimand from the King.&lt;ref name="DerridaKantCensorship"/&gt; When he nevertheless published a second edition in 1794, the censor was so irate that he arranged for a royal order that required Kant never to publish or even speak publicly about religion.&lt;ref name="DerridaKantCensorship"/&gt; Kant then published his response to the King's reprimand and explained himself, in the preface of ''The Conflict of the Faculties''.&lt;ref name="DerridaKantCensorship"/&gt;

[[File:Kant doerstling2.jpg|thumb|Kant with friends, including [[Christian Jakob Kraus]], [[Johann Georg Hamann]], [[Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder|Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel]] and [[Karl Gottfried Hagen]]]]
He also wrote a number of semi-popular essays on history, religion, politics and other topics. These works were well received by Kant's contemporaries and confirmed his preeminent status in 18th-century philosophy. There were several journals devoted solely to defending and criticizing Kantian philosophy. Despite his success, philosophical trends were moving in another direction. Many of Kant's most important disciples and followers (including [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold|Reinhold]], [[Jakob Sigismund Beck|Beck]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]) transformed the Kantian position into increasingly radical forms of idealism. The progressive stages of revision of Kant's teachings marked the emergence of [[German Idealism]]. Kant opposed these developments and publicly denounced Fichte in an open letter in 1799.&lt;ref name = "Fichte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korpora.org/Kant/aa12/370.html|title=Open letter by Kant denouncing Fichte's Philosophy (in German)|publisher=Korpora.org|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of his final acts expounding a stance on philosophical questions. In 1800, a student of Kant named Gottlob Benjamin Jäsche (1762–1842) published a manual of logic for teachers called ''Logik'', which he had prepared at Kant's request. Jäsche prepared the ''Logik'' using a copy of a textbook in logic by [[Georg Friedrich Meier]] entitled ''Auszug aus der Vernunftlehre'', in which Kant had written copious notes and annotations. The ''Logik'' has been considered of fundamental importance to Kant's philosophy, and the understanding of it. The great 19th-century logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] remarked, in an incomplete review of [[Thomas Kingsmill Abbott]]'s English translation of the introduction to ''Logik'', that "Kant's whole philosophy turns upon his logic."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v.1, (HUP, 1960), 'Kant and his Refutation of Idealism' p. 15
&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Robert Schirokauer Hartman]] and Wolfgang Schwarz, wrote in the translators' introduction to their English translation of the ''Logik'', "Its importance lies not only in its significance for the ''Critique of Pure Reason'', the second part of which is a restatement of fundamental tenets of the ''Logic'', but in its position within the whole of Kant's work."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''Logic'', G.B. Jäsche (ed), R.S. Hartman, W. Schwarz (translators), Indianapolis, 1984, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's health, long poor, worsened and he died at Königsberg on 12 February 1804, uttering "''Es ist gut'' (It is good)" before expiring.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Vorländer, ''Immanuel Kant: Der Mann und das Werk'', Hamburg: Meiner, 1992, p. II 332.&lt;/ref&gt; His unfinished final work was published as ''Opus Postumum''.

Kant wrote a book discussing his theory of virtue in terms of independence which he believed was "a viable modern alternative to more familiar Greek views about virtue". This book is often criticized for its hostile tone and for not articulating his thoughts about autocracy comprehensibly. In the self-governance model of Aristotelian virtue, the non-rational part of the soul can be made to listen to reason through training. Although Kantian self-governance appears to involve "a rational crackdown on appetites and emotions" with lack of harmony between reason and emotion, Kantian virtue denies requiring "self-conquest, self-suppression, or self-silencing". They dispute that "the self-mastery constitutive of virtue is ultimately mastery over our tendency of will to give priority to appetite or emotion unregulated by duty, it does not require extirpating, suppressing, or silencing sensibility in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McAleer|first1=Sean|title=Kant's Theory of Virtue: The Value of Autocracy.

In Kant's essay "[[What is Enlightenment?|Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]",
Kant defined the Enlightenment as an age shaped by the [[Latin]] motto ''[[Sapere aude]]'' ("Dare to be wise"). Kant maintained that one ought to think autonomously, free of the dictates of external [[authority]]. His work reconciled many of the differences between the [[rationalism|rationalist]] and [[empiricism|empiricist]] traditions of the 18th century. He had a decisive impact on the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[German Idealism|German Idealist]] philosophies of the 19th century. His work has also been a starting point for many 20th century philosophers.

Kant asserted that, because of the limitations of argumentation in the absence of irrefutable [[Evidence#Evidence in Problems|evidence]], no one could really know whether there is a God and an afterlife or not. For the sake of morality and as a ground for reason, Kant asserted, people are justified in believing in God, even though they could never know God's presence empirically. He explained:

{{quote|text=All the preparations of reason, therefore, in what may be called pure philosophy, are in reality directed to those three problems only [God, the soul, and freedom]. However, these three elements in themselves still hold independent, proportional, objective weight individually. Moreover, in a collective relational context; namely, to know ''what ought to be done'': if the will is free, if there is a God, and if there is a future [[world (philosophy)|world]]. As this concerns our actions with reference to the highest aims of life, we see that the ultimate intention of nature in her wise provision was really, in the constitution of our reason, directed to moral interests only.&lt;ref name = "CPR A801"&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A801.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Kant017.jpg|thumb|Immanuel Kant by [[Carle Vernet]] (1758–1836)]]

The sense of an enlightened approach and the [[scientific method|critical method]] required that "If one cannot prove that a thing ''is,'' he may try to prove that it is ''not.'' If he fails to do either (as often occurs), he may still ask whether it is in his ''interest'' to ''accept'' one or the other of the alternatives hypothetically, from the theoretical or the practical point of view. Hence the question no longer is as to whether [[perpetual peace]] is a real thing or not a real thing, or as to whether we may not be deceiving ourselves when we adopt the former alternative, but we must ''act'' on the supposition of its being real."&lt;ref name = "SoR Concl"&gt;''The Science of Right,'' Conclusion.&lt;/ref&gt; The presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was then a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams... ."&lt;ref name = "CPR A811"&gt;''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant drew a parallel between the [[Copernican Revolution#Immanuel Kant|Copernican revolution]] and the epistemology of his new [[transcendental philosophy]]. He never used the "Copernican revolution" phrase about himself, but it has often been applied to his work by others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Rockmore]], ''Marx After Marxism: The Philosophy of Karl Marx'' (2002), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's Copernican revolution involved two interconnected foundations of his "[[critical philosophy]]":
* the [[epistemology]] of [[transcendental idealism]] and
* the [[moral philosophy]] of the autonomy of practical reason.

These teachings placed the active, rational human [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] at the center of the cognitive and moral worlds. Kant argued that the rational order of the world as known by science was not just the accidental accumulation of sense perceptions.

Conceptual unification and integration is carried out by the mind through [[concept]]s or the "categories of the [[Understanding (Kant)|understanding]]" operating on the perceptual manifold within [[space and time]]. The latter are not concepts,&lt;ref&gt;In the first edition of the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' Kant refers to space as "no discursive or...general conception of the relation of things, but a pure intuition" and maintained that "We can only represent to ourselves one space". The "general notion of spaces...depends solely upon limitations" (Meikeljohn trans., A25). In the second edition of the CPR, Kant adds, "The original representation of space is an ''a priori'' intuition, not a concept" (Kemp Smith trans., B40). In regard to time, Kant states that "Time is not a discursive, or what is called a general concept, but a pure form of sensible intuition. Different times are but parts of one and the same time; and the representation which can be given only through a single object is intuition" (A31/B47). For the differences in the discursive use of reason according to concepts and its intuitive use through the construction of concepts, see ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (A719/B747 ff. and A837/B865). On "One and the same thing in space and time" and the mathematical construction of concepts, see A724/B752.&lt;/ref&gt; but are forms of sensibility that are ''a priori'' necessary conditions for any possible experience. Thus the objective order of nature and the causal necessity that operates within it depend on the mind's processes, the product of the rule-based activity that Kant called, "[[A priori and a posteriori|synthesis]]." There is much discussion among Kant scholars about the correct interpretation of this train of thought.

The 'two-world' interpretation regards Kant's position as a statement of epistemological limitation, that we are not able to transcend the bounds of our own mind, meaning that we cannot access the "[[thing-in-itself]]". However, Kant also speaks of the thing in itself or ''transcendental object'' as a product of the (human) understanding as it attempts to conceive of objects in abstraction from the conditions of sensibility. Following this line of thought, some interpreters have argued that the thing in itself does not represent a separate ontological domain but simply a way of considering objects by means of the understanding alone{{spaced ndash}}this is known as the two-aspect view.

The notion of the "[[thing in itself]]" was much discussed by philosophers after Kant. It was argued that because the "thing in itself" was unknowable, its existence must not be assumed. Rather than arbitrarily switching to an account that was ungrounded in anything supposed to be the "real," as did the German Idealists, another group arose to ask how our (presumably reliable) accounts of a coherent and rule-abiding universe were actually grounded. This new kind of philosophy became known as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], and its founder was [[Edmund Husserl]].

With regard to [[morality]], Kant argued that the source of the [[Goodness and value theory|good]] lies not in anything outside the [[human]] subject, either in [[nature]] or given by [[God]], but rather is only the good will itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanity{{spaced ndash}}understood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as others{{spaced ndash}}as an [[end in itself]] rather than (merely) as [[means (philosophy)|means]] to other ends the individual might hold. This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons.

These ideas have largely framed or influenced all subsequent philosophical discussion and analysis. The specifics of Kant's account generated immediate and lasting controversy. Nevertheless, his theses{{spaced ndash}}that the [[mind]] itself necessarily makes a constitutive contribution to its [[knowledge]], that this contribution is transcendental rather than psychological, that philosophy involves self-critical activity, that morality is rooted in human freedom, and that to act autonomously is to act according to rational moral principles{{spaced ndash}}have all had a lasting effect on subsequent philosophy.

===Theory of perception===
{{Main|Critique of Pure Reason}}

Kant defines his theory of perception in his influential 1781 work the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', which has often been cited as the most significant volume of metaphysics and [[epistemology]] in modern philosophy. Kant maintains that our understanding of the external world had its foundations not merely in experience, but in both experience and [[A priori knowledge|''a priori'' concepts]], thus offering a ''non-empiricist critique of rationalist philosophy'', which is what has been referred to as his [[Copernican Revolution#Immanuel Kant|Copernican revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Kant%2c+Immanuel |title=Kant, Immanuel definition of Kant, Immanuel in the Free Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, Kant [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|distinguishes between analytic and synthetic propositions]]:

# '''Analytic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept; ''e.g.'', "All bachelors are unmarried," or, "All bodies take up space."
# '''Synthetic proposition''': a proposition whose predicate concept is not contained in its subject concept; ''e.g.'', "All bachelors are alone," or, "All bodies have weight."

An analytic proposition is true by nature of the meaning of the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. [[David Hume|Hume]]) and rationalists (cf. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.

Kant contests this assumption by claiming that elementary mathematics, like arithmetic, is synthetic ''a priori'', in that its statements provide new knowledge not derived from experience. This becomes part of his over-all argument for [[transcendental idealism]]. That is, he argues that the possibility of experience depends on certain necessary conditions — which he calls ''a priori'' forms — and that these conditions structure and hold true of the world of experience. His main claims in the "[[Critique of Pure Reason#I. Transcendental Doctrine of Elements|Transcendental Aesthetic]]" are that mathematic judgments are synthetic ''a priori'' and that [[space]] and [[time]] are not derived from experience but rather are its preconditions.

Once we have grasped the functions of basic arithmetic, we do not need empirical experience to know that 100 + 100 = 200, and so it appears that arithmetic is analytic. However, that it is analytic can be disproved by considering the calculation 5 + 7 = 12: there is nothing in the numbers 5 and 7 by which the number 12 can be inferred. Thus "5 + 7" and "the cube root of 1,728" or "12" are not analytic because their reference is the same but their sense is not — the statement "5 + 7 = 12" tells us something new about the world. It is self-evident, and undeniably ''a priori'', but at the same time it is synthetic. Thus Kant proved that a proposition can be synthetic and a priori.

Kant asserts that experience is based on the perception of external objects and ''a priori'' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;The German word ''Anschauung'', which Kant used, literally means 'looking at' and generally means what in philosophy in English is called "perception". However it sometimes is rendered as "intuition": not, however, with the vernacular meaning of an indescribable or mystical experience or sixth sense, but rather with the meaning of the direct perception or grasping of sensory phenomena. In this article, both terms, "perception" and "intuition" are used to stand for Kant's ''Anschauung''.&lt;/ref&gt; The external world, he writes, provides those things that we sense. But our mind processes this information and gives it order, allowing us to comprehend it. Our mind supplies the conditions of space and time to experience objects. According to the "transcendental unity of apperception", the concepts of the mind (Understanding) and perceptions or intuitions that garner information from phenomena (Sensibility) are synthesized by comprehension. Without concepts, perceptions are nondescript; without perceptions, concepts are meaningless — thus the famous statement, "Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions (perceptions) without concepts are blind."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason [1781], trans. Norman Kemp Smith (N.Y.: St. Martins, 1965), A 51/B 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant also claims that an external environment is necessary for the establishment of the self. Although Kant would want to argue that there is no empirical way of observing the self, we can see the logical necessity of the self when we observe that we can have different perceptions of the external environment over time. By uniting these general representations into one global representation, we can see how a transcendental self emerges. "I am therefore conscious of the identical self in regard to the manifold of the representations that are given to me in an intuition because I call them all together my representations."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason''. Ed. [[Paul Guyer]] and [[Allen W. Wood]]. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1998. p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categories of the Faculty of Understanding===

Kant deemed it obvious that we have some objective knowledge of the world, such as, say, Newtonian physics. But this knowledge relies on [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]], ''a priori'' laws of nature, like causality and substance. How is this possible? Kant's solution was that the [[Subject (philosophy)#The subject in German idealism|subject]] must supply laws that make experience of objects possible, and that these laws are synthetic, ''a priori'' laws of nature that apply to all objects before we experience them. To deduce all these laws, Kant examined experience in general, dissecting in it what is supplied by the mind from what is supplied by the given intuitions. This is commonly called a transcendental deduction.&lt;ref name="Prolegomena"&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics'', pages 35 to 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

To begin with, Kant's distinction between the ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' being [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and particular knowledge, and the ''a priori'' being universal and necessary knowledge, must be kept in mind. If we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the knowledge is always subjective because it is derived ''a posteriori,'' when what is desired is for the knowledge to be objective, that is, for the two intuitions to refer to the object and hold good of it for anyone at any time, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition. What else is equivalent to objective knowledge besides the ''a priori,'' (universal and necessary knowledge)? Before knowledge can be objective, it must be incorporated under an ''a priori'' category of ''understanding''.&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webdeleuze.com/php/texte.php?cle=66&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=2 Deleuze on Kant] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114091656/http://www.webdeleuze.com/php/texte.php?cle=66&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=2 |date=14 November 2007 }}, from where the definitions of ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' were obtained.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a subject says, "The sun shines on the stone; the stone grows warm," all he perceives are phenomena. His judgment is contingent and holds no necessity. But if he says, "The sunshine causes the stone to warm," he subsumes the perception under the category of causality, which is not found in the perception, and necessarily synthesizes the concept sunshine with the concept heat, producing a necessarily universally true judgment.&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;

To explain the categories in more detail, they are the preconditions of the construction of objects in the mind. Indeed, to even think of the sun and stone presupposes the category of subsistence, that is, substance. For the categories synthesize the random data of the sensory manifold into intelligible objects. This means that the categories are also the most abstract things one can say of any object whatsoever, and hence one can have an ''a priori'' cognition of the totality of all objects of experience if one can list all of them. To do so, Kant formulates another transcendental deduction.&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;

Judgments are, for Kant, the preconditions of any thought. Man thinks via judgments, so all possible judgments must be listed and the perceptions connected within them put aside, so as to make it possible to examine the moments when ''the understanding'' is engaged in constructing judgments. For the categories are equivalent to these moments, in that they are concepts of intuitions in general, so far as they are determined by these moments universally and necessarily. Thus by listing all the moments, one can deduce from them all of the categories.&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;

One may now ask: How many possible judgments are there? Kant believed that all the possible propositions within Aristotle's [[syllogism|syllogistic]] logic are equivalent to all possible judgments, and that all the logical operators within the propositions are equivalent to the moments of the understanding within judgments. Thus he listed Aristotle's system in four groups of three: quantity (universal, particular, singular), quality (affirmative, negative, infinite), relation (categorical, hypothetical, disjunctive) and modality (problematic, assertoric, apodeictic). The parallelism with Kant's categories is obvious: quantity (unity, plurality, totality), quality (reality, negation, limitation), relation (substance, cause, community) and modality (possibility, existence, necessity).&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;

The fundamental building blocks of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are now in place. First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, and then there is the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions up out of the subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other words, we filter what we see and hear.&lt;ref name = "Prolegomena"/&gt;

===Transcendental schema doctrine===
{{See also|Schema (Kant)}}

Kant ran into a problem with his theory that the mind plays a part in producing objective knowledge. Intuitions and categories are entirely disparate, so how can they interact? Kant's solution is the (transcendental) schema: a priori principles by which the transcendental imagination connects concepts with intuitions through time. All the principles are temporally bound, for if a concept is purely a priori, as the categories are, then they must apply for all times. Hence there are principles such as ''substance is that which endures through time'', and ''the cause must always be prior to the effect''.&lt;ref name="Prolegomena"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hackett&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Judgment'', the Introduction to the Hackett edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral philosophy===
[[File:Immanuel Kant.jpg|thumb|Immanuel Kant]]
Kant developed his moral philosophy in three works: ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'' (1785), ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' (1788), and ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (1797).

In ''Groundwork'', Kant' tries to convert our everyday, obvious, rational&lt;ref&gt;The distinction between rational and philosophical knowledge is given in the Preface to the ''Groundwork'', 1785.&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge of morality into philosophical knowledge. The latter two works used "practical reason", which is based only on things about which reason can tell us, and not deriving any principles from experience, to reach conclusions which can be applied to the world of experience (in the second part of ''The Metaphysic of Morals'').

Kant is known for his theory that there is a single [[moral obligation]], which he called the "[[Categorical Imperative]]", and is derived from the concept of [[duty]]. Kant defines the demands of moral law as "categorical imperatives". Categorical imperatives are principles that are intrinsically valid; they are good in and of themselves; they must be obeyed in all situations and circumstances, if our behavior is to observe the moral law. The Categorical Imperative provides a test against which moral statements can be assessed. Kant also stated that the moral means and ends can be applied to the categorical imperative, that rational beings can pursue certain "ends" using the appropriate "means". Ends based on physical needs or wants create [[hypothetical imperative]]s. The categorical imperative can only be based on something that is an "end in itself", that is, an end that is not a means to some other need, desire, or purpose.&lt;ref name="Beck 421"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant believed that the moral law is a principle of [[reason]] itself, and is not based on contingent facts about the world, such as what would make us happy, but to act on the moral law which has no other motive than "worthiness of being happy".&lt;ref name = "CPR A806 B834"&gt;''Critique of Pure Reason'', A806/B834.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he believed that moral obligation applies only to rational agents.&lt;ref name="Beck 408"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike a hypothetical imperative, a categorical imperative is an unconditional obligation; it has the force of an obligation regardless of our will or desires&lt;ref name="Beck 420-1"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', pp. 420–1.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'' (1785) Kant enumerated three formulations of the categorical imperative that he believed to be roughly equivalent.&lt;ref name="Beck 436"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, Kant stated:

:Act only according to that [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant |first=Immanuel |translator-first=James W. |translator-last=Ellington |orig-year=1785 |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett |year=1993 |pages=30 |isbn=0-87220-166-X |ref=harv}}. It is standard to also reference the ''Akademie Ausgabe'' of Kant's works. The ''Groundwork'' occurs in the fourth volume.The above citation is taken from 4:421.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant, one cannot make exceptions for oneself. The philosophical maxim on which one acts should always be considered to be a universal law without exception.  One cannot allow oneself to do a particular action unless one thinks it appropriate that the reason for the action should become a universal law. For example, one should not steal, however dire the circumstances{{mdash}}because, by permitting oneself to steal, one makes stealing a universally  acceptable act. This is the first formulation of the categorical imperative, often known as the universalizability principle.

Kant believed that, if an action is not done with the motive of duty, then it is without moral value. He thought that every action should have pure intention behind it; otherwise, it is meaningless. The final result is not the most important aspect of an action;  rather, how the person feels while carrying out the action is the time when value is attached to the result.

In ''Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'', Kant also posited the "counter-[[utilitarian]] idea that there is a difference between preferences and values, and that considerations of individual rights temper calculations of aggregate utility", a concept that is an axiom in economics:&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2003) ''Ecosystems and Well-being: A Framework for Assessment''. Washington DC: Island Press, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everything has either a ''price'' or a ''dignity''. Whatever has a price can be replaced by something else as its equivalent; on the other hand, whatever is above all price, and therefore admits of no equivalent, has a dignity. But that which constitutes the condition under which alone something can be an end in itself does not have mere relative worth, i.e., price, but an intrinsic worth, i.e., a dignity. (p. 53, italics in original).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A phrase quoted by Kant, which is used to summarize the counter-utilitarian nature of his moral philosophy, is ''[[Fiat justitia, pereat mundus]]'', ("Let justice be done, though the world perish"), which he translates loosely as "Let justice reign even if all the rascals in the world should perish from it". This appears in his 1795 ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'' ("''[[:de:Zum ewigen Frieden|Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf]]''"), Appendix 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/kant/append1.htm|title=Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch: Appendix 1|publisher=Constitution.org|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LykHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=pereat+mundus+inauthor:Kant|title=Project for a Perpetual Peace, p. 61|publisher=Books.google.com|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009|year=1796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QskIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA456&amp;dq=pereat+mundus+inauthor:Kant|title=Immanuel Kant's Werke, revidirte Gesammtausg, p. 456|publisher=Books.google.com|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009|year=1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First formulation====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|In his ''Metaphysics,'' Immanuel Kant introduced the [[categorical imperative]]: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."]]
The first formulation (Formula of Universal Law) of the moral imperative "requires that the maxims be chosen as though they should hold as universal [[natural law|laws of nature]]" .&lt;ref name="Beck 436" /&gt; This formulation in principle has as its supreme law the creed "Always act according to that maxim whose universality as a law you can at the same time will" and is the "only condition under which a will can never come into conflict with itself [....]"&lt;ref name="Beck 437"&gt;Kant, Foundations, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

One interpretation of the first formulation is called the "universalizability test".&lt;ref&gt;"Kant and the German Enlightenment" in "History of Ethics". ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Vol. 3, pp. 95–96. MacMillan, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; An agent's maxim, according to Kant, is his "subjective principle of human actions": that is, what the agent believes is his reason to act.&lt;ref name="Beck 400 429"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', pp. 400, 429.&lt;/ref&gt; The universalisability test has five steps:

# Find the agent's maxim (i.e., an action paired with its motivation). Take, for example, the declaration "I will lie for personal benefit". Lying is the action; the motivation is to fulfill some sort of desire. Together, they form the maxim.
# Imagine a possible world in which everyone in a similar position to the real-world agent followed that maxim.
# Decide if contradictions or irrationalities would arise in the possible world as a result of following the maxim.
# If a contradiction or irrationality would arise, acting on that maxim is not allowed in the real world.
# If there is no contradiction, then acting on that maxim is permissible, and is sometimes required.

(For a modern parallel, see [[John Rawls]]' hypothetical situation, the [[original position]].)

====Second formulation====
The second formulation (or Formula of the End in Itself) holds that "the rational being, as by its nature an end and thus as an end in itself, must serve in every maxim as the condition restricting all merely relative and arbitrary ends".&lt;ref name="Beck 436" /&gt; The principle dictates that you "[a]ct with reference to every rational being (whether yourself or another) so that it is an end in itself in your maxim", meaning that the rational being is "the basis of all maxims of action" and "must be treated never as a mere means but as the supreme limiting condition in the use of all means, i.e., as an end at the same time".&lt;ref name="Beck 437-8"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', pp. 437–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Third formulation ====
The third formulation (i.e. Formula of Autonomy) is a synthesis of the first two and is the basis for the "complete determination of all maxims". It states "that all maxims which stem from autonomous legislation ought to harmonize with a possible realm of ends as with a realm of nature".&lt;ref name="Beck 436"/&gt;

In principle, "So act as if your maxims should serve at the same time as the universal law (of all rational beings)", meaning that we should so act that we may think of ourselves as "a member in the universal realm of ends", [[legislating]] universal laws through our maxims (that is, a universal [[code of conduct]]), in a "possible realm of ends".&lt;ref name="Beck 438-9"&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', pp. 438–9. See also [[Kingdom of Ends]]&lt;/ref&gt; No one may elevate themselves above the universal law, therefore it is one's duty to follow the maxim(s).

====''Religion Within the Limits of Reason''====
Commentators, starting in the 20th century, have tended to see Kant as having a strained relationship with religion, though this was not the prevalent view in the 19th century. [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]], whose letters first made Kant famous, wrote "I believe that I may infer without reservation that the interest of religion, and of Christianity in particular, accords completely with the result of the Critique of Reason.".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Leonhard Reinhold, Letters on the Kantian Philosophy (1786), 3rd Letter&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Schultz]], who wrote one of the first Kant commentaries, wrote "And does not this system itself cohere most splendidly with the Christian religion? Do not the divinity and beneficence of the latter become all the more evident?"&lt;ref&gt;Johann Schultz, Exposition of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1784), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This view continued throughout the 19th century, as noted by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who said "Kant's success is merely a theologian's success."&lt;ref&gt;"The Protestant pastor is the grandfather of German philosophy...German philosophy is at bottom-a cunning theology...Why the rejoicing heard through the German academic world--three-quarters composed of the sons of pastors and teachers-at the appearance of Kant? Why the Germans' conviction, which still find echo even today, that with Kant things were taking a turn of the better? Kant's success is merely a theologian's success". Nietzsche, The Antichrist, 10&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for these views was Kant's moral theology, and the widespread belief that his philosophy was the great antithesis to [[Spinozism]], which had been convulsing the European academy for much of the 18th century. Spinozism was widely seen as the cause of the [[Pantheism controversy]], and as a form of sophisticated pantheism or even atheism. As Kant's philosophy disregarded the possibility of arguing for God through pure reason alone, for the same reasons it also disregarded the possibility of arguing against God through pure reason alone. This, coupled with his moral philosophy (his argument that the existence of morality is a rational reason why God and an afterlife do and must exist), was the reason he was seen by many, at least through the end of the 19th century, as a great defender of religion in general and Christianity in particular.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Kant articulates his strongest criticisms of the organization and practices of religious organizations to those that encourage what he sees as a religion of counterfeit service to God.&lt;ref name="Immanuel Kant 1793"&gt;Immanuel Kant. ''Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone'' (1793), Book IV, Part 1, Section 1, "The Christian religion as a natural religion."&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major targets of his criticism are external ritual, superstition and a hierarchical church order. He sees these as efforts to make oneself pleasing to God in ways other than conscientious adherence to the principle of moral rightness in choosing and acting upon one's maxims. Kant's criticisms on these matters, along with his rejection of certain theoretical proofs grounded in pure reason (particularly the [[ontological argument]]) for the existence of God and his philosophical commentary on some Christian doctrines, have resulted in interpretations that see Kant as hostile to religion in general and Christianity in particular (e.g., Walsh 1967). Nevertheless, other interpreters consider that Kant was trying to mark off defensible from indefensible Christian belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-religion/|title=Kant's Philosophy of Religion (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=Plato.stanford.edu|date=|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant sees in [[Jesus Christ]] the affirmation of a "pure moral disposition of the heart" that "can make man well-pleasing to God".&lt;ref name="Immanuel Kant 1793"/&gt; Regarding Kant's conception of religion, some critics have argued that he was sympathetic to deism.&lt;ref&gt;For example Peter Byrne, who wrote about Kant's relationship with deism. Byrne, Peter (2007), ''Kant on God'', London: Ashgate, page 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have argued that Kant's moral conception moves from deism to theism (as moral theism), for example Allen W. Wood&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Allen W. (1970), ''Kant's moral religion'', London and Ithaca: Cornell University Press, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and Merold Westphal.&lt;ref&gt;Westphal, Merold (2010),''The Emerge of Modern Philosophy of Religion'', in Taliaferro, Charles, Draper, Paul and Quinn, Philip (editors), ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion'', Oxford: Blackwell, page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; As for Kant's book ''Religion within the Boundaries of bare Reason'', it was emphasized that Kant reduced religiosity to rationality, religion to morality and Christianity to ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2004), ''Dumnezeu şi religia în concepţia lui Immanuel Kant din Religia în limitele raţiunii'', in Boboc, Alexandru and Mariş, N. I. (editors), ''Studii de istoria filosofiei universale'', volume 12, Bucharest: Romanian Academy.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Idea of freedom====
In the ''Critique of Pure Reason'',&lt;ref&gt;The Norman Kemp Smith translation has been used for this section, with citation noting the pagination of the first and second editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant distinguishes between the transcendental idea of freedom, which as a psychological concept is "mainly empirical" and refers to "the question whether we must admit a power of spontaneously beginning a series of successive things or states" as a real ground of necessity in regard to causality,&lt;ref name="CPR A448 B476"&gt;Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', A448/B476.&lt;/ref&gt; and the practical concept of freedom as the independence of our will from the "coercion" or "necessitation through sensuous impulses". Kant finds it a source of difficulty that the practical idea of freedom is founded on the transcendental idea of freedom,&lt;ref name = "CPR A534 B562"&gt;Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', A534/B562.&lt;/ref&gt; but for the sake of practical interests uses the practical meaning, taking "no account of... its transcendental meaning," which he feels was properly "disposed of" in the Third Antinomy, and as an element in the question of the freedom of the will is for philosophy "a real stumbling-block" that has "embarrassed speculative reason".&lt;ref name="CPR A448 B476" /&gt;

Kant calls practical "everything that is possible through freedom", and the pure practical laws that are never given through sensuous conditions but are held analogously with the universal law of causality are moral laws. Reason can give us only the "pragmatic laws of free action through the senses", but pure practical laws given by reason ''a priori''&lt;ref&gt;the same distinction of transcendental and practical meaning can be applied to the idea of God, with the ''proviso'' that the practical concept of freedom can be experienced (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A801-804/B829-832).&lt;/ref&gt; dictate "''what ought to be done''".&lt;ref name = "CPR A800-802 B828-830"&gt;Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', A800–2/B828–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The concept of freedom is also handled in the third section of the ''Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals''. In the ''Critique of Practical Reason'' see § VII and § VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Categories of freedom====
In the ''Critique of Practical Reason'', at the end of the second Main Part of the ''Analytics'',&lt;ref&gt;5:65–67&lt;/ref&gt; Kant introduces the categories of freedom, in analogy with the categories of understanding their practical counterparts. Kant's categories of freedom apparently function primarily as conditions for the possibility for actions (i) to be free, (ii) to be understood as free and (iii) to be morally evaluated. For Kant, although actions as theoretical objects are constituted by means of the theoretical categories, actions as practical objects (objects of practical use of reason, and which can be good or bad) are constituted by means of the categories of freedom. Only in this way can actions, as phenomena, be a consequence of freedom, and be understood and evaluated as such.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien]], 'Die Kategorien der Freiheit bei Kant', in ''Kant: Analysen, Probleme, Kritik'' Vol. 1, 1988, 193–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic philosophy===
Kant discusses the subjective nature of aesthetic qualities and experiences in ''[[Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime]]'' (1764). Kant's contribution to [[aesthetics|aesthetic theory]] is developed in the ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (1790) where he investigates the possibility and logical status of "judgments of taste." In the "Critique of Aesthetic Judgment," the first major division of the ''Critique of Judgment'', Kant used the term "aesthetic" in a manner that, according to Kant scholar W.H. Walsh, differs from its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Critique of Judgment in "Kant, Immanuel" ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol 4. Macmillan, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Critique of Pure Reason'', to note essential differences between judgments of taste, moral judgments, and scientific judgments, Kant abandoned the term "aesthetic" as "designating the critique of taste," noting that judgments of taste could never be "directed" by "laws ''a priori''."&lt;ref name = "CPR A22 B36"&gt;Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, A22/B36.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|A. G. Baumgarten]], who wrote ''Aesthetica'' (1750–58),&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley, Monroe. "History of Aesthetics". ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 1, section on "Toward a unified aesthetics", p. 25, Macmillan 1973. Baumgarten coined the term "aesthetics" and expanded, clarified, and unified Wolffian aesthetic theory, but had left the ''Aesthetica'' unfinished (See also: Tonelli, Giorgio. "Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten". ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 1, Macmillan 1973). In Bernard's translation of the ''Critique of Judgment'' he indicates in the notes that Kant's reference in § 15 in regard to the identification of perfection and beauty is probably a reference to Baumgarten.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was one of the first philosophers to develop and integrate aesthetic theory into a unified and comprehensive philosophical system, utilizing ideas that played an integral role throughout his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;German Idealism in "History of Aesthetics" ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol 1. Macmillan, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chapter "Analytic of the Beautiful" in the ''Critique of Judgment'', Kant states that beauty is not a property of an artwork or natural phenomenon, but is instead consciousness of the pleasure that attends the 'free play' of the imagination and the understanding. Even though it appears that we are using reason to decide what is beautiful, the judgment is not a cognitive judgment,&lt;ref&gt;Kant's general discussions of the distinction between "cognition" and "conscious of" are also given in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (notably A320/B376), and section V and the conclusion of section VIII of his Introduction in ''Logic''.&lt;/ref&gt; "and is consequently not logical, but aesthetical" (§ 1). A pure judgement of taste is subjective since it refers to the emotional response of the subject and is based upon nothing but esteem for an object itself: it is a disinterested pleasure, and we feel that pure judgements of taste (i.e. judgements of beauty), lay claim to universal validity (§§20–22). It is important to note that this universal validity is not derived from a determinate concept of beauty but from ''common sense'' (§40). Kant also believed that a judgement of taste shares characteristics engaged in a moral judgement: both are disinterested, and we hold them to be universal. In the chapter "Analytic of the Sublime" Kant identifies the sublime as an aesthetic quality that, like beauty, is subjective, but unlike beauty refers to an indeterminate relationship between the faculties of the imagination and of reason, and shares the character of moral judgments in the use of reason. The feeling of the sublime, divided into two distinct modes (the mathematical and the dynamical sublime), describes two subjective moments that concern the relationship of the faculty of the imagination to reason. Some commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clewis |first=Robert |year= 2009 |title=The Kantian Sublime and the Revelation of Freedom |location= Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item2326741/?site_locale=en_US}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that Kant's critical philosophy contains a third kind of the sublime, the moral sublime, which is the aesthetic response to the moral law or a representation, and a development of the "noble" sublime in Kant's theory of 1764. The mathematical sublime results from the failure of the imagination to comprehend natural objects that appear boundless and formless, or appear "absolutely great" (§ 23–25). This imaginative failure is then recuperated through the pleasure taken in reason's assertion of the concept of infinity. In this move the faculty of reason proves itself superior to our fallible sensible self (§§ 25–26). In the dynamical sublime there is the sense of annihilation of the sensible self as the imagination tries to comprehend a vast might. This power of nature threatens us but through the resistance of reason to such sensible annihilation, the subject feels a pleasure and a sense of the human moral vocation. This appreciation of moral feeling through exposure to the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] helps to develop moral character.

Kant developed a distinction between an object of art as a material value subject to the conventions of society and the transcendental condition of the judgment of taste as a "refined" value in the propositions of his ''Idea of A Universal History'' (1784). In the Fourth and Fifth Theses of that work he identified all art as the "fruits of unsociableness" due to men's "antagonism in society"&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Idea for a Universal History''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (20, 22).&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the Seventh Thesis, asserted that while such material property is indicative of a civilized state, only the ideal of morality and the universalization of refined value through the improvement of the mind "belongs to culture".&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Idea for a Universal History''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (26).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political philosophy===
{{Main|Political philosophy of Immanuel Kant}}
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
In ''Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch'',&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]'' (1795)&lt;/ref&gt; Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace.'' Trans. Lewis White Beck (377).&lt;/ref&gt; His [[classical republicanism|classical republican]] theory was extended in the ''Science of Right'', the first part of the [[Metaphysics of Morals]] (1797).&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Riedel ''Between Tradition and Revolution: The Hegelian Transformation of Political Philosophy'', Cambridge 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Kant believed that [[universal history]] leads to the ultimate world of republican states at peace, but his theory was not pragmatic. The process was described in "Perpetual Peace" as natural rather than rational:
{{quote|
The guarantee of perpetual peace is nothing less than that great artist, nature...In her mechanical course we see that her aim is to produce a harmony among men, against their will, and indeed through their discord. As a necessity working according to laws we do not know, we call it destiny. But, considering its designs in universal history, we call it "providence," inasmuch as we discern in it the profound wisdom of a higher cause which predetermines the course of nature and directs it to the objective final end of the human race.&lt;ref&gt;''On History'', (ed. L. W. Beck, New York: Bobbs Merill, 1963, p 106).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant's political thought can be summarized as republican government and international organization. "In more characteristically Kantian terms, it is doctrine of the state based upon the law (''[[Rechtsstaat]]'') and of eternal peace. Indeed, in each of these formulations, both terms express the same idea: that of legal constitution or of 'peace through law'. Kant's political philosophy, being essentially a legal doctrine, rejects by definition the opposition between moral education and the play of passions as alternate foundations for social life. The state is defined as the union of men under law. The state is constituted by laws which are necessary a priori because they flow from the very concept of law. "A regime can be judged by no other criteria nor be assigned any other functions, than those proper to the lawful order as such." &lt;ref&gt;History of Political Philosophy, edited by Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, The University of Chicago Press, 1987, pp. 581–582, 603&lt;/ref&gt;

He opposed "democracy," which at his time meant [[direct democracy]], believing that majority rule posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated, "...democracy is, properly speaking, necessarily a despotism, because it establishes an executive power in which 'all' decide for or even against one who does not agree; that is, 'all,' who are not quite all, decide, and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace.'' Trans. Lewis White Beck (352).&lt;/ref&gt; As with most writers at the time, he distinguished three forms of government i.e. democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy with [[mixed government]] as the most ideal form of it.

==Anthropology==
[[File:German 5 DM 1974 D Silver Coin Immanuel Kant.jpg|right|thumb|5 DM 1974 D silver coin commemorating the 250th birthday of Immanuel Kant in [[Königsberg]]]]

Kant lectured on anthropology for over 25 years. His ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' was published in 1798. (This was the subject of [[Michel Foucault]]'s secondary dissertation for his [[State doctorate]], ''[[Introduction to Kant's Anthropology]]''.) Kant's Lectures on Anthropology were published for the first time in 1997 in German.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis Verlag, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Introduction to Kant's Anthropology'' was translated into English and published by the Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy series in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'', ed. Robert B. Louden, introduction by Manfred Kuehn, Cambridge University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant was among the first people of his time to introduce anthropology as an intellectual area of study long before the field gained popularity. As a result, his texts are considered to have advanced the field. Kant's point of view also influenced the works of philosophers after him such as Martin Heidegger, Paul Ricoeur, and Jean Greisch.

Kant viewed anthropology in two broad categories. One category was the physiological approach which he referred to as "what nature makes of the human being". The other category was the pragmatic approach which explored the things a human "can and should make of himself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gregor|first1=Brian|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View. By Immanuel Kant. Translated and edited by Robert B. Louden.|volume=Heythrop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Kant's influence on Western thought has been profound.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Oliver A. Johnson claims that, "With the possible exception of Plato's Republic, (Critique of Pure Reason) is the most important philosophical book ever written." Article on Kant within the collection "Great thinkers of the Western World", Ian P. McGreal, Ed., HarperCollins, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Over and above his influence on specific thinkers, Kant changed the framework within which philosophical inquiry has been carried out. He accomplished a [[paradigm shift]]; very little philosophy is now carried out in the style of pre-Kantian philosophy. This shift consists in several closely related innovations that have become foundational in philosophy itself and in the social sciences and humanities generally:
* Kant's "Copernican revolution", that placed the role of the human subject or knower at the center of inquiry into our knowledge, such that it is impossible to philosophize about things as they are independently of us or of how they are for us;&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen Palmquist, "The Architectonic Form of Kant's Copernican Logic", ''Metaphilosophy'' 17:4 (October 1986), pp. 266–288; revised and reprinted as Chapter III of [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 Kant's System of Perspectives]: An architectonic interpretation of the Critical philosophy (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;
* His invention of critical philosophy, that is of the notion of being able to discover and systematically explore possible inherent limits to our ability to know through philosophical reasoning;
* His creation of the concept of "conditions of possibility", as in his notion of "the conditions of possible experience"{{spaced ndash}}that is that things, knowledge, and forms of consciousness rest on prior conditions that make them possible, so that, to understand or to know them, we must first understand these conditions;
* His theory that objective experience is actively constituted or constructed by the functioning of the human mind;
* His notion of moral autonomy as central to humanity;
* His assertion of the principle that human beings should be treated as ends rather than as means.

Kant's ideas have been incorporated into a variety of schools of thought. These include [[German Idealism]], [[Marxism]], [[positivism]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], [[critical theory]], [[linguistic philosophy]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[deconstructionism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Historical influence===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}

During his own life, there was much critical attention paid to his thought. He had an influence on [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold|Reinhold]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Novalis]] during the 1780s and 1790s. The school of thinking known as [[German Idealism]] developed from his writings. The German Idealists Fichte and Schelling, for example, tried to bring traditional "metaphysically" laden notions like "the Absolute", "God", and "Being" into the scope of Kant's [[critical thought]].&lt;ref&gt;There is much debate in the recent scholarship about the extent to which Fichte and Schelling actually overstep the boundaries of Kant's critical philosophy, thus entering the realm of dogmatic or pre-Critical philosophy. Beiser's ''German Idealism'' discusses some of these issues. Beiser, Frederick C. ''German Idealism: The Struggle against Subjectivism, 1781–1801.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, the German Idealists tried to reverse Kant's view that we cannot know what we cannot observe.

[[File:Kant Kaliningrad.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Immanuel Kant in [[Kaliningrad]] ([[Königsberg]]), Russia. Replica by {{Interlanguage link multi|Harald Haacke|de}} of the original by [[Christian Daniel Rauch]] lost in 1945.]]

Hegel was one of Kant's first major critics. In response to what he saw as Kant's abstract and formal account, Hegel brought about an ethic focused on the "ethical life" of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, ''Natural Law: The Scientific Ways of Treating Natural Law, Its Place in Moral Philosophy, and Its Relation to the Positive Sciences.'' trans. T. M. Knox. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1975. Hegel's mature view and his concept of "ethical life" is elaborated in his ''Philosophy of Right.'' Hegel, ''Philosophy of Right.'' trans. T. M. Knox. Oxford University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; But Hegel's notion of "ethical life" is meant to subsume, rather than replace, [[Kantian ethics]]. And Hegel can be seen as trying to defend Kant's idea of freedom as going beyond finite "desires", by means of reason. Thus, in contrast to later critics like Nietzsche or Russell, Hegel shares some of Kant's most basic concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pippin's ''Hegel's Idealism'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989) emphasizes the continuity of Hegel's concerns with Kant's. Robert Wallace, ''Hegel's Philosophy of Reality, Freedom, and God'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005) explains how Hegel's ''Science of Logic'' defends Kant's idea of freedom as going beyond finite "inclinations", contra skeptics such as David Hume.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's thinking on religion was used in Britain to challenge the decline in religious faith in the nineteenth century. British Catholic writers, notably [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]], followed this approach. [[Ronald Englefield]] debated this movement, and Kant's use of language. See Englefield's article,&lt;ref&gt;Englefield, Ronald, ''Kant as Defender of the Faith in Nineteenth-century England", ''Question'', 12, 16–27, (Pemberton, London)&lt;/ref&gt; reprinted in Englefield.&lt;ref&gt;Englefield, Ronald, Critique of Pure Verbiage, Essays on Abuses of Language in Literary, Religious, and Philosophical Writings, edited by G. A. Wells and D. R. Oppenheimer, Open Court, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of Kant were common in the realist views of the new positivism at that time.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was strongly influenced by Kant's [[transcendental idealism]]. He, like [[G. E. Schulze]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], and Fichte before him, was critical of Kant's theory of the thing in itself. Things in themselves, they argued, are neither the cause of what we observe nor are they completely beyond our access. Ever since the first ''Critique of Pure Reason'' philosophers have been critical of Kant's theory of the thing in itself. Many have argued, if such a thing exists beyond experience then one cannot posit that it affects us causally, since that would entail stretching the category 'causality' beyond the realm of experience. For a review of this problem and the relevant literature see ''The Thing in Itself and the Problem of Affection'' in the revised edition of Henry Allison's ''Kant's Transcendental Idealism''. For Schopenhauer things in themselves do not exist outside the non-rational will. The world, as Schopenhauer would have it, is the striving and largely unconscious will. Michael Kelly, in the preface to his 1910 book ''Kant's Ethics and Schopenhauer's Criticism'', stated: "Of Kant it may be said that what is good and true in his philosophy would have been buried with him, were it not for Schopenhauer...."

With the success and wide influence of Hegel's writings, Kant's influence began to wane, though there was in Germany a movement that hailed a return to Kant in the 1860s, beginning with the publication of ''Kant und die Epigonen'' in 1865 by [[Otto Liebmann]]. His motto was "Back to Kant", and a re-examination of his ideas began (See [[Neo-Kantianism]]). During the turn of the 20th century there was an important revival of Kant's theoretical philosophy, known as the [[Marburg School]], represented in the work of [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Paul Natorp]], [[Ernst Cassirer]],&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Lewis White. "Neo-Kantianism". In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 5–6. Macmillan, 1973. Article on Neo-Kantianism by a translator and scholar of Kant.&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-Neo-Kantian [[Nicolai Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Cerf, Walter. "Nicolai Hartmann". In ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Vol. 3–4. Macmillan, 1973. Nicolai was a realist who later rejected the idealism of Neo-Kantianism, his anti-Neo-Kantian views emerging with the publication of the second volume of ''Hegel'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's notion of "Critique" has been quite influential. The Early German Romantics, especially [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] in his "Athenaeum Fragments", used Kant's self-reflexive conception of criticism in their Romantic theory of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, Friedrich. "Athenaeum Fragments", in ''Philosophical Fragments''. Trans. Peter Firchow. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1991. See especially fragments Nos. 1, 43, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in [[Aesthetics]], [[Clement Greenberg]], in his classic essay "Modernist Painting", uses Kantian criticism, what Greenberg refers to as "immanent criticism", to justify the aims of [[Abstract Art|Abstract painting]], a movement Greenberg saw as aware of the key limitiaton—flatness—that makes up the medium of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Clement. "Modernist Painting", in ''The Philosophy of Art'', ed. Alex Neill and Aaron Ridley, McGraw-Hill, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] was also greatly influenced by Kant's notion of "Critique" and wrote several pieces on Kant for a re-thinking of the Enlightenment as a form of "critical thought". He went so far as to classify his own philosophy as a "critical history of modernity, rooted in Kant".&lt;ref&gt;See "Essential Works of Foucault: 1954–1984 vol.2: Aesthetics, Method, and Epistemology." Ed. by James Faubion, Trans. Robert Hurley et al. New York City, New York: The New Press, 1998 (2010 reprint). See "Foucault, Michel, 1926 –" entry by Maurice Florence.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant believed that mathematical truths were forms of [[synthetic a priori]] knowledge, which means they are necessary and universal, yet known through intuition.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion and qualified defense of this position, see Stephen Palmquist, "A Priori Knowledge in Perspective: (I) Mathematics, Method and Pure Intuition", ''The Review of Metaphysics'' 41:1 (September 1987), pp. 3–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's often brief remarks about [[mathematics]] influenced the mathematical school known as [[intuitionism]], a movement in [[philosophy of mathematics]] opposed to [[David Hilbert|Hilbert's]] [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], and [[Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[logicism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephan Körner|Körner, Stephan]], ''The Philosophy of Mathematics'', Dover, 1986. For an analysis of Kant's writings on mathematics see, Friedman, Michael, ''Kant and the Exact Sciences'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on modern thinkers===
[[File:DBP - 250 Jahre Immanuel Kant - 90 Pfennig - 1974.jpg|thumb|West German postage stamp, 1974, commemorating the 250th anniversary of Kant's birth]]
With his ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'', Kant is considered to have foreshadowed many of the ideas that have come to form the [[democratic peace theory]], one of the main controversies in [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, James Lee. [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm ''Does Democracy Cause Peace?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217032515/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |date=17 February 2008 }} Annual Review of Political Science 1998. 1:27–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent recent Kantians include the British philosophers [[P. F. Strawson]]&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, P. F., ''The Bounds of Sense: An Essay on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.'' Routledge: 2004. When first published in 1966, this book forced many Anglo-American philosophers to reconsider Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quassim Cassam]]&lt;ref&gt;Cassam, Q., "The Possibility of Knowledge" Oxford: 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the American philosophers [[Wilfrid Sellars]]&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, Wilfrid, ''Science and Metaphysics: Variations on Kantian Themes.'' Ridgeview Publishing Company, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christine Korsgaard]].&lt;ref&gt;Korsgaard, Christine. ''Creating the Kingdom of Ends.'' Cambridge; New York, NY, US: Cambridge University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-521-49644-6}}, {{ISBN|0-521-49962-3}} (pbk.) ''Not a commentary, but a defense of a broadly Kantian approach to ethics''&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influence of Strawson and Sellars, among others, there has been a renewed interest in Kant's view of the mind. Central to many debates in [[philosophy of psychology]] and [[cognitive science]] is Kant's conception of the unity of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Brook|Brook, Andrew]]. ''Kant and the Mind''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994. See also, Meerbote, R. "Kant's [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]]". In: J. C. Smith, ed. ''Historical Foundations of Cognitive Science''. Dordrecht, Holland: Reidel, 1991. Brook has an article on Kant's View of the Mind in the [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-mind/ Stanford Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[John Rawls]] are two significant political and moral philosophers whose work is strongly influenced by Kant's moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See Habermas, J. ''Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action.'' Trans. Christian Lenhardt and Shierry Weber Nicholsen. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1996. For Rawls see, Rawls, John. ''Theory of Justice'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1971. Rawls has a well-known essay on Kant's concept of good. See, Rawls, "Themes in Kant's Moral Philosophy" in ''Kant's Transcendental Deductions''. Ed. Eckart Förster. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; They argued against relativism,&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J. (1994): The Unity of Reason in the Diversity of Its Voices. In: Habermas, J. (Eds.): Postmetaphysical Thinking. Political Essays, Cambridge, Massachusetts: 115–148.&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the Kantian view that universality is essential to any viable moral philosophy. Jean-Francois Lyotard, however, emphasized the indeterminacy in the nature of thought and language and has engaged in debates with Habermas based on the effects this indeterminacy has on philosophical and political debates.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. (2984) Habermas and Lyotard on postmodernity. Praxis International (32-44)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's influence also has extended to the social, behavioral, and physical sciences, as in the sociology of [[Max Weber]], the psychology of [[Jean Piaget]], and the linguistics of [[Noam Chomsky]]. Kant's work on mathematics and synthetic a priori knowledge is also cited by theoretical physicist [[Albert Einstein]] as an early influence on his intellectual development.&lt;ref&gt;Issacson, Walter. "Einstein: His Life and Universe." p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the thoroughness of the Kantian paradigm shift, his influence extends to thinkers who neither specifically refer to his work nor use his terminology.

==Personal legacy==

Kant always cut a curious figure in his lifetime for his modest, rigorously scheduled habits, which have been referred to as clocklike. But [[Heinrich Heine]] noted the magnitude of "his destructive, world-crushing thoughts" and considered him a sort of philosophical "executioner", comparing him to [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] with the observation that both men "represented in the highest the type of provincial bourgeois. Nature had destined them to weigh coffee and sugar, but Fate determined that they should weigh other things and placed on the scales of the one a king, on the scales of the other a god."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/resources/files/On%20Kant.pdf |title=Heine on Immanuel Kant |access-date=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When his body was transferred to a new burial spot, his skull was measured during the exhumation and found to be larger than the average German male's with a "high and broad" forehead.&lt;ref&gt;''Examined Lives, From Socrates to Nietzsche'', James Miller p.284&lt;/ref&gt; His forehead has been an object of interest ever since it became well-known through his portraits: "In Döbler's portrait and in Kiefer's faithful if expressionistic reproduction of it — as well as in many of the other late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century portraits of Kant — the forehead is remarkably large and decidedly retreating. Was Kant's forehead shaped this way in these images because he was a philosopher, or, to follow the implications of Lavater's system, was he a philosopher because of the intellectual acuity manifested by his forehead? Kant and Johann Kaspar Lavater were correspondents on theological matters, and Lavater refers to Kant in his work "Physiognomic Fragments, for the Education of Human Knowledge and Love of People" (Leipzig &amp; Winterthur, 1775-1778).&lt;ref&gt;''Immanuel Kant and the Bo(a)rders of Art History'' Mark Cheetham, in The Subjects of Art History: Historical Objects in Contemporary Perspectives, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tomb and statue==
[[File:Kant kaliningrad2.png|upright|thumb|Kant's tomb in [[Kaliningrad]], Russia]]

Kant's [[mausoleum]] adjoins the northeast corner of [[Königsberg Cathedral]] in [[Kaliningrad]], Russia. The mausoleum was constructed by the architect [[Friedrich Lahrs]] and was finished in 1924 in time for the bicentenary of Kant's birth. Originally, Kant was buried inside the cathedral, but in 1880 his remains were moved to a [[neo-Gothic]] chapel adjoining the northeast corner of the cathedral. Over the years, the chapel became dilapidated and was demolished to make way for the mausoleum, which was built on the same location.

The tomb and its mausoleum are among the few artifacts of German times preserved by the [[Soviets]] after they conquered and annexed the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/architectural-competition-held-to-rebuild-koenigsberg-city-center-a-980260.html|title=Resurrecting Königsberg: Russian City Looks to German Roots|last=Beyer|first=Susanne|date=2014-07-25|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many newlyweds bring flowers to the mausoleum.

Artifacts previously owned by Kant, known as ''Kantiana'', were included in the [[Königsberg City Museum]]. However, the museum was destroyed during [[World War II]].

A replica of the statue of Kant that stood in German times in front of the main [[University of Königsberg]] building was donated by a German entity in the early 1990s and placed in the same grounds.

After the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion]] of [[Königsberg]]'s German population at the end of [[World War II]], the University of Königsberg where Kant taught was replaced by the Russian-language Kaliningrad State University, which appropriated the campus and surviving buildings. In 2005, the university was renamed [[Immanuel Kant State University of Russia]]. The name change was announced at a ceremony attended by President [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia and Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of Germany, and the university formed a Kant Society, dedicated to the study of [[Kantianism]].

===Collected works in German===
[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] inaugurated the Academy edition (the ''Akademie-Ausgabe'' abbreviated as ''AA'' or ''Ak'') of Kant's writings (''Gesammelte Schriften'', [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Königlich-Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften]], Berlin, 1902–38) in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Notes and Fragments'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; and served as its first editor. The volumes are grouped into four sections:
* I. Kant's published writings (vols. 1–9),
* II. Kant's correspondence (vols. 10–13),
* III. Kant's literary remains, or ''[[Nachlass]]'' (vols. 14–23), and
* IV. Student notes from Kant's lectures (vols. 24–29).

In Germany, one important contemporary interpreter of Kant and the movement of [[German Idealism]] he began is [[Dieter Henrich]], who has some work available in English. [[P. F. Strawson]]'s ''[[The Bounds of Sense]]'' (1966) played a significant role in determining the contemporary reception of Kant in England and America. More recent interpreters of note in the English-speaking world include [[Lewis White Beck]], [[Jonathan Bennett (philosopher)|Jonathan Bennett]], Henry Allison, [[Paul Guyer]], [[Christine Korsgaard]], Stephen Palmquist, [[Robert B. Pippin]], [[Roger Scruton]], [[Rudolf Makkreel]], and [[Béatrice Longuenesse]].

An alum of The Straitjacket Society in Los Angeles, CA, Jillian auditioned for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and though she did not join the cast, she became a writer for the show in 2009 for the [[Saturday Night Live (season 35)|thirty-fifth season]].&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; The same year Bell appeared in an episode of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' as an assistant who wears revealing clothing at work.&lt;ref name=huffpo/&gt;

In 2011, she began to play "Jillian Belk" on the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Workaholics]]''. Film director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] noticed her in ''Workaholics'' and cast her in a small role in his 2012 film, ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'' and yet again in another small role in his 2014 film, ''[[Inherent Vice (film)|Inherent Vice]]''.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; She had a recurring role as Dixie in the fourth and final season of ''[[Eastbound and Down]]''.

'''Juliet Capulet''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Giulietta Capuleti'') is the female [[protagonist]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s romantic [[tragedy]] ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. Juliet is the only daughter of the patriarch of the [[House of Capulet]].  She falls in love with [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]], a member of the [[House of Montague]] (with which the Capulets have a [[blood feud]]).  The [[The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet|story]] has a long history that precedes Shakespeare himself.

[[File:Juliet - Philip H. Calderon.jpg|thumb|right|''Juliet'' by [[Philip H. Calderon]]]]

== Juliet's age ==

One aspect of the story which now seems problematic is Juliet's age. As the story occurs, Juliet is approaching her fourteenth birthday. She was born on "[[Lammas]] Eve at night" (1 August), so Juliet's birthday is 31 July (1.3.19). Her birthday is "a fortnight hence", putting the action of the play in mid-July (1.3.17). Her father states that she "hath not seen the change of fourteen years" (1.2.9). In many cultures and time periods, women did and do marry and bear children at an early age. ''Romeo and Juliet'' is a play about Italian families. Lady Capulet had given birth to her first child by the time she had reached Juliet's age: "By my count, I was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid." (1.3.74–75).

Even Capulet tries to encourage Paris to wait a little longer before even thinking of marrying his daughter, feeling that she is still too young; "She hath not seen the change of fourteen years, Let two more summers wither in their pride, Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride". However, in the English poem the story is based on (''Romeus and Juliet'' by [[Arthur Brooke (poet)|Arthur Brooke]])&lt;ref name="Romeus and Juliet"&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/shakespeare/romeus.html The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet], Arthur Brooke.&lt;/ref&gt; Juliet is approaching her sixteenth birthday and Romeo is the same age whereas in the [[Bandello]] novella she is nearly eighteen with Romeo about twenty.&lt;ref name="Franson, J.

Papers on Language &amp; Literature, Vol. 32, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The common English people of that age were very rarely in their teens when they married and even among the nobility and gentry of the age, brides thirteen years of age were rare, at about one in one thousand brides; in that era, the vast majority of English brides were [[Western European marriage pattern|at least nineteen years of age]] when they first married, most commonly at about 23 years, and most English noblewomen were at least sixteen when they married. That the parts of young women were played by pre-adolescent boys in Shakespeare's day also cannot be overlooked and it is possible that Shakespeare had the physique of a young boy in mind during composition, in addition to the fact that Romeo and Juliet are of wealthy families and would be more likely to marry earlier than commoners.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, Peter. 1965. The World We Have Lost. New York City: Charles Scribner's Sons. p 82-86&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, English noblewomen married on average at 19–21 years (compared to 24–26 years for English noblemen) while the average marriage age in England was 25–26 years for women and 27–28 for men;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Bruce W. 2008. Family Life in the Age of Shakespeare. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press. p 41&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Thomas More]] wrote in his ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' that, in Utopia, women must be at least 18 years of age when they marry and men at least 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elizabethan.org/compendium/9.html Life in Elizabethan England: Weddings and Betrothals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uzgalis, William. 1997. Utopia, by Sir Thomas More. New York: Ideal Commonwealths. P.F. Collier &amp; Son. {{cite web |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/more/utopia-slaves.html |title=''Utopia'' by Sir Thomas More |accessdate=13 March 2014 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026010854/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/more/utopia-slaves.html |archive-date=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common belief in [[Elizabethan England]] was that motherhood before 16 was dangerous; popular manuals of health, as well as observations of married life, led Elizabethans to believe that early marriage and its consummation permanently damaged a young woman's health, impaired a young man's physical and mental development, and produced sickly or stunted children. Therefore, 18 came to be considered the earliest reasonable age for motherhood and 20 and 30 the ideal ages for women and men, respectively, to marry. Shakespeare might also have reduced Juliet's age from sixteen to thirteen to demonstrate the dangers of marriage at too young of an age; that Shakespeare himself married [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]] when he was just eighteen might hold some significance.&lt;ref name="Franson, J. Karl 1996"/&gt;

== In today's Verona ==

=== ''Casa di Giulietta'' ===

[[File:Julia balcony.jpg|thumb|right|Juliet's purported balcony, in Verona. Beneath it, on the walls, there are love letters.]]
[[File:Juliet's wall with names.JPG|thumb|right|The entrance wall known as Juliet's wall]]

In [[Verona]], an early 14th-century house at Via Cappello no. 23, claiming to be the Capulets' has been turned into a tourist attraction but it is mostly empty. The real second name was in Italian Cappelletti, a noble family, and not Capuleti. Cappelletti were in the past members of the light cavalry of the Republic of Venice. They fought for it since the 13th century and they were originally from Dalmatia and Albania. It features the balcony, and in the small courtyard, a bronze statue of Juliet. It is one of the most visited sites in the town. The metal of its chest is worn bare due to a legend that if a person strokes the right breast of the statue, that person will have good fortune and luck in love.&lt;ref name="igougo" /&gt;

Many people write their names and the names of their beloved ones on the walls of the entrance, known as Juliet's wall. Many believe that writing on that place will make their love everlasting. After a restoration and cleaning of the building, it was intended that further writing should be on replaceable panels&lt;ref name="Veronissima" /&gt; or white sheets&lt;ref name="PremioTerna" /&gt; placed outside the wall.

It is also a tradition to put small love letters on the walls (which is done by the thousands each year), which are regularly taken down by employees to keep the courtyard clean.&lt;ref name="DesenzanoItaly" /&gt;

Another tradition that occurs in Juliet's courtyard is writing your name and that of your loved one on a lock and attaching it to a large ornamental gate in the back left. The gate is overwhelmed with locks that hold hope for lasting love. This tradition is seen throughout Europe on bridges and gates all over cities.

=== Club di Giulietta ===
Since the 1930s, letters addressed to Juliet keep arriving in Verona. As of 2010, more than 5,000 letters were received annually, three-quarters of which were from women. The largest single group of senders was American teenagers.&lt;ref name="Hooper 2010" /&gt; The letters are read and replied to by local volunteers, organised since the 1980s in the ''Club di Giulietta'' (Juliet Club), which is financed by the City of Verona.&lt;ref name="Hooper 2010" /&gt; The club has been the subject of a book by Lise and Ceil Friedman and is the setting for a 2008 book by Suzanne Harper and a 2010 USA movie, ''[[Letters to Juliet]]''.

'''''{{lang|frm|Le Morte d'Arthur}}''''' (originally spelled '''''{{lang|frm|Le Morte Darthur}}''''', [[Middle French]] for "The Death of Arthur"&lt;ref&gt;Since ''morte'' (or ''mort'') is a feminine noun, French would require the article ''la'' (i.e., "la mort d'Arthur"). According to Stephen H. A. Shepherd, "Malory frequently misapplies ''le'' in titular compounds, perhaps on a simple sonic and gender-neutral analogy with 'the'". Stephen H. A. Shepherd, ed., ''Le Morte Darthur'', by Sir Thomas Malory (New York: W. W. Norton, 2004), 1n.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a reworking by Sir [[Thomas Malory]] of existing tales about the legendary [[King Arthur]], [[Guinevere]], [[Lancelot]], [[Merlin]], and the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Malory interpreted existing French and English stories about these figures and adds original material (e.g., the [[Gareth]] story). Malory's actual title for the work was '''''The Whole Book of King Arthur and His Noble Knights of the Round Table''''', but after Malory's death the publisher changed the title to what is commonly known today. "The Death of Arthur" originally only referred to the final volume in the complete work.

''Le Morte d'Arthur'' was first published in 1485 by [[William Caxton]] and is today one of the best-known works of [[Arthurian literature]] in English. Until the discovery of the [[Winchester Manuscript]] in 1934, the 1485 edition was considered the earliest known text of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' and that closest to Malory's translation and compilation.&lt;ref name="Bryan vii"&gt;Bryan, Elizabeth J. (1994/1999). "Sir Thomas Malory", ''Le Morte D'Arthur'', p.vii. Modern Library. New York. {{ISBN|0-679-60099-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Various modern editions are inevitably variable, changing a variety of spelling, grammar, and/or pronouns for the convenience of readers of modern English. Many modern Arthurian writers have used Malory as their principal source.

==Authorship==
{{main|Sir Thomas Malory}}

The exact identity of the author of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' has long been the subject of speculation, owing to the fact that at least six historical figures bore the name of "Sir Thomas Malory" in the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Bryan|1994/1999|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work the author describes himself as "Knyght presoner Thomas Malleorre" ("Sir Thomas Maleore" according to the publisher [[William Caxton]]). This is taken as supporting evidence for the identification most widely accepted by scholars: that the author was the Thomas Malory born in the year 1416, to Sir John Malory of [[Newbold Revel]], [[Warwickshire]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wight|first1=Colin|title=Thomas Malory's 'Le Morte Darthur'|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/englit/malory/|website=www.bl.uk|language=en|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Whitteridge|2009|pp=257–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Thomas inherited the family estate in 1434, but by 1450 he was fully engaged in a life of crime. As early as 1433 he had been accused of theft, but the more serious allegations against him were that of the attempted murder of [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], an accusation of at least two rapes, and that he had attacked and robbed [[Coombe Abbey]]. Malory was first arrested and imprisoned in 1451 for the ambush of Buckingham, but was released early in 1452. By March he was back in the [[Marshalsea]] prison and then in [[Colchester]], escaping on at least two occasions. In 1461 he was granted a pardon by [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], returning to live at his estate.

Although originally allied to the [[House of York]], after his release Malory changed his allegiance to the [[House of Lancaster]]. This led to him being imprisoned yet again in 1468 when he led an ill-fated plot to overthrow [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It was during this final stint at [[Newgate Prison]] in London that he is believed to have written ''Le Morte d'Arthur''. Malory was released in October, 1470 when Henry VI came to the throne, but died only five months later.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Publication history==
Elizabeth Bryan speaks of Malory's contribution to Arthurian legend in her introduction to ''Le Morte d'Arthur'': "Malory did not invent the stories in this collection; he translated and compiled them... Malory in fact translated Arthurian stories that already existed in thirteenth-century French prose (the so-called [[Old French]] [[Vulgate Cycle|Vulgate romances]]) and compiled them together with at least one tale from [[Middle English]] sources (the [[Alliterative Morte Arthure|Alliterative ''Morte Arthure'']] and the [[Stanzaic Morte Arthur|Stanzaic ''Morte Arthur'']]) to create this text."&lt;ref name="Bryan viii"&gt;Bryan (1994), p.viii-ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malory called the full work ''The Hoole Book of Kyng Arthur and of His Noble Knyghtes of The Rounde Table'', but William Caxton instead titled it with Malory's name for the final section of the cycle. Modernized editions update the late Middle English spelling, update some pronouns, and re-punctuate and re-paragraph the text. Others furthermore update the phrasing and vocabulary to contemporary [[Modern English]]. Here is an example (from Caxton's preface) in Middle English and then in Modern English:

:Doo after the good and leve the evyl, and it shal brynge you to good fame and renomme.&lt;ref name="Bryan xii"&gt;Bryan (1994), p.xii.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Do after the good and leave the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renown.&lt;ref name="Bryan xviii"&gt;Bryan, ed. (1999), p.xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle English of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' is much closer to [[Early Modern English]] than the Middle English of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. If the spelling is modernized, it reads almost like Elizabethan English.

The first printing of Malory's work was made by Caxton in 1485. Only two copies of this original printing are known to exist, in the collections of the [[Morgan Library &amp; Museum]] in New York and the [[John Rylands Library]] in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/malorybooklet/malory.htm | title=Malory's Morte d'Arthur | publisher=The Rossell Hope Robbins Library at the University of Rochester | year=2010 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | author=McShane, Kara L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proved popular and was reprinted in 1498 and 1529 with some additions and changes by [[Wynkyn de Worde]] who succeeded Caxton's press. Three more editions were published before the [[English Civil War]]: William Copland's (1557), [[Thomas East]]'s (1585), and [[William Stansby]]'s (1634), each of which contained additional changes and errors (including the omission of an entire leaf). Thereafter, the book went out of fashion until the [[romanticism|Romantic]] revival of interest in all things [[medieval]]; the year 1816 saw a new edition by Walker and Edwards, and another one by Wilks, both based on the 1634 Stansby edition. Davison's 1817 edition was promoted by [[Robert Southey]] and was based on Caxton's 1485 edition or on a mixture of Caxton and Stansby. Davison was the basis for subsequent editions until the discovery of the Winchester Manuscript.

Caxton separated Malory's eight books into 21 books; subdivided each book into a total of 507 chapters; added a summary of each chapter and added a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] to the entire book.&lt;ref name="Bryan ix"&gt;Bryan (2004), p.ix&lt;/ref&gt; Malory's eight tales are:
#The birth and rise of Arthur: "From the Marriage of King Uther unto King Arthur that Reigned After Him and Did Many Battles"
#[[King Arthur]]'s war against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]: "The Noble Tale Between King Arthur and Lucius the Emperor of Rome"
#The book of [[Lancelot]]: "The Tale of Sir Launcelot du Lac"
#The book of [[Gareth]] (brother of [[Gawain]]): "The Tale of Sir Gareth"
#[[Tristan]] and [[Isolde]]: "The Book of Sir Tristrams de Lyons"
#The Quest for the [[Holy Grail]]: "The Noble Tale of the Sangreal"
#The affair between [[Lancelot]] and [[Guinevere]]: "Sir Launcelot and Queen Gwynevere"
#The breaking of the [[Knights of the Round Table]] and the death of Arthur: "Le Morte d'Arthur"

Most of the events in the book take place in [[Sub-Roman Britain|Britain]] and France at an unspecified time. (The historical events on which the legend is based took place in the late 5th century, but the story contains many [[anachronism]]s and makes no effort at historical accuracy.) In some parts, the story ventures farther afield, to [[Rome]] and [[Sarras]] (near [[Babylon]]), and recalls [[Bible|Biblical]] tales from the [[ancient Near East]].

===The Winchester Manuscript===
{{for|the Winchester Chronicle|Anglo-Saxon Chronicle}}

[[Winchester College]] headmaster [[Walter Fraser Oakeshott|W. F. Oakeshott]] discovered a previously unknown [[manuscript]] copy of the work in June 1934, during the cataloging of the college's library. Newspaper accounts announced that what Caxton had published in 1485 was not exactly what Malory had written.&lt;ref name="manuscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://virtual.park.uga.edu/~jdmevans/public/september.html |title=The Text of Malory |author=W. F. Oakeshott |accessdate=2009-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703210455/http://virtual.park.uga.edu/~jdmevans/public/september.html |archivedate=2008-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oakeshott published "The Finding of the Manuscript" in 1963, chronicling the initial event and his realization that "this indeed was Malory," with "startling evidence of revision" in the Caxton edition.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Walter F. Oakeshott, "The Finding of the Manuscript," ''Essays on Malory'', ed. J. A. W. Bennett (Oxford: Clarendon, 1963), 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that Caxton's text and the Winchester manuscript are both derived from an earlier copy. (Having said this, microscopic examination revealed that ink smudges on the Winchester manuscript are offsets of newly printed pages set in Caxton's own font, which indicates that the Winchester Manuscript was in Caxton's print shop. The "Winchester Manuscript" is believed to be closer on the whole to Malory's original. In addition, it does not have the book and chapter divisions for which Caxton takes credit in his preface.

Malory scholar [[Eugène Vinaver]] examined the manuscript shortly after its discovery. Oakeshott was encouraged to produce an edition himself, but he ceded the project to Vinaver.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Based on his initial study of the manuscript, Oakeshott concluded in 1935 that the copy from which Caxton printed his edition "was already subdivided into books and sections."&lt;ref&gt;Walter F. Oakeshott, "Caxton and Malory's Morte Darthur," ''[[Gutenberg-Jahrbuch]]'' (1935), 112-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Vinaver made an exhaustive comparison of the manuscript with Caxton's edition and reached similar conclusions. In his 1947 publication of ''The Works of Sir Thomas Malory'', he argued that Malory did not write a single book, but rather a series of Arthurian tales, each of which is an internally consistent and independent work. However, scholars (including William Matthews) pointed out that Malory's later tales make frequent references back to the earlier events, suggesting that he had wanted the tales to cohere better but had not sufficiently revised the whole text to achieve this.&lt;ref&gt;William Matthews, ''The Ill-Framed Knight: A Skeptical Inquiry into the Identity of Sir Thomas Malory'' (Berkeley, CA: University of California, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Winchester manuscript has been digitised by a Japanese team, who note that "the text is imperfect, as the manuscript lacks the first and last quires and few leaves. The most striking feature of the manuscript is the [[Rubrication|extensive use of red ink]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maloryproject.com/winchester_more.php The Malory Project (http://www.maloryproject.com)], directed by Takako Kato and designed by Nick Hayward.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whetter|first1=K. S.|title=The Manuscript and Meaning of Malory's Morte Darthur|date=2017|publisher=D. S. Brewer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style and themes===
The publication of Chaucer's work by William Caxton was a precursor to his publication of Malory's ''Le Morte d'Arthur''. Where the ''Canterbury Tales'' are in Middle English, Malory extends "one hand to Chaucer, and one to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]" constructing a manuscript which is hard to place in one category. Like other English prose in the 15th century, ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' was highly influenced by French writings, but Malory blends these with other English verse and prose forms. Although Malory hearkens back to an age of idealized knighthood, jousting tournaments, and grand castles to suggest a medieval world, his stories lack any agricultural life, or commerce which makes the story feel as if it were an era of its own.

Because there is so much lengthy ground to cover, Malory uses "so—and—then," often to transition his retelling. This repetition is not redundant, but adds an air of continuity only befitting the story's scale and grandeur. The stories then become episodes instead of instances that can stand on their own.

There is an artful way in which Malory portrays Arthur by revealing him to the readers only by how others are affected by his actions. This creates a man whom we cannot define, but still stands as the center of the legend, and lets our mind move from him to the scenes around him.&lt;ref&gt;"Morte d'Arthur."

==Synopsis==
===Book I: "From the Marriage of King Uther unto King Arthur that Reigned After Him and Did Many Battles" (Caxton I–IV)===
[[King Arthur|Arthur]] is born to [[Uther Pendragon]] and [[Igraine]] and then taken by [[Sir Ector]] to be fostered in the country. He later becomes the king of a leaderless Britain when he removes the fated sword from the stone. Arthur goes on to win many battles due to his military prowess and [[Merlin]]'s counsel. He then consolidates his kingdom.

This first book also tells "The Tale of [[Sir Balin|Balyn]] and [[Sir Balan|Balan]]", which ends in accidental fratricide, and the begetting of [[Mordred]], Arthur's incestuous son by his half-sister, [[Morgause]] (though Arthur did not know her as his half-sister). On Merlin's advice, and reminiscent of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], Arthur takes every newborn boy in his kingdom and sends them to sea in a boat. The boat crashes and all but Mordred, who later kills his father, perish (this is mentioned matter-of-fact, with no apparent moral overtone). Arthur marries [[Guinevere]], and inherits the [[Round Table]] from her father [[Leodegrance]]. At [[Pentecost]], Arthur gathers his knights at [[Camelot]] and establishes the Round Table company. All swear to the [[Pentecostal Oath]] as a guide for knightly conduct.

===Book II: "The Noble Tale Between King Arthur and Lucius the Emperor of Rome" (Caxton V)===
This book, detailing Arthur's march on [[Rome]], is heavily based on the Middle English [[Alliterative Morte Arthure|Alliterative ''Morte Arthure'']], which in turn is heavily based on [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. The opening of Book V finds Arthur and his kingdom without an enemy. His throne is secure, his knights have proven themselves through a series of quests, Sir [[Lancelot]] and Sir [[Tristan]] have arrived and the court is feasting. When envoys from [[Lucius Tiberius|Emperor Lucius]] of Rome arrive and accuse Arthur of refusing tribute, "contrary to the statutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy [[Julius Caesar]]", Arthur and his knights are stirring for a fight. They are "many days rested" and excited, "for now shall we have warre and worshype." Arthur invokes the lineage of Ser [[Belinus|Belyne]] and Sir [[Brennius|Bryne]], legendary British conquerors of Rome, and through their blood lineage demands tribute from Lucius under the argument that Britain conquered Rome first. Lucius, apprised of the situation by his envoys, raises a heathen army of the East, composed of [[Spain|Spaniards]] and [[Saracen]]s, as well as other enemies of the Christian world. Rome is supposed to be the seat of Christianity, but it is more foreign and corrupt than the courts of Arthur and his allies. 

Departing from Geoffrey of Monmouth's history in which Mordred is left in charge, Malory's Arthur leaves his court in the hands of Sir [[Constantine III of Britain|Constantine]] of Cornwall and an advisor. Arthur sails to [[Normandy]] to meet his cousin [[Hoel]], but he finds a giant terrorizing the people from the holy island of [[Mont Saint-Michel|Mont St. Michel]]. Arthur battles him alone, an act of public relations intended to inspire his knights. The giant dies after Arthur "swappis his genytrottys in sondir" and "kut his baly in sundir, that oute wente the gore." Arthur then fights Lucius and his armies defeat the Romans. He is crowned Emperor, a proxy government is arranged for the Roman Empire and Arthur returns to London where his queen welcomes him royally.

===Book III: "The Noble Tale of Sir Launcelot Du Lac" (Caxton VI)===
In this tale, Malory establishes Lancelot as King Arthur's most revered knight. Among Lancelot's numerous episodic adventures include being enchanted into a deep sleep by the four sorceresses including [[Morgan le Fay]] and [[Sebile]] and having to escape from their castle, proving victorious in a tournament fighting on behalf of King [[Bagdemagus]], slaying the mighty Sir Turquine who had been holding several of Arthur's knights prisoner, and also overcoming the betrayal of a damsel to defend himself unarmed against Sir Phelot.

===Book IV: "The Tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney" (Caxton VII)===
The tale of Sir [[Gareth]] begins with his arrival at court as ''[[le bel inconnu]]'', or the fair unknown. He comes without a name and therefore without a past. [[Sir Kay]] mockingly calls the unknown young man "Beaumains" and treats him with contempt and condescension. An unknown woman, later revealed to be the Dame [[Lynette and Lyonesse|Lynette]], eventually comes to court asking for assistance against the [[Red Knight]] of the Red Lands, and Gareth takes up the quest. On his quest, he encounters the [[Black knight|Black]], [[Green Knight|Green]], [[Red Knight|Red]], and Blue knights and the Red knight of the Red Lands. He kills the Black Knight, incorporates the others into Arthur's court, and rescues Lynette's sister [[Lynette and Lyonesse|Lyonesse]]. Lustily in love with Lyonesse, Gareth conspires to consummate their relationship before marrying. Only by the magical intervention of Lynette is their tryst unsuccessful, thus preserving Gareth's virginity and, presumably, his standing with God. Gareth later counsels Lyonesse to report to King Arthur and pretend she doesn't know where he is; instead, he tells her to announce a tournament of his knights against the Round Table. This allows Gareth to disguise himself and win honor by defeating his brother knights. The heralds eventually acknowledge that he is Sir Gareth right as he strikes down Sir [[Gawain]], his brother. The book ends with Gareth rejoining his fellow knights and marrying Lyonesse.

In Book IV, there are only two knights that have ever held against Sir Lancelot in tournament: Tristan and Gareth. This was always under conditions where one or both parties were unknown by the other, for these knights loved each other "passingly well." Gareth was knighted by Lancelot himself when he took upon him the adventure on behalf of Dame Lynette. Much later, Gareth is accidentally slain by his beloved Lancelot when Guinevere is rescued from being burnt at the stake by King Arthur.

===Book V: "The First and the Second Book of Sir Tristrams de Lione" (Caxton VIII–XII)===
In "The Fyrste and the Secunde Boke of Syr Trystrams de Lyones", Malory tells the tales of Sir Tristan (Trystram), Sir [[Dinadan]], Sir [[Palamedes (Arthurian legend)|Palamedes]], Sir [[Sir Breunor|La Cote de Male Tayle]], Sir Alexander, and a variety of other knights. Based on the French [[Prose Tristan|Prose ''Tristan'']], or a lost English adaptation of it, Malory's Tristan section is the literal centerpiece of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' as well as the longest of the eight books.

The book is rife with adultery, characterized most visibly in Sir Tristan and the Belle [[Iseult|Isolde]]. However, it should be noted that Sir Tristan had met and fallen in love with Isolde earlier, and that his uncle, King Mark, jealous of Tristan and seeking to undermine him, appears to seek marriage to Isolde for just such a hateful purpose, going so far as to ask Tristan to go and seek her hand on his behalf (which Tristan, understanding that to be his knightly duty, does). Sir Tristan is the namesake of the book and his adulterous relationship with Isolde, his uncle [[Mark of Cornwall|King Mark]]'s wife, is one of the focuses of the section. Other knights, even knights of the Round Table, make requests that show the dark side of the world of chivalry. In one episode, Sir Bleoberis, one of Lancelot's cousins, claims another knight's wife for his own and rides away with her until stopped by Sir Tristan. In another, when Tristan defeats Sir Blamore, another knight of the Round Table, Blamore asks Tristan to kill him because he would rather die than have his reputation tarnished by the defeat.

Of all the knights, Tristan most resembles Lancelot. He loves a queen, the wife of another. Tristan is even considered to be as strong and able a knight as Lancelot, although they become beloved friends. Because of King Mark's treacherous behavior, Tristan takes Isolde from him and lives with her for some time, but he then returns Isolde to him. Nonetheless, Mark kills Tristan while he is "harping" (Tristan is noted in the book as one of the greatest of musicians and falconers).

===Book VI: "The Noble Tale of the Sangreal" (Caxton XIII–XVII)===
Malory's primary source for "The Noble Tale of the Sangreal" is the French [[Vulgate Cycle]]'s ''La Queste Del Saint Graal''. Malory's version chronicles the adventures of numerous knights in their quest to achieve the [[Holy Grail]]. The Grail first appears in the hall of King Arthur "{{H:title|covered|coverde}} with {{H:title|white|whyght}} [[samite|samyte]]," and it miraculously produces meat and drink for the knights. Gawain is the first to declare that he "shall laboure in the Queste of the Sankgreall." He embarks on the quest in order to see the Grail "more opynly than hit hath bene shewed" before, and to gain more "metys and drynkes." Likewise, Lancelot, [[Percival]], [[Bors]], and [[Galahad]] undergo the quest. Their exploits are intermingled with encounters with maidens and hermits who offer advice and interpret dreams along the way.

===Book VII: "Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere" (Caxton XVIII–XIX)===
At the beginning of the book "Sir Launcelot and Queene Gwenyvere", Malory tells his readers that the pair started behaving carelessly in public, stating that "Launcelot began to resort unto the Queene Guinevere again and forget the promise and the perfection that he made in the Quest... and so they loved together more hotter than they did beforehand." They indulged in "privy draughts together" and behaved in such a way that "many in the court spoke of it" (Cooper, 402).

This book also includes the "knight of the cart" episode, where [[Maleagant]] kidnapped Guinevere and her unarmed knights and held them prisoner in his castle. After Maleagant's archers killed his horse, Lancelot had to ride to the castle in a cart in order to save the queen. Knowing Lancelot was on his way, Maleagant pleaded to Guinevere for mercy, which she granted and then forced Lancelot to stifle his rage against Maleagant.

In this same book Malory mentions Lancelot and Guinevere's adultery. Malory says, "So, to passe upon this tale, Sir Launcelot wente to bedde with the Quene and toke no force of his hurte honed, but toke his plesaunce and hys lyknge untyll hit was the dawning of the day" (Cooper, 633). Sir Maleagant, upon finding blood in Guinevere's bed, was so convinced of her unfaithfulness to Arthur that he was willing to fight in an attempt to prove it to others. After Guinevere made it known that she wanted Maleagant dead, Lancelot killed him even though Maleagant begged for mercy (but only after Maleagant agreed to continue fighting with Lancelot's helmet removed, his left side body armor removed, and his left hand tied behind his back—Lancelot felt it necessary to finish the bout, but would not slay Maleagant unless Maleagant agreed to continue fighting). The book ends with Lancelot's healing of Sir Urry of Hungary, where Malory notes that Lancelot is the only knight out of hundreds to succeed in this endeavor.

===Book VIII: "The Death of Arthur" (Caxton XX–XXI)===
Mordred and [[Agravaine]] have been scheming to uncover Lancelot and Guinevere's adultery for quite some time. When they find an opportune moment to finally and concretely reveal the adulterous relationship, Lancelot kills Agravaine and several others and escapes. Arthur is forced to sentence Guinevere to burn at the stake, and orders his surviving nephews, Gawain, Mordred, Gareth, and [[Gaheris]], to guard the scene, knowing Lancelot will attempt a rescue. Gawain flatly refuses to be part of any act that will treat the queen shamefully. His younger brothers, Gaheris and Gareth, unable to deny the king's request that they escort Guinevere to the stake to be burnt, advise that they will do so at his command, but they will not arm themselves. When Lancelot's party raids the execution, many knights are killed, including, by accident, Gareth and Gaheris. Gawain, bent on revenge for their deaths, prompts Arthur into a war with Lancelot, first at his castle in northern Britain. At this point the Pope steps in and issues a [[papal bull|bull]] to end the violence between Arthur's and Lancelot's factions. Shortly thereafter, Arthur pursues Lancelot to his home in France to continue the fight. Gawain twice challenges Lancelot to a duel, but each time loses and asks Lancelot to kill him; Lancelot refuses and grants him mercy before leaving.

Arthur receives a message that Mordred, whom he had left in charge back in Britain, has usurped his throne, and he leads his forces back home. In the invasion Gawain is mortally injured, and writes to Lancelot, asking for his help against Mordred, and for forgiveness for separating the Round Table. In a dream, the departed Gawain tells Arthur to wait thirty days for Lancelot to return to Britain before fighting Mordred, and Arthur sends [[Sir Lucan|Lucan]] and [[Bedivere]] to make a temporary peace treaty. At the exchange, an unnamed knight draws his sword to kill an adder. The other knights construe this as treachery and a declaration of war. Seeing no other recourse, at the [[Battle of Camlann]], Arthur charges Mordred and impales him with a spear. But with the last of his strength, Mordred impales himself even further, so as to come within striking distance of King Arthur, then gives a mortal blow to Arthur's head.

As he was dying, Arthur commands Bedivere to cast his sword [[Excalibur]] into the lake. Bedivere initially does not throw the sword in the lake, but instead hides it behind a tree. He confesses his reluctance to Arthur, then returns to the lake and throws in his own sword instead of Excalibur. Bedivere once again relays his disobedience to Arthur, who requests the sword be returned to the lake for a third time. When Bedivere finally throws Excalibur back in the lake, it is retrieved by the hand of the [[Lady of the Lake]]. The hand shakes the sword three times and then vanishes back into the water. A barge appears, carrying ladies in black hoods (one being Morgan), who take Arthur to the Isle of [[Avalon]].

After the passing of King Arthur, Malory provides a [[Dramatic structure#D.C3.A9nouement.2C resolution.2C or catastrophe|denouement]], mostly following the lives (and deaths) of Guinevere, Lancelot, and Lancelot's kinsmen. When Lancelot returns to Dover, he mourns the deaths of his comrades. Lancelot travels to Almesbury to see Guinevere. During the civil war, Guinevere is portrayed as a scapegoat for violence without developing her perspective or motivation. However, after Arthur's death, Guinevere retires to a convent in penitence for her infidelity. Her contrition is sincere and permanent; Lancelot is unable to sway her to come away with him. Instead, Lancelot becomes a monk, and is joined in monastic life by his kinsmen. Arthur's successor is appointed ([[Constantine (Briton)|Constantine]], son of King Carados of Scotland), and the realm that Arthur created is significantly changed. After the deaths of Guinevere and Lancelot, Sirs Bors, [[Hector de Maris|Hector]], Blamore, and Bleoberis head to the [[Holy Land]] to crusade, where they die on [[Good Friday]].

* The Victorian poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] retold the legends in the poetry volume ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' (1859 and 1885). His work focuses primarily on ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' and the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', but with many expansions, additions, and several adaptations, like the fate of Guinevere. In Malory, she is sentenced to be burnt at the stake but is rescued by Lancelot; in the ''Idylls'' Guinevere flees to a convent, is forgiven by Arthur, repents, and serves in the convent until she dies.
* In 1892, London publisher J. M. Dent &amp; Co. decided to produce an illustrated edition of ''Le Morte Darthur'' in modern spelling. They chose a 20-year-old insurance-office clerk and art student, [[Aubrey Beardsley]], to illustrate the work. It was issued in 12 parts between June 1893 and mid-1894, and met with only modest success at the time. However, it has since been described as Beardsley's first masterpiece, launching what has come to be known as the "Beardsley look".&lt;ref name="Dover"&gt;Dover Publications (1972). ''Beardsley's Illustrations for Le Morte Darthur'', Publisher's note &amp; back cover.&lt;/ref&gt; It was his first major commission, and included nearly 585 chapter openings, borders, initials, ornaments and full- or double-page illustrations. Most of the Dent edition illustrations were reprinted by Dover Publications, New York, in 1972 under the title ''Beardsley's Illustrations for Le Morte Darthur''. A facsimile of the Beardsley edition, complete with Malory's unabridged text, was published in the 1990s.

'''Lisa Sergio''' (Italian-American, 1905–1989) was a radio news broadcaster in Italy under [[Mussolini]] who became a leading anti-Fascist broadcaster and one of the first women to have her own radio news commentary program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flint|first1=Peter|title=Lisa Sergio, Radio Commentator In Italy and New York, Dies at 84|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/26/obituaries/lisa-sergio-radio-commentator-in-italy-and-new-york-dies-at-84.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only woman ''Variety'' included in its 1945 analysis of 30 popular radio news commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sergio|first1=Lisa|title=Brains Have No Sex|url=only woman Variety included in its 1945 analysis of 30 popular radio news commentators|website=NYPR Archives|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergio died on June 22, 1989 in Washington, DC.

==Early life==

Lisa Sergio was born Elisa Maria Alice Sergio in Florence, Italy on March 17, 1905. Her father was Baron Agostino Sergio, a landowner and her mother was Margherita Fitzgerald, daughter of Charles Hoffman Fitzgerald of Baltimore, Maryland, and Alice Lawrason Riggs from Virginia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/3144|title=LISA SERGIO: HOW MUSSOLINI'S "GOLDEN VOICE" OF PROPAGANDA CREATED AN AMERICAN MASS COMMUNICATION CAREER|last=Stacy|first=Spaulding,|website=drum.lib.umd.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents separated in 1922, after her father attempted to shoot her mother.

==Journalistic career in Italy==
In 1922, Sergio became an associate editor of the ''Italian Mail'', the only English-language weekly in Italy, eventually becoming the assistant editor and then the editor. Known as "the Golden Voice of Rome," Sergio was one of the first women broadcasters in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1601077631/totalitarian-refugee-or-fascist-mistress-comparing|title="Totalitarian Refugee or Fascist Mistress? Comparing Lisa Sergio's Autobiography to Her FBI File" by Spaulding, Stacy – Journalism History, Vol. 34, Issue 3, Fall 2008 {{!}} Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having grown up speaking both Italian and English at home, Sergio translated [[Benito Mussolini]]'s speeches into English on the air. By most accounts, she was supportive of Mussolini and fascism until at least 1937, but according to biographer Stacy Spaulding, when Sergio did convert to anti-fascism, her "conversion was authentic and heartfelt."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a note she wrote at the time, she remarked, "Human beings are not born knowing. They are endowed, from birth with the capacity to learn. They learn to walk, to talk. We must also learn how to be free."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==WQXR==

After moving to the US, Sergio worked for NBC. Frustrated because she believed that "NBC was not about to allow a woman to do news," Sergio began to work for local New York City station WQXR in 1939. Sergio became one of the first female news commentators on WQXR, developing her program, "A Column of the Air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Station-Albums/WQXR-Rebel-in-Radio.pdf|title=Rebel in Radio: The Story of WQXR|last=Sanger|first=Elliott, M.|date=March 4, 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sergio's commentary has been dismissed as being of interest mainly to women, "A Column of the Air" was intended to address the crisis in Europe and her address to all listeners was made possible, according to Spaulding, by WQXR's programming decision to address its listeners in terms of culture and education rather than strictly in terms of gender. "A Column of the Air" broadcast seven times a week from 1939 to 1946, when WQXR cancelled all its news commentary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When asked whether her gender made a difference in the quality of her broadcasting, Sergio wrote, "Here, too, women can claim and hold a place. If men and women are equally needed in the war effort, as they indubitably are, if men and women the world over are bearing the tragic burden of a war without quarter, as they are, it follows that men and women can equally contribute to the understanding of issues at stake and of the sometimes baffling trend of the events which affect us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sergio|first1=Lisa|title="Brains Have No Sex"|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/317729-brains-have-no-sex/|website=NYPR Archives|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blacklist==

Sergio, who had been the subject of extensive FBI surveillance since she immigrated to the United States, was blacklisted by the American Legion in 1949 and listed in the anti-communist publication ''[[Red Channels]]'' in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spaulding|first=Stacy|date=2009-12-01|title=Off the Blacklist, but Still a Target|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616700902975053|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=10|issue=6|pages=789–804|doi=10.1080/14616700902975053|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other writing==

Sergio was also the author of several books, including a biography of Anita Garibaldi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sergio|first1=Lisa|title=I am My Beloved: The Life of Anita Garibaldi|date=1969|publisher=Weybright and Talley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a biography of lawyer and clubwoman Lena Madelin Phillips&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sergio|first1=Lisa|title=A Measure Filled: The Life of Lena Madesin Phillips|date=1972|publisher=Luce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Sergio died on June 22, 1989 at her home in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="Flint"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flint|first1=Peter B.|title=Lisa Sergio, Radio Commentator In Italy and New York, Dies at 84|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/26/obituaries/lisa-sergio-radio-commentator-in-italy-and-new-york-dies-at-84.html|accessdate=14 July 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=June 28, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Little Free Library was built in 2009 by the late [[Todd Bol]] in [[Hudson, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=ST-20181018&gt;Ross, Jenna (October 18, 2018).

Like other public book exchanges, a passerby can take a book to read or leave one for someone else to find. The organization relies on volunteer "stewards" to construct, install, and maintain book exchange boxes.

Little Free Libraries of all shapes and sizes exist, from small, brightly painted wooden houses to a larger library based on [[Doctor Who]]'s [[TARDIS]].&lt;ref name= npr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Brodie.

In September 2016, LFL announced a collaboration with the [[The World Peace Prayer Society|World Peace Prayer Society]] on its [[Peace pole|Peace Pole Project]] to offer a new Peace Pole Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://littlefreelibrary.org/may-peace-prevail-on-earth-is-message-of-new-peace-pole-library/|title=‘May Peace Prevail on Earth’ Is Message of New Peace Pole Library|date=2016-09-12|work=Little Free Library|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features the standard Peace Pole message of peace - "May Peace Prevail on Earth” - in a six-foot library. Some of these new libraries were installed at locations significant to the [[civil rights movement]], such as the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|16th Street Baptist Church]] in Birmingham, Alabama.  

==Zoning==
Little Free Libraries are typically welcomed by communities; if zoning problems arise, however, local governments often work with residents to find solutions. In late 2012, the village of [[Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin]], denied permission to potential Little Free Library projects and required that an existing Little Free Library be removed because of a village ordinance that prohibited structures in front yards. Village trustees also worried about inappropriate material being placed in the boxes.&lt;ref name="JS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/village-slaps-endnote-on-little-libraries-2f7j416-178453671.html|title=Village slaps endnote on Little Libraries|last=Stingl|first=Jim|date=10 November 2012|newspaper=[[Wisconsin Journal Sentinel]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308055805/http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/village-slaps-endnote-on-little-libraries-2f7j416-178453671.html|archive-date=2013-03-08|dead-url=yes|work=|location=[[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison, Wisc.]]|via=|accessdate=November 12, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2013, the village approved a new ordinance that specifically allowed Little Free Library boxes to be put up on private property.&lt;ref name="WFBN"&gt;{{cite web|title=News &amp; Notes: Aug. 7|url=http://www.whitefishbaynow.com/news/218695041.html|publisher=''Whitefish Bay Now''|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, city officials in [[Leawood, Kansas]] shut down a Little Free Library under a city ordinance prohibiting detached structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Olivia B.|last=Waxman|title=City Forces 9-Year-Old Boy to Move 'Little Free Library' From Front Yard|url=http://time.com/2905505/city-forces-9-year-old-boy-to-move-little-free-library-from-front-yard|newspaper=[[Time magazine|Time]]|date=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family of the nine-year-old boy who built the structure created a [[Facebook]] page to support the amendment of Leawood's city code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spencer's Little Free Library|url=https://www.facebook.com/Spencerslittlefreelibrary|website=[[Facebook]]|date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another resident of the city who erected a Little Free Library was threatened with a $25 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Laura|last1=McCallister|first2=Brix|last2=Fowler|title=City to fine owners of Little Free Libraries|url=http://www.kfvs12.com/story/25812411/city-to-fine-owners-of-little-free-libraries|publisher=[[KFVS-TV]]|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the city council unanimously approved a temporary moratorium to permit Little Free Libraries on private property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Caroline|last=Baumann|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/government-politics/article687562.html|title='Little Free Libraries' legal in Leawood thanks to 9-year-old Spencer Collins|newspaper=[[Kansas City Star]]|date=7 July 2014|type=updated 8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2015, the Metropolitan Planning Commission in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] shut down a Little Free Library.

[[File:Louvre Pyramid.jpg|thumb|The Louvre Pyramid|372x372px]]

The '''Louvre Pyramid''' (Pyramide du Louvre) is a large [[glass]] and metal [[pyramid]] designed by Chinese-American architect [[I.M. Pei]], surrounded by three smaller pyramids, in the main courtyard (Cour Napoléon) of the Louvre Palace ([[Palais du Louvre]]) in [[Paris]]. The large pyramid serves as the main entrance to the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre Museum]]. Completed in 1989,&lt;ref name="SimonsNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=5 Pieces of Europe's Past Return to Life: France; A vast new exhibition space as the Louvre renovates |work=The New York Times|date=28 March 1993|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDF1F39F93BA15750C0A965958260|accessdate=7 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become a landmark of the city of [[Paris]].

==Design and construction==
[[File:Louvre Palace.jpg|thumb|Inside the Pyramid: the view of the Louvre Museum in Paris from the underground lobby of the pyramid.]]

Commissioned by the President of [[France]], [[François Mitterrand]], in 1984, it was designed by the architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The structure, which was constructed entirely with [[glass]] segments and metal poles, 
reaches a height of {{convert|21.6|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Glassontheweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassonweb.com/articles/article/94 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020112004520/http://www.glassonweb.com/articles/article/94/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 January 2002 |title=Architecture: Louvre Pyramid |work=Glass on the Web |date=June 2005 |accessdate=16 January 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its square base has sides of {{convert|34|m|ft}} and a base surface area of {{convert|1000|m2|ft2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Official Press Release|first1=Louvre|title=“Pyramid” Project Launch: The Musée du Louvre is improving visitor reception (2014-2016)|url=http://www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/dp_pyramide%2028102014_en.pdf|website=Louvre|accessdate=16 May 2016|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of 603 [[rhombus|rhombus-shaped]] and 70 triangular glass segments.&lt;ref name="Glassontheweb"/&gt;
The pyramid structure was engineered by Nicolet Chartrand Knoll Ltd. of [[Montreal]] (Pyramid Structure / Design Consultant) and [[RFR Engineers|Rice Francis Ritchie]] of [[Paris]] (Pyramid Structure / Construction Phase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcfandp.com/a/p/8315/s.html |title= Grand Louvre: Phase I |publisher=Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners |date= |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyramid and the underground lobby beneath it were created because of a series of problems with the Louvre's original main entrance, which could no longer handle the enormous number of visitors on an everyday basis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Visitors entering through the pyramid descend into the spacious lobby then ascend into the main Louvre buildings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

For design historian [[Mark Pimlott]], "I.M. Pei’s plan distributes people effectively from the central concourse to myriad destinations within its vast subterranean network... the architectonic framework evokes, at gigantic scale, an ancient atrium of a [[Pompeii]]an villa; the treatment of the opening above, with its tracery of engineered castings and cables, evokes the atria of corporate office buildings; the busy movement of people from all directions suggests the concourses of rail termini or international airports."&lt;ref name="Pimlott"&gt;{{cite book |last= Pimlott |first= Mark |year= 2007 |url= http://www.artdesigncafe.com/The-Grand-Louvre-I-M-Pei-Pimlott-2007 |chapter= The Grand Louvre &amp; I.M. Pei |type= Excerpt |title= Without and Within: Essays on Territory and the Interior |via= artdesigncafe |publisher= Episode Publishers |location= Rotterdam |access-date= 13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other museums have duplicated this concept, most notably the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]]. The [[Dolphin Centre]], featuring a similar pyramid, was opened in April 1982, by [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Phil |last= Steer |url= http://www.romford.org/sports/swimming/dolphin/dolphin01.htm |title= Dolphin Centre: Brief History |work= Romford Now &amp; Then |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111123140716/http://www.romford.org/sports/swimming/dolphin/dolphin01.htm |archivedate= 23 November 2011 |df= dmy-all }}{{Self-published source|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction work on the pyramid base and underground lobby was carried out by the [[Vinci (construction)|Vinci]] construction company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/en/history-sites.htm?OpenAgent&amp;the_grand_louvre_museum |title= History |publisher= Vinci |date=  |accessdate= 16 January 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111001122424/http://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/en/history-sites.htm?OpenAgent&amp;the_grand_louvre_museum |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1839, according to one newspaper account, in ceremonies commemorating the "glorious revolution" of 1830, "The tombs of the Louvre were covered with black hangings and adorned with tricolored flags. In front and in the middle was erected an expiatory monument of a pyramidical shape, and surmounted by a funeral vase."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/w/captcha/question/|title=The Paris Sketch Book Of Mr. M. A. Titmarsh|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The construction of the pyramid triggered many years of strong and lively aesthetic and political debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tempest|first1=Rone|title=Controversial New Pyramid Entrance to the Louvre Opens in Paris|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-03-30/entertainment/ca-1039_1_glass-pyramid|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticisms tended to fall into four areas:  (1) the modernist style of the edifice being inconsistent with the classic French Renaissance style and history of the Louvre;  (2) the pyramid being an unsuitable symbol of death from ancient Egypt;  (3) the project being an immodest, pretentious, megalomaniacal folly imposed by then-President [[François Mitterrand]]; and (4) Chinese-American architect [[I.M. Pei]] being insufficiently French to be entrusted with the task of updating the treasured Parisian landmark.&lt;ref name="IM PEI Pyramid"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bernstein|first1=Richard|title=I.M. Pei's Pyramid: A Provocative Plan for The Louvre|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/magazine/im-pei-s-pyramid-a-provative-plan-for-the-louvre.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those criticizing the aesthetics said it was "sacrilegious" to tamper with the Louvre's majestic old French Renaissance architecture, and called the pyramid an anachronistic intrusion of an Egyptian death symbol in the middle of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberger|first1=Paul|title=Pei Pyramid and New Louvre Open Today|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/29/arts/pei-pyramid-and-new-louvre-open-today.html?pagewanted=1|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, political critics referred to the structure as ''Pharaoh Francois' Pyramid''.&lt;ref name="IM PEI Pyramid"/&gt;
Many still continue to feel the harsh modernism of the edifice is out of place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stamberg|first1=Susan|title=Landmark At The Louvre: The Pyramid Turns 20|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121097261|website=NPR|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=16 May 2016}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carbone|first1=Ken|title=Viva Le Louvre!

During the design phase, there was a proposal{{by whom|date=May 2015}} that the design include a spire on the pyramid to simplify window washing. Pei objected, however, and this proposal was eliminated.

==Urban legend of 666 panes==
It has been claimed by some that the glass panes in the Louvre Pyramid number exactly 666, "the [[number of the beast]]", often associated with [[Satan]]. Dominique Stezepfandt's book ''François Mitterrand, Grand Architecte de l'Univers'' declares that "the pyramid is dedicated to a power described as the Beast in the [[Book of Revelation]] (...) The entire structure is based on the number 6."

The story of the 666 panes originated in the 1980s, when the official brochure published during construction did indeed cite this number (even twice, though a few pages earlier the total number of panes was given as 672 instead).  The number 666 was also mentioned in various newspapers. The Louvre museum, however, states that the finished pyramid contains 673 glass panes (603 rhombi and 70 triangles).&lt;ref name="Glassontheweb"/&gt;  A higher figure was obtained by David A. Shugarts, who reports that the pyramid contains 689 pieces of glass.&lt;ref name="secrets"&gt;''Secrets of the Code'', edited by Dan Burstein, p. 259.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shugarts obtained the figure from the Pei's offices.

Elementary arithmetic allows for easy counting of the panes: each of the three sides of the pyramid without an entrance has 18 triangular panes and 17 rows of rhombic ones arranged in a [[triangular number|triangle]], thus giving &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{17\cdot(17+1)}{2}=153&lt;/math&gt; rhombic panes (171 panes total).  The side with the entrance has 11 panes fewer (9 rhombic, 2 triangular), so the whole pyramid consists of &lt;math&gt;4\cdot153-9=603&lt;/math&gt; rhombi and &lt;math&gt;4\cdot18-2=70&lt;/math&gt; triangles, 673 panes total.

The myth resurfaced in 2003, when [[Dan Brown]] incorporated it in his best-selling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', in which the protagonist reflects that "this pyramid, at President Mitterrand's explicit demand, had been constructed of exactly 666 panes of glass&amp;nbsp;— a bizarre request that had always been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who claimed 666 was the number of [[Satan]]."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brown. ''The Da Vinci Code'', p. 21.{{full citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, David A. Shugarts reports that according to a spokeswoman of the offices of Pei, the French President never specified the number of panes to be used in the pyramid. Noting how the 666 rumor circulated in some French newspapers in the mid-1980s, she commented: "If you only found those old articles and didn't do any deeper fact checking, and were extremely credulous, you might believe the 666 story."&lt;ref name="secrets"/&gt;

''La Pyramide Inversée'' (''The Inverted Pyramid'') is a skylight in the [[Carrousel du Louvre]] shopping mall in front of the Louvre Museum. It looks like an upside-down and smaller version of the ''Louvre Pyramid''.

==Renovation==
Designed for a museum that attracted 4.5 million visitors a year, the pyramid proved inadequate by the time the Louvre's attendance had doubled in 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, the layout of the foyer area in the Cour Napoleon beneath the glass pyramid is undergoing a thorough redesign, including better access to the pyramid and the Passage Richelieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Javier |last=Pes |date=28 April 2014 |url=http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Louvres-director-makes-unblocking-pyramid-bottleneck-a-priority/32552 |title=Louvre's Director Makes Unblocking Pyramid Bottleneck a Priority |work=[[The Art Newspaper]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429215635/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Louvres-director-makes-unblocking-pyramid-bottleneck-a-priority/32552 |archivedate=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public [[masquerade ball|masquerades]] play an extremely significant role in the life of the [[Mende people]] - one of the two largest [[ethnic groups in Sierra Leone]]. 

Art historian [[Ruth Phillips]] writes that '''Mende masquerades''' "are a means of mediating between the general community and the medicine societies that are central to Mende social life. Through masking performances, the public is kept informed of important events which occur in the private domain and is enabled to witness and to share in rituals that transform the status of relatives and friends. The masquerades make visible the powerful medicines (''haleisa'', sing. ''hale'') of these [[Sodality (social anthropology)|sodalities]] without compromising their essential mystery. Maskers personify and dramatize the powers of the medicines and elicit ritualized gestures of respect and tribute from the spectators. At the same time participants and audience drawn into a common sphere of performance, aesthetically heightened by theater, music and dance."&lt;ref name="Philips 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Ruth B.|title=Representing woman : Sande masquerades of the Mende of Sierra Leone|year=1995|publisher=UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|isbn=0930741447}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Mende people|Mende]] define the visual features and performance of each masker in relation to a standard set of [[masquerade ceremony|masquerades]]. The occasions for each masquerade are fixed according to an annual calendar of ritual and secular events and, within a single celebration, there is a carefully orchestrated sequence of masquerades.

==''Hale''==
''Hale'', meaning "medicine," is believed to be a material substance found in nature that has powerful inherent properties that the officials of Mende secret societies know how to manipulate. These "medicine societies" are the men's [[Poro]] society, and women's [[Sande society]], and ''hale'' can also refer to these.&lt;ref name="Boone 1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boone|first=Sylvia Ardyn|title=Radiance from the waters : ideals of feminine beauty in Mende art|year=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300035764|author2=Busselle, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maskers of a medicine society embodies the spirit (''ngafa'') as well as the power associated with its ''hale''; the Mende refer to maskers by both of these terms.&lt;ref name="Philips 1995" /&gt; The standard set of Mende maskers includes about a dozen personalities embodying spirits of varying degrees of power and importance. The ''goboi'' and ''gbini'' of the Poro society, the ''sowei'' of the Sande society, and the ''njaye'' and ''humoi'' maskers belonging to the eponymous medicine societies.

==Types of maskers and masquerade==
The maskers of the Sande and Poro societies are responsible for enforcing laws and are important symbolic presences in the rituals of initiation and in public ceremonies that mark the coronations and funerals of chiefs and society officials. Another group of maskers, including the male ''gongoli'' and the female ''gonde'' and ''samawa'', are clownlike figures that feature in performances characterized by humor, satire and parody. These maskers are not true ''haleisia'', 

==''Gbini''==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 2004.77.1 Gbini Mask.jpg|thumbnail|Gbini Mask, Mende (Wood, leopard skin, sheepskin, antelope skin, raffia fiber, cotton cloth, cotton string, cowry shells), from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
''Gbini'' is considered to be the most powerful of all Mende maskers. ''Gbini'' appears at the final "pulling" ceremony of Poro initiation for a son of the paramount chief and also at the coronation of funeral of a paramount chief. Because of its power, women must stand far back from ''gbini'' and if a woman accidentally touches it, she must be anointed with medicine immediately. 

''Gbini'' wears a large leopard skin which indicates its association with the paramount chief. The flat, round headpiece resembles the chief's crown. The headpiece is constructed of animal hide stretched over a bamboo framework. The hide is decorated with cowrie shells and black, white and red strips of cloth that are worked into a geometric pattern. At the center is a round mirror. Several flaps that are similarly decorated hang down from the base of the headpiece and overlap the [[raffia]] cape which covers much of the wearer's torso.&lt;ref name="Philips 1995" /&gt; 

==''Sowei''==

The [[Sande society]] is one of the most influential patrons of the visual arts in West Africa.&lt;ref name="Boone 1986" /&gt; The Sande ''sowei'' masquerades promote and represent the images of women in specific ritual and festive contexts. 

The ceremonies of the Sande society are the only occasions in Africa in which women customarily wear masks. Wooden masks worn during these public ceremonies, such as funerals or the installations of chiefs, are called ''sowo'' (sing. ''sowei'') and represent the society's guardian spirit. The irreducible elements of sowei are a helmet form, lustrous blackness, beautifully arranged hair, downcast eyes, a closed mouth and an expression of inner spiritual concentration.&lt;ref name="Philips 1995" /&gt;  The features of the mask illustrate the group's ideal of feminine beauty. The elegant hairstyles also symbolize the importance of social cooperation, since a woman needs the help of her friends to dress her hair. &lt;ref name="BM Collections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Helmet Mask (ndoli jowei) for Sande Society|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4809/Helmet_Mask_ndoli_jowei_for_Sande_Society|work=Collections: Arts of Africa|publisher=Brooklyn Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mende honor outstanding carvers of sowei masks, which are typically men, with the name ''Sowo Gande''. According to Philips, the Sowo Gande demonstrates virtuosity through "the triumphant conjuring of new forms which are recognizable variations of old forms."&lt;ref name="Philips 1995" /&gt; 

According to [[Mende people|the Mende]], ''hojo''- white clay or kaolin- stands for the concept of the Sande society.&lt;ref name="Boone 1986" /&gt; Symbolically, it reflects a lot of the characteristics the Sande treasure, such as purity and elusiveness. The Sande society daubs objects and people with hojo to indicate that they are under Sande's control and protection and are subject to the full authority of Sande law and punishment. At Sande ceremonies, the pure white of ''hojo'' and of the clothes worn by Sande officials is thrown into dramatic contrast with the blackness of sowei masks.

The most important participant in the sowei masquerade is the ''ndoli jowei'', "the expert in dancing," the woman who dances in the mask in public and teaches dancing to the girls in the encampment.&lt;ref name="Boone 1986" /&gt;

An important part of initiation into the Sande society is the taking of a new name, which the girl herself usually chooses.&lt;ref name="Philips 1995" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9221">In [[colorimetry]], '''metamerism''' is a perceived matching of the colors with different (nonmatching) [[spectral power distribution]]s.  Colors that match this way are called '''metamers'''.

A spectral power distribution describes the proportion of total light given off (emitted, transmitted, or reflected) by a color sample at each visible wavelength; it defines the complete information about the light coming from the sample. However, the human eye contains only three color receptors (three types of [[cone cell]]s), which means that all colors are reduced to three sensory quantities, called the [[tristimulus value]]s. Metamerism occurs because each type of cone responds to the cumulative energy from a broad range of wavelengths, so that different combinations of light across all wavelengths can produce an equivalent receptor response and the same tristimulus values or color sensation. In color science, the set of sensory spectral sensitivity curves is numerically represented by color matching functions.

== Sources of metamerism ==
Metameric matches are quite common, especially in near neutral (grayed or whitish colors) or dark colors. As colors become brighter or more saturated, the range of possible metameric matches (different combinations of light wavelengths) becomes smaller, especially in colors from surface reflectance spectra.

Metameric matches made between two light sources provide the trichromatic basis of [[colorimetry]]. For any given light stimulus, regardless of the form of its spectral emittance curve, there always exists a unique mixture of three "primary" lights that when added together, or added to the stimulus, will be an exact metameric match.

The basis for nearly all commercially available color image reproduction processes such as photography, television, printing, and digital imaging, is the ability to make metameric color matches.

Making metameric matches using reflective materials is more complex. The appearance of surface colors is defined by the product of the spectral reflectance curve of the material and the spectral emittance curve of the light source shining on it. As a result, the color of surfaces depends on the light source used to illuminate them.

== Metameric failure ==
The term '''''illuminant metameric failure''''' or '''''illuminant metamerism''''' is sometimes used to describe situations where two material samples match when viewed under one light source but not another. Most types of fluorescent lights produce an irregular or peaky spectral emittance curve, so that two materials under fluorescent light might not match, even though they are a metameric match to an incandescent "white" light source with a nearly flat or smooth emittance curve. Material colors that match under one source will often appear different under the other.

Normally, material attributes such as translucency, gloss or surface texture are not considered in color matching. However '''geometric metameric failure''' or '''geometric metamerism''' can occur when two samples match when viewed from one angle, but then fail to match when viewed from a different angle. A common example is the color variation that appears in [[pearlescent coatings|pearlescent]] automobile finishes or "metallic" paper; e.g., [[Kodak]] Endura Metallic, [[Fujicolor]] Crystal Archive Digital Pearl.

'''Observer metameric failure''' or '''observer metamerism''' can occur because of differences in [[color vision]] between observers. The common source of observer metameric failure is [[colorblindness]], but it is also not uncommon among "normal" observers. In all cases, the proportion of long-wavelength-sensitive [[cone cell|cones]] to medium-wavelength-sensitive cones in the retina, the profile of light sensitivity in each type of cone, and the amount of yellowing in the lens and macular pigment of the eye, differs from one person to the next. This alters the relative importance of different wavelengths in a spectral power distribution to each observer's color perception. As a result, two spectrally dissimilar lights or surfaces may produce a color match for one observer but fail to match when viewed by a second observer.

Finally, '''field-size metameric failure''' or '''field-size metamerism''' occurs because the relative proportions of the three cone types in the retina vary from the center of the visual field to the periphery, so that colors that match when viewed as very small, centrally fixated areas may appear different when presented as large color areas. In many industrial applications, large-field color matches are used to define color tolerances.

The difference in the spectral compositions of two metameric stimuli is often referred to as the '''degree of metamerism'''. The sensitivity of a metameric match to any changes in the spectral elements that form the colors depend on the degree of metamerism. Two stimuli with a high degree of metamerism are likely to be very sensitive to any changes in the illuminant, material composition, observer, field of view, and so on.

The word ''metamerism'' is often used to indicate a metameric failure rather than a match, or used to describe a situation in which a metameric match is easily degraded by a slight change in conditions, such as a change in the illuminant.

== Measuring metamerism ==
The best-known measure of metamerism is the [[color rendering index]] (CRI), which is a linear function of the mean [[Euclidean distance]] between the test and reference [[spectral reflectance]] vectors in the [[CIE 1964 color space]]. A newer measure, for daylight simulators, is the '''MI''', [[CIE Metamerism Index]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/15-2004.html CIE Publication 15]&lt;/ref&gt; which is derived by calculating the mean [[color difference]] of eight metamers (five in the [[visible spectrum]] and three in the [[ultraviolet]] range) in [[CIELAB]] or [[CIELUV]]. The salient difference between CRI and MI is the color space used to calculate the color difference, the one used in CRI being obsolete  and not [[perceptually uniform]].

MI can be decomposed into MI&lt;sub&gt;vis&lt;/sub&gt; and MI&lt;sub&gt;UV&lt;/sub&gt; if only part of the spectrum is being considered. The numerical result can be interpreted by rounding into one of five letter categories:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knt.vein.hu/staff/schandaj/SJCV-Publ-2005/397.doc CIE Standards for assessing quality of light sources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112155836/http://www.knt.vein.hu/staff/schandaj/SJCV-Publ-2005/397.doc |date=2011-01-12 }}, J Schanda, [[Veszprém]] University, Department for Image Processing and Neurocomputing, Hungary&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metamerism and industry ==
Using materials that are metameric color matches rather than spectral color matches is a significant problem in industries where color matching or color tolerances are important. A classic example is in automobiles: the interior fabrics, plastics and paints may be manufactured to provide a good color match under a standard light source (such as the sun), but the matches can disappear under different light sources (fluorescent or halide lights). Similar problems can occur in apparel manufactured from different types of dye or using different types of fabric, or in quality color printing using different types of inks. Papers manufactured with [[optical brightener]]s are especially susceptible to color changes when lights differ in their short wavelength radiation, which can cause some papers to fluoresce.

Color matches made in the paint industry are often aimed at achieving a '''spectral color match''' rather than just a tristimulus (metameric) color match under a given spectrum of light. A spectral color match attempts to give two colors the same spectral reflectance characteristic, making them a good metameric match with a low degree of metamerism, and thereby reducing the sensitivity of the resulting color match to changes in illuminant, or differences between observers.

'''''Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach''''' ({{lang-da|Sankt Hansblus på Skagen strand}}) is a 1906 painting by [[P.S. Krøyer]]. The large work, which took several years to complete, shows many of the artists in the group known as the [[Skagen Painters]] as well as influential members of [[Skagen]]'s local community.

==Background==
{{main|Skagen Painters}}
The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of [[Jutland]], painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings and celebrations. Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909), who was born in [[Stavanger]], Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer, finally settling there after marrying [[Marie Krøyer|Marie Triepcke]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S. Krøyer (1851–1909)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in [[Hornbæk]] on the north coast of [[Zealand]] and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement in his travels to France. In Skagen, he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the group of painters, creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light in his beach scenes while painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1850-1910/Peder_Severin_Kr%C3%B8yer?highlight=p.s.%20kr%C3%B8yer|title=P.S. Krøyer|work=Den Store Danske |accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting description==
The painting depicts many of the members of the artists' colony as well as local inhabitants gathered around the traditional midsummer bonfire, celebrated in Denmark on [[Sankt Hans aften#Denmark|Sankt Hans aften]]. The artists and the influential personalities from the village are on the left while the rest of the inhabitants are on the right. Krøyer originally made a sketch of the event in 1892 but it took him 14 years to complete the large painting which measures {{convert|149.5|cm|in}} x {{convert|257|cm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-art-works/ps-kroeyer/midsummers-eve-bonfire/|title=P.S. Krøyer: Midsummer's Eve bonfire on Skagen's beach - 1906|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=2 August 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her ''Northern Lights'', Lise Svanholm tells us Krøyer took his easel onto the beach at Skagen Østerby in 1903 and spent a couple of hours making an extensive sketch. In the foreground, Krøyer's daughter Vibeke stands in front of Marie Krøyer's brother, Valdemar Triepcke, next to Walter Schwartz, the mayor's son. Otto and Alba Schwartz come next, then [[Michael Ancher]] in his straw hat beside [[Degn Brøndum]], the innkeeper. In the next row is Brøndum's daughter, [[Anna Ancher]] in a green shawl, Henry Brodersen, then the treasurer's wife and, at the end of the row, Schrøder, the postmaster with his little wife Soffi. In addition to the painters, the work includes the writer [[Holger Drachmann]], the head of the lifeboat service, Captain P.K. Nielsen, and the town's treasurer, Brodersen, with his sister in law, Mrs Dethlef Jürgensen, on his arm. On the right-hand side, the artist [[Laurits Tuxen]] can be seen with Frederikke who is looking up wonderously at her husband. Tuxen is sketching the scene, resulting in a work which can be seen in Skagens Museum (''Krøyer Painting the Midsummer Bonfire'', 1906). The red and orange flames are blowing over towards [[Hugo Alfvén]], with Marie on his arm, leaning on a fishing boat.&lt;ref name=Svanholm2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Svanholm|first=Lise|title=Northern Light: The Skagen Painters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFBVtB1CTvkC&amp;pg=PA274|year=2004|publisher=Gyldendal A/S|isbn=978-87-02-02817-1|pages=201–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/samlingen/vaerkerne/ps-kroeyer/sankthansblus/|title=P.S. Krøyer: Sankt Hansblus på Skagen strand – 1906|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=23 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==

The painting is one of the most important in the collection at [[Skagens Museum]], although Krøyer himself felt the work was too dark, especially the sky which should have been brighter. He recognized it was not one of his best works but believed it would have considerable historic importance.&lt;ref name="Ancher2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ancher|first=Anna|title=Breve fra Anna Ancher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Le4LdqB3hgAC&amp;pg=PA132|year=2005|publisher=Gyldendal A/S|isbn=978-87-02-03112-6|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; On signing the painting, however, his daughter Vibeke remembers a celebration which reached such heights that Drachmann threw his glass down on the floor. Apparently Krøyer replied: "I find, Drachmann, you should think twice before flinging other people's glasses on the floor. It was not your fault it didn't break."&lt;ref name=Svanholm2004/&gt;

Nevertheless, the painting is now generally accepted as one of the most important works by the Skagen Painters. Writing in ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'', Morten Rasmussen reports that the work is considered by many to be Krøyer's "Magnum Opus", representing a reflection of his own life and a tribute to the people who contributed to his success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/kultur/den-st%C3%A6rke-maler-med-det-skr%C3%B8belige-sind|title=Den stærke maler med det skrøbelige sind|work=Kristeligt Dagblad|date=21 November 2009|accessdate=24 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6602">[[File:Edgar from Winchester Charter.jpg|thumb|Fontispiece of the New Minster Charter, Cotton MS Vespasian A VIII]]
The '''New Minster Charter''' is an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[illuminated manuscript]] that was likely composed by Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester|Æthelwold]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and presented to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster in Winchester]] by [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]] in the year 966 CE to commemorate the [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] Reform.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Medieval Art|last=Nees|first=Lawrence|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fod.infobase.com/PortalPlaylists.aspx?wID=102733&amp;xtid=55152|title=Ruling by the Book: Illuminations—The Private Life of Kings|last=Ramirez|first=Janina|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Purpose and Content ===
In approximately 963 CE, Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester required the monks of New Minster, under threat of eviction, to adopt Benedictine rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1903|editor-last=Doubleday|editor-first=H. Arthur|editor2-last=Page|editor2-first=William|title=Houses of Benedictine Monks: New Minster, or the Abbey of Hyde|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/hants/vol2/pp116-122|journal=A History of the County of Hampshire2|volume=2|pages=116-122|via=British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was made with the approval of King Edgar, who reigned in England from 959 until his death in 975.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The charter was officially created as a codex to compile and present the royal grants which established the new laws of the New Minster, later to become Hyde Abbey.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thepostgradchronicles.org/2018/05/19/the-image-of-the-king-10-portraits-from-medieval-england/|title=The Image of the King – 10 Portraits from Medieval England|last=Firth|first=Matt|date=2018|website=The Postgrad Chronicles|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of 34 surviving documents from the pre-Conquest archive of the New Minster, and stands out as an authentic document among numerous forgeries of its time.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxon Charters|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=Sean|volume=IX: New Minster, Winchester|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text is comprised of 22 short chapters which outline the creation and fall of both angels and man, and also articulates Edgar’s desire to do the will of God.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It additionally explains why Edgar made the change from secular clerics to Benedictine monks, and references the relationship between the king and the abbey as a cycle of protection from spiritual and physical threats.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Cotton_MS_vespasian_a_viii|title=Digitised Manuscripts|website=www.bl.uk|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an unknown number of missing leaves from the manuscript, the contents of which can merely be speculated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

=== Style ===
Unusual in several ways, this Anglo-Saxon volume stands out against other illuminated manuscripts of its time. Although the use of gold lettering was uncommon in England&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Illuminating as Practised in Europe from the Earliest Times|last=Tymms|first=W.R.|last2=Wyatt|first2=M. Digby, Sir|publisher=Day and Son|year=1860|isbn=|location=London|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, every page of the New Minster Charter is written in gold, making it one of a kind&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. The [[Insular art|insular]] style of lettering is present in the charter, which is written mainly in round Style I [[Carolingian minuscule|Anglo-Caroline script]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; with large capital letters marking the beginning of different sections of text. Aside from these stylized letters, the majority of the written pages have no other type of illumination. The only true exceptions are found near the beginning of the charter. One page presents the name of King Edgar&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, with blue wash and gold border. The king's name, presented as 'Eadgar rex', is written in square capitals, with the remainder of the page written in uncials.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The facing page contains a large [[Chi Rho|chi-rho]] (also referred to as a chrismon)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; decorated in green and gold, and also framed in gold. The text of the page is written entirely in square capitals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Preceeding these pages is an elaborate [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]], the only fully illuminated page of the charter. Also noteworthy are the crosses adorning the witness list, some filled with gold and others merely outlined in brown or red. The significance of the different style of crosses is speculated to correlate somehow to the importance of each witness, but is not entirely known. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another stylistic feature that was unusual for its time is the presence of ten rhyming sentences of prose in chapter II.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

=== Frontispiece ===
The frontispiece of the New Minster Charter depicts King Edgar, situated between the virgin Mary and Saint Peter&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, presenting the very charter the image adorns to Christ for blessing. Although Edgar appears to be kneeling, the use of gold on his feet and the edge of his cloak may have been applied with the intention of having the king standing and facing forward.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The use of a rare purple tone associates the piece with imperial Byzantium, and the image reflects, in part, the royal [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] manuscript style&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; of pieces such as the Prayer Book of [[Charles the Bald]]. However, it more specifically displays the trademarks of the Winchester style of the tenth century with its wide use of gold as well as the presence of a border of wild [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of the Medieval World: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, the Sacred Arts|last=Zarnecki|first=George|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1975|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Minster Charter is the first datable manuscript in the Winchester style&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although the [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold]] is a more well-known example from the 10th century.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:Flacon Manifesto.jpg|thumb|A bottle of perfume by Yves Saint Laurent]]

'''Perfume''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|ɜːr|f|j|uː|m}}, {{IPAc-en|US|p|ər|ˈ|f|j|uː|m}}; {{lang-fr|parfum}}) is a mixture of fragrant [[essential oil]]s or [[aroma compound]]s, [[Fixative (perfumery)|fixative]]s and [[solvent]]s, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable [[scent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perfume|title= Perfume – Definition and More from Dictionary|work= merriam-webster.com}}wtf
&lt;/ref&gt;
It is usually in liquid form and used to give a pleasant scent to a person's body.
Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as [[vanillin]] or [[coumarin]], which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics alone.

==History==
{{main|History of perfume}}

[[File:Egypte louvre 021.jpg|thumbnail|left|Egyptian scene depicting the preparation of lily perfume, 4th century BC]]

The word ''perfume'' derives from the Latin ''perfumare'', meaning "to smoke through". Perfumery, as the art of making perfumes, began in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and was further refined by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] and the Arabs.

The world's first-recorded [[chemist]] is considered a woman named [[Tapputi]], a perfume maker mentioned in a [[cuneiform]] tablet from the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Strathern, Paul |title= Mendeleyev's Dream – The Quest For the Elements|location= New York | publisher= Berkley Books|year= 2000|isbn= 0-425-18467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She distilled flowers, oil, and [[Acorus calamus|calamus]] with other [[aromatic]]s, then filtered and put them back in the still several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Levey|first=Martin|title= Early Arabic Pharmacology: An Introduction Based on Ancient and Medieval Sources|publisher= Brill Archive|year=1973|page= 9|isbn= 90-04-03796-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, perfume and perfumery existed in the [[Indus civilization]] (3300 BC – 1300 BC). One of the earliest distillations of [[Ittar]] was mentioned in the Hindu Ayurvedic text ''[[Charaka Samhita]]'' and ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Agriculture Diversification: Problems and Perspectives|author1= A.K. Sharma|author2= Seema Wahad|author3= Raśmī Śrīvāstava|page=140|publisher= I. K. International Pvt Ltd|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century the [[Alchemy and chemistry in Islam|Arab chemist]] [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) wrote the ''Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations'', which contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant [[oils]], salves, aromatic waters, and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs.

[[File:Arheologicheski-Perfume.jpg|thumb|A Byzantine [[alembic]] used to distil perfumes.]]

The Persian chemist Ibn Sina (also known as [[Avicenna]]) introduced the process of extracting oils from flowers by means of [[distillation]], the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the [[rose]]. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes consisted of mixtures of oil and crushed herbs or petals, which made a strong blend. [[Rose water]] was more delicate, and immediately became popular. Both the raw ingredients and the distillation technology significantly influenced western perfumery and scientific developments, particularly [[chemistry]].

The art of perfumery was known in western Europe from 1221, taking into account the [[monk]]s' recipes of Santa Maria delle Vigne or [[Santa Maria Novella]] of [[Florence]], Italy.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} In the east, the [[Hungarians]] produced in 1370 a perfume made of scented oils blended in an alcohol solution – best known as [[Hungary Water]] – at the behest of [[Elisabeth of Poland|Queen Elizabeth of Hungary]]. The art of perfumery prospered in [[Renaissance]] Italy, and in the 16th century the personal perfumer to [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519–1589), Rene the [[Florence|Florentine]] (Renato il fiorentino), took Italian refinements to France. His laboratory was connected with her apartments by a secret passageway, so that no formulae could be stolen en route. Thanks to Rene, France quickly became one of the European centers of perfume and [[cosmetics]] manufacture. Cultivation of flowers for their perfume essence, which had begun in the 14th century, grew into a major industry in the south of France.

Between the 16th and 17th centuries, perfumes were used primarily by the wealthy to mask [[body odor]]s resulting from infrequent bathing. Partly due to this patronage, the perfume industry developed. In 1693, Italian barber Giovanni Paolo Feminis created a perfume water called Aqua Admirabilis,&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite book

By the 18th century the [[Grasse]] region of France, [[Sicily]], and [[Calabria]] (in Italy) were growing aromatic plants to provide the growing perfume industry with raw materials. Even today, Italy and France remain the center of European perfume design and [[trade]].

Perfume types reflect the concentration of aromatic compounds in a solvent, which in fine fragrance is typically [[ethanol]] or a mix of water and ethanol. Various sources differ considerably in the definitions of perfume types. The intensity and longevity of a perfume is based on the concentration, intensity and longevity of the aromatic compounds, or perfume oils, used. As the percentage of aromatic compounds increases, so does the intensity and longevity of the scent. Specific terms are used to describe a fragrance's approximate concentration by the percent of perfume oil in the volume of the final product. The most widespread terms&lt;ref name="NYT71218"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tynan Sinks |title=The Difference Between Perfume, Cologne and Other Fragrances |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/smarter-living/differences-perfume-cologne-fragrance.html?fb=0&amp;recb=home-living.control&amp;recid=17KSsjadYlQApm7TCIQPhRUe8tk&amp;contentCollection=smarter-living&amp;mData=articles%255B%255D%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2018%252F07%252F12%252Fsmarter-living%252Fdifferences-perfume-cologne-fragrance.html%253Ffb%253D0%2526recb%253Dhome-living.control%2526recid%253D17KSsjadYlQApm7TCIQPhRUe8tk%26articles%255B%255D%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nytimes.com%252F2018%252F07%252F11%252Fsmarter-living%252Fhow-to-start-knitting.html%253Ffb%253D0%2526recb%253Dhome-living.control%2526recid%253D17KSsjadYlQApm7TCIQPhRUe8tk&amp;hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=smarterLiving-promo-region&amp;region=smarterLiving-promo-region&amp;WT.nav=smarterLiving-promo-region |accessdate=July 13, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=July 12, 2018 |quote=You’ll see all sorts of names in the fragrance section: perfume, eau de toilette, parfum, eau de cologne. What makes them different — and in many cases, more expensive?}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* '''parfum''' or '''extrait''', in English known as perfume extract, pure perfume, or simply perfume: 15–40% aromatic compounds ([[International Fragrance Association|IFRA]]: typically ~20%);
* '''esprit de parfum''' (ESdP): 15–30% aromatic compounds, a seldom used strength concentration in between EdP and perfume;
* '''eau de parfum''' (EdP) or '''parfum de toilette''' (PdT) (The strength usually sold as "perfume"&lt;ref name="NYT71218"/&gt;): 10–20% aromatic compounds (typically ~15%); sometimes called "eau de perfume" or "millésime"; parfum de toilette is a less common term, most popular in the 1980s, that is generally analogous to eau de parfum;
* '''[[eau de toilette]]''' (EdT): 5–15% aromatic compounds (typically ~10%);
* '''[[eau de Cologne]]''' (EdC): often simply called cologne: 3–8% aromatic compounds (typically ~5%); see below for more information on the confusing nature of the term "cologne";
* '''eau fraiche''': products sold as "splashes", "mists", "veils" and other imprecise terms. Generally these products contain 3% or less aromatic compounds and are diluted with water rather than oil or alcohol.&lt;ref name="NYT71218"/&gt;

There is much confusion over the term "cologne", which has three meanings. The first and oldest definition refers to a family of fresh, citrus-based fragrances distilled using extracts from citrus, floral, and woody ingredients. Supposedly these were first developed in the early 18th century in [[Cologne, Germany]], hence the name. This type of "classical cologne" describes unisex compositions "which are basically citrus blends and do not have a perfume parent."&lt;ref name="Glossary C"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary (C) |url=http://www.fragrance.org/glossary.php?l=C |publisher=The Fragrance Foundation |accessdate=7 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731203552/http://www.fragrance.org/glossary.php?l=C |archivedate=31 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include Mäurer &amp; Wirtz's ''[[4711]]'' (created in 1799), and Guerlain's ''Eau de Cologne Impériale'' (1853).

In the 20th century, the term took on a second meaning. Fragrance companies began to offer lighter, less concentrated interpretations of their existing perfumes, making their products available to a wider range of customers. Guerlain, for example, offered an Eau de Cologne version of its flagship perfume ''[[Shalimar (perfume)|Shalimar]]''. In contrast to classical colognes, this type of modern cologne is a lighter, diluted, less concentrated interpretation of a more concentrated product, typically a pure parfum. The cologne version is often the lightest concentration from a line of fragrance products.&lt;ref name="Glossary C"/&gt;

Finally, the term "cologne" has entered the English language as a generic, overarching term to denote a fragrance worn by a man, regardless of its concentration. The actual product worn by a man may technically be an eau de toilette, but he may still say that he "wears cologne". A similar problem surrounds the term "perfume", which can be used a generic sense to refer to fragrances marketed to women, whether or not the fragrance is actually an extrait.

Classical colognes first appeared in Europe in the 17th century. The first fragrance labeled a "parfum" extract with a high concentration of aromatic compounds was Guerlain's ''[[Jicky]]'' in 1889. Eau de Toilette appeared alongside parfum around the turn of the century. The EdP concentration and terminology is the most recent. Parfum de toilette and EdP began to appear in the 1970s and gained popularity in the 1980s.

===Imprecise terminology===
[[File:J.B. Filz Vienna 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|J.B. Filz in Vienna. Perfumeries with long traditions, such as J.B. Filz, created their own scents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wien.info/en/lifestyle-scene/trendy/scents-from-vienna|title=Scents from Vienna|work=wien.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The wide range in the percentages of aromatic compounds that may be present in each concentration means that the terminology of extrait, EdP, EdT, and EdC is quite imprecise. Although an EdP will often be more concentrated than an EdT and in turn an EdC, this is not always the case. Different perfumeries or perfume houses assign different amounts of oils to each of their perfumes. Therefore, although the oil concentration of a perfume in EdP dilution will necessarily be higher than the same perfume in EdT from within a company's same range, the actual amounts vary among perfume houses. An EdT from one house may have a higher concentration of aromatic compounds than an EdP from another.

Furthermore, some fragrances with the same ''product name'' but having a different ''concentration'' may not only differ in their dilutions, but actually use different perfume oil mixtures altogether. For instance, in order to make the EdT version of a fragrance brighter and fresher than its EdP, the EdT oil may be "tweaked" to contain slightly more top notes or fewer base notes. ''[[Chanel No. 5]]'' is a good example: its parfum, EdP, EdT, and now-discontinued EdC concentrations are in fact different compositions (the parfum dates to 1921, whereas the EdP was not developed until the 1980s). In some cases, words such as ''extrême'', ''intense'', or ''concentrée'' that might indicate a higher aromatic concentration are actually completely different fragrances, related only because of a similar perfume ''accord''. An example of this is Chanel's ''Pour Monsieur'' and ''Pour Monsieur Concentrée''.

As a rule of thumb, women's fragrances tend to have higher levels of aromatic compounds than men's fragrances. Fragrances marketed to men are typically sold as EdT or EdC, rarely as EdP or perfume extracts. Women's fragrances used to be common in all levels of concentration, but today are mainly seen in parfum, EdP and EdT concentrations.

===Solvent types===
Perfume oils are often diluted with a solvent, though this is not always the case, and its necessity is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume is oil dilution is an alcohol solution, typically a mixture of ethanol and water or a [[rectified spirit]]. Perfume oil can also be diluted by means of neutral-smelling oils such as fractionated [[coconut oil]], or liquid [[wax]]es such as [[jojoba oil]].

===Applying fragrances===
The conventional application of pure perfume (parfum extrait) in Western cultures is at pulse points, such as behind the ears, the nape of the neck, and the insides of wrists, elbows and knees, so that the pulse point will warm the perfume and release fragrance continuously. According to perfumer [[Sophia Grojsman]] behind the knees is the ideal point to apply perfume in order that the scent may rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forward.com/news/144873/perfume-nose-conjures-up-perfect-scents/ | title=Perfume 'Nose' Conjures Up Perfect Scents | publisher=forward.com | accessdate=8 August 2015 | author=Berger, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern perfume industry encourages the practice of layering fragrance so that it is released in different intensities depending upon the time of the day. Lightly scented products such as bath oil, shower gel, and body lotion are recommended for the morning; eau de toilette is suggested for the afternoon; and perfume applied to the pulse points for evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Agata A.

==Describing a perfume==

[[File:Fragrance pyramid.svg|thumb|upright|Fragrance pyramid]]

The precise formulae of commercial perfumes are kept [[Trade secret|secret]]. Even if they were widely published, they would be dominated by such complex ingredients and odorants that they would be of little use in providing a guide to the general consumer in description of the ''experience'' of a scent. Nonetheless, connoisseurs of perfume can become extremely skillful at identifying components and origins of scents in the same manner as wine experts.&lt;ref name=Burr&gt;{{cite book | author=Burr, Chandler | title=The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses | year=2003 | location=New York | publisher=Random House | isbn=0-375-50797-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most practical way to start describing a perfume is according to the elements of the ''fragrance notes'' of the scent or the "family" it belongs to, all of which affect the overall impression of a perfume from first application to the last lingering hint of scent.&lt;ref name=Fortineau&gt;Perfume connoisseurs speak of a fragrance's "sillage", or the discernible trail it leaves in the air when applied. Fortineau, Anne-Dominique (2004). "Chemistry Perfumes Your Daily Life". ''Journal of Chemical Education''.81(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Edwards1&gt;Edwards, Michael (2006). "Fragrances of the World 2006". ''Crescent House Publishing''. {{ISBN|0-9756097-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trail of scent left behind by a person wearing perfume is called its ''sillage'', after the French word for "[[wake]]", as in the trail left by a boat in water.

===Fragrance notes===
{{main| Note (perfumery)}}

Perfume is described in a musical metaphor as having three sets of ''notes'', making the harmonious scent ''accord''. The notes unfold over time, with the immediate impression of the top note leading to the deeper middle notes, and the base notes gradually appearing as the final stage. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process of the perfume.
*'''Top notes''': Also called the '''''head notes'''''. The scents that are perceived immediately on application of a perfume. Top notes consist of small, light molecules that evaporate quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of a perfume. Examples of top notes include mint, lavender and coriander.
*'''Middle notes''': Also referred to as '''''heart notes'''''. The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to the dissipation of the top note. The middle note compounds form the "''heart''" or main body of a perfume and act to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Examples of middle notes include seawater, sandalwood and jasmine.
*'''Base notes''': The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and "deep" and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after application. Examples of base notes include tobacco, amber and musk.
The scents in the top and middle notes are influenced by the base notes; conversely, the scents of the base notes will be altered by the types of fragrance materials used as middle notes. Manufacturers who publish perfume notes typically do so with the fragrance components presented as a ''fragrance pyramid''&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.lebermuth.com/fragrance-101-understanding-the-fragrance-pyramid Fragrance 101 Understanding The Fragrance Pyramid]&lt;/ref&gt;, using imaginative and abstract terms for the components listed.

===Olfactive families===
Grouping perfumes can never be a completely objective or final process. Many fragrances contain aspects of different families. Even a perfume designated as "single flower", however subtle, will have undertones of other aromatics. "True" unitary scents can rarely be found in perfumes as it requires the perfume to exist only as a singular aromatic material.

Classification by olfactive family is a starting point for a description of a perfume, but it cannot by itself denote the specific characteristic of that perfume.

====Traditional====

[[File:Opium by YSL.jpg|thumb|upright|Opium by YSL, of amber or oriental fragrance class]]
[[File:Joy Jean Patou.jpg|thumb|upright|A floral bouquet, Joy from [[Jean Patou]]]]
The traditional classification which emerged around 1900 comprised the following categories:
*'''Single Floral''': Fragrances that are dominated by a scent from one particular flower; in French called a ''soliflore''. (e.g. [[Serge Lutens]]' ''Sa Majeste La Rose'', which is dominated by rose.)
*'''Floral Bouquet''': Is a combination of fragrance of several flowers in a perfume compound. Examples include ''Quelques Fleurs'' by [[Houbigant (perfume)|Houbigant]] and ''[[Joy (perfume)|Joy]]'' by [[Jean Patou]].
*'''Amber or "Oriental"''': A large fragrance class featuring the sweet slightly animalic scents of [[ambergris]] or [[labdanum]], often combined with [[vanilla]], [[tonka bean]], flowers and woods. Can be enhanced by camphorous oils and [[incense]] resins, which bring to mind [[Victorian era]] imagery of the Middle East and [[Far East]]. Traditional examples include [[Guerlain]]'s ''[[Shalimar (perfume)|Shalimar]]'', [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]]'s ''[[Opium (perfume)|Opium]]'' and Chanel's ''Coco Mademoiselle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanel.com/en_US/fragrance-beauty/Fragrance-Coco-Mademoiselle-COCO-MADEMOISELLE-PARFUM-88207|title=Coco Mademoiselle from Chanel|publisher=www.chanel.com |accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Woody''': Fragrances that are dominated by woody scents, typically of [[agarwood]], [[sandalwood]], [[cedar wood|cedarwood]], and [[vetiver]]. Patchouli, with its [[camphor]]aceous smell, is commonly found in these perfumes. A traditional example here would be Myrurgia's ''Maderas De Oriente'' or [[Chanel]] ''Bois des Îles''. A modern example would be [[Balenciaga]] ''Rumba''.
*'''Leather''': A family of fragrances which features the scents of [[honey]], [[tobacco]], wood and wood [[tar]]s in its middle or base notes and a scent that alludes to leather. Traditional examples include [[Robert Piguet]]'s ''Bandit'' and [[Pierre Balmain|Balmain]]'s ''Jolie Madame''.
*'''[[Chypre]]''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃipʁ|IPA}}): Meaning ''[[Cyprus]]'' in French, this includes fragrances built on a similar accord consisting of [[bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[oakmoss]], and [[labdanum]]. This family of fragrances is named after the eponymous 1917 perfume by [[François Coty]], and one of the most famous extant examples is [[Guerlain]]'s ''[[Mitsouko (perfume)|Mitsouko]]''.
*'''[[Fougère]]''' ({{IPA-fr|fu.ʒɛʁ|IPA}}): Meaning ''[[fern]]'' in French, built on a base of [[lavender]], [[coumarin]] and [[oakmoss]]. [[Houbigant (perfume)|Houbigant]]'s ''Fougère Royale'' pioneered the use of this base. Many men's fragrances belong to this family of fragrances, which is characterized by its sharp herbaceous and woody scent. Some well-known modern fougères are [[Fabergé]] ''Brut'' and [[Guy Laroche]] ''Drakkar Noir''.

==== Modern ====
[[File:Perfume.ogv|thumb|Perfume being sprayed in the air.]]
Since 1945, due to great advances in the technology of perfume creation (i.e., compound design and synthesis) as well as the natural development of styles and tastes, new categories have emerged to describe modern scents:
*'''Bright Floral''': combining the traditional Single Floral &amp; Floral Bouquet categories. A good example would be [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]]'s ''Beautiful''.
*'''Green''': a lighter and more modern interpretation of the Chypre type, with pronounced cut grass, crushed green leaf and cucumber-like scents. Examples include Estée Lauder's ''Aliage'', Sisley's ''Eau de Campagne'', and Calvin Klein's ''Eternity''.
*'''Aquatic''', '''Oceanic''', or '''Ozonic''': the newest category in perfume history, first appearing in 1988 [[Davidoff]] ''[[Cool Water (perfume)|Cool Water]]'' (1988), Christian Dior's ''Dune'' (1991), and many others. A clean smell reminiscent of the ocean, leading to many of the modern [[androgynous]] perfumes. Generally contains [[calone]], a synthetic scent discovered in 1966, or other more recent synthetics. Also used to accent floral, oriental, and woody fragrances.
*'''Citrus''': An old fragrance family that until recently consisted mainly of "freshening" eau de colognes, due to the low tenacity of citrus scents. Development of newer fragrance compounds has allowed for the creation of primarily citrus fragrances. A good example here would be Faberge ''Brut''.
*'''Fruity''': featuring the aromas of fruits other than citrus, such as peach, cassis (black currant), mango, passion fruit, and others. A modern example here would be Ginestet ''Botrytis''.
*'''Gourmand''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡuʁmɑ̃|lang}}): scents with "edible" or "dessert"-like qualities. These often contain notes like vanilla, [[tonka bean]] and [[coumarin]], as well as synthetic components designed to resemble food flavors. A sweet example is [[Thierry Mugler]]'s ''Angel''.

====Fragrance wheel====
{{main|Fragrance wheel}}
[[File:Wheel2.gif|thumb|Fragrance Wheel perfume [[classification chart]], ver. 1983]]
The Fragrance wheel is a relatively new classification method that is widely used in retail and in the fragrance industry. The method was created in 1983 by [[Michael Edwards (fragrance expert)|Michael Edwards]], a consultant in the perfume industry, who designed his own scheme of fragrance classification. The new scheme was created in order to simplify fragrance classification and naming scheme, as well as to show the relationships between each of the individual classes.&lt;ref name="OGrantInterview"&gt;{{cite web |author= Osborne, Grant |date= 1 May 2001 |title= Interview with Michael Edwards |url= http://www.basenotes.net/interviews/int-medwards.html |accessdate= 17 December 2006 |publisher= Basenotes |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070206133603/http://www.basenotes.net/interviews/int-medwards.html |archivedate= 6 February 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five standard families consist of ''Floral'', ''Oriental'', ''Woody'', ''Aromatic Fougère'', and ''Fresh'', with the first four families borrowing from the classic terminology and the last consisting of newer bright and clean smelling citrus and oceanic fragrances that have arrived in the past generation due to improvements in fragrance technology. Each of the families are in turn divided into subgroups and arranged around a wheel.
In this classification scheme, ''Chanel No.5'', which is traditionally classified as an aldehydic floral, would be located under the Soft Floral sub-group, and amber scents would be placed within the Oriental group. As a class, [[chypre]] perfumes are more difficult to place since they would be located under parts of the Oriental and Woody families. For instance, Guerlain's ''Mitsouko'' is placed under Mossy Woods, but Hermès ''Rouge'', a chypre with more floral character, would be placed under Floral Oriental.

==Aromatics sources==

===Plant sources===
[[File:Citrus x limon Blüten und Schädlinge.JPG|thumb|upright|Citrus tree blossom]]
[[File:Myrrh.JPG|thumb|Resins in perfumery include [[myrrh]]]]
[[File:Frankincense 2005-12-31.jpg|thumb|Frankincense]]

Plants have long been used in perfumery as a source of essential oils and aroma compounds. These aromatics are usually [[secondary metabolites]] produced by plants as protection against [[herbivore]]s, infections, as well as to attract [[pollinator]]s. Plants are by far the largest source of fragrant compounds used in perfumery. The sources of these compounds may be derived from various parts of a plant. A plant can offer more than one source of aromatics, for instance the aerial portions and seeds of [[coriander]] have remarkably different odors from each other. [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]] leaves, blossoms, and fruit zest are the respective sources of [[petitgrain]], [[neroli]], and [[orange oil]]s.
* '''[[Bark (botany)|Bark]]''': Commonly used barks include [[cinnamon]] and [[cascarilla]]. The fragrant oil in [[sassafras]] root bark is also used either directly or purified for its main constituent, [[safrole]], which is used in the synthesis of other fragrant compounds.
* '''[[Flower]]s''' and '''[[blossom]]s''': Undoubtedly the largest and most common source of perfume aromatics. Includes the flowers of several species of [[rose]] and [[jasmine]], as well as [[osmanthus]], [[plumeria]], [[Acacia farnesiana|mimosa]], [[tuberose]], [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[Pelargonium graveolens|scented geranium]], [[Vachellia farnesiana|cassie]], [[ambrette]] as well as the blossoms of [[citrus]] and [[ylang-ylang]] trees. Although not traditionally thought of as a flower, the unopened flower buds of the [[clove]] are also commonly used. Most orchid flowers are not commercially used to produce essential oils or absolutes, except in the case of [[vanilla]], an orchid, which must be pollinated first and made into seed pods before use in perfumery.
* '''[[Fruit]]s''': Fresh fruits such as [[apple]]s, [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[cherry|cherries]] rarely yield the expected odors when extracted; if such fragrance notes are found in a perfume, they are more likely to be of synthetic origin. Notable exceptions include blackcurrant leaf, [[litsea|litsea cubeba]], vanilla, and [[juniper|juniper berry]]. The most commonly used fruits yield their aromatics from the rind; they include citrus such as [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[lemon]]s, and [[lime (fruit)|limes]]. Although [[grapefruit]] rind is still used for aromatics, more and more commercially used grapefruit aromatics are artificially synthesized since the natural aromatic contains [[sulfur]] and its degradation product is quite unpleasant in smell.
* '''[[Leaves]]''' and '''[[twigs]]''': Commonly used for perfumery are [[lavender]] leaf, [[patchouli]], [[Common sage|sage]], [[violet (plant)|violets]], [[rosemary]], and citrus leaves. Sometimes leaves are valued for the "green" smell they bring to perfumes, examples of this include [[hay]] and [[tomato]] leaf.
* '''[[Resin]]s''': Valued since antiquity, resins have been widely used in [[incense]] and perfumery. Highly fragrant and antiseptic resins and resin-containing perfumes have been used by many cultures as medicines for a large variety of ailments. Commonly used resins in perfumery include [[labdanum]], [[frankincense]]/[[olibanum]], [[myrrh]], [[balsam of Peru]], [[benzoin (resin)|benzoin]]. [[Pine]] and [[fir]] resins are a particularly valued source of [[terpene]]s used in the [[organic synthesis]] of many other synthetic or naturally occurring aromatic compounds. Some of what is called [[amber]] and [[copal]] in perfumery today is the resinous secretion of fossil [[conifer]]s.
*'''[[Root]]s, [[rhizome]]s and [[bulb]]s''': Commonly used terrestrial portions in perfumery include [[iris (plant)|iris]] [[rhizome]]s, [[vetiver]] roots, various rhizomes of the [[ginger]] family.
* '''[[Seed]]s''': Commonly used seeds include [[tonka bean]], [[Daucus carota|carrot seed]], [[coriander]], [[caraway]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[nutmeg]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], [[cardamom]], and [[anise]].
* '''[[Wood]]s''': Highly important in providing the base notes to a perfume, wood oils and distillates are indispensable in perfumery. Commonly used woods include [[sandalwood]], [[rosewood]], [[agarwood]], [[birch]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[juniper]], and [[pine]]. These are used in the form of macerations or dry-distilled (rectified) forms.
*'''Rom [[terpenes]]'''. Orchid scents

===Animal sources===
[[File:Primary Form of Musk.jpg|thumb|A [[musk]] pod. Extensive hunting of male [[musk deer]] for their pods in recent history has resulted in the detriment of the species.]]
[[File:Ambergris.jpg|thumb|[[Ambergris]]]]
*'''[[Ambergris]]''': Lumps of [[oxidize]]d fatty compounds, whose precursors were secreted and expelled by the [[sperm whale]]. Ambergris should not be confused with [[amber|yellow amber]], which is used in jewelry. Because the harvesting of ambergris involves no harm to its animal source, it remains one of the few animalic fragrancing agents around which little controversy now exists.
*'''[[Castoreum]]''': Obtained from the odorous sacs of the North American beaver.
*'''[[Civet (perfumery)|Civet]]''': Also called civet musk, this is obtained from the odorous sacs of the civets, animals in the family ''Viverridae'', related to the [[mongoose]]. [[World Animal Protection]] investigated African civets caught for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profumo.it/internet-documents/zibetto/suffering.htm|title=Civet suffering|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Honeycomb]]''': From the honeycomb of the [[honeybee]]. Both beeswax and honey can be solvent extracted to produce an absolute. Beeswax is extracted with ethanol and the ethanol evaporated to produce beeswax absolute.
*'''[[Musk]]''': Originally derived from a gland (sac or pod) located between the genitals and the umbilicus of the Himalayan male [[musk deer]] Moschus moschiferus, it has now mainly been replaced by the use of [[synthetic musk]]s sometimes known as "white musk".

===Other natural sources===
* '''[[Lichen]]s''': Commonly used lichens include [[oakmoss]] and [[treemoss]] thalli.
* '''[[Brown algae|"Seaweed"]]''': Distillates are sometimes used as [[essential oil]] in perfumes. An example of a commonly used seaweed is ''[[Fucus vesiculosus]]'', which is commonly referred to as bladder wrack. Natural seaweed fragrances are rarely used due to their higher cost and lower potency than synthetics.

===Synthetic sources===
{{main| Aroma compound}}
Many modern perfumes contain [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] odorants. Synthetics can provide fragrances which are not found in nature. For instance, [[Calone]], a compound of synthetic origin, imparts a fresh ozonous metallic marine scent that is widely used in contemporary perfumes. Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate source of compounds that are not easily obtained from natural sources. For example, [[linalool]] and [[coumarin]] are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from [[terpenes]]. Orchid scents (typically ''[[salicylic acid|salicylates]]'') are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match the fragrant compounds found in various orchids.

One of the most commonly used classes of synthetic aromatics by far are the [[synthetic musk|white musk]]s. These materials are found in all forms of commercial perfumes as a neutral background to the middle notes. These musks are added in large quantities to laundry detergents in order to give washed clothes a lasting "clean" scent.

The majority of the world's synthetic aromatics are created by relatively few [[:Category:Fragrance companies|companies]]. They include:
* [[International Flavors and Fragrances]] (IFF)
* [[Givaudan]]
* [[Firmenich]]
* [[Takasago International Corporation|Takasago]]
* [[Symrise]]
Each of these companies patents several processes for the production of aromatic synthetics annually.

===Characteristics===
Natural and synthetics are used for their different odor characteristics in perfumery
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!|
! style="background:#ff5656;"|Naturals
! style="background:#5656ff;"|Synthetics
|-
!|Variance
|Natural scents will vary from each supplier based on when and where they are harvested, how they are processed, and the extraction method itself. This means that a certain flower grown in Morocco and in France will smell different, even if the same method is used to grow, harvest, and extract the scent. As such, each perfumer will prefer flowers grown in one country over another, or one extraction method to the next. However, due to a natural scent's mixed composition, it is easy for unscrupulous suppliers to adulterate the actual raw materials by changing its ''source'' (adding Indian jasmine into Grasse jasmine) or the ''contents'' (adding linalool to rosewood) to increase their [[profit margin]].
|Much more consistent than natural aromatics. However, differences in organic synthesis may result in minute differences in concentration of impurities. If these impurities have low smell (detection) thresholds, the differences in the scent of the synthetic aromatic will be significant.
|-
!|Components
|Contains many different organic compounds, each adding a different note to the overall scent. Certain naturally derived substances have a long history of use, but this cannot always be used as an indicator of whether they are safe or not. Possible allergenic or carcinogenic compounds.
|Depending on purity, consists primarily of one chemical compound. Sometimes [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] mixtures of isomers, such as in the case of [[Iso E Super]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iso E Super® |publisher=International Flavors &amp; Fragrances |year=2007 |url=http://www.iff.com/Ingredients.nsf/0/E69A1213546C4F8B80256993003995C6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223080634/http://www.iff.com/Ingredients.nsf/0/E69A1213546C4F8B80256993003995C6 |archivedate=23 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the almost pure composition of one chemical compound, the same molecules found diluted in nature will have a different scent and effect on the body, if used undiluted.
|-
!|Scent uniqueness
|Reminiscent of its originating material, although extraction may capture a different "layer" of the scent, depending on the how the extraction method denatures the odoriferous compounds.
|Similar to natural scents yet different at the same time. Some synthetics attempt to mimic natural notes, while others explore the entire spectrum of scent. Novel scent compounds not found in nature will often be unique in their scent.
|-
!|Scent complexity
|Deep and complex fragrance notes. Soft, with subtle scent nuances. Highly valued for ideal composition.
|Pure and pronounced fragrance notes. Often monotonous in nature, yet reminiscent of other natural scents.
|-
!|Price
|Dependent on extraction method. More expensive, but not always, as prices are determined by the labor and difficulty of properly extracting each unit of the natural materials, as well as its quality. Typically the relationship between, longevity of a perfume, cost and the concentration of essential oils follows the graph below:
[[File:Cologne Strength vs. Cost vs. Cologne Concentration.jpg|thumb|This chart shows the typical relationship between price of perfume, its longevity and the concentration of essential oils.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost Curve|url=http://www.topcolognesformen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|Dependent on synthesis method. Generally cheaper, but not necessarily. Synthetic aromatics are not necessarily cheaper than naturals, with some synthetics being more costly than most natural ingredients due to various factors such as the long synthesis routes, low availability of precursor chemicals, and low overall yield. However, due to their low odor threshold, they should be diluted when making a perfume.

==Obtaining natural odorants==
{{main|Fragrance extraction}}
[[File:Itar vendor in Hyderabad.JPG|thumb|Itar (herbal perfume) vendor on the street of [[Hyderabad]], India, who can compose an original perfume for the customer]]
Before perfumes can be composed, the odorants used in various perfume compositions must first be obtained. Synthetic odorants are produced through [[organic synthesis]] and purified. Odorants from natural sources require the use of various methods to extract the aromatics from the raw materials. The results of the extraction are either [[essential oil]]s, absolutes, concretes, or butters, depending on the amount of [[wax]]es in the extracted product.&lt;ref name=Camps&gt;Camps, Arcadi Boix (2000). "Perfumery Techniques in Evolution". ''Allured Pub Corp''. {{ISBN|0-931710-72-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these techniques will, to a certain extent, distort the odor of the aromatic compounds obtained from the raw materials. This is due to the use of heat, harsh solvents, or through exposure to oxygen in the extraction process which will denature the aromatic compounds, which either change their odor character or renders them odorless.
* '''[[Solvent extraction|Maceration/Solvent extraction]]''': The most used and economically important technique for extracting aromatics in the modern perfume industry. Raw materials are submerged in a solvent that can dissolve the desired aromatic compounds. ''Maceration'' lasts anywhere from hours to months. Fragrant compounds for woody and fibrous plant materials are often obtained in this manner as are all aromatics from animal sources. The technique can also be used to extract odorants that are too volatile for ''distillation'' or easily [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] by heat. Commonly used solvents for ''maceration/solvent extraction'' include [[ethane]], [[hexane]], and [[dimethyl ether]]. The product of this process is called a "[[Concrete (perfumery)|concrete]]."
** ''[[Supercritical fluid extraction]]'': A relatively new technique for extracting fragrant compounds from a raw material, which often employs [[Supercritical carbon dioxide|Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Due to the low heat of process and the relatively nonreactive solvent used in the extraction, the fragrant compounds derived often closely resemble the original odor of the raw material.
**''[[Ethanol extraction]]'': A type of solvent extraction used to extract fragrant compounds directly from dry raw materials, as well as the impure oily compounds materials resulting from solvent extraction or enfleurage. Ethanol extraction from fresh plant materials contain large quantities of water, which will also be extracted into the ethanol.
* '''[[Distillation]]''': A common technique for obtaining aromatic compounds from [[plant]]s, such as [[orange blossom]]s and [[rose]]s. The raw material is heated and the fragrant compounds are re-collected through [[condensation]] of the distilled vapor.
[[File:Fragonard small perfume distillery.JPG|thumb|upright|An old perfume still on display at [[Musée du Parfum|Fragonard]]]]
** ''Steam distillation'': Steam from boiling water is passed through the raw material, which drives out their volatile fragrant compounds. The condensate from distillation are settled in a [[Florentine flask]]. This allows for the easy separation of the fragrant oils from the water. The water collected from the condensate, which retains some of the fragrant compounds and oils from the raw material is called [[hydrosol]] and sometimes sold. This is most commonly used for fresh plant materials such as [[flower]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and [[Plant stem|stems]].
** ''Dry/destructive distillation'': The raw materials are directly heated in a still without a carrier solvent such as water. Fragrant compounds that are released from the raw material by the high heat often undergo anhydrous [[pyrolysis]], which results in the formation of different fragrant compounds, and thus different fragrant notes. This method is used to obtain fragrant compounds from fossil [[amber]] and fragrant [[wood]]s where an intentional "burned" or "toasted" odor is desired.
** ''Fractionation'': Through the use of a [[fractionation column]], different fractions distilled from a material can be selectively excluded to modify the scent of the final product. Although the product is more expensive, this is sometimes performed to remove unpleasant or undesirable scents of a material and affords the perfumer more control over their composition process.
* '''Expression''': Raw material is squeezed or compressed and the [[essential oil]]s are collected. Of all raw materials, only the fragrant oils from the peels of fruits in the citrus family are extracted in this manner since the oil is present in large enough quantities as to make this extraction method economically feasible.
* '''[[Enfleurage]]''': Absorption of aroma materials into solid fat or wax and then extraction of odorous oils with [[ethanol|ethyl alcohol]]. Extraction by [[enfleurage]] was commonly used when [[distillation]] was not possible because some fragrant compounds [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] through high heat. This technique is not commonly used in the modern industry due to prohibitive costs and the existence of more efficient and effective extraction methods.&lt;ref name=Fortineau/&gt;

==Fragrant extracts==
[[File:38034290 aromater3.jpg|thumb|upright|Indian Patchouli - Tincture]]
Although fragrant extracts are known to the general public as the generic term "[[essential oil]]s", a more specific language is used in the fragrance industry to describe the source, purity, and technique used to obtain a particular fragrant extract.
Of these extracts, only ''absolutes'', ''essential oils'', and ''tinctures'' are directly used to formulate perfumes.
*'''Absolute''': Fragrant materials that are purified from a ''pommade'' or ''concrete'' by soaking them in [[ethanol]]. By using a slightly [[hydrophilic]] compound such as ethanol, most of the fragrant compounds from the waxy source materials can be extracted without dissolving any of the fragrantless waxy molecules. Absolutes are usually found in the form of an oily liquid.
*'''Concrete''': Fragrant materials that have been extracted from raw materials through ''solvent extraction'' using volatile [[hydrocarbon]]s. Concretes usually contain a large amount of wax due to the ease in which the solvents dissolve various [[hydrophobic]] compounds. As such concretes are usually further purified through distillation or ethanol based solvent extraction. Concretes are typically either waxy or resinous solids or thick oily liquids.
*'''[[Essential oil]]''': Fragrant materials that have been extracted from a source material directly through ''distillation'' or ''expression'' and obtained in the form of an oily liquid. Oils extracted through expression are sometimes called ''expression oils''.
*'''Pomade''': A fragrant mass of solid fat created from the ''[[enfleurage]]'' process, in which odorous compounds in raw materials are adsorbed into animal fats. Pommades are found in the form of an oily and sticky solid.
*'''[[Tincture]]''': Fragrant materials produced by directly soaking and infusing raw materials in [[ethanol]]. Tinctures are typically thin liquids.&lt;ref name=Fortineau/&gt;

Products from different extraction methods are known under different names even though their starting materials are the same. For instance, orange blossoms from ''[[Citrus aurantium]]'' that have undergone solvent extraction produces "orange blossom absolute" but that which have been steam distilled is known as "neroli oil".

==Composing perfumes==
[[File:Lesbos - Perfume formula by Will Inrig.jpg|thumb|Perfume formula]]

Perfume compositions are an important part of many industries ranging from the luxury goods sectors, food services industries, to manufacturers of various household chemicals. The purpose of using perfume or fragrance compositions in these industries is to affect customers through their [[olfaction|sense of smell]] and entice them into purchasing the perfume or perfumed product. As such there is significant interest in producing a perfume formulation that people will find aesthetically pleasing.

===The perfumer===
{{main|Perfumer}}
[[File:Ernst, Rodolphe - The Perfume Maker.jpg|thumb|left|''The Perfume Maker'', by [[Rodolphe Ernst]]]]
The job of composing perfumes that will be sold is left up to an expert on perfume composition or known in the fragrance industry as the ''perfumer''. They are also sometimes referred to affectionately as a "''Nez''" (French for ''nose'') due to their fine sense of smell and skill in smell composition.

The composition of a perfume typically begins with a ''brief'' by the perfumer's employer or an outside customer. The customers to the perfumer or their employers, are typically fashion houses or large [[corporation]]s of various industries.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, G., Endrissat, N., &amp; Noppeney, C. (2016). Beyond “the Eye” of the Beholder: Scent innovation through analogical reconfiguration. Organization Studies, 0170840615622064. http://doi.org/10.1177/0170840615622064.&lt;/ref&gt; The perfumer will then go through the process of blending multiple perfume mixtures and sell the formulation to the customer, often with modifications of the composition of the perfume. 
The perfume composition will then be either used to enhance another product as a ''functional fragrance'' ([[shampoo]]s, [[make-up]], [[detergent]]s, car interiors, etc.), or marketed and sold directly to the public as a ''fine fragrance''.&lt;ref name=Burr /&gt;

===Technique===
[[File:Blotter strips.jpg|right|thumb|Paper blotters (fr:''mouillettes'') are commonly used by perfumers to sample and smell perfumes and odorants.]]
Although there is no single "correct" technique for the formulation of a perfume, there are general guidelines as to how a perfume can be constructed from a concept. Although many ingredients do not contribute to the smell of a perfume, many perfumes include colorants and anti-oxidants to improve the marketability and shelf life of the perfume, respectively.

====Basic framework====
Perfume oils usually contain tens to hundreds of ingredients and these are typically organized in a perfume for the specific role they will play. These ingredients can be roughly grouped into four groups:
*''Primary scents'' (Heart): Can consist of one or a few main ingredients for a certain concept, such as "rose". Alternatively, multiple ingredients can be used together to create an "abstract" primary scent that does not bear a resemblance to a natural ingredient. For instance, jasmine and rose scents are commonly blends for abstract floral fragrances. [[Cola]] flavourant is a good example of an abstract primary scent.
*''Modifiers'': These ingredients alter the primary scent to give the perfume a certain desired character: for instance, fruit [[ester]]s may be included in a floral primary to create a fruity floral; [[calone]] and citrus scents can be added to create a "fresher" floral. The cherry scent in cherry cola can be considered a modifier.
*''Blenders'': A large group of ingredients that smooth out the transitions of a perfume between different "layers" or bases. These themselves can be used as a major component of the primary scent. Common blending ingredients include [[linalool]] and hydroxycitronellal.
*''Fixatives'': Used to support the primary scent by bolstering it. Many resins, wood scents, and amber bases are used as fixatives.

The top, middle, and base notes of a fragrance may have separate primary scents and supporting ingredients. The perfume's [[fragrance oil]]s are then blended with [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]] and water, aged in tanks for several weeks and filtered through processing equipment to, respectively, allow the perfume ingredients in the mixture to stabilize and to remove any sediment and particles before the solution can be filled into the perfume bottles.&lt;ref name=cbyear&gt;{{Cite book| first=Chandler| last=Burr| title=The Perfect Scent: A Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris &amp; New York| publisher=Henry Holt and Co.| year=2008| isbn=978-0-8050-8037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fragrance bases====
[[File:Perfume Organ, Grasse.jpg|upright|thumb|A "perfume organ", where perfumers play around with hundreds of essences, in [[Grasse]]]]
Instead of building a perfume from "ground up", many modern perfumes and colognes are made using ''fragrance bases'' or simply '''bases'''. Each base is essentially modular perfume that is blended from essential oils and aromatic chemicals, and formulated with a simple concept such as "fresh cut grass" or "juicy sour apple". Many of [[Guerlain]]'s ''Aqua Allegoria'' line, with their simple fragrance concepts, are good examples of what perfume fragrance bases are like.

The effort used in developing bases by fragrance companies or individual perfumers may equal that of a marketed perfume, since they are useful in that they are reusable. On top of its reusability, the benefit in using bases for construction are quite numerous:
#Ingredients with "difficult" or "overpowering" scents that are tailored into a blended base may be more easily incorporated into a work of perfume
#A base may be better scent approximations of a certain thing than the extract of the thing itself. For example, a base made to embody the scent for "fresh dewy rose" might be a better approximation for the scent concept of a rose after rain than plain [[rose oil]]. Flowers whose scents cannot be extracted, such as [[gardenia]] or [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]], are composed as bases from data derived from [[headspace technology]].
#A perfumer can quickly rough out a concept from a brief by combining multiple bases, then present it for feedback. Smoothing out the "edges" of the perfume can be done after a positive response.

===Reverse engineering===
Creating perfumes through reverse engineering with analytical techniques such as [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] (GC/MS) can reveal the "general" formula for any particular perfume. The difficulty of GC/MS analysis arises due to the complexity of a perfume's ingredients. This is particularly due to the presence of natural essential oils and other ingredients consisting of complex chemical mixtures. However, "anyone armed with good GC/MS equipment and experienced in using this equipment can today, within days, find out a great deal about the formulation of any perfume... customers and competitors can analyze most perfumes more or less precisely."&lt;ref&gt;Calkin, Robert R. &amp; Jellinek, J. Stephen (1994). "Perfumery: practice and principles". ''John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.''. {{ISBN|0-471-58934-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antique or badly preserved perfumes undergoing this analysis can also be difficult due to the numerous degradation by-products and impurities that may have resulted from breakdown of the odorous compounds. Ingredients and compounds can usually be ruled out or identified using [[gas chromatograph]] (GC) smellers, which allow individual chemical components to be identified both through their physical properties and their scent. Reverse engineering of best-selling perfumes in the market is a very common practice in the fragrance industry due to the relative simplicity of operating GC equipment, the pressure to produce marketable fragrances, and the highly lucrative nature of the perfume market.&lt;ref name=cbyear/&gt;

===Copyright===
[[File:Fakeperfumes.jpg|right|thumb|[[Counterfeit]] perfumes]]
It is doubtful whether perfumes qualify as appropriate copyright subject matter under the US [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]]. The issue has not yet been addressed by any US court. A perfume's scent is not eligible for [[trademark]] protection because the scent serves as the functional purpose of the product.&lt;ref name="cp"&gt;{{citation | author=David A. Einhorn | author2=Lesley Portnoy | title=The Copyrightability of Perfumes: I Smell a Symphony | journal=Intellectual Property Today |date=April 2010 | url=http://www.iptoday.com/issues/2010/04/the-copyrightability-perfumes-i-smell-symphony.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[Dutch Supreme Court]] granted copyright protection to [[Lancôme]]'s perfume ''Tresor'' (''Lancôme v. Kecofa''). The [[French Supreme Court]] has twice taken the position that perfumes lack the creativity to constitute copyrightable expressions (''Bsiri-Barbir v. Haarman &amp; Reimer'', 2006; ''Beaute Prestige International v. Senteur Mazal'', 2008).&lt;ref name="cp" /&gt;

==Health and environmental issues==

Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.

===Health===

====Immunological; asthma and allergy====
Evidence in peer-reviewed journals shows that some fragrances can cause asthmatic reactions in some individuals, especially those with severe or atopic asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kumar P, Caradonna-Graham VM, Gupta S, Cai X, Rao PN, Thompson J |title=Inhalation challenge effects of perfume scent strips in patients with asthma |journal=Ann.

In some cases, an excessive use of perfumes may cause [[allergy|allergic]] reactions of the skin. For instance, [[acetophenone]], [[ethyl acetate]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and [[acetone]]&lt;ref name=cbyear/&gt; while present in many perfumes, are also known or potential respiratory [[allergen]]s. Nevertheless, this may be misleading, since the harm presented by many of these chemicals (either natural or synthetic) is dependent on environmental conditions and their concentrations in a perfume. For instance, linalool, which is listed as an irritant, causes skin irritation when it degrades to peroxides, however the use of antioxidants in perfumes or reduction in concentrations can prevent this. As well, the [[furanocoumarin]] present in natural extracts of grapefruit or [[celery]] can cause severe allergic reactions and increase sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Furanocoumarins as potent chemical defenses |first=May |last=Berenbaum |url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/berenbaum/newpage1.htm|date=June 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research on natural aromatics have shown that many contain compounds that cause skin irritation.&lt;ref name="udgiv"&gt;Environmental and Health Assessment of Substances in Household Detergents and Cosmetic Detergent Products [http://www2.mst.dk/common/Udgivramme/Frame.asp?pg=http://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/Publications/2001/87-7944-596-9/html/kap12_eng.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232246/http://www2.mst.dk/common/Udgivramme/Frame.asp?pg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.mst.dk%2Fudgiv%2FPublications%2F2001%2F87-7944-596-9%2Fhtml%2Fkap12_eng.htm|date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However some studies, such as IFRA's research claim that [[opoponax]] is too dangerous to be used in perfumery, still lack scientific consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_sccp/docs/sccp_o_025b.pdf|title=EC.europa.eu|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also true that sometimes inhalation alone can cause skin irritation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Epikutanni-test.jpg|thumb|[[Patch test]]]]
A number of national and international surveys have identified [[balsam of Peru]], often used in perfumes, as being in the "top five" allergens most commonly causing [[patch test]] reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrreTHuo54wC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;dq=balsam+of+peru+allergy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m18XU46XMI7QkQfTvYGIDw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=balsam%20of%20peru%20allergy&amp;f=false |title=Biocompatibility of Dental Materials |author1=Gottfried Schmalz |author2=Dorthe Arenholt Bindslev |publisher= Springer|date= 2008|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDWlWR5UbqQC&amp;pg=PT530&amp;dq=%22balsam+of+peru%22+allergy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UGoXU_CfL5TLkAelvYCQCg&amp;ved=0CIIBEOgBMAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22balsam%20of%20peru%22%20allergy&amp;f=false |title=Clinical Dermatology |author=Thomas P.

Kellerman |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |date= 2013 |accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study in 2001 found that 3.8% of the general population patch tested was allergic to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZqlfcIWh9oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22balsam+of+peru%22+allergy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UGoXU_CfL5TLkAelvYCQCg&amp;ved=0CIkCEOgBMCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22balsam%20of%20peru%22%20allergy&amp;f=false |title=Allergy in Practice |page=35|author1=T.

Balsam of Peru is used as a marker for [[perfume allergy]]. Its presence in a cosmetic is denoted by the [[INCI]] term ''Myroxylon pereirae''.&lt;ref name="rook"&gt;{{citation | author=M. H. Beck | author2=S. M. Wilkinson | chapter=Contact Dermatitis: Allergic | title=Rook's Textbook of Dermatology | volume=2 | edition=8th | year=2010 | publisher=Wiley | page=26.40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balsam of Peru has been banned by the [[International Fragrance Association]] since 1982 from use as a fragrance compound, but may be present as an extract or distillate in other products, where mandatory labelling is not required for usage of 0.4% or less.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt;

====Carcinogenicity====
There is scientific evidence that nitro-musks such as [[musk xylene]] could cause cancer in some specific animal tests. These reports were evaluated by the EU Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS, formerly the SCCNFP &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/index_en.htm|title=Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) - Public Health - European Commission|website=Public Health|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and musk xylene was found to be safe for continued use in cosmetic products.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out280_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is in fact part of the procedures of the Cosmetic Regulation in Europe that materials classified as carcinogens require such a safety evaluation by the authorities to be allowed in cosmetic consumer products.

Although other ingredients such as polycyclic [[synthetic musk]]s, have been reported to be positive in some in-vitro hormone assays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Schreurs RH, Legler J, Artola-Garicano E, etal |title=In vitro and in vivo antiestrogenic effects of polycyclic musks in zebrafish |journal=Environ. Sci. Technol. |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=997–1002 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14998010 |doi= 10.1021/es034648y|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schreurs RH, Sonneveld E, Jansen JH, Seinen W, van der Burg B |title=Interaction of polycyclic musks and UV filters with the estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), and progesterone receptor (PR) in reporter gene bioassays |journal=Toxicol. Sci. |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=264–72 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15537743 |doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfi035 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; these reports have been reviewed by various authorities. For example, for one of the main polycyclic musks [[Galaxolide|Galaxolide (HHCB)]] these reviews includes those of the EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety,&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out179_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the EU's Priority Substances Review,&lt;ref&gt;http://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/947def3b-bbbf-473b-bc19-3bda7a8da910&lt;/ref&gt; the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk,&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scher/docs/scher_o_086.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently also the US EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppt/existingchemicals/pubs/workplans.html|title=TSCA Work Plan Chemicals - Existing Chemicals - OPPT - US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of all of these reviews over the past decade or so is that there is no safety concerns for human health. Reviews with similar positive outcome exists for another main polycyclic musk (AHTN) as well for instance on its safe use in cosmetics by the EU.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/sccp/documents/out176_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many natural aromatics, such as oakmoss absolutes,&lt;ref name=udgiv/&gt;&lt;ref name="OakAranol"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Rastogi SC, Bossi R, Johansen JD, etal |title=Content of oak moss allergens atranol and chloroatranol in perfumes and similar products |journal=Contact Derm. |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=367–70 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15274728 |doi=10.1111/j.0105-1873.2004.00379.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[basil]] oil, [[rose oil]] and many others contain allergens or carcinogenic compounds, the safety of which is either governed by regulations (e.g. allowed methyl eugenol levels in the EU Cosmetics Regulation (Entry{{nbsp}}102, Annex{{nbsp}}III of the EU Cosmetics Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2009R1223:20130711:en:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;) or through various limitations set by the International Fragrance Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifraorg.org/en-us/standards|title=standards - IFRA International Fragrance Association - in every sense|website=www.ifraorg.org|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Toxicity====
Certain chemicals found in perfume are often toxic, at least for small insects if not for humans. For example, the compound Tricyclodecenyl allyl ether is often found in synthetic perfumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/55017187/Insect-Repellents---Patent-6660288|title=Insect Repellents – PDF|work=Docstoc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1119250.html|title=INSECT REPELLENTS – QUEST INTERNATIONAL B.V.|work=freepatentsonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has [[insect repellent]] property.

===Environmental===
[[File:Flickr - dlisbona - Perfume stall in Cairo metro.jpg|thumb|upright|Perfume stall in [[Cairo]]]]

====Pollution====
Synthetic musks are pleasant in smell and relatively inexpensive, as such they are often employed in large quantities to cover the unpleasant scent of laundry detergents and many personal cleaning products. Due to their large-scale use, several types of synthetic musks have been found in human fat and milk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duedahl-Olesen L, Cederberg T, Pedersen KH, Højgård A |title=Synthetic musk fragrances in trout from Danish fish farms and human milk |journal=Chemosphere |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=422–31 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16182860 |doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.02.004 |url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/synthetic-musk-fragrances-in-trout-from-danish-fish-farms-and-human-milk(477f6612-140a-40f8-b794-fd61aca8aaab).html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the sediments and waters of the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peck AM, Linebaugh EK, Hornbuckle KC |title=Synthetic Musk Fragrances in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario Sediment Cores |journal=Environ. Sci. Technol. |volume=40 |issue=18 |pages=5629–35 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17007119 |doi= 10.1021/es060134y|url= |pmc=2757450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These pollutants may pose additional health and environmental problems when they enter human and animal diets.

====Species endangerment====
The demands for aromatic materials such as sandalwood, agarwood, and musk have led to the endangerment of these species, as well as illegal trafficking and harvesting.

===Safety regulations===
The perfume industry in the US is not directly regulated by the FDA, instead the FDA controls the safety of perfumes through their ingredients and requires that they be tested to the extent that they are ''[[Generally recognized as safe]]'' (GRAS). Due to the need for protection of trade secrets, companies rarely give the full listing of ingredients regardless of their effects on health. In Europe, as from 11 March 2005, the mandatory listing of a set of 26 recognized fragrance allergens was enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:066:0026:0035:EN:PDF|title="DIRECTIVE 2003/15/EC"|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement to list these materials is dependent on the intended use of the final product. The limits above which the allegens are required to be declared are 0.001% for products intended to remain on the skin, and 0.01% for those intended to be rinsed off. This has resulted in many old perfumes like chypres and [[fougère]] classes, which require the use of oakmoss extract, being reformulated.

==Preserving perfume==
[[File:Dokumentation av utställningen Passion för parfym, 2007, Hallwylska museet - Hallwylska museet - 86456.tif|thumb|upright|Perfumes in a museum]]

Fragrance compounds in perfumes will degrade or break down if improperly stored in the presence of [[heat]], [[light]], [[oxygen]], and [[Dirt|extraneous organic materials]].
Proper preservation of perfumes involves keeping them away from sources of heat and storing them where they will not be exposed to light. An opened bottle will keep its aroma intact for several years, as long as it is well stored.&lt;ref name=Burr /&gt; However, the presence of oxygen in the head space of the bottle and environmental factors will in the long run alter the smell of the fragrance.

Perfumes are best preserved when kept in light-tight [[aluminium]] bottles or in their original packaging when not in use, and refrigerated to relatively low temperatures: between 3–7&amp;nbsp;°C (37–45&amp;nbsp;°F). Although it is difficult to completely remove oxygen from the headspace of a stored flask of fragrance, opting for spray dispensers instead of rollers and "open" bottles will minimize oxygen exposure. Sprays also have the advantage of isolating fragrance inside a bottle and preventing it from mixing with dust, skin, and detritus, which would degrade and alter the quality of a perfume.

There exist several [[archives]] and [[museums]] devoted to the preservation of historical perfumes, namely the [[Osmothèque]], which stocks over 3,000 perfumes from the past two millennia in their original formulations. All scents in their collection are preserved in non-[[actinic]] glass flasks flushed with [[argon]] gas, stored in [[Thermal insulation|thermally insulated]] compartments maintained at {{convert|12|°C|°F|1}} in a large vault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beautyfashion.com/archives/LOsmotheque.html Colton, Sarah, "L’Osmothèque—Preserving The Past To Ensure The Future", Beauty Fashion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615174831/http://www.beautyfashion.com/archives/LOsmotheque.html |date=15 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">The '''Private Libraries Association''' (PLA) came into being in 1956 when 18-year-old Philip Ward wrote a letter to the [[The Observer|Observer]] inviting booklovers and [[book collectors]] to attend a meeting to discuss the setting up of an association whose aims would be:-
*To help readers in the organisation, cataloguing and fuller enjoyment of their personal collections;
*To cover every subject field by voluntary organised specialisation, and to record locations for loans.&lt;ref&gt;David Chambers, editor, ''A Modest Collection'' (Pinner, Middlesex, Private Libraries Association, 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-900002-67-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the membership has always included distinguished experts, it largely consists of ordinary collectors who share their enthusiasms and their knowledge. Since its foundation, the PLA has published a quarterly journal, originally called ''P.L.A. Quarterly'' but quickly renamed (from 1958) ''The Private Library''; since Spring 1968, the journal has appeared in a standard format of some 40-50 pages containing two or three illustrated articles. It also publishes a members’ book every year or two years. The articles and books are written by members and cover a wide range of subjects – classic fine printing and modern [[private press]]es, modern [[small press]]es and [[children's books]], [[illustrators]] and [[publishers]], famous books and the history of [[printing]], [[bookplates]] and [[bookbinding]], [[bookselling]], etc.. Details of the books and ''the Private Library'' can be found on the association’s website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plabooks.org/ The website of the Private Libraries Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rita Clay Estrada''' (born July 31, 1941, in [[Michigan]], US) is a US writer of [[romance novels]] as '''Rita Clay''', '''Tira Lacy''' and '''Rita Clay Estrada''', she has also written non-fiction books about writing romance novels. She was the first president of the [[Romance Writers of America]], and founding member with her mother [[Rita Gallagher]].

==Biography==
Born Rita Clay on July 31, 1941, in [[Michigan]], US.  Her mother, [[Rita Gallagher]], was a former Miss Michigan, a romance novelist and a noted writing instructor, while her father was a pilot with the [[U.S. Air Force]].  She spent much of her early years living in Europe.  She married her high school sweetheart when she was very young and stayed at home to raise their four children.  In 1977, when she had been married about 20 years, her husband brought her a typewriter and said, "'You said you always wanted to write.  Now write.'"&lt;ref name="racine"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Racine|first=Marty|title=Romancing the word|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=August 26, 1995|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1995_1293554|accessdate=August 16, 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first attempt was a long historical romance which was promptly rejected.  Her next manuscript, a contemporary romance, was likewise rejected.  Her third manuscript, ''Wanderer's Dream,'' sold to [[Harlequin Enterprises Ltd|Silhouette Books]].  She used her maiden name, Rita Clay for that and an additional seven titles for Silhouette.  In 1982, she moved to Dell to write for their Candlelight Ecstasy line.  Harlequin owned her pen name, so she wrote as Tira Lacy, an anagram of Rita Clay.  In 1985 she re-signed with Harlequin and asked to use her full name, Rita Clay Estrada, on all future books.&lt;ref name="racine"/&gt;

She generally takes 4.5 months to write a novel.  Except for punctuation and fact-checking, she does very little rewriting, as "that's why there are editors."&lt;ref name="racine"/&gt; Generally, she writes five pages each night and more on the weekends.  Her novels have been translated in 23 languages.&lt;ref name="racine"/&gt;

Estrada was a founding member and the first president of the [[Romance Writers of America]] (RWA).  Their signature award, the RITA, which is the highest award of excellence given in the genre of [[romance novel|romantic fiction]], is named for her.&lt;ref name="rwa"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Romance Writers of America]]|title=RITA Awards|url=https://www.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=RWA&amp;WebKey=626513aa-6aaa-4e14-9873-6a3c1efbaa87|accessdate=July 4, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630232429/https://www.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=RWA&amp;WebKey=626513aa-6aaa-4e14-9873-6a3c1efbaa87|archivedate=June 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RWA also awarded Estrada their Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000.&lt;ref name="ward"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Crescent Blues| last=Ward|first=Jean Marie|title=RWA National 2000: Contrasting Passions|url=http://www.crescentblues.com/3_4issue/rwa.shtml|accessdate=July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Jerome in His Study''''' is a [[fresco]] by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], executed in 1480 and located in the [[church of Ognissanti]], [[Florence]].

The work was commissioned by the [[Amerigo Vespucci|Vespucci]] family together with a ''[[St. Augustine (Botticelli)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]]. Both depicted two Doctors of the Church in their studies, with a number of objects which should mark their role as precursors of [[humanism]]. They decorated the area next to the choir, which was demolished in the 18th century. In that occasion the two frescoes were removed and placed in the nave. Part of the annexed frame and the inscriptions were lost.

==Description==

While Botticelli adopted a more expressive composition in his ''[[Saint Augustine]]'' (inspired by [[Andrea del Castagno]]'s works), Ghirlandaio created a more serene and conventional figure, concentrating instead on the [[still life]] of the objects exposed on the writing desk and the shelves behind [[Saint Jerome|Jerome]]. In this, he was perhaps inspired by northern European models, such as  [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Saint Jerome in His Study (van Eyck)|Saint Jerome in His Study]]'' which was in the collections of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].

Jerome is portrayed with his head resting on one hand, while writing with the other. This was the same posture chosen by Jan van Eyck. The open books and the cartouches, with [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters, correspond to his activity as translator of the [[Bible]]. On the writing desk is the date (MCCCCLXXX), as well as a sealed letter, glasses, two inkwells (with drops of ink near them), scissors and a candle holder. The desk is covered by an oriental carpet, a luxurious object often depicted by Ghirlandaio, and perhaps also inspired by [[Flemish painting|Netherlandish painters]]. The objects on the shelves include a [[cardinal hat]], two pharmacist vases, a cylindrical case,  a necklace, a purse, some fruit, two transparent glass bottles and an hourglass.

The light comes from the upper right corner, producing a well defined shadow of the saint on the drapery behind him; but also from the foreground, illuminating the objects on the desk.

'''Slow Design''' is a branch of the [[Slow movement (culture)|Slow Movement]], which began with the concept of [[Slow Food]], a term coined in contrast to ''fast food''. As with every branch of the Slow Movement, the overarching goal of Slow Design is to promote well being for individuals, society, and the natural environment. Slow Design seeks a holistic approach to designing that takes into consideration a wide range of material and social factors as well as the short and long term impacts of the design.

==Origin and meaning==
Slow Design refers to the goals and approach of the designer, rather than the object of the design.  In this way a Slow Design approach can be used within any [[design]] field.  The term was probably first coined by Alastair Fuad-Luke in his 2002 paper "'Slow Design' - a paradigm for living sustainably?", in which Slow Design is seen as the next step in the development of [[sustainable design]], balancing individual, socio-cultural, and environmental needs.&lt;ref name="FuadLuke2002"/&gt;

While Fuad-Luke focused on the design of physical products, the concept can be applied to the design of non-material things such as experiences, processes, services, and organizations. In fact, Slow Design may be seen as a path toward the [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] required for long-term sustainability as it takes into account the non-material nature of human well being and [[happiness]].

Beth Meredith and Eric Storm attempt to summarize the concept, stating: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Slow Design is a democratic and holistic design approach for creating appropriately tailored solutions for the long-term well being of people and the planet. To this end, Slow Design seeks out positive synergies between the elements in a system, celebrates diversity and regionalism, and cultivates meaningful relationships that add richness to life.&lt;ref name="MeredithStorm2010"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The editor and journalist [[Spencer Bailey]] has described Slow Design as “design that’s timeless and made to last, and done thoughtfully, with intent, and with care for our planet.”&lt;ref name="Spencer Bailey, editor, New York"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spencer Bailey, editor, New York”|url=http://www.slow-words.com/spencer-bailey-editor-new-york/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and future practice ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Common qualities of Slow Design include:
* Holistic – taking into account as many relevant short and long term factors as possible.
* Sustainable – considering the [[Cradle to cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]] impacts and reducing harm as much as possible including the [[precautionary principle]].
* Elegant – finding the simplest and most concise solutions that provide the desired results.
* Tailored – creating specific solutions that fit a particular situation.
* Democratic – keeping the process and results accessible to those using and impacted by the design and to non-professionals.
* Adaptable – developing solutions that will continue to work over time or that can be modified as needed. 
* Durable – making sure solutions can be maintained over time while minimizing the need for repairs and replacement.
* Non-toxic – eliminating substances and processes that pollute or are toxic.
* Efficient – minimizing waste of time, labor, energy, and physical resources.
* Distinctive – promoting cultural, social, and environmental uniqueness and diversity.

Slow design is still a relatively new concept of design thinking, and its implications are yet to be fully developed and defined. It could evolve in the following ways:
* Longer design processes with more time for research, contemplation, real life impact tests, and fine tuning. 
* Design for manufacturing with local or regional materials and technologies or design that supports local industries, workshops, and craftspeople. 
* Design that takes into account local or regional culture both as a source of inspiration and as an important consideration for the design outcome. 
* Design that studies the concept of natural time cycles and incorporates them into design and manufacturing processes. 
* Design that looks at longer cycles of human behavior and sustainability.
* Design that takes into account deeper well being and the findings of [[positive psychology]].

'''Tel Kabri''' ({{lang-he-n|תֵל כַבְרִי}}; {{lang-ar|تَلْ ألْقَهوَة}}, Tell al-Qahweh, "the mound of coffee"{{sfnp|Khalidi|1992|p=28}}) is an [[archaeological]] site of a ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]'' (hill city), containing one of the largest [[Bronze Age|Middle Bronze]] (MB) Age (2,100–1,550 BC) [[Canaan]]ite palaces in ancient Palestine,{{sfnp|Wiener|2013b}} and the largest such palace excavated as of 2014.{{sfnp|Koh|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2014}} Kabri is named for the abundance of its perennial [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] – as described in the [[#Etymology|Etymology]] section below – the presence of which has led to the site's occupation and use as a water source from the [[Neolithic#Neolithic 3 – Pottery Neolithic (PN)|Pottery Neolithic]] (PN) period (6,400–4,500 BC) to the present day.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=15}} Located in the Western [[Upper Galilee]], the site was at the height of its power in the MB, controlling much of the surrounding region. Kabri declined as a local power at the end of the MB, but the site continued to be occupied at times, on a much reduced level, up until the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].

Since 1957, Tel Kabri has been excavated by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] (IAA), formerly the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (IDAM), as well as Israeli and American universities.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|pp=839–841}} Among the discoveries at the site by the two full-scale archaeological expeditions,{{efn|1= [[#The Tel Kabri Expedition: 1986–1993|The Tel Kabri Expedition]] (1986–1993) and [[#The Tel Kabri Archaeological Project: 2005–ongoing|The Tel Kabri Archaeological Project]] (2005–ongoing) are discussed in detail later in the text.}}  two have attracted particular attention from the archaeological community. The first finding to come to international attention was the discovery of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]-style [[fresco]]es in the palace at Kabri.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|Goshen|2011|p=245}} {{as of|2015}}, these are the only Minoan-style frescoes ever discovered in Israel.{{sfnp|Science Daily|2009}} Second, in 2013, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project uncovered the oldest and largest known palatial [[wine cellar]] in the [[Ancient Near East]] in Kabri's palace.{{sfnp|Burrows|2013}}

==Etymology==
{{as of|2015}}, the original Canaanite name of Tel Kabri is unknown.{{efn|1= Tel Kabri, as the name suggests is a ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tel]]'', a type of mound found from the [[Balkans]] to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] that is created as a result of the destruction of mudbrick from repeated different periods of occupation of a site.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|pp=21-22}}}} Aharon Kempinski hypothesised that Kabri might have been the same city as Rehov, referred to in the [[Execration Texts]], an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian list of enemy polities.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002b|p=452}} [[Amihai Mazar]] once believed that Tel Kabri – or the site of [[Rehov|Tel Rehov]] – might be the Rehov from the Execration Texts, or Tel Kabri might be a different Rehov mentioned in topographic lists by [[Pharaoh]] [[Thutmose III]].{{sfnp|Mazar|1999|p=4}} No definitive evidence has been found to support any of these hypotheses. By the [[Iron Age Levant|Iron Age]], 1200-500BC (IA), the site is known to have been called Rehov, and this continued into the [[Phoenicia#High point: 1200–800 BC|Phoenician]] period – a period of Phoenician dominance over the area, which was concurrent with the Iron Age.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}}

Early in the [[Phoenicia under Roman rule|Roman Period]] (64 BC–500s AD), the town of Kabrita had been established to the east of the tel.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}} The site is mentioned in the 3rd century [[Mosaic of Rehob]], as marking one of the northernmost bounds of Jewish resettlement after their return from [[Babylonian exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]], ''The Northwest Corner of Eretz-Israel in the Baraita ‘Boundaries of Eretz-Israel’'' Cathedra: For the History of Eretz Israel and its Yishuv (vol. 27), 1983, pp. 39–46. (See: {{cite journal |last=Finkelstein |first=Israel |title='The Northwest Corner of Eretz-Israel' in the Baraita 'Boundaries of Eretz-Israel' |journal=Cathedra: For the History of Eretz Israel and its Yishuv |volume=27 |issue= |pages=39–46 |jstor=23398920|date=1983|registration=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt; Kabrita became the Arab village of el-Kabira, which by the late 1200s AD was called al-Kabrah by the Arabs and Le Quiebre by the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem#The Kingdom of Acre|Crusader]]s who controlled the area at the time. By 1880, both the village and the ruins on the tel had come to be associated and bear the same names.{{sfnp|Guérin|1880|p=32}} Al-Kabrah eventually became [[al-Kabri]],{{sfnp|Barag|1979|p=203}} and this name lasted until the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] when the village was depopulated.{{sfnp|Anon|1988|p=49}} Both the post-war kibbutz, [[Kabri, Israel|Kabri]], on whose grounds the archaeological site is located, and the tel itself, are named for al-Kabri.{{sfnp|Anon|1988|p=49}} The name of Kabrita, and the later names, were derived from the triconsonantal [[Semitic root#Triconsonantal roots|Semitic root]], כבר, meaning 'great or powerful', in reference to the plentiful water from Kabri's springs.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002b|p=452}}

==Geography==
Tel Kabri is at the eastern end of the Western Galilee coastal plain, located on the grounds of Kibbutz Kabri. It is less than {{convert|5|km|mi}} from the [[Mediterranean Sea|sea]], and the [[Ga'aton River]] is nearby to the south, with the closest major city being [[Nahariyya]] to the west. The [[Tell (archaeology)|tel]] is home to four springs, Ein Shefa, Ein Giah, Ein Tzuf, and Ein ha-Shayara.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=15}} It is these springs that have brought people to Kabri since the Neolithic.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=15}}

Natural resources such as trees on the hills to the east and stone quarries near the coast were important for the inhabitants of the site. Kabri's height is partly a result of human activity: Over the centuries, material remains created layers that built up thetel.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|pp=21-22}} During Kempinski's excavations, it was found that the original surface in the Neolithic would have been up to {{convert|5.5|m|ft}} lower than the present surface.{{sfnp|Horowitz|2002|p=8}}

==History==

The tel and its surrounding area have been inhabited since the [[Neolithic#Neolithic 3 .E2.80.93 Pottery Neolithic .28PN.29|Pottery Neolithic]] (PN).{{efn|1= 6,400–4,500 BC}}  Kabri was at the height of its power in the MB, when the polity there controlled a significant portion of the Upper Galilee. After the MB, Tel Kabri was occupied by later peoples – though on a much reduced scale – up to the founding of the State of Israel, when the kibbutz of Kabri was created.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}}

===Pre-Palatial===

The area of Kabri was first settled during the PN by members of the [[Yarmoukian]] culture.{{sfnp|Marder|al.|2002|p=305}} In the early [[Chalcolithic]] period (4500–3500 BC), Kabri was a major centre of the [[Wadi Raba]] culture. In the Early Bronze (EB) Age (3500-2100 BC), there was a town on the side of the tel that was destroyed as part of the region-wide [[societal collapse|systems collapse]] that characterised the EB collapse.{{efn|1= The Early Bronze Age collapse is the event that is traditionally used to mark the end of the EB and the beginning of MB. The "collapse" was an abrupt end to the material culture – such as pottery and architecture – that is identified with the EB civilisations of the [[Aegean Civilization|Aegean]], [[Bronze Age Anatolia#Early Bronze Age|Anatolia]] and the [[Bronze Age Levant#Bronze Age|Levant]] and the beginning of a period marked by the prevalence of so-called palatial society. {{As of|2015}} there is no accepted explanation for this sudden change.}}  In the early and middle MB I, Tel Kabri – along with [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Tel Afek|Aphek]], and [[Acre, Israel#Antiquity|Akko]] – was one of the earliest cities in the Levant to rebuild its fortifications following the EB collapse.{{sfnp|Kempinski|1992|p=127}} The new city was confined to the northern part of the earlier EB tel.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|p=70}}

===Palatial===

Prior to the ongoing excavations at Kabri that began in 2005,{{efn|1= {{as of|2015}}, excavations are ongoing.}}  archaeologists thought that there was only one palace at the site,{{efn|1= A palace that had been found by Aharon Kempinski during the [[#The Tel Kabri Expedition: 1986–1993|Tel Kabri Expedition of 1986–1993]].}}  and that it was built in the period between the late MB I (2200–1950 BC) and MB IIA (1950–1700 BC). It was also thought that the MB I period had been a transition phase. However, the palace found by Kempinski has been dated to the MB IIB (1700–1550 BC), and in 2010, a second, earlier, palace – an MB IIA palace{{efn|1= MB I and MB IIA are interchangeable terms. This palace is hereinafter referred to as the earlier palace.}}  – was identified beneath the MB IIB palace.{{efn|1= Hereinafter referred to as the later palace.}}  The remains of the earlier MB IIA palace appear to show that it was expanded to create the later MB IIB palace. The discovery of the earlier palace pushes the dates for palatial occupation of the site to the MB IIA, 150 years earlier than originally believed. The earlier MB IIA palace may have been "the most impressive structure in the Upper Galilee" at the time, and was possibly the oldest palace in Canaan.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}}

Earlier still, at the transition between the MB I and MB II, a large-scale restructuring programme was undertaken in a possible effort to transform Kabri into an idealised Syrian-style city – a powerful city-state centred around a magnificent and well-fortified palace.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|p=70}} The area was fortified, and an additional {{convert|25|ha|m2}} were enclosed within a large glacis, a type of earthwork fortification that was {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide with a stone core and that encircled the tel as it appears today. The glacis was topped by mudbrick and stone.{{sfnp|Issar|Zohar|2004|p=147}} There was an MB I palace and this was expanded into the MB II palaces.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}} This restructuring programme resulted in some parts of the tel being flattened out and a large portion of the population having to find new homes in the city, as a result of part of the MB IIA palace – along with certain parts of the rampart – being built in an area previously occupied by private houses.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|p=72}} Kabri's ancillary sites (such as [[Achziv]] and [[Avdon]]) were also built up, and migration from the hinterland to Kabri – and its secondary sites – increased dramatically as a result of these projects.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|pp=72–73}} Kabri became the capital of a major polity, with the newly expanded MB II palace at its centre.{{sfnp|Marom|al.|2014|p=63}}

At the peak of its power, Kabri may have controlled a domain that stretched from [[Mount Carmel]] in the south to the [[Sulam range]] in the north, with as many as 31 vassal sites and 30,000 subjects.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2007|p=162}} Kempinski hypothesised that Kabri might be the Bronze Age settlement of Rehov, a polity mentioned in the Execration Texts and the biblical [[Book of Joshua]].{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}}During this period, Kabri maintained significant contacts with neighbouring regions in the form of trade and exchange of ideas.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|Pierce|2008|p=62}}

Counting the MB I, MB IIA, and MB IIB stages, the palace was continuously occupied for three centuries. This is longer than any other palace in ancient Israel.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}}

[[File:AcreNE1799.jpg|thumb|[[Sidon Eyalet|Ottoman period]] French survey map from 1799 showing the Upper Galilee. Kabri's springs are shown as being exploited by Akko.]]
By 1500 BC, the site was abandoned for reasons unknown as of the 2015.{{sfnp|Burrows|2013}} Some time after the abandonment, during the Late Bronze (LB) Age (1550–1200 BC), a small village occupied the tel.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}}
In the Iron Age, the site was reoccupied by Greek mercenaries under hire from the Phoenician city-state of [[Tyre, Lebanon#Early history|Tyre]]. The mercenaries were based in a citadel there.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=2}} Close to the citadel, in the Iron Age and Phoenician periods, the later Phoenician city of Rehov was sited at Kabri. The Phoenician town was fortified by a [[casemate]] wall. This town was destroyed by the armies of the [[Neo-Babylonian]] king, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] around 585 BC, and his rule was extended over [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Phoenicia]].{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1994|p=35*}} After this destruction, the town was rebuilt and this new town grew during the [[Achaemenid Phoenicia|Persian period]] (538–332 BC). Remains from this time have been found near the tel's spring of Ein Shefa.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}} Habitation at the tel itself ends at this point. Early in the [[Phoenicia under Hellenistic rule|Hellenistic period]] (332–64 BC), the ruins of the Iron Age citadel were used for burials, but the tel was not resettled until the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period (1517-1917 AD).{{sfnp|Lehmann|2002|p=87}}

Some time during the [[Phoenicia under Roman rule|Early Roman period]], a Jewish settlement is mentioned, named Kabrita,{{sfnp|Aviram|1997|p=23}} located east of the tel in the area that was occupied by the later Arab village, eventually named al-Kabri.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} Kabri, appearing under the name of al-Kabrah, is mentioned in the last [[hudna]], or peace treaty, between the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]{{efn|1= Which by that point had been reduced to a remnant based out of Akko (called Acre).}}  and the [[Mamluks]].{{efn|1= A [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] sultanate based in Egypt which ruled most of the Levant at the time}}  In the treaty, the village and its surrounding fields, are shown as belonging to the ruler of Akko.{{sfnp|Barag|1979|p=203}}

In addition to al-Kabri which is located east of the site, during the Ottoman Period, two additional Arab villages were founded on the actual site – [[Al-Nahr|en-Nahr]] and [[al-Tall, Acre|et-Tell]] – in the southern and western portions of the tel, respectively.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} All three villages were close to the major springs, but during most of their existence, they were sparsely populated – in the low hundreds. Al-Kabri appears as ''Kabli'' and En-Nahr appears as ''el-Qahweh'' in the first topographic map of the region made in 1799 by [[Napoleon]]'s cartographer, [[Pierre Jacotin]]. This same map does not show Et-Tell, and only shows a mill in that location.{{sfnp|Karmon|1960|p=160}} Et-Tell does appear in the later [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] map of 1880,{{sfnp|Karmon|1960|p=160}} and is talked about by [[Victor Guérin]] in his travelogue of the area, published that same year, which described all three villages.{{sfnp|Guérin|1880|pp=31-33, 46, 50}} Karmon hypothesised that the new village of et-Tell might have been founded by villagers from el-Qahweh as a home for mill workers.{{sfnp|Karmon|1960|p=246}} The three villages existed up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War when they were depopulated.{{sfnp|Morris|2004|pp=253-254}}

Much of Kabri's recorded history also deals with its springs and, starting in the Hellenistic period, the springs' relationship to the city of [[Akko]].{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|pp=15-17}} The springs of Kabri have fed Akko for centuries, and aqueducts have been built from Kabri to Akko by local rulers.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=17}} In the Hellenistic period, an aqueduct was constructed at Kabri,{{sfnp|Frankel|2002|pp=82-87}} and another was built during the governorship of [[Jezzar Pasha]], the Ottoman ruler of [[Acre, Israel#Ottoman era|Akko]] who also ruled the [[Eyalet of Sidon]] (1775-1804).{{efn|1= An ''[[eyalet]]'' was an Ottoman administrative division corresponding to a province. Most of the Galilee, including Kabri, fell under the Eyalet of Sidon.}}  Later, a new aqueduct was built by Jezzar's successor, [[Suleiman Pasha(Acre)|Sulaymán Páshá]]{{efn|1= Jezzar's aqueduct had been destroyed by the military forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].}}  in the Ottoman Period, and this aqueduct functioned up until the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=18}} Portions of the structure still stand today.{{sfnp|Kahanov|2011|p=104}}

Following the War, the tel was incorporated into the grounds of Kibbutz Kabri and was made into agricultural land. Soon after, the ancient remains of the site were rediscovered and on-and-off archaeological work began which continues to the present day alongside the agricultural work of the kibbutz.

==Archaeology==
[[File:TelKabriRegion.png|thumb|250px|Tel Kabri in relation to old and new settlements]]
Tel Kabri has been a subject of archaeological study since 1957, following the discovery of Late Neolithic vessels at the site in 1956 by members of the kibbutz.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1959|pp=268–269}} After 1961, most of the focus on the site shifted to Bronze Age material remains. [[Archaeological survey|Surveys]] and excavations have taken place at the site to explore its past.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|pp=2–3}}

Tel Kabri is a multi-period site, meaning that it has layers, or "strata", of occupation dating from different time periods. The tel itself operates as an agricultural area of Kibbutz Kabri, and certain layers have been subject to damage as a result of agriculture activity.{{Sfnm|Kempinski|2002a|1p=4|Kempinski|2002c|2p=35}}

The tel is located on the grounds of the kibbutz, and contains the remains of the Canaanite city from the MB period and the partially excavated later Iron Age citadel. Tel Kabri is the only Canaanite city that can be excavated in its entirety because no other city with monumental architecture was built on the site after the MB city.{{sfnp|Science Daily|2009}} In 2013, it was estimated that the palace would have occupied {{convert|6100|m2|acres|abbr=on}},{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=10}} and in 2006, it was estimated that the ancient city as a whole would have occupied {{convert|4|ha|acres|abbr=on|0}}.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=37}}

As a result of farming and erosion, Stratum 1 of the tel, the uppermost layer, has been heavily damaged.{{efn|1= Strata (sing. stratum) are layers of stratigraphy. Typically strata arranged in descending order, so Stratum 1 is physically on top of Stratum 2, which is in turn over Stratum 3, and so on. See the following section for a brief explanation of stratigraphy.}}  Prior to agricultural activities by the ''[[kibbutz]]niks'' in 1976, there still existed large towers on the tel, which may have been gates.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002c|p=35}} The entire site is cut across by a [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] period (1920–1948 AD) road that originally led from the coastal city of [[Nahariyya]] to the ''[[moshav]]'' of [[Me'ona]].{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=1}}  Most of the tel was also covered over with a metre of sterile top-soil (containing no archaeological remains) laid down for the purpose of farming by the kibbutz between Kempinski's excavations ending in 1993 and the beginning of the ongoing expedition in 2005. According to Tel Kabri Archaeological Project co-Director Assaf Yasur-Landau: "The city's preservation enables us to get a complete picture of political and social life in the Canaanite period. We can reveal whether or not it had a central government, whether taxes were levied, what sort of agriculture there was and how politics were conducted at the time."{{sfnp|Science Daily|2009}}

===Stratigraphy===
{{details|topic=stratigraphy and its uses in archaeology|Stratigraphy (archaeology)}}
Kempinski identified twelve stratigraphic layers at Tel Kabri. Stratigraphy is the layering of soil with the more recent soil layers higher up and the older soil layers further down. Archaeologists and geologists use stratigraphy to date artefacts found in the soil relative to each other.{{efn|1= See [[Relationship (archaeology)]] for further information on how the relationships between archaeological finds are determined.}}  The artefacts – in particular, [[sherd]]s of pottery – can, in turn, be used to date the layer of soil and its contents to a specific date range.{{efn|1= See ''[[Seriation (archaeology)]]'' for an explanation on how archaeologists can use pottery to create a timeline for the past.}}  The 1986-1993 Tel Kabri Expedition did not find a continuous stratigraphic sequence in any one excavation trench, and so Kempinski based the identification of the layers at Tel Kabri on finds in different areas.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} He arranged the layers as follows:{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|pp=4–5}}

===Areas===

Tel Kabri is divided up into areas (some of which are shown in the table above) for practical purposes of organisation.{{efn|1= As defined in Kempinski (2002a); p. 4-5}}  The first areas – A, B, and C – were designated during the 1975–1976 excavations by Kempinski and Prausnitz.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|pp=165–166}} Later Areas D, E, F, and T were opened by the 1986–1993 Tel Kabri Expedition, and Area D was subdivided by the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project starting in 2005.The following areas have been investigated as of the 2013 season.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;

*'''Area A''' – This area was designated Area A by Kempinski and Prausnitz during their 1975–1976 excavations.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|pp=165–166}} The area that would come to be called Area A was the first area of archaeological fieldwork at Tel Kabri. This was the survey of Area A in 1957 after Neolithic [[Stone tool|stone]] vessels had been found in 1956.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1959|pp=268–269}} This area was first excavated by Prausnitz from 1957 to 1958, when he found early Chalcolithic [[cist|cist tombs]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#cite note-FOOTNOTEPrausnitz1959268-68|Prausnitz (1959)]], pp. 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;  and houses.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1970|p=160}} Exploration in Area A has focused on the Neolithic and Chalcolithic aspects of the site.{{sfnp|Marder|al.|2002|p=299}} This area was not excavated during Kempinski's 1986–1993 Tel Kabri Expedition,{{sfnp|Marder|al.|2002|pp=299–305}} and has not been excavated by the current Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, as of the 2013 season.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;
*'''Area B''' – First excavated by Ben-Yosef in 1969,{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}} the area was later excavated by Kempinski and Prausnitz in 1975 and 1976 who gave it the name, Area B. Kempinski's 1986-1993 expedition found some pottery from the MB II, but modern human activity had destroyed the layers of previous habitation.
*'''Area C''' – Like Areas A and B, Area C was named during Kempinski and Prausnitz's 1975–1976 excavations. Area C was a 40-metre-long trench cut into the rampart on the northern end of the tel in the first year of their expedition. During Kempinski's 1986–1993 excavations, the trench was expanded south so as to study the fortifications inside the city itself.
*'''Area D''' – First uncovered as a result of [[Mekorot]]'s 1961 trench, which exposed the MB [[lime plaster|plaster]] floors. Area D is where the excavation on the MB palaces has taken place. Kempinski focused most of his efforts on Area D,{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} and excavations during the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project have been confined to Area D.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt; During the course of the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, Area D has been sub-divided as follows:&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;
**''Area D-West'' (2005, 2008–present) – First opened in 2005 to investigate a possible throne room for the final palace,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=4}} D-West has been open every year during the portion of the expedition devoted to excavation, which started in 2008, for the purpose of further uncovering palatial structures.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt; In 2013, a storage room was found in D-West which was later identified as a wine cellar. 
**''Area D-South'' (2005, 2009-2013) – In 2005, D-South was opened to investigate the southern portion of Area D which Kempinski and Niemeier hypothesised might be a religious area. Excavators found evidence of metal-working as well as what excavators referred to as a massive stone structure.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=3}} When D-South was reopened in 2009, it was further subdivided into D-South 1 and 2 and remained as two areas in 2009 and 2011, and then just D-South 1 in the 2013 season. During the course of these excavations, a structure called the "Upper Terrace or Courtyard Building" or Building 3079 was exposed in both areas, which the excavators hypothesised might be part of an as of yet unexcavated monumental structure.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|pp=4-6}}
***''D-South 1'' (2009-2013) – D-South 1 was opened in 2009 to investigate the massive stone structure found in 2005, which was found to be a wall corner and was further exposed towards the east in later seasons as building 3079. In 2013, the excavators looked for further structures as well as the possible early stages of the city rampart. They found a wall which they believe may be part of the retaining wall for another building.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|pp=6-7}}
***''D-South 2'' (2009 and 2011) – D-South 2 was opened in 2009 so as to link areas excavated in 2005 in D-South with Area F as well as to investigate, further towards the west, the massive stone structure found in 2005 (later Building 3079).{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=5}} By 2011, the large structure had been identified, including a so-called "zig-zag wall" (based on its shape), and the excavators hypothesised that there might be a lower courtyard, as well as a thus far unexcavated monumental structure.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|pp=4-6}}
**''Area D-North'' (2005, 2013 as part of Area D-West East) – Opened in 2005 to locate a possible northern wall of the final palace which had been located by geophysical surveys. The results of the 2005 season in D-North supported an earlier hypothesis by Kempinski and Niemeier that there had been a large structure on the site of the later palace preceding its construction.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|pp=3–4}} In 2013, D-North was linked via D-West East to Kempinski's old Area D excavations.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=10}}
**''Area D-West East'' (2013) – D-West East was opened in 2013 in an attempt to link up D-North with the portions of Area D excavated by Kempinski, as well as explore further rooms surrounding one of the final palace's courtyards, as well as to find a complete [[Assemblage (archaeology)|pottery assemblage]] free of possible contamination from other periods or locations in the palace.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=7}}
*'''Area E''' – Area E was excavated in 1986 via a trench in the southwest of the tel after a survey found traces of Iron Age settlement.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} It was reopened from 1989 to 1990 and from 1992 to 1993.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xvi}} This area was investigated once more by Smithline in 2004 when he recovered significant amounts of Iron Age pottery, which add to the body of knowledge for the site's post-palatial ceramics.{{sfnp|Smithline|2007}} 
*'''Area F''' – Area F was a portion of Area D created in 1990 as a result of Area D being physically cut in two by the Mandate period road. In both Kempinski's preliminary reports and on-site, Area F was treated as separate from Area D.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} However, both Kempinski's final report (2002) treated Area F as part of Area D. In 2009, Area F was reopened and excavated by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;
*'''Area T''' – Located in the northeast of the tel, this area was excavated in 1990{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xvi}} to investigate what Kempinski's team thought might be a tower.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} They found a section of well-preserved city wall instead.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002c|p=35}}

==Archaeological expeditions==
[[File:Tel Kabri Wine Cellar with labelled wine jars.png|thumb|A view to the southeast of the 40 or so wine storage vessels ''in-situ'' in the D-West wine cellar in 2013. The expedition has numbered the vessels in the photo.{{sfnp|Koh|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2014}}]]
Archaeological work has taken place at Tel Kabri since 1956. The work at Tel Kabri has consisted of a survey, five minor excavations, and two major excavations,{{efn|1= Kempinski's 1986–1993 excavations, under the Tel Kabri Expedition, and the excavations by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project ongoing since 2005}}  although prior to 1986, much of the activity was [[Rescue archaeology|salvage excavations]] and surveys. {{as of|2015}}, Tel Kabri is being excavated by an international consortium, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt; Among the finds that have been discovered at Tel Kabri, are Minoan-style wall frescoes – of which there are four known at Kabri – and the oldest and largest known palatial wine cellar in the Ancient Near East.{{sfnp|Wiener|2013b}}

In the years before the first large-scale excavations by Aharon Kempinski (1986-1993), surveys and smaller excavations were conducted to rescue artefacts and get an idea of the nature of Tel Kabri. This began when the archaeological remains of the tel were first discovered in the 1950s after kibbutzniks started coming across Neolithic artefacts near the local spring of Ein Giah. In 1956, on behalf of IDAM, the forerunner of today's Israel Antiquities Authority, David Alon and [[Daniel Rosolio]] conducted a survey in the area where the Neolithic artefacts had first been found earlier in the same year. They came across fortifications from the MB, and this survey led to salvage excavations in the following two years of what would later become Area A. In 1961, public works by the national water company revealed Bronze Age architectural remains in the form of a palace floor. In 1969, another rescue excavation was launched to investigate MB IIA tombs revealed as a result of agricultural activity by the kibbutz. {{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} From 1975 to 1976, a salvage excavation was conducted to examine areas exposed in 1957, 1958, 1961, and 1969 {{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|pp=165–166}}

From 1957 to 1958, The first rescue excavations  were carried out by [[Moshe Prausnitz]] working with the IDAM,{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=2}} who was joined by Robert Stigler of [[Brandeis University]].{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1959|p=268}} Prausnitz focused on Area A of the site where the surveyors, Alon and Rosoliyo, had first investigated the Neolithic implements found by the kibbutzniks in 1956. His expedition found Neolithic 'cist' tombs as well as round and rectangular dwellings from the lower part of the city.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1970|p=160}}

In 1961, after Prausnitz's excavation, a large trench was cut into the tel by the national water company, Mekorot, so as to incorporate the local springs into the national water system. This inadvertently led to the start of exploration into the EB and MB archaeological remains at Kabri.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} The stratigraphy from the Mekorot trench was photographed and revealed the existence of the Bronze Age settlements.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002b|p=449,451}} It also revealed the plaster floors – the first evidence of what would later be identified as the MB II palaces.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} The trench also cut into – and revealed the existence of – the MB II rampart.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}}

In 1969, as a result of the kibbutz removing an orchard from the tel, MB II tombs containing grave goods were found in what had been the lower city. Their findspot{{efn|1= Later designated as Area B in the 1975–1976 excavations.}}  was excavated by Y. Ben-Yosef for the IDAM that same year.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}}

From 1975 to 1976, salvage excavations were carried out by Prausnitz representing the IDAM, Kempinski of [[Tel Aviv University]] (TAU), and [[Ruth Amiran]] of the [[Israel Museum]], to explore the area where the MB II tombs had been found, the lower city, the earthen rampart, and the Neolithic layers of the site.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} Among their finds was a {{convert|2.10|m|ft}} tall [[stela]] that had a polished face, but no inscription.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}} Following this excavation, Kempinski, focused his work on Tel Kabri{{sfnp|Oren|2002b|p=xii}} and applied for permits from the IDAM and permission from Kibbutz Kabri to conduct large-scale excavation of the site.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=3}}

In 1986, large-scale excavations began at Tel Kabri, initially under the direction of Kempinski for TAU, and then, from 1989 onwards, Kempinski and [[Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier]] for [[Heidelberg University]],{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} until Kempinski died in July 1994, and the expedition was discontinued.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=34}} Between 1986 and 1988, the first remains of the MB palaces were discovered near the spring of Ein Shefa, along with a contemporaneous residential area. The portion of the palace initially excavated included a {{convert|10|by|10|m|ft}} hall, with a Minoan-style decorated plaster floor.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}} The style of the floor is closest to what is referred to as the 'Cretan-Theran Late Minoan IA' tradition of wall painting.{{sfnp|Kempinski|1992|pp=112–113}} They also found more than 2,000 Aegean-style painted plaster fragments.{{sfnp|Wiener|2013a}} It was during the course of Kempinski's excavations that an Iron Age [[Phoenicia]]n citadel was also discovered. The site's excavators believed this fortification was occupied by Greek mercenaries, based on the pottery found there.{{sfnp|Niemeier|2002|pp=328–331}}

[[File:MBII duckbill axe from Kabri.png|thumb|An MB II duck-billed axe recovered during the 1988 excavations.]]

In the first year of excavation by the Kempinski expedition, work was carried out in Area C, {{efn|1= which had been designated during the 1975–1976 excavations.}}  and continued each year through the 1991 season. In 1986, Areas D and E were opened, and excavated,{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xv}} for the first time.{{sfnm|Oren|2002a|1p=55|Lehmann|2002|2p=73}} Area D was, and is, home to the MB palace, which became the focus of Kempinski's excavations for the duration of his expedition, which was the first to excavate the palace intentionally (after the accidental excavation by the Mekorot water company [[#Early work|in 1961]]).{{sfnp|Oren|2002a|p=55}} Area D was excavated each year by Kempinski's team. In 1987, the Kempinski expedition discovered the entranceway to what would be designated as Hall 611 in the palace, the ceremonial hall with the painted plaster floor.{{sfnp|Niemeier|Niemeier|2002|p=254}} Area E was excavated every year except 1987, 1988, and 1991, and in the first year, 1986, yielded Iron Age Greek pottery.{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1991|p=31*}} In 1987, new work was carried out in Prausnitz's Area B and continued each year through 1992.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xv}} During the 1988 excavation, a large family tomb was discovered in Area C,{{sfnp|Kempinski|1989|p=Introduction}} and MB II bronze artefacts, such as a "duck-billed axe" from Area B{{sfnp|Kempinski|1989|p=vi}} (see picture to the right), were also recovered from tombs in both Areas B and C.{{sfnp|Shalev|2002|pp=310–311}}

At the start of the 1989 season, German Archaeologist, Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier, joined Kempinski's Tel Kabri Expedition as his co-director. Along with the excavations in Areas B, C, D, and E, additional work was carried out in the new Area F,{{efn|1= An extension of Area D, again for the sake of organisation}}  which continued each year excluding the 1991 season, and in Area T,{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1990|p=1*}} which was excavated in 1990. Area T was an area at the northern part of the tel opened to explore what looked like a surviving tower but the exploration of which resulted in finding well-preserved fortifications. In 1990, finds included a Phoenician seal impression which had both the name of the official who owned it and the year according to the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] calendar.{{sfnp|Naveh|Kempinski|1991|p=10*}} Also in 1990, the western portion of Hall 611 was completely revealed in Area D, and preliminary preservation efforts were completed on the hall's painted plaster floor.{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1991|p=1*}} Work by the Kempinski expedition continued up though 1993. In Area E, work was done to investigate occupation of the site after the Iron Age – prior focus having been on the Bronze Age aspects of the site.

At the end of the 1993 season, the painted plaster floor in Hall 611 was covered over with [[geotextile]], as the team expected to return the following summer in 1994. However, Kempinski's excavations never resumed past 1993, as Kempinski died in June the following year.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=34}} In accordance with his wishes, Kempinski was buried at Tel Kabri.{{sfnp|Oren|2002b|p=xv}}

Between the major excavations by Kempinski and the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, two separate minor excavations were conducted by Dina Shalem and Howard Smithline. In 1999, Shalem headed up a salvage excavation ahead of a construction project on the Mandate period road running through the tel. Her team worked in Area D and came across EB architecture, as well as some Chalcolithic sherds and a possible surface from that period.{{sfnp|Shalem|2009|pp=19–39}} In 2004, the Israeli telecommunications company, Cellcom, was laying down new telephone cable near Area E, and Smithline was asked to conduct a salvage excavation before the work started. He used this as an opportunity to investigate further the Iron Age aspects of the site. His team did not make any new discoveries, but did add to the collection of Iron Age I (1,200–1,000 BC) and Iron Age II (1,000–586 BC) pottery from the site.{{sfnp|Smithline|2007}}

In 2003, former Tel Kabri Expedition excavator, Assaf Yasur-Landau,{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=34}} and geophysicist, Yitzhach Makovsky, both then of Tel Aviv University, conducted an investigation to see if Kempinski and Niemeier had underestimated the size of the palace at Tel Kabri. They conducted [[Electrical resistivity tomography|electric resistivity]] and [[Magnetic survey (archaeology)|magnetometric]] soundings in an attempt to map out the architectural features under the soil without having to dig trenches. Their findings showed that the palace was indeed larger than previously thought.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|pp=67-68}} With these results, Yasur-Landau approached his former [[Tel Megiddo#Archaeology|Megiddo Expedition]] colleague, Prof. [[Eric H. Cline]] of [[The George Washington University]], the following year and asked whether he would like to co-direct new excavations at Tel Kabri. After devoting a year to getting the necessary funding and permits for excavation, the two were able to begin work on the site in the summer of 2005.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|pp=34-36}}

Since 2005, the renewed excavations have been conducted by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, an international team co-directed by Yasur-Landau, now of the Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at the [[University of Haifa]], Cline on behalf of The George Washington University, and Prof. Andrew Koh of [[Brandeis University]], which officially joined the consortium in 2013.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=1}} The majority of these excavation seasons have taken place at the MB palaces in Area D of the tel,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|pp=70–75}} and, since 2009, have been semi-annual.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=1}}

The first four seasons at Tel Kabri were dedicated to investigating the site's potential for future large-scale excavation. As a result, the 2005 season was exploratory in nature, featuring assessment of the site and minor excavations to determine the viability of conducting future work at the site.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=1}}During the course of the season, additional palatial architecture was uncovered, and the palace was found to be twice as large as previously thought by Kempinski, thus confirming the results of the 2003 soundings by Yasur-Landau and Makovsky.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|p=68}}  Along with this, another structure – possibly communal or another palace – was discovered below the MB II palace.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=1}} It was during the 2005 season that the first find of a gold artefact at Kabri was made.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=3}}

The team also found that in the time between the end of Kempinski's excavations and the start of the new expedition, there had been significant damage done to the site by the elements. The most apparent example of this was the [[geotextile]] that had been placed by Kempinski to cover the painted plaster floor in the palace hall.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=5}} Since 1993, the geotextile had bonded to the plaster, and this made it impossible to remove the geotextile without destroying the floor. As a result of this, much of the work done in the 2005 season was also conservation work.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|pp=5–6}}

The following 2006 season was a series of surveys of the region around Kabri. The goals of this season were only partially fulfilled during the original timeframe though, as the 2006 season coincided with the [[2006 Lebanon War]].{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=1}} The team was able to survey MB II sites in the area around the site and see how they would have interacted with Kabri in that time period. However, as a result of the war, they had to postpone any aerial photography of the tel – by order of the [[Israeli Air Force]] – and access to the pottery from previous excavations – held in the IAA storerooms at Kibbutz [[Beit HaEmek]] – was restricted for the duration of the war.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=1}} In that time period, the IAA did allow the team to remove the relevant pottery from Beit HaEmek{{efn|1= This was a result of Beit HaEmek being under continuous bombardment.}}  to Tel Aviv for study, where the pottery could also be kept safe.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=4}} The team had to wait until mid-September to achieve its goals fully. As a result of the dangers posed by the rockets from the north,{{efn|1= Six rockets struck the tel and one rocket hit the kibbutz itself.}}  some members of the team had to return to their home countries, without completing their work.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=1}}

The 2007 season was partly devoted to finishing the work that had to be halted in the 2006 season, as well as preparing the site for excavation the following season.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2007|p=1}} Through comparative studies of pottery, the team was able to map out Kabri's rise to regional power in the MB II.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2007|p=3}} The architecture of the palace was mapped out using a [[total station]], and a digital topographic map was made of the tel using aerial photography and measurements on the ground.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2007|p=5}}

The 2008 season saw a return to excavation at the site, with a focus on the palace in Area D that had been discovered by Kempinski. The team wanted to go deeper and explore the possibility of there being a palace beneath the one Kempinski found.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2008|p=2}} They managed to get a clearer picture of the entire MB palatial area up to the 1600s BC destruction, and recovered further wall plaster fragments. The structure underneath the MB II palace was determined most likely to be a palace itself, and further fragments of Aegean wall frescos and imported pottery were found, allowing the excavators to push back the time for contact with the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]] and [[Alashiya|Cyprus]] to the MB I period.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2008|p=8}} At the close of the dig season, the site was covered up to preserve it in the off-season.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2008|p=9}}

2009 was the first year of large-scale excavation by the expedition, and the first year that the system of semi-annual excavation – with the off-years devoted to data-processing – was implemented and was in use as of the 2013 season.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=1}} The 2009 season was also the only year that two separate seasons of excavations were conducted: a summer large-scale excavation, and a winter minor excavation. During the summer season of 2009, additional Aegean style frescoes were found at the site. In Area D-West, the northern bounds of the palace were successfully determined,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=2}} and a corridor was discovered that held restorable pottery.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|pp=4–5}} During the winter season, the corridor in D-West was revisited, so that its use could be determined.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|pp=1–2}} As a result of these excavations, the date for the construction of the earliest palace was revised and estimated to be in the MB I period in the 1800s BC, making the palace at Kabri one of the oldest palaces in Canaan.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}}

[[File:Tell Kabri (4).JPG|thumb|2011 excavations in Area D South-1]]
The main finds of the 2011 season included an [[orthostat]] building close to the palace, further pieces of painted plaster,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|p=1}} and a scarab of the [[Second Intermediate Period]].{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|p=4}}

Andrew Koh, and students from Brandeis University, were responsible for doing the residue analysis on the wine jars in the storage room, which led to the room's identification as a wine cellar.}}]]
During the 2013 season, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project discovered the first known complete MB storage room in Canaan.{{sfnp|Wiener|2013b}} On 22 November 2013, the team announced that this storage room had been found to be the oldest palatial [[wine cellar]] in the Ancient Near East, with 40 large ceramic jars, totalling 2,000 litres in capacity,{{efn|1= The equivalent of 3,000 750ml [[Wine bottle size|standard wine bottles]].}}  containing traces of wine dating to 1700 BC.{{sfnp|Wilford|2013}} During the latter half of the season, the dig shifted its focus to Area D-West, where the wine cellar was located. To speed up the process of uncovering the vessels in the wine cellar, for part of the time, the team adopted the atypical practice of working in morning and afternoon shifts of 05:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 19:00, respectively,{{sfnp|Ingeno|2015|p=51}} almost exclusively in Area D-West.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=6}}{{efn|1= Near Eastern summer archaeological digs typically dig in the morning only so as to avoid the afternoon heat. Exceptions are made when time is a constraint or the collecting of artefacts is urgent.{{sfnp|Ingeno|2015|p=51}}}} Prior to the actual removal of the vessels, [[LiDAR]] work was done on the site, for the first time, in this area.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=2,6}} Near the end of the season, red plaster fragments were discovered while the area was being cleaned.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=6}} However, the finds were not restricted to Area D-West. In Area D-South, a deposit was discovered that held additional pieces of wall plaster.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=6}} In Area D-West-East, the area of D-North was linked up with the areas excavated by Kempinski, thus unifying the whole area from D-North to D-West, exposing further architecture,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=7,10}} and bringing the estimate of the size of the palace to approximately {{convert|6000|m2|abbr=on}}.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=10}} As a result of the discovery of two doorways in D-West at the end of the 2013 season, part of the 2015 season will be devoted to exploring where – and to what – these doorways lead.{{sfnp|Lopatto|2013}}

==Site reports==
Below are the site reports that could be located for the archaeological work at Tel Kabri. They have been arranged chronologically, with internet links where available, for reference.

The reports for the 1957–1958, 1975–1976, 1999, and 2004 excavations were all published in journals, some in English and some in Hebrew. It was not until the Tel Kabri Expedition of Tel Aviv University under Kempinski that stand-alone excavation reports for Tel Kabri were published, and then Kempinski made sure to publish a report for each year – a practice that has continued with the ongoing excavations by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project of The George Washington University and the University of Haifa. Reports for the 1969 survey could not be located.

'''''The Flight from Woman''''' is a book by psychiatrist [[Karl Stern]], first published in 1965 by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]. It is described as a study of the polarity of the sexes as reflected in the conflict between two modes of knowledge - scientific or rational, as contrasted with intuitive or poetic. In the course of exploring this theme Stern undertakes to provide psychological portraits of six representative figures whose thought and work have influenced modern man: Descartes, Goethe, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Tolstoy, and Sartre.

==Lyrics==

The song is about a dream, set in the then future year of 1953, where a veteran of [[World War I]] reflects on the year 1917 when various military troops defeated [[Wilhelm II of Germany]]. It turns out this was the dream of a school boy, day dreaming in class, who learns that Germany now no longer exists because it was wiped out during [[World War I]] (a conflict which still had to end at the time this song was recorded).

LYRICS:

I dreamed of a scene in an old soldier's home, 
The year was nineteen fifty three. 
With medals galore that he'd won in this war, 
He sat smoking peacefully. 
Tell me of the war of nineteen seventeen, 
Said his grandson who stood by his side. 
How did they fix up that terrible mix up?
And proudly the old man replied:

My dream quickly changed to a schoolroom that day, 
The lesson was geography. 
A child raised her hand, said, "I don't understand, 
This map looks all wrong to me. 
What is this strange place that is marked Germany?" 
And the teacher replied with a roar. 
"Why, that's an old map, dear since we had that scrap, dear, 
There ain't no such place anymore.

The Russians were rushin' the Prussians, 
The Prussians were crushin' the Russians. 
The Balkins were balkin' and Turkey was squawkin' 
[[Rasputin]] disputtin' and Italy scootin'
The Boches all bulled [[bolshevik]]is 
The British were skittish at sea. 
But the good Lord I'm thankin' 
The Yanks started yankin', 
And yanked [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Bill]] up a tree.

The Russians were rushin' the Prussians, 
The Prussians were crushin' the Russians. 
The good old Italians were hurling battalions 
Canadians raidin' and Frenchmen invadin'
The Bulgars were bulgin' the Belgians 
But Yanks started yankin' you see. 
And when Peace was conceded, 
Some new maps were needed, 
They ruined the geography.

Barnacle was active in the [[trade unions]] from the 1860s to the 1890s. Though [[illiterate]], he had a trade as a well-skilled [[baker]]—the family line of work—and was much in demand till the end of his life. He often freelanced beyond the town in such places as [[Oughterard]].

He married Annie Honoria Healy in 1881 and they had children Mary, Nora, Bridget (known as Delia), Thomas, and Kathleen (born 1896). One other boy died in infancy, and two other daughters are known to have been born to the couple.

Thomas and Annie moved house some seven times by 1904, all in lowly working-class districts of Galway such as Newtownsmyth, Raleigh Row, and Abbeygate Street, before eventually settling at number 8 (now number 4) Bowling Green, an L-shaped street below the church of [[St. Nicholas]].

Sometime around 1896, Annie threw Thomas out of the house due to his severe drinking which had led to the loss of his bakery shop. However, he remained in demand as a [[journeyman]] baker.

While his son-in-law [[James Joyce]] (who never met him) depicted him as rough, irresponsible man, Thomas himself was very well liked by all who knew him, and was remembered very fondly by his daughter Nora. Many years later, Nora wrote to her sister Kathleen, of Joyce: ''"He's a weakling, Kathleen. I always have to be after his tail. I wish I was married to a man like my father."'' Nora Barnacle's Galway [[biographer]], Padriag Ó Laoi noted him as a genial man of five foot nine, good humored and an excellent storyteller and stated that ''"True, he took a drink, but he never disgraced his family".''

Barnacle died in 1921, having been nursed during his illness by his estranged wife, Annie.

'''''Vorhor, the Green Wave''''' is one of the most famous paintings by [[France|French]] artist [[Georges Lacombe (painter)|Georges Lacombe]]. It is currently located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georges Lacombe|url=http://www.artlikbez.com/Artist/Georges-Lacombe/d3412a903cbffef0632ed6de73135e9a/georges-lacombe.html?lang=en|publisher=Artlikbez|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painted 1896-97, Lacombe used egg tempera and the inspiration of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese prints]] to depict the cliffs of Vorhor in [[Brittany]].&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

==Description==
North of [[Pont-Aven]], Lacombe found this dramatic crag overlooking the sea and rendered it even more spectacular with vivid hues of turquoise, mauve, and gold. He also anthropomorphized the rocks, finding human shapes in them, and transformed the waves into decorative patterns similar to Japanese prints.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The back of the canvas bears an atelier monogram.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

==Historical information==
In 1892, Lacombe first encountered [[Post-Impressionism]], and was immediately smitten. He fully embraced [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin's]] insistence that artists be allowed to reinterpret nature when creating a series of coastal paintings between 1893 and 1897. The influence of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] on Lacombe can be seen in the foreboding with which he imbued the narrow gap and pounding waves.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
Sylvie Mora-Lacombe inherited the painting upon her father's death. It was purchased by the IMA in 1984 with the assistance of the  Alliance of the Indianapolis Museum of Art, where it was given the acquisition number 1984.202.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Vorhor, the Green Wave|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/vorhor-green-wave-lacombe-georges|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wendy Tilby''' and '''Amanda Forbis''' are a Canadian [[animation]] duo. On January 24, 2012, they received their second [[Academy Award]] nomination, for the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) animated short film, ''[[Wild Life (2011 film)|Wild Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/oscars/nominations/&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to writing and directing the film, Forbis and Tilby drew and painted every [[animation frame]] in [[guache]], and wrote the lyrics for the film's final song. They were only able to work on ''Wild Life'' [[part-time]], due to commercial obligations, and the film is reported to have taken them from six to over seven years, from concept to completion.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Jamie|title=Edmonton producer's film Wild Life off to the Oscars|url=https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Edmonton+producer+film+Wild+Life+Oscars/6194423/story.html|accessdate=24 February 2012|newspaper=[[Edmonton Journal]]|date=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dixonfeb24&gt;{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Guy|title=Oscar-nominated NFB animators draw on tradition|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/awards/academy-awards/oscar-nominated-nfb-animators-draw-on-tradition/article2349142/|accessdate=26 February 2012|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both originally from Alberta, they first met in Vancouver at the Emily Carr College of Art and Design. In 2003, they relocated from Montreal to Calgary, where Forbis was raised. In addition to their NFB work, they have collaborated on workshops and commercials,&lt;ref name=telefilminterview&gt;{{cite web|title=Amanda Forbis &amp; Wendy Tilby|url=http://www2.telefilm.gc.ca/05/516/Cannes/2011/not-short-on-talent.php?id=498|work=Cannes 11|publisher=[[Telefilm Canada]]|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Acme Filmworks]] on major [[ad campaign]]s, most notably for [[United Airlines]].&lt;ref name=Dixonfeb24/&gt; In 2007, they founded the Bleak Midwinter Film Festival in their home neighbourhood of [[Inglewood, Calgary]].&lt;ref name=bleak&gt;{{cite news|title=Bleak Midwinter Film Festival|url=https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/Bleak+Midwinter+Film+Festival/6167641/story.html|accessdate=17 February 2012|newspaper=[[Calgary Herald]]|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal lives ==

=== Wendy Tilby ===
Wendy Tilby was born in 1960 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Tilby studied visual arts and literature at the [[University of Victoria]] before studying film and animation at the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]], where she met Forbis. Tilby used to teach animation at [[Harvard]] and [[Concordia University]]. Tilby was also external examiner for animation at the [[Royal College of Art]] in London from 2007-2009.&lt;ref name="tilbyforbis.com"&gt;http://www.tilbyforbis.com/bio-contact/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amanda Forbis===
Amanda Forbis attended the [[University of Lethbridge]] as well as the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design. Like Tilby, she went on from the Emily Carr Institute to complete animation work for the National Film Board of Canada on the 1995  short ''The Reluctant Deckhand''. Forbis has also worked as an instructor at the Arts Umbrella Children's Art Centre in Vancouver, as well as leading many animation workshops for children.&lt;ref name="tilbyforbis.com"/&gt;

==Animation Styles==

===''[[Strings (1991 film)|Strings]]''===
This film was not a collaboration between Tilby and Forbis, it was only worked on by Tilby. The animation style used is reminiscent of [[Caroline Leaf|Caroline Leaf's]] method of painting on frosted glass, used in her 1976 short film, ''[[The Street (film)|The Street]]''. However, Tilby used bottom-lighting in her film, instead of top lighting like Caroline Leaf. She used an animation camera apparatus and worked directly under the camera, she applied, moved, and removed the colored paints on the glass until the frame was finished. When the frame was complete she took two frames worth of footage from the overhead camera. Then she would modify the image to make the next frame, and repeat the process. 
To make details on the characters' faces and in their body language Tilby used a stylus and scratched details into the paint. She also used her fingers, q-tips, and tissues to move the paint around the glass and change the scene. Tilby enjoys using this method because the artist erases the previous work as they go, and it forces her not to dwell on what she has already shot and keep going with the filming.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. W. (1991). CANADIAN PRESERVE FOR AN ENDANGERED SPECIES: THE FREE ANIMATOR. Post Script, 10(3), 13-29&lt;/ref&gt;

===''[[When the Day Breaks]]''===
This film was co-directed by Tilby and Forbis and was made using a new animation technique that they designed. The duo used a [[Hi-8]] video camera and shot real life scenes of people and objects, the film focuses in on many mundane inanimate objects, and other things that they thought they might include. They then printed stills from these scenes on a video printer attached to a [[VCR]] as three by four inch images that they enlarged slightly. They then would take these stills and draw on them. This technique was designed to save time, however, the film took about four years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;http://takeone.athabascau.ca/index.php/takeone/article/viewFile/639/630&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wild Life''===
In the making of ''Wild Life'' Tilby and Forbis experimented with many different techniques for animation. They wanted to find a technique that would save them some time, the last film they had made took them four years. However, they also wanted to make sure their technique allowed them to get the look and style that they wanted for their film. They tried many computer drawing and hybrid techniques in an effort to save time, however, they eventually found that the computer drawing wouldn't work, as the effect was too clean and it didn't seem right for this film. They decided to print their images onto paper and use [[gouache]] painting. They then scanned these images onto the computer and would sometimes do some composting on some of the images. This process ended up taking about seven years, however, they achieved the texture and style that they wanted to with the film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.awn.com/animationworld/oscar-2012-wendy-tilby-and-amanda-forbis-talk-wild-life&lt;/ref&gt;
