'''Ain-manés''' are the ancestral homes of the native communities in [[Kodagu]], and have an important role in their socio-cultural traditions. Each ainmané belongs to an okka (matrilineal clan) that is identified. The traditional ainmanés of Koḍagu have a unique architectural style. Those that are still standing today generally date from about 150 to 450 years ago, and have evolved from the simple balyamanés of earlier times. Currently there are about 1720 okkas in Koḍagu (including about 1040 [[Kodava people|Kodava]], 320 Gowda and 360 okkas of other communities). Nearly 60% of them no longer have traditional ainmanés.&lt;ref name=Ainmanes&gt;{{cite web|title=Ainmanes|url=http://ainmanes.com/|publisher=Chinshai technologies|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The people Kodagu are Hindus; they believe in reincarnation, revere the cow and originally worshipped the natural elements (revering the Sun, the Moon, the Earth, water and fire) and their ancestors. The reverence of various spirits in addition to the established gods of Hinduism is also part of their religion. Each village had a Bhagwathi ([[Mahalakshmi]]) temple, each lane had a snake deity and each nad(region) had an [[Ayyappa|Aiyappa]] temple. The people worshipped Mahadeva as well. Comparatively liberal in their beliefs, the consumption of soma and pork is permitted during their ceremonies (except during Kaveri Sankramana when they have to be on a vegetarian, non-alcoholic diet). However like other Hindus, the consumption of beef is strictly prohibited. They maintained sacred groves on their public village lands from ancient times, hunting was prohibited in these woods called the Devakadu. They believe in astrology as well. Generally they didn't follow idol worship but believed in nature worship.

People settlements in Coorg are in the form of Okka family groups that are scattered across agricultural and forested holdings, where traditional ainemane houses form focal meeting points in the rural landscape. It is a joint patrilineal clan with males of common ancestry. The male members of an okka share an okka name. Currently there are about 1000 okka names and families in Kodagu. Traditionally all the members of an okka lived in a large ancestral Ainemane house (ayyangada mane&amp;nbsp;– House of the Elders). The emergence of townships, as such, has been a relatively recent phenomenon and many of the main towns in Kodagu are inhabited by recent migrants. This cluster of homes and property form the nucleus of a village called ur.

The spirits of departed souls who were prominent figures in the community and had done good deeds while they were alive were worshipped. These spirit gods do not have a set form of physical representation. Symbolically a piece of rock is sanctified and considered as such a spirit deity. The founder of each clan (Okka), the Guru Karana, is worshipped by the members of that particular clan. On their ancestral clan lands the have a shrine ('''Kaimada'''), which is the shrine of the clan's first ancestor (Guru Karana), where they offer prayers and obeisance. A number of weapons, made of wood or metal, are kept in the Kaimadas. The shrine is usually made of clay or wood or covered with sheet metal, and housed within a roofed structure built near the entrance to the ain-mane. Sometimes it is simply located on a platform under a sap-exuding tree near the entrance of ainemane. Some clans conduct a karana kola, a dance of the ancestral spirit during which a Malayalee migrant dresses in elaborate colourful clothing and dances in a trance and acts as an oracle. During this ceremony he is symbolically possessed by the karana, the original founder of the particular clan. In every home a lamp called '''Nellakki Deepa''' is lit in honour of the Guru Karana. The lamp in the central hall is lit by the embers of the kitchen hearth every day. Fire of the kitchen hearth is especially sacred.

On the day of '''Huttari''' (the rice harvest festival celebrated in around November–December), the whole family assembles in their ain mane (the common family house), which is decorated with flowers and green mango and banana leaves. Specific foods are prepared: thambuttu, puttari, kari and poli poli. Then the eldest member of the family hands a sickle to the head of the family and one of the women leads a procession to the paddy fields with a lit lamp in her hands. The path leading to the field is decorated. A gunshot is fired to mark the beginning of the harvest, with chanting of "Poli Poli Deva" (prosperity) by all present. Then the symbolic harvesting of the crop begins. The rice is cut and stacked and tied in odd numbers and is carried home to be offered to the gods. The younger generation then lite fire crackers and revel, symbolising prosperity. Groups of youngsters visit neighbouring houses and show off their dancing skills and are given monetary gifts. A week later, this money is pooled and the entire village celebrates a communal dinner. All family members gather for this meal.

==The Pattole Palame Connection==

The ''Pattole Palame'' was written using the Kannada script originally; it has been translated into English by [[Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa]], grandchildren of [[Nadikerianda Chinnappa]], and has been published by Rupa &amp; Co., New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books: Pattole Palame ~ A love song to Kodagu|url=http://mulledink.blogspot.in/2012/05/books-pattole-palame-love-song-to.html|publisher=Google blogger - Aditi De|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translators’ introduction explains: “Since the Kodava language does not have a script, he used the Kannada script that has been in vogue since the 17th century, when the Lingayat Rajas ruled Kodagu and Kannada was their court language.”

Nadikerianda Chinnappa had begun translating the work into English in 1925 but he died in 1931, before he could complete it. Chinnappa's daughter married into the Boverianda clan. His son and daughter-in-law were both teachers. Their daughter Nanjamma and Chinnappa's daughter's son, also called Chinnappa, cross-cousins, got married. Boverianda Chinnappa, an engineer with a degree from an Illinois university, and Nanjamma, a statistician who was a visiting fellow at Cambridge University in 1974, pursued their professions at Chennai, Kolkata and Canada. In the 1970s, Boverianda Chinnappa, Nanjamma's mother and Nanjamma began to copy out the Pattole Palome in longhand over almost three years.&lt;ref name="It's story time, folks"&gt;{{cite web|title=It's story time, folks|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2003/10/16/stories/2003101600630300.htm|publisher=The Hindu newspaper|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While they were searching for copies of the original edition of the [[Pattole Palome]], a ninety-year-old farmer and self-taught folk artist, Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, responded to their advertisement. During his youth unable to afford the book he had copied out the entire text word by word under a kerosene lamp. This hardcover book he gifted to the Chinnappas. Nanjamma's parents assisted in translating and interpreting the text. In the second edition of ‘Pattole Palame” (or ‘Silken Lore’), published by the University of Mysore in 1975, the editor describes it as one of the earliest extensive collections of folklore from any Indian community.&lt;ref name="It's story time, folks"/&gt;  

After retirement they settled down in Bangalore in 1995 and began to realise his cherished dream. Finally in 2003, they completed the work and it has been published by Rupa &amp; Co., New Delhi. That same year it was released in Madikeri (Mercara). This book has become the chief text for the Coorgs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Book Review: Pattole Palame: Kodava Culture - Folksongs and Traditions |author= M N Venkatesha|url=https://indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/IFRJ/article/view/182/189|journal=Indian Folklore Research Journal|volume=1|issue=4|year=2004|pages=124-129|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa]] have chalked out at least ten Kodagu-based projects for the future, including a directory of aine mane or ancestral homes, a lexicon of the Kodava language and a biography of the late Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, a self-taught folk artist. Presently they have been working on the ainemane project, this can be found on the '''Ainmanes''' website.&lt;ref name="Ainmanes"/&gt;

==The Ainmanes Project==
[[File:Nalaknad_(6).jpg|thumb|[[Nalknad Palace|Nalnad Palace]] built in the style of an Ainmane]]{{coord|12|14|34.8|N|75|42|5.8|E|region:IN|display=title}}

Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa had undertaken a project to collect information regarding each and every Ainmane found in Kodagu, irrespective of the community or caste of the clan members residing in them. They visited many of them in the period between April 2003 and May 2008. They also collected oral legends and traditional information from the occupants of each of these functional Ainemanes. Along with this they also researched about the concerned clans from previously published written material, wherever possible. The information thus collected are now available on the Ainmanes website. They have also provided a glossary for the Kodava thakk words used in the site. The couple are currently working on a book “Ainmanés of Koḍagu” that will give an overview of the ancestral homes of Koḍagu and of their socio-cultural significance.

The objective of this web-site is to document the current status of the traditional ainmanés of all the communities in Koḍagu and thereby contribute to the archival records of the heritage and oralhistory of the people of Koḍagu. It provides insights into the social and religious customs and conventions of the communities in Kodagu and the way of life of the people. It will also serve to raise awareness of the value of these buildings and the need to preserve them, besides providing information for those studying the socio-cultural-architectural heritage of Kodagu.This web-site contains information on all the traditional ainmanés in Koḍagu that were functional when the Chinnappas visited them. It includes photographs and information on each ainmané and its okka. The information was collected from members of the okka present in the ainmané during the visits and from those contacted later by telephone. Where available, information was added from published articles and books.&lt;ref name="Ainmanes"/&gt;
 
Every ainmané in the web-site is identified by its mané péda, the village where it is located and the community to which it belongs. Entering the mané péda of the okka in the ‘Search window’ allows the user to retrieve the photos  and information on the ainmané and the okka. A table listing the okkas visited in alphabetical order of their mané pédas along with the names of the villages where their ainmanés are located and the communities that the okkas belong to is provided. Similar tables in alphabetical order of village names and by community are also provided. Also included are sketch maps of Kodagu (in 9 sections) that show the location of each ainmané. The ainmanés are identified by numbers on the maps, and the index gives their mané pédas. A glossary gives the meanings of words in Koḍava language that are in the web-site. Accent marks in the glossary and the key to the transliteration provides a guide to the reader on the correct pronunciation of these words. The stories collected from the informants are oral narratives.&lt;ref name="Ainmanes"/&gt; 

==Ainmanes of Kodagu (Book)==
In 2014, Niyogi books has published their work titled 'Ainmanes of Kodagu'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bopanna|first1=P T|title=KODAGU AINMANES BOOK HITS THE STANDS|url=http://www.coorgtourisminfo.com/coorg_news.php|website=Coorg Tourism Info|publisher=Bopanna|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Leonidovich Dvorkin''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Леонидович Дворкин}}; born 20 August 1955 in [[Moscow]]) is a Russian [[medieval historian]], [[Eastern Orthodox theology|orthodox theologian]] and [[Anti-cult movement|anti-cult activist]].

==Biography==
Dvorkin was born in Moscow. He received his secondary education at schools No. 25, 91 and 112 in Moscow. After graduation from grade 10, in 1972, he entered the [[Moscow State Pedagogical University|Moscow Pedagogical Institute]] at the Faculty of Russian Language and Literature. During his studies he joined the hippy movement. Dvorkin sets out two completely different versions of deductions from the institute. According to the book "Teachers and lessons: memories, stories, reflections" ({{lang-ru|"Учителя и уроки: воспоминания, рассказы, размышления"}}), together with the like-minded people, he prepared a work that was demonstrated on September 20, 1975 at an exhibition of avant-garde artists in one of the pavilions of the [[VDNKh (Russia)|VDNKh]]; about this work and its authors — a group of hippies called "Hair", to which Alexander Dvorkin was close, — American magazine "Time" positively responded; as a consequence, in the autumn of 1975, Alexander Dvorkin was expelled from the third year of the institute "for believers incompatible with those that should be in the future Soviet teacher"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Учителя и уроки: воспоминания, рассказы, размышления |author=Дворкин А.

According to the book "My America" ({{lang-ru|"Моя Америка"}}), he was not admitted to the fifth examination session and was expelled from the institute for poor academic performance and non-attendance in early 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Моя Америка: автобиографический роман в двух книгах с прологом и двумя эпилогами |author=Дворкин А.

He did not go to Israel, but went to the USA. He worked as a courier, waiter, copyist. In 1978, Dvorkin became a student at the [[Hunter College]], where he continued to study Russian literature. Dvorkin was baptized in the New York church of Christ the Savior of the Orthodox Church in America on January 19, 1980. Dvorkin graduated as Bachelor of Arts in Russian Literature in 1980 at [[Hunter College]] in 1980. In 1980, he became a student of the St. Vladimir Orthodox Theological Seminary of the OCA in New York. Dvorkin graduated as [[Master of Divinity]] in 1983 at the [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]] in [[Crestwood, New York]]. In 1984, Dvorkin received American citizenship. In 1984, he enrolled in doctoral studies at the Department of Medieval History at [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities|Jesuit-affiliated]] [[independent school]] — [[Fordham University]]. Dvorkin graduated as [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[Medieval studies]] in 1988 at [[Fordham University]] (thesis "Ivan the Terrible as a Religious Type"; his mentor was [[John Meyendorff]]). In late 1988, Dvorkin moved to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], where he worked at the bureau of the [[Voice of America]] radio station. At the same time, he became the subdeacon and [[altar server]] of bishop  [[:ru:Василий (Родзянко)|Vasily Rodzianko]] in the Washington [[St. Nicholas Cathedral (Washington, D.C.)|St. Nicholas Cathedral]]. In 1991, Dvorkin moved to Germany and started working for [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]]. December 31, 1991 Dvorkin returned to Russia. He has appeared countless times on Russian television and many times on television in various Eastern-European countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rutube.ru/tracks/1848731.html For example his appearance in TV-program "National Interest"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119042020/http://rutube.ru/tracks/1848731.html |date=19 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has authored 16 books (on various cults, on Church history as well as autobiographical prose) and edited 3 more. The number of his publications and interviews (translated into 16 languages) exceeds 1000.

He is president of the Saint Ireneus of Lyons Informational Consultative Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, morality, and community in post-Soviet societies |authorlink=Mark D. Steinberg |last=Steinberg |first=Mark D. |author2=Catherine Wanner |page=300 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=978-0-253-22038-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an anti-cult organisation registered in the [[Russian Federation]] as non-religious [[NGO]], 
and since 2009 Vice-President of the [[European Federation of Centres of Research and Information on Sectarianism]]&amp;nbsp;(FECRIS), an umbrella organization for anti-cult groups in Europe.&lt;ref name="FECase"&gt;[[Régis Dericquebourg]], [http://www.hrwf.net/images/reports/2012/2012fecrisbook.pdf "FECRIS: European Federation of Research and Information Centers on Sectarianism"], in ''Freedom of Religion or Belief — Anti-Sect Movements and State Neutrality — A Case Study: FECRIS'', special issue of ''Religion – Staat – Gesellschaft: Zeitschrift für Glaubensformen und Weltanschauungen'' (''Journal for the Study of Beliefs and Worldviews'', {{ISSN|1438-955X}}), 2012/2, p.188–189, {{ISBN|978-3-643-99864-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dvorkin is on the board of the Europe-wide counter-cult agency FECRIS. He is a professor of Church History and Cultic Studies at [[Saint Tikhon's Orthodox University]], Moscow, Russia.

==Anti-cult activism==
In 1993, with the blessing of [[Alexy II of Moscow|Patriarch Alexy II]], he established a Russian anti-cult organization currently called Association of Centres for the Study of Religions and Sects (RATsIRS). From that time on he has been extremely active in opposing cults and new religious movements through his publications.&lt;ref name="FECase" /&gt;

Dvorkin is a critic of [[Scientology]], which he regards as a dangerous cult. Church of Scientology-affiliated organizations describe him as an "anti-religious extremist", and compile negative information about him on their websites. In 1997, Scientology and several other [[new religious movement]]s sued Dvorkin and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] for defamation, but their case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chercheurs de dieux dans l'espace public |last=Côté |first=Pauline |pages=157–158 |year=2001 |publisher=[[University of Ottawa Press]] |isbn=978-2-7603-0535-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dvorkin has claimed that the followers of [[Nikolai Rerikh]] as well as Jehovah's Witnesses, Scientology, Hare Krishnas, Neo-Pagans, Neo-Pentecostals, and many others are "totalitarian cults".&lt;ref name="Открытое письмо"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Савенко|first=Юрий|script-title=ru:Открытое письмо Президенту Российской Федерации  Д.А.

Dvorkin supports himself and his family by teaching, but dedicates at least half of his working time to helping those harmed by cults. He travels regularly throughout Russia and Eastern Europe, running seminars and conferences.

'''Andrew "bunnie" Huang''' (born 1975) is an American researcher and [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/30/green_asks_protection_from_dmca_lawsuits/|title=Crypto guru Matt Green asks courts for DMCA force field so he can safely write a textbook|last=Thomson|first=Iain|date=30 September 2016|website=[[The Register]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-09|last2=Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt; who holds a Ph.D in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and is the author of the freely available 2003 book ''Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering''. As of 2012 he resides in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousprototypes.com/2012/08/23/workshop-video-36-beers-in-bunnies-workshop/|title=Workshop Video #36: Beers in Bunnie’s Workshop|last=Lesnet|first=Ian|date=2012-08-23|website=Dangerous Prototypes|publisher=|access-date=|author=|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Huang attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1992, earning a Ph.D in electrical engineering in 2002.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://makezine.com/2012/04/30/makes-exclusive-interview-with-andrew-bunnie-huang-the-end-of-chumby-new-adventures/|title=MAKE's Exclusive Interview with Andrew (bunnie) Huang - The End of Chumby, New Adventures {{!}} Make:|last=Torrone|first=Phillip|date=2012-04-30|website=[[Make (magazine)|Make]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that he had 'flipped a coin' to determine whether to pursue biology or electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theblueprint.com/stories/andrew-huang/|title=An interview with Andrew Huang|last=|first=|date=|website=The Blueprint|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huang is also a member of the [[Zeta Beta Tau]] fraternity.

The nickname bunnie is short for vorpalbunnie, a reference to the creature in both [[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]] and [[Moria (video game)|Moria]], that he used as a [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] screen name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://features.slashdot.org/story/14/08/21/0334254/interviews-andrew-bunnie-huang-answers-your-questions|title=Interviews: Andrew "bunnie" Huang Answers Your Questions - Slashdot|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Slashdot]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
Huang was the hardware lead at [[Chumby]]; his responsibilities included the design and production of Chumby devices, as well as the strategic planning and ecosystem development of the broader Chumby hardware platform. 

He has completed several major projects, ranging from hacking the [[Xbox]], to designing the world's first fully integrated photonic-silicon chips running at 10 Gbit/s with [[Luxtera|Luxtera, Inc.]], to building some of the first prototype hardware for silicon nanowire device research with Caltech. Huang has also participated in the design of [[wireless]] transceivers for use in [[802.11b]] and [[Bluetooth]] networks with [[Mobilian Corporation|Mobilian]], graphics chips at Silicon Graphics, [[digital cinema]] [[codec]]s at [[Qualcomm]], and autonomous robotic submarines during the 1999 competition held by the [[Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International|AUVSI]] that the MIT team won. He is also responsible for the "un-design" of many security systems, with an appetite for the challenge of digesting silicon-based hardware security.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Huang was scheduled to appear as an [[expert witness]] in the trial [[United States v. Crippen]] to determine whether or not [[modding]] an [[Xbox]] violates sections of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kravets|first=David|title=Threat Level Privacy, Crime and Security Online Previous post Next post Prosecutors Seek to Block Xbox Hacking Pioneer From Trial|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/10/xbox-modder-tria/|accessdate=May 1, 2011|newspaper=Wired|date=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dropped suddenly on the third day of trial before the [[jury]] sat by the US federal authorities who had initiated the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kravets|first=David|title=Prosecutors Dismiss Xbox-Modding Case Mid-Trial|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/crippen-dismissed/|accessdate=May 1, 2011|newspaper=Wired|date=December 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed before Huang was called to give testimony.

He also created the [[open hardware]] Safecast Geiger Counter Reference Design, as a volunteer effort in response to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake]], [[tsunami]], and ensuing [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|meltdown of Fukushima Daiichi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2012/03/15/bunnie-huangs-open-geiger-co.html|title=Bunnie Huang's open Geiger counter: design notes and reference|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|date=2012-03-15|website=|publisher=[[Boing Boing]]|access-date=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geigercounter.com/soul-geiger-counter/|title=Inside the Heart and Soul of a new Geiger counter|last=Sythe|first=Dan|date=2012-09-27|website=|publisher=Geiger Counter Bulletin|access-date=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A project in collaboration with Jie Qi of the [[MIT Media Lab]] is Circuit Stickers, a peel-and-stick circuit system for crafting electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crowdsupply.com/chibitronics/circuit-stickers|title=Circuit Stickers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Crowd Supply|access-date=|author=Chibitronics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huang was interviewed on [[David L. Jones (electronics engineer)|Dave Jones]]' ''The Amp Hour'' in episode #84, where he talked about his electronics work in China and reverse engineering.&lt;ref name="AmpHourInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamphour.com/the-amp-hour-84-bunnies-bibelot-bonification/|title=The Amp Hour #84 - An Interview with Bunnie Huang - Bunnie's Bibelot Bonification|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|work=The Amp Hour|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huang is a member of the advisory board for [[Crowd Supply]], the crowdfunding platform that he used for [[Novena_(computing_platform)|Novena]] and ''The Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crowdsupply.com/launch|title=Launch|last=|first=|date=|website=Crowd Supply|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reverse engineering ===
Huang has a long and noted history with the [[reverse engineering]] and [[Hacking of consumer electronics|hacking of consumer products]]. His 2003 publication ''Hacking the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering'' was one of the first published works regarding the reverse engineering of a high end consumer product. He faced significant legal pressure from [[Microsoft]] to not reveal the details of his exploits, and the book itself reveals that he had received a letter from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], where he was at the time a student, informing him of their disavowal of any association with his project. Additionally, his publisher [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] had rescinded their intent to publish the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://cryptome.org/2013/03/hacking-digital-dissidence.pdf|title=Resistance, Liberation Technology and Human Rights in the Digital Age|last=Ziccardi|first=Giovanni|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decapsulated microSD memory card lineup-genuine, questionable, and fake-counterfeit.jpg|thumb|microSD cards: genuine &amp; questionable]]

In part because of this response by MIT to his work, when the Institute was again put at the forefront of controversy in their handling of the criminal prosecution brought against [[Aaron Swartz]], and his subsequent suicide, Huang released the book for free through [[No Starch Press]], remarking that "Without the right to tinker and explore, we risk becoming enslaved by technology; and the more we exercise the right to hack, the harder it will be to take that right away".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/xbox-hacker-bunnie-huang-makes-book-free-in-aaron-swartz-tribute-11273285/|title=Xbox hacker “bunnie” Huang makes book free in Aaron Swartz tribute|date=2013-03-11|website=SlashGear|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nostarch.com/xboxfree|title=An open letter from bunnie, author of Hacking the Xbox|last=Huang|first=Andrew|date=March 2013|website=[[No Starch Press]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Huang worked with a team from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] to develop code that interprets [[printer steganography]] markings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/printers/docucolor/|title=DocuColor Tracking Dot Decoding Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|access-date=|accessdate=2015-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114074339/https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/printers/docucolor/|archive-date=January 14, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huang created the NeTV in 2011, which was the first known public use of the [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP)]] 'master key'. The device uses the master key to implement a video overlay on existing HDCP-protected links, in a fashion which purportedly does not violate the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/16/chumby_nettv_hack/|title=How gizmo maker's hack outflanked copyright trolls|last=Goodin|first=Dan|date=September 16, 2011|work=|newspaper=[[The Register]]|access-date=|via=|accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the hardware and [[firmware]] for the NeTV are openly available under the [[CC-BY-SA]] license.&lt;ref&gt;Source code links at http://kosagi.com/w/index.php?title=NeTV_Main_Page&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also used reverse engineering techniques to reveal why certain [[MicroSD]] cards are poor in quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|title=Sleuthing uncovers the mystery of Kingston MicroSD cards' crappy QA|url=http://boingboing.net/2010/02/16/sleuthing-uncovers-t.html|accessdate=May 1, 2011|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=Feb 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=1022|title=On MicroSD Problems|last=Huang|first=Andrew|date=|work=|newspaper=bunnie's blog|access-date=|via=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, he presented results in collaboration with fellow Singapore developer Sean 'xobs' Cross revealing methods to load arbitrary code into microSD cards via [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] built into the [[embedded controller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Exploration and Exploitation of an SD Memory Card|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPEzLNh5YIo|date=2013-12-29|author=bunnie and xobs|publisher=30c3

On 21 July 2016, Huang and [[Edward Snowden]], in a talk at [[MIT Media Lab]]’s Forbidden Research event, published research for a smartphone case, the so-called ''Introspection Engine'', that would monitor signals received and sent by that phone to provide an alert to the user if their phone is [[Cellphone surveillance|transmitting or receiving information when it shouldn't be]] (for example when it's turned off or in airplane mode), a feature described by Snowden to be useful for journalists or activists operating under hostile governments that would otherwise track their activities through their phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pubpub.org/pub/direct-radio-introspection|title=Against the Law: Countering Lawful Abuses of Digital Surveillance|last=Snowden|first=Edward|last2=Huang|first2=Andrew (bunnie)|date=2016-07-21|website=|publisher=PubPub|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/07/21/edward-snowdens-new-research-aims-to-keep-smartphones-from-betraying-their-owners/|title=Edward Snowden’s New Research Aims to Keep Smartphones From Betraying Their Owners|last=Lee|first=Micah|date=2016-07-21|website=The Intercept|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/snowden-designs-device-warn-iphones-radio-snitches/|title=Snowden Designs a Device to Warn if Your iPhone’s Radios Are Snitching|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=|website=|publisher=Wired|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/21/phone-case-privacy-data-monitor-bluetooth-wifi-snowden-introspection-engine|title=Edward Snowden designs phone case to show when data is being monitored|last=Mott|first=Nathaniel|date=2016-07-21|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/07/22/edward-snowden-co-designs-an-iphone-case-that-alerts-user-to-sur/|title=Edward Snowden co-designs an iPhone case that alerts user to surveillance activity|last=Palazzo|first=Chiara|date=|website=|publisher=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Novena ===
[[File:Novena laptop motherboard.jpg|thumb|The [[open-source hardware]] laptop motherboard, [[Novena (computing platform)|Novena]].]]In 2013, Huang announced that he, again in collaboration with Cross, was at work developing a [[laptop]] called the [[Novena (computing platform)|''Novena'']]. The laptop is the first of its kind, in that the hardware and software are entirely [[Open-source model|open]] and only include components where the manufacturing companies do not require [[non-disclosure agreements]] to obtain the documentation necessary for design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Antony Charles Robert Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|FRSA|GCVO|RDI}} (7 March 1930{{snd}}13 January 2017), commonly known as '''Lord Snowdon''', was a British photographer and film-maker. He was the husband of [[Princess Margaret]] and brother-in-law of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].

== Early life ==
Armstrong-Jones was the only son from the marriage of the [[barrister]] [[Ronald Armstrong-Jones]] (1899–1966) and his first wife [[Anne Parsons, Countess of Rosse|Anne Messel]] (later Countess of Rosse; 1902–1992).

During the six months that he was in [[Liverpool Royal Infirmary]] recuperating, his only family visits were from his sister Susan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3554322/Lord-Snowdon-small-in-stature-big-in-bed.html "''Snowdon: the Biography'' by [[Anne de Courcy]], reviewed by Duncan Fallowell"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. 20 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="griceelizabethtelegraph" /&gt;

== Education ==
Armstrong-Jones was educated at two [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent boarding schools]]: firstly at [[Sandroyd School]]&lt;ref name="cathcart60"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cathcart|first1=Helen|title=Lord Snowdon|date=1968|publisher=W.H. Allen|location=London|isbn=978-0491003810|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Wiltshire]] from the autumn term of 1938 to 1943.

Armstrong-Jones attended [[Eton College]], beginning in the [[Michaelmas]] term of 1943.&lt;ref name="cathcart65"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cathcart|first1=Helen|title=Lord Snowdon|date=1968|publisher=W.H. Allen|location=London|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1945, he qualified in the "extra special weight" class of the School Boxing Finals.&lt;ref name="cathcart74"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cathcart|first1=Helen|title=Lord Snowdon|date=1968|publisher=W.H. Allen|location=London|pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to box in 1946, gaining at least two flattering mentions in the ''Eton College Chronicle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coco|first1=Tatiana|title=Lord Snowdon by Helen Cathcart, Chapter 4|url=http://tatianacressidacoco.blogspot.com/2017/11/sambournelinleylives.html|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on holiday at his father's family estate in [[North Wales]] (Plas Dinas), he was stricken with [[poliomyelitis]].&lt;ref name="cathcart69"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cathcart|first1=Helen|title=Lord Snowdon|date=November 1968|publisher=W.H.

He then matriculated at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], where he studied architecture but failed his second-year exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lord Snowdon dies aged 86|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38611497|accessdate=18 January 2017|work=''BBC News''|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[coxswain (rowing)|coxed]] the winning [[Cambridge University Boat Club|Cambridge boat]] in the [[The Boat Race 1950|1950 Boat Race]].&lt;ref&gt;British Rowing Almanack 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
[[File:Earlofsnowdon.jpeg|thumb|left|Armstrong-Jones in 1958, photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]]]]
After university, Armstrong-Jones began a career as a photographer in fashion, design and theatre. His stepmother had a friend who knew [[Baron (photographer)|Baron the photographer]]; Baron visited Armstrong-Jones in his London flat, which doubled as his work studio.&lt;ref name="cathcart82"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cathcart|first1=Helen|title=Lord Snowdon|date=1968|publisher=W.H. Allen|location=London|page=82|edition=Hardback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron, impressed, agreed to bring on Armstrong-Jones as an apprentice, first on a fee-paying basis&lt;ref name="cathcart82" /&gt; but eventually, as his talent and skills became apparent to Baron, as a salaried associate.&lt;ref name="cathcart84"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cathcart|first1=Helen|title=Lord Snowdon|date=1968|publisher=W.H. Allen|location=London|page=84|edition=Hardback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his early commissions were theatrical portraits, often with recommendations from his uncle [[Oliver Messel]], and "society" portraits highly favoured in ''[[Tatler]]'', which, in addition to buying a lot of his photographs, gave him byline credit for the captions.&lt;ref name="helencathcart"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cathcart|first1=Helen|title=Lord Snowdon|date=November 1968|publisher=W.H.

In the early 1960s, Armstrong-Jones became the artistic adviser of ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'', and by the 1970s had established himself as one of Britain's most respected photographers. Though his work included everything from fashion photography to documentary images of inner city life and the mentally ill, he is best known for his portraits of world notables, many of them published in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' magazine.

== Designs and inventions ==
Armstrong-Jones co-designed (in 1963, with [[Frank Newby]] and [[Cedric Price]]) the "Snowdon Aviary" of the [[London Zoo]] (which opened in 1964); he later said it was one of his proudest creations, affectionately calling it the "birdcage".&lt;ref name="griceelizabethtelegraph"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grice|first1=Elizabeth|title=Lord Snowdon: 'Taking photographs is a very nasty thing to do.'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/photography/7368664/Lord-Snowdon-Taking-photographs-is-a-very-nasty-thing-to-do.html|website=The Telegraph (UK) |access-date=25 November 2017 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307050416/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/photography/7368664/Lord-Snowdon-Taking-photographs-is-a-very-nasty-thing-to-do.html |archive-date=7 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a major role in designing the physical arrangements for the [[Investiture of the Prince of Wales|1969 investiture of his nephew]] Prince Charles as [[Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;''Royal'', by [[Robert Lacey]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy and charity==
During his royal marriage, he was patron of the [[National Youth Theatre]], the [[Contemporary Art Society]] for Wales, the [[Theatre of Wales|Welsh Theatre]] Company, and the [[Civic Trust for Wales]].&lt;ref name="helencathcart" /&gt; He was also President of the British [[Theatre Museum]].&lt;ref name="helencathcart" /&gt;

In June 1980 Lord Snowdon started an award scheme for disabled students.&lt;ref name=TimesObituary/&gt; This scheme, administered by the Snowdon Trust, provides grants and scholarships for students with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Snowdon Trust|url=https://www.snowdontrust.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, he served in the capacity of a council member of the Polio Research Fund,&lt;ref name="cathcart70"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cathcart|first1=Helen|title=Lord Snowdon|date=1968|publisher=W.H.

==Personal life==
Snowdon was married twice. He was married first to [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] (1960 to 1978), and second to Lucy Mary Lindsay-Hogg (1978 to 2000).&lt;ref name=telegraph1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/2059552/Lord-Snowdon-his-women-and-his-love-child.html|title=Lord Snowdon, his women, and his love child|date=31 May 2008|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Alderson, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First marriage===
[[File:Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon with Lyndon B. Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson.jpg|thumb|Princess Margaret and the Earl of Snowdon with the United States president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his wife [[Lady Bird Johnson|Lady Bird]] at the [[White House]] on 17 November 1965]]
In February 1960, Snowdon, then known as Antony Armstrong-Jones, became engaged to the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and they married on 6 May 1960 at [[Westminster Abbey]]. The ceremony was the first royal wedding to be broadcast on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1384451/A-captivating-woman-who-was-courted-by-many-suitors-but-failed-to-find-lasting-love.html |title=A captivating woman...|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |author=Caroline Davies|date=10 February 2002 |accessdate=17 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the public enthusiasm, "some critics disapproved of a commoner marrying into the royal family".&lt;ref name="BBC-Wedding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/6/newsid_3993000/3993317.stm|title=1960: Margaret weds Armstrong-Jones|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple made their home in apartments at [[Kensington Palace]]. He was created '''Earl of Snowdon''' and '''Viscount Linley''', of [[Nymans]] in the [[County of Sussex]], on 6 October 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=42481 |date=6 October 1961 |page=7199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children: [[David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon|David, 2nd Earl of Snowdon]], born 3 November 1961, and [[Lady Sarah Chatto|Lady Sarah]], born 1 May 1964.&lt;ref name=bbcotd/&gt;

The marriage began to collapse early and publicly; various causes may have been behind the failure. On her side there was a penchant for late-night partying, while on Snowdon's an undisguised sexual profligacy. ("'If it moves, he'll have it,' was the summing-up of one close friend.")&lt;ref name="deCourcy"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3554322/Lord-Snowdon-small-in-stature-big-in-bed.html "Snowdon: the Biography" by Anne de Courcy, reviewed by Duncan Fallowell], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 20 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; "'[T]o most of the girls who worked in the Pimlico Road studio, there seemed little doubt that Tony was gay'. To which Tony responds: 'I didn't fall in love with boys - but a few men have been in love with me.'"&lt;ref name=deCourcy /&gt; The authorized biography by [[Anne de Courcy]] (2008) reveals a series of affairs with women, including a 20-year relationship with his mistress Ann Hills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/22/biography.features|title=Talk about a cad and a bounder|work=The Guardian|first=Rachel|last=Cooke|date=21 June 2008|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Armstrong-Jones did not deny that he was bisexual.&lt;ref name=telegraph1/&gt;

In his 2009 memoir, ''Redeeming Features'', British interior designer [[Nicholas Haslam]] claimed that he had an affair with Snowdon before the latter's marriage to Princess Margaret and that Snowdon had also been the lover of Tom Parr, another leading interior designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/nicky-haslam| work=W Magazine|title=Nicky Haslam|first1=James|last1=Reginato|date=1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple remained married sixteen years. "They were both pretty strong-willed and accustomed to having their own way, so there were bound to be collisions," according to de Courcy. His work also consumed a great deal of time. "She expected her husband to be with her more, but one of Tony's strongest motivations was work."&lt;ref name="townandcountrymag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/news/a9255/princess-margaret-lord-snowdon-relationship/|title=The True Story of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones's Love Affair|publisher=Town &amp; Country|first=Katie|last=Frost|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was accompanied by drugs, alcohol and bizarre behaviour by both parties, such as his leaving lists of "things I hate about you" for the princess to find between the pages of books she read. According to biographers [[Sarah Bradford]], one note read: "You look like a Jewish manicurist and I hate you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradford|first=Sarah|title=Elizabeth|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; When high society palled, Snowdon would escape to a hideaway cottage with his lovers or on overseas photographic assignments; "[m]ost people, including the Royal Family, took his side."&lt;ref name=deCourcy/&gt; Among Snowdon's lovers in the late 1960s was Lady Jacqueline Rufus-Isaacs, daughter of the [[Michael Alfred Rufus Isaacs, 3rd Marquess of Reading|3rd Marquess of Reading]].&lt;ref name=telegraph1/&gt; In spite of her own affairs, Margaret was said to be particularly upset when hearing about this woman.&lt;ref name="townandcountrymag.com"/&gt; They separated in 1976, and the marriage ended in divorce in 1978.&lt;ref name=bbcotd&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/19/newsid_4243000/4243211.stm|title=1976: Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon to split|work=''BBC News''|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''The Telegraph'' reported that Snowdon had fathered an illegitimate daughter shortly before marrying Princess Margaret.&lt;ref name=bloxham08&gt;Andy Bloxham, Andy (31 May 2008).

Retrieved 28 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne de Courcy reports the claim by Polly Fry, born on 28 May 1960, in the third week of Lord Snowdon's marriage to Princess Margaret, and brought up as a daughter of [[Jeremy Fry]], inventor and member of the [[J.

''[[Women's Wear Daily]]''. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Polly Fry asserted that a [[DNA test]] in 2004 proved Snowdon's paternity. Jeremy Fry rejected her claim, and Snowdon denied having taken a DNA test. However, four years later, he admitted that this account was true.&lt;ref name=telegraph1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloxham08/&gt;

===Second marriage===
After his divorce from Princess Margaret, Lord Snowdon married Lucy Mary Lindsay-Hogg (née Davies) on 15 December 1978. Armstrong-Jones's youngest daughter is Lady Frances Armstrong-Jones, a designer and board member of the Snowdon Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our board|url=https://www.snowdontrust.org/our-board|website=The Snowdon Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born on 17 July 1979 and married Rodolphe von Hofmannsthal in 2006.&lt;ref name="Frances-Marriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/snowdons-daughter-marries-f0j5p5c8nw3|title=Snowdon's daughter marries|publisher=The Times|date=3 December 2006|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1976 until 1996, Snowdon also had a mistress, journalist Ann Hills. She died by suicide on 31 December 1996.&lt;ref name=telegraph1/&gt;

The couple separated in 2000 after the revelation that Snowdon, then aged 67, had fathered a son, Jasper William Oliver Cable-Alexander (born 30 April 1998), with Melanie Cable-Alexander, an editor at ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3592805/Still-playing-Peter-Pan.html|title=Still playing Peter Pan|date=16 April 2003|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Bearn, Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owens, Mitchell (27 July 1999).

On 16 November 1999 Lord Snowdon was created '''Baron Armstrong-Jones''', of Nymans in the County of West Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=55672 |date=19 November 1999 |page=12349}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a [[life peer]]age given to him so that he could keep his seat in the [[House of Lords]] after the hereditary peers had been [[House of Lords Act 1999|excluded]].

She entered Uganda's elective politics by contesting for the Kitgum Municipality Constituency parliamentary seat in 2006.

She became well known for her work to save the [[Mabira Forest]] in [[Uganda]]. The president [[Yoweri Museveni]], and the government, had prior to her work decided to sell the forest to the sugar company [[Sugar Corporation of Uganda Limited]] (SCOUL) to cut it down and convert it into a sugar cane plantation for [[ethanol]] production. Atim fought along with for example the ''National Association of Professional Environmentalists'' to stop the felling, and organized a boycott of SCOUL's sugar.&lt;ref name="Pri"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.ug/mabira-no-storm-mehtas-tea-cup/

A regular in the side throughout the following three seasons, Falconer's job restricted his ability to play in later seasons, and eventually forced his retirement from the club at the end of the 1960 season, although he did later play a handful of matches for [[Waverley Football Club|Waverley]] in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA).&lt;ref name="potw"/&gt;

'''Cornelis Frederik Bezuidenhout''' was a frontier farmer in the eastern [[Cape Colony]] whose death in a skirmish with Hottentot soldiers, who had been sent to arrest him, was the origin of the [[Slagtersnek Rebellion]] which reached its dramatic finale on 9 March 1816 under the [[gallows]] at Van Aardspos, twelve miles south of Slagtersnek.&lt;ref name = "DSAB2"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Bezuidenhout, Johannes Jurgen | encyclopedia = Dictionary of South African Biography | volume = II | pages = 59–60 | publisher = Human Sciences Research Council | year = 1983 | isbn = 0-624-00369-8 }}&lt;!--| accessdate = 23 January 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and death==
Cornelis Frederik Bezuidenhout, known by the nickname Freek, was the fifth of seven children of Wynand Jacobus Bezuidenhout, a [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] of [[Graaff-Reinet]], and his wife, Maria Terblans, a descendant of Wynand Leendertsz Bezuidenhout, of the [[Netherlands]], master gardener at the Cape, and his wife, Jannetje Gerrits, of [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name = "DSAB1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Bezuidenhout, Cornelis Frederik | encyclopedia = Dictionary of South African Biography | volume = II | pages = 59 | publisher = Human Sciences Research Council | year = 1983 | isbn = 0-624-00369-8 }}&lt;!--| accessdate = 23 January 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in the Graaff-Reinet district and [[baptised]] on 9 June 1773.&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

As a frontier farmer, he lived in seclusion in the valley of the Baviaans River, east of [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]].&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

He was said to know no fear, to be full of self-confidence and decidedly arrogant and quick-tempered.&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

As a result of his views on public affairs he came into conflict with the authorities. Unrest on the eastern frontier, caused by conflicts with the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], increased the tension, especially after the Black Circuit in 1812.&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

Bezuidenhout was generally known as a difficult man; he was accused by his servant, Booi, of ill-treatment and of holding back his pay due to a theft accusation against Booi.&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

He was summoned to appear before the court at Graaff-Reinet. At first he sent poor excuses for his absence; but eventually defied the court's orders.&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

As a result,  he was sentenced in his absence by a circuit court for [[contempt of court]] to a month's [[incarceration|imprisonment]]. An order for his arrest was issued and [[landdrost]] [[Andries Stockenström]] of Graaff-Reinet instructed the Deputy-Messenger of the Court to carry out the order.&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

Receiving no help from the [[Field Cornet]] of the ward, he proceeded to the nearest military post, commanded by [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Andrews armed with a letter asked for military assistance. While Bezuidenhout was preparing to resist, by force, his arrest, [[Lieutenant]] F Rousseau accompanied the Deputy-Messenger with a patrol of twelve [[Khoikhoi]] soldiers.&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

He was confronted at the Baviaans River (the present Glen Lynden) on 16 October 1815. Bezuidenhout refused to surrender and fired on the soldiers. With his [[half-breed]] son and a casual visitor, Jacob Erasmus, sought refuge amongst the tumbled rocks of the nearby valley. He would not listen to reason and recommenced firing until he was mortally wounded by the soldiers returning the fire. His son and Erasmus, who took no part in the action, surrendered.&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

Bezuidenhout was buried on the farm the next day by his relatives.&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

There is no certainty about Bezuidenhout's wife or children, apart from one son, Gerrit Coenraad Bezuidenhout (1790-1838).&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

==Memorial==
The cave in which Bezuidenhout died, and also his grave, are at Silverbrook farm, the present Glen Lynden in the [[Eastern Cape]]. The [[Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk|Dutch Reformed Church]] and the local Reddingsdaadbond [https://web.archive.org/web/20081007201126/http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich13.html] erected an [[obelisk]] of red [[diabase|dolerite]] at the cave and a [[granite]] rock at the grave. These two memorials are about 200 yards apart on the road between [[Bedford, Eastern Cape|Bedford]] and [[Tarkastad, Eastern Cape|Tarkastad]] in the Eastern Cape province.&lt;ref name="DSAB1"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
At Bezuidenhout's funeral, his brother, Johannes Jurgen (Hans Jan) Bezuidenhout, swore to [[revenge|avenge]] himself on the officials whom he held responsible for his brother's death.&lt;ref name="DSAB2"/&gt;

He incited the whole community to resistance against British authority. He believed that his decision to chase the British and the [[Khoikhoi]] into the sea and to establish an independent state on the eastern frontier coincided with the wishes of all the [[citizen|burgher]]s. About sixty burghers took an [[oath of vengeance]] and loyalty and took part in what became known as the [[Slachter's Nek Rebellion]].&lt;ref name="DSAB2"/&gt;

The Slachter's Nek Rebellion was an uprising by [[Boers]] in 1815 on the eastern border of the [[Cape Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Slachter's Nek Rebellion  | encyclopedia = Standard Encyclopedia of Southern Africa | volume = 9 | pages = 655–656 | publisher = Human Sciences Research Council | date = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rebellion, which was small and local, was handled so badly that it acquired importance as an incident in the struggle of [[Afrikaner]]dom against British domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Cape of Good Hope | encyclopedia = Standard Encyclopedia of Southern Africa | volume = 3 | pages = 47 | publisher = Human Sciences Research Council | date = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charlotte Gordon Cumming''' (born 2 February 1958) is a Scottish contemporary [[singer-songwriter]] and music producer, daughter of a Scottish clan chief. She wrote the [[Sugababes]] hit "[[Soul Sound]]", nominated for [[MTV]] Best European Single Award 2001. In 2005, the song was covered by [[Indonesia]]n [[singer]] [[Joy Tobing]] on her album ''[[Rise (Joy Tobing album)|Rise]]'' and was recorded by Cumming on her album ''Mindwalking''.

Cumming is influenced by artists such as [[Paul Simon]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Sinéad O'Connor]], though she has developed her own modern blend of Celtic melodies and African rhythms.

She is married to the novelist [[Nicholas Evans]], author of ''The Horse Whisperer''.&lt;ref name = "Times"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4660269.ece | last = Sweeney | first = "Charlene | title = Horse Whisperer author, Nicholas Evans, poisoned by wild mushrooms | newspaper = [[The Times]] | date = 3 September 2008 | accessdate = 2009-04-16 | location=London}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese personal names''' are names used by those from [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[Chinese diaspora]] overseas. Due to China's historical dominance of East Asian culture, many names used in [[Korean name|Korea]] and [[Vietnamese name|Vietnam]] are adaptations of Chinese names, or have historical roots in Chinese, with appropriate adaptation to accommodate linguistic differences.

Modern Chinese names consist of a surname known as '''xing''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|姓}}}}, ''xìng''), which comes first and is usually but [[Chinese compound surname|not always]] monosyllabic, followed by a personal name called '''ming''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|名}}}}, ''míng''), which is nearly always mono- or disyllabic.  Prior to the 20th century, educated Chinese also utilized a "[[courtesy name]]" or "style name" called '''zi''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|字}}}}, ''zì'') by which they were known among those outside their family and closest friends.

From at least the time of the [[Shang dynasty]], the [[Han people|Han Chinese]] observed a number of [[naming taboo]]s regulating who may or may not use a person's given name (without being disrespectful). In general, using the given name connoted the speaker's authority and superior position to the addressee. Peers and younger relatives were barred from speaking it. Owing to this, many historical Chinese figures—particularly emperors—used a half-dozen or more different names in different contexts and for different speakers. Those possessing names (sometimes even mere homophones) identical to the emperor's were frequently forced to change them. The normalization of personal names after the [[May Fourth Movement]] has generally eradicated aliases such as the school name and courtesy name but traces of the old taboos remain, particularly within families.

==History==
Although some terms in the ancient Chinese naming system, such as ''xìng'' ({{lang|zh|姓}}) and ''míng'' ({{lang|zh|名}}), are still used today, in ancient times they were used in different and more complex ways than in modern China.

In the first half of the 1st millennium BC, during the [[Zhou dynasty]], members of the Chinese nobility could possess up to four different names{{mdash}}personal names (''míng'' 名), clan names (''xìng'' 姓), lineage names (''shì'' 氏), and "style" or "courtesy" names (''zì'' 字){{mdash}}and up to two titles: standard titles (''jué'' 爵), and posthumous titles (''shì'' 諡 or ''shìhào'' 諡號).{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=113}}  Commoners possessed only a personal name (''ming''), and the modern concept of a "surname" or "family name" did not yet exist at any level of society.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=113}}  The old lineage (''shi'') and clan names (''xing'') began to become "family names" in the modern sense and trickle down to commoners around 500 BC, during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]], but the process took several centuries to complete, and it was not until the late [[Han dynasty]] (1st and 2nd centuries AD) that all Chinese commoners had surnames.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|pp=113-115}}

== Family names ==
{{Main|Chinese surname}}
Although there are currently over 4,000 [[Chinese surname]]s ({{linktext|姓}}, ''xìng'') in use in China,&lt;ref name="Xinhua"&gt;何春中 (12 Dec 2007). "[http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2007-12/12/content_7231985.htm 我国汉族公民最长姓名达15字 公安部：起名不规范会有不便]".  Xinhua Net.  Accessed 16 Mar 2012. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the colloquial expression for the "Chinese people" is  Bǎixìng (百姓) "[[Hundred Family Surnames|Hundred Surnames]]", and a mere hundred surnames still make up over 85% of China's 1.3 billion citizens.&lt;ref name="PD"&gt;People's Daily. "[http://english.people.com.cn/200706/19/eng20070619_385661.html Chinese surname shortage sparks rethink]". 19 May 2007. Accessed 16 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, just the top three—[[Wang (surname)|Wang]] (王), [[Li (李)|Li]] ({{linktext|李}}), and [[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]] (張)—cover more than 20% of the population.&lt;ref name="PD"/&gt; This homogeneity results from the great majority of [[Han Chinese|Han]] family names having only one character, while the small number of [[Chinese compound surname|compound surnames]] is mostly restricted to minority groups.&lt;ref name="Xinhua"/&gt; This has not always been true in Chinese history: between the first and fifth centuries AD, a law against multiple-character personal names briefly popularized two-character surnames and a number of important figures like [[Zhuge Liang]] and [[Sima Qian]] possessed them.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Chinese surnames arose from two separate [[Prehistoric China|prehistoric]] traditions: the ''[[Chinese family name|xìng]]'' ({{linktext|姓}}) and the ''[[Chinese clan name|shì]]'' ({{linktext|氏}}). The original ''xìng'' were clans of royalty at the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] court and always included the 'woman' [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] {{linktext|女}}. The ''shì'' did not originate from families, but denoted fiefs, states, and titles granted or recognized by the Shang court. Apart from the [[Jiang (surname)|Jiang]] ({{linktext|姜}}) and [[Yao (surname)|Yao]] ({{linktext|姚}}) families, the original ''xìng'' have nearly disappeared but the terms ironically reversed their meaning. ''Xìng'' is now used to describe the ''shì'' surnames which replaced them, while ''shì'' is used to refer to [[maiden name]]s.

The enormous modern clans sometimes share [[tanghao|ancestral halls]] with one another, but actually consist of many different lineages gathered under a single name. As an example, the surname [[Ma (surname)|Ma]] ({{linktext|馬}}) includes descendants of the [[Warring States period|Warring States]]–era bureaucrat [[Zhao She]], descendants of his subjects in his fief of [[Mafu]], Koreans from an [[Mahan confederacy|unrelated confederation]], and Muslims from all over western China who chose it to honor [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA375|title=Muslim Chinese: Ethnic Nationalism in the People's Republic|author=[[Dru C.

Asia Center|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=375|isbn=0-674-59497-5|accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, however tenuous these bonds sometimes are, it remains a minor taboo to marry someone with the same family name.

Traditionally, a married woman keeps her name unchanged, without adopting her husband's surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tatlow|first1=Didi|title=For Chinese Women, a Surname Is Her Name|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/world/asia/china-women-surnames.html|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child would inherit her father's surname. This is still the norm in [[mainland China]], though the marriage law explicitly states that a child may use either parent's surname. It is also possible, though far less common, for a child to combine both parents' surnames. Due to Western influence, some areas of [[greater China]], such as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], have also adopted the tradition of a woman changing her last name, or prepending her husband’s to her own.

== Given names ==
{{Main|Chinese given name}}
Chinese given names (名字, ''míngzi'') show much greater diversity than the surnames, while still being restricted almost universally to one or two syllables. Including [[variant Chinese characters|variant forms]], there are at least 106,000 individual Chinese characters,&lt;ref name="TME"&gt;The 2004 [[Taiwan]]ese [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] ''[[Dictionary of Chinese Variant Form]]'' compiled 106,230.&lt;/ref&gt; but as of 2006, in the People's Republic of China Public Security Bureau only approximately 32,000 are supported for computer input&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/world/asia/21china.html | work=The New York Times | title=Name Not on Our List? Change It, China Says | first=Sharon | last=Lafraniere | date=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even fewer are in common use. Given names are chosen based on a range of factors, including possession of pleasing sound and [[Chinese tones|tonal qualities]], as well as bearing positive associations or a beautiful shape. Two-character ''ming'' may be chosen for each character's separate meaning and qualities, but the name remains a single unit which is almost always said together even when the combination no longer 'means' anything.

Today, two-character names are more common and make up more than 80% of Chinese names.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;Woo Louie, Emma &amp; al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IGAClRACrsYC&amp;pg=PA48 Chinese American Names: Tradition and Transition]''. McFarland, 2008. {{ISBN|0-7864-3877-0}}. Accessed 22 Mar 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this custom has been consistent only since the [[Ming dynasty]]. About 70% of all names were only one character long during the [[Western Han dynasty|early Han]] and that rose beyond 98% after the usurping [[Wang Mang]] banned all two-character names outright. Although his [[Xin dynasty]] was short-lived, the law was not repealed until 400 years later, when northern invasions and interest in establishing lineages revived interest in such longer names.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; The [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] saw populations with a majority of two-character names for the first time, but the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Liao]] between them and the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] afterward both preferred single character names. The restoration of [[Han people|Han]] dominance under the Ming, promotion of [[Han culture]] under the [[Qing]], and development of [[generation name]]s established the current traditions.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;

Given names resonant of qualities which are perceived to be either masculine or feminine are frequently given, with males being linked with strength and firmness and females with beauty and flowers. It is also more common for female names to employ diminutives like ''Xiǎo'' or doubled characters in their formal names, although there are famous male examples such as [[Li Xiaoping]] and [[Yo-Yo Ma]]. People from the countryside previously often bore names that reflect rural life—for example, Daniu ({{linktext|大|牛}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Big Ox") and Dazhu ({{linktext|大|柱}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Big Pole")—but such names are becoming less common.

It is also considered bad form to name a child after a famous person, although tens of thousands might happen to share a common name such as "[[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]]".&lt;ref&gt;法制晚报(北京). ''Op. cit.'' 163.com. "[http://news.163.com/07/0815/15/3LUPHGL4000120GU.html 中国1.8万多人姓名为刘翔,叫刘德华的人逾1.6万]". 15 Oct 2007. Accessed 17 Mar 2012. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, owing to the traditional [[naming taboo]]s, it is very uncommon in China to name a child directly after a relative, since such children would permit junior family members to inappropriately use the personal names of senior ones. Ancestors can leave a different kind of mark: Chinese naming schemes often employ a [[generation name]]. Every child recorded into the family records in each generation would share an identical character in their names. Sixteen, thirty-two, or more generations would be worked out in advance to form a [[generation poem]]. For example, the one selected in 1737 for the family of [[Mao Zedong]] read:{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

::::{{linktext|立|显|荣|朝|士}}，''Stand tall &amp; display unstintingly before gentlemen,''
::::{{linktext|文|方|运|际|祥}}。''And study &amp; method will expand the borders of our fortune''.
::::{{linktext|祖|恩|贻|泽|远}}，''Ancestral favors bequeath kindness through the ages,''
::::{{linktext|世|代|永|承|昌}}。''Descendants forever obliged for their prosperity''.

This scheme was in its fourteenth generation when Mao rejected it for the naming of his own children, preferring to give his sons the generational name An ({{linktext|岸}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Lofty", "Proud") instead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} A similar practice was observed regarding the [[stage name]]s of [[Chinese opera]] performers: all the students entering a training academy in the same year would adopt the same first character in their new "given name". For example, as part of the class entering the National Drama School in 1933, [[Li Yuru]] adopted a name with the central character "jade" ({{linktext|玉}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Li |first=Ruru |authormask=Li Ruru |contribution-url=https://chinoperl.osu.edu/sites/chinoperl.osu.edu/files/back-issues-no.29-liruru-caoyu-liyuru-report-color-photos.pdf |contribution=2010 Commemorations of the Theatrical Careers of Cao Yu and Li Yuru |date=2010b |title=CHINOPERL Papers |volume=No. 29 |publisher=Conference on Chinese Oral and Performing Literature |p=225 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the region and particular family, daughters were not entered into the family records and thus did not share the boys' generation name, although they may have borne a separate one among themselves. Even where generation names are not used, siblings' names are frequently related, so that a boy named Song ({{linktext|松}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Pine") might have a sister named Mei ({{linktext|梅}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "[[plum tree|Plum]]"). In some famlies, the siblings' names have the same [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]. For example, in the Jia (贾) clan in ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'', a novel mirroring the rise and decline of the Qing Dynasty, there is Zheng (政), She (赦), and Min (敏) in the first generation, Lian (琏), Zhen (珍), and Huan (环) in the second, and Yun (芸), Qin (芹), and Lan (兰(蘭 at the time)) in the third.

More recently, although generation names have become less common, many personal names reflect periods of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. For example, following the victory of the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] in the [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]], many Chinese bore "revolutionary names" such as Qiangguo ({{linktext|強|國}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Strong Nation" or "Strengthening the Nation") or Dongfeng ({{linktext|東|風}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Eastern Wind"). Similarly, on [[Taiwan]], it used to be common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name "[[Republic of China]]" ({{linktext|中華|民國}}, ''Zhōnghuá Mínguó'') into masculine names. Periodic fad names like Aoyun ("Olympics") also appear. Owing to both effects, there has also been a recent trend in China to hire fortune tellers to change people's names to new ones more in accordance with traditional Taoist and [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five element]] practices.

==Spelling==
{{Main|Pinyin|Romanization of Chinese}}
The process of converting Chinese names into a phonetic alphabet is called [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]].

In mainland China, Chinese names have been romanized using the [[Hanyu Pinyin]] system since 1958. Although experiments with the complete conversion of Chinese to the Pinyin alphabet failed,&lt;ref name="F&amp;F"&gt;DeFrancis, John. ''[[The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; it remains in common use and has become the transcription system of the government of [[Singapore]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[International Organization for Standardization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=13682|title=ISO 7098:1982 – Documentation – Romanization of Chinese|accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After many decades of avoiding its use, Taiwan formally adopted Pinyin as its "New Phonetic System" in 2009,&lt;ref name="pinyin_tt"&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Taipei Times |date=2008-09-18 |title=Hanyu Pinyin to be standard system in 2009 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/18/2003423528 |accessdate=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinyin_cp"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=The China Post |date=2008-09-18 |title=Government to improve English-friendly environment|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175155/Gov%27t-to.htm |accessdate=2008-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it continues to allow its citizens to use other romanizations on official documents such as passports. The system is easily identified by its frequent use of letters uncommon in English, such as "q", "x", and "z"; when tones are included, they are noted via [[Hanyu Pinyin tones|tone marks]]. In Pinyin, 毛澤東 is written as Máo Zédōng.

Proper use of [[Pinyin ("romanization")]] means treating the surname and given name as precisely two separate words with no spaces between the letters of multiple Chinese characters. For example, "王秀英" is properly rendered either with its [[Hanyu Pinyin tones|tone marks]] as "Wáng Xiùyīng" or without as "Wang Xiuying", but should not be written as "Wang Xiu Ying", "Wang XiuYing", "Wangxiuying", and so on. In the rare cases where a surname consists of more than one character, it too should be written as a unit: "[[Sima Qian]]", not "Si Ma Qian" or "Si Maqian". However, as the Chinese language makes almost no use of spaces, native speakers often do not know these rules and simply put a space between each Chinese character of their name, causing those used to alphabetical languages to think of the ''xing'' and ''ming'' as three words instead of two.

The switch to Pinyin is still quite new for Taiwan and many non-standard spellings continue to be found, including "Lee" and "Soong". Similarly, many Taiwanese and historic names still employ the older [[Wade–Giles]] system. This [[English language|English]]-influenced system is identified by its use of the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s "hs" (for the pinyin ''x'') and "ts" (for the pinyin ''z'' and ''c'') and by its use of hyphens to connect the syllables of multi-character words. Correct reading depends on the inclusion of superscript numbers and the use of apostrophes to distinguish between different consonants, but in practice both of these are commonly omitted. In Wade–Giles, 毛澤東 is written as [[Mao Tse-tung]], as the system hyphenates names between the characters. For example, Wang Xiuying and Sima Qian are written in Wade as "Wang&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Hsiu&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-Ying&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;" and "Ssu&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Ma&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Ch'ien&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;".

Pinyin and Wade-Giles both represent the pronunciation of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], based on the [[Beijing dialect]]. In [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and the [[Chinese diaspora|diaspora]] communities in southeast Asia and abroad, the Chinese often romanize according to the sounds of their own local Chinese dialect or lingua franca or language mostly spoken in the area or country they settled into, particularly [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], [[Hokkien]], and [[Hakka language|Hakka]]. This occurs amid a plethora of competing romanization systems. In Hong Kong, many Chinese who grew up under the British occupation adopted English spelling conventions for their names: "Lee" for 李, "Shaw" for 邵, and so forth. In Macau, Chinese names are similarly sometimes still transliterated based on [[Portuguese orthography]] and [[Yuetping]]. The Chinese from [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and the diaspora communities in Malaysia and Singapore fully divide the characters in their names with spaces as a matter of course.

A final point is that—although characters have remained roughly the same since the Han dynasty and some [[Classical Chinese|classical grammar]] is still part of the core curriculum of Chinese secondary schools—vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation have all changed from [[Old Chinese|Old]] to [[Middle Chinese|Middle]] to [[Written Vernacular Chinese|Modern Chinese]] even within the [[prestige dialect]]s. Thus, although modern Chinese read "Confucius" ({{linktext|孔|夫子}}) as ''Kǒng Fūzǐ'' via Pinyin&lt;ref name="BaxSag"&gt;Baxter, Wm. H. &amp; Sagart, Laurent. ''{{cite web|url=http://crlao.ehess.fr/docannexe.php?id=1207 |title=Baxter–Sagart Old Chinese Reconstruction |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927141238/http://crlao.ehess.fr/docannexe.php?id=1207 |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.93&amp;nbsp;MB)}}''. 2011.

==Alternative names==
{{See also|Naming taboo|Taboo on rulers|Table of Chinese monarchs}}

From their earliest recorded history, the Chinese observed a number of [[naming taboo]]s, avoiding the names of their elders, [[taboo against naming the dead|ancestors]], and [[taboo on rulers|rulers]] out of respect and fear. As a result, the upper classes of traditional Chinese culture typically employed a variety of names over the course of their lives, and the [[table of Chinese monarchs|emperors]] and [[ancestor veneration in China|sanctified deceased]] had still others.

Current naming practices are more straightforward and consistent, but a few pseudonyms or alternate names remain common.

When discussing Chinese writers, Chinese and Japanese scholars do not consistently use particular names, whether they are private names or alternative names.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Wing-tsit.

===Milk===
Traditionally, babies were named a hundred days after their birth; modern [[naming laws in the People's Republic of China]] grant the parents a month before requiring the baby to be registered.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Upon birth, the parents often use a "milk name" ({{linktext|乳名}}, ''rǔmíng''; {{linktext|小名}})—typically employing [[Chinese diminutives|diminutives]] like ''xiǎo'' ({{linktext|小}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "little") or doubled characters—before a formal name is settled upon, often in consultation with the grandparents. The milk name may be abandoned but is often continued as a form of familial nickname. A tradition sometimes attached to the milk name is to select an unpleasant name, in order to ward off demons who might wish to harm the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Teresa|title=A World of Baby Names|year=2003|publisher=The Berkeley Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-399-52894-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nickname===
[[Nickname]]s (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|綽號}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|绰号}}}}, ''chuòhào'', or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|外號}}}}, ''wàihào'') are acquired in China in much the same way they are in other countries. Not everyone has one. Most that do received theirs in childhood or adolescence from family or friends. Common Chinese nicknames are those based on a person's physical attributes, speaking style, or behavior. Names involving animals are common, although those animals may be associated with different attributes than they are in English: for example, Chinese cows are strong, not stupid; foxes are devious, not clever; pigs are ugly, lazy, stupid, or content, but not dirty. Similarly, nicknames that might seem especially insulting in English—such as "Little Fatty" ({{linktext|小胖}})—are more acceptable in Chinese. One especially common method of creating nicknames is prefixing ''Ā-'' ({{linktext|阿}}) or ''Xiǎo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|小}}}}) to the surname or the second character of the given name. ''Ā-'' is more common in southern China and abroad, while ''Xiǎo'' is common throughout China. Both ''Ā-'' and ''Xiǎo'' are distinguished from ''Lǎo'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|老}}}}, "old" but [[#Forms of address|see below]] for usage). Nicknames are rarely used in formal or semi-formal settings, although a famous exception is [[Chen Shui-bian|A-bian]].

===Western name===
English is taught throughout China's secondary schools and the English language section is a required component of the ''[[Gaokao]]'', China's college entrance examination. Many Chinese teenagers thus acquire English names, which they may keep and use as nicknames even in Chinese-language contexts. Chinese may adopt English names for a variety of reasons, including foreigners' difficulty with [[Chinese tones]] and the modern Chinese tendency to regard foreign names as modern or egalitarian.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2009/04/the_names_du_xiao_hua_but_call_me_steve.html|title=The Name's Du Xiao Hua, But Call Me Steve: What's up with Chinese people having English names?|last=Hsu|first=Huan|date=April 27, 2009|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2009-04-28}}{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom associated with choosing a Chinese given name sometimes leads to choosing English names which seem bizarre to native English speakers. Names like Chlorophyll, Candy, Devil or Whale are pretty common, and even the real English names chosen by Chinese often tend to be rarely used by native English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/10/hong-kong-loves-weird-english-names/263103/&lt;/ref&gt; Creative names made and adopted by [[Hongkongers]] are generated by modifying normal English names either by deleting, inserting or substituting specific letters (e.g. Kith, Sonija, Garbie) or by mimicking the phonetic sounds of the Chinese name (e.g. [[Hacken Lee]] from Lee Hak-kan (李克勤)).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hksarblog.blogspot.com/|title=NOTABLE NAMES (Brilliant Funny Weird Monikers)|website=hksarblog.blogspot.com|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Hong Kong, because of its one and a half century [[British Hong Kong|British rule]], many Hong Kong people will pick English names as early as attending English classes in kindergarten, or even have the English alias embedded in official documentation. The English aliases are widely used at schools and at work. Similar to [[Singapore]], which shares a similar historical development, it is very common among [[Hongkongers]] to address each other with an English alias. An English alias can be accepted as part of the name in official documentation, but whether to include such is an option to individuals.

It is also becoming more popular for parents to give their child a middle name in between their given name and family name, similar to many Western traditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===School name===
The school name (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|學名}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|学名}}, ''xuémíng'') was a separate formal name used by the child while they were at school.

As [[binomial nomenclature]] is also called ''xuémíng'' in Chinese, the school name is also sometimes now referenced as the ''xùnmíng'' ({{linktext|訓名}}) to avoid confusion.

===Courtesy name===
{{Main|Courtesy name}}

Upon maturity, it was common for educated males to acquire a [[courtesy name]] ({{linktext|字}}, ''zì'' or {{linktext|表字}}, ''biǎozì'') either from one's parents, a teacher, or self-selection. The name commonly mirrored the meaning of one's given name or displayed his birth order within his family.

The practice was a consequence of admonitions in the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' that among adults it is disrespectful to be addressed by one's given name by others within the same generation. The true given name was reserved for the use of one's elders, while the courtesy name was employed by peers on formal occasions and in writing. The practice was decried by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and has been largely abandoned.

===Pseudonym===
{{Main|Art name}}

Pseudonyms or aliases (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|號}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|号}}, ''hào'') or pen names (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|筆名}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|笔名}}, ''bǐmíng'') were self-selected alternative courtesy names, most commonly three or four characters long. They may have originated from too many people having the same courtesy name.

Some—but by no means most—authors do continue to employ stylized pen names. A noted{{dubious|date=May 2012}} example is the exile and dissident poet [[Zhao Zhenkai]], whose pen name is "Bei Dao" ({{linktext|北|岛}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "North Island").

===Posthumous name===
{{Main|Posthumous name}}

Posthumous names (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|諡號}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|谥号}}, ''shìhào'') were honorary names selected after a person's death, used extensively for royalty. The common "names" of most Chinese emperors before the [[Tang dynasty]]—with the pointed exception of [[Shi Huangdi]]—are their posthumous ones. In addition to emperors, successful courtiers and politicians such as [[Sun Yat-sen]] also occasionally received posthumous titles.

===Temple name===
{{Main|Temple name}}
{{See also|Ancestor veneration in China}}

The temple name (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|廟號}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{linktext|庙号}}, ''miàohào'') of the emperor inscribed on the [[spiritual tablet]]s of the [[imperial ancestral temple]] often differed from his posthumous name. The structure eventually became highly restricted, consisting of a single adjective and either ''zǔ'' ({{linktext|祖}}) or ''zōng'' ({{linktext|宗}}). These common "names" of the emperors between the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] are their temple ones.

===Era name===
{{Main|Chinese era name|Table of Chinese monarchs}}

The era name ({{linktext|年號}}, ''niánhào'') arose from the custom of dating years by the reigns of the ruling emperors. Under the [[Han dynasty|Han]], the practice began of changing [[regnal name]]s as means of dispensing with bad luck and attracting better. Almost all era names were literary and employed exactly two characters. By the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, emperors had largely dispensed with the practice and kept a single era name during their reign, such that it is customary to refer to Ming and Qing emperors by their era names.

== Forms of address ==
Within families, it is often considered inappropriate or even offensive to use the given names of relatives who are senior to the speaker. Instead, it is more customary to identify each family member by abstract hierarchical connections: among siblings, gender and birth order (big sister, second sister, and so on); for the extended family, the manner of relationship (by birth or marriage; from the maternal or paternal side).

The hierarchical titles of junior relatives are seldom used except in formal situations, or as indirect reference when speaking to family members who are even younger than the person in question. Children can be called by their given names, or their parents may use their nicknames.

When speaking of non-family social acquaintances, people are generally referred to by a title, for example Mother Li ({{zh|t=李媽媽|s=李妈妈|p=lǐ māma}}) or Mrs. Zhu (朱太太, {{zh|p=zhū tàitai}}). Personal names are used when referring to adult friends or to children, although, unlike in the west, referring to somebody by their full name (including surname) is common even among friends, especially if the person's full name is only two syllables.  It is common to refer to a person as ''lǎo'' (老, old) or ''xiǎo'' (小, young) followed by their family name, thus Lǎo Wáng (老王) or Xiǎo Zhāng (小張, 小张).  Xiǎo is also frequently used as a diminutive, when it is typically paired with the second or only character in a person's name, rather than the surname.  Note that because old people are well respected in Chinese society, ''lǎo'' (old) does not carry disrespect, offense or any negative implications even if it is used to refer to an older woman.  Despite this, it is advisable for non-Chinese to avoid calling a person xiǎo-something or lǎo-something unless they are so-called by other Chinese people and it is clear that the appellation is acceptable and widely used.  Otherwise, the use of the person's full name, or alternatively, their surname followed by xiānsheng ({{zh|c=先生}}, mister) or nǚshì ({{zh|c=女士}}, madam) is relatively neutral and unlikely to cause offense.

Within school settings and when addressing former classmates, it is common to refer to them as older siblings, e.g elder brother Zhao ({{zh|t=趙哥|s=赵哥|p=Zhào Gé}}) or e.g. elder sister Zhang ({{zh|t=張姐|s=张姐|p=Zhāng Jǐe}}) if they were of senior classes, or simply to show respect or closeness. The opposite (e.g. younger brother Zhao) is rarely used. This custom spawns from traditional forms of respectful address, where it was considered rude to directly address your seniors.

Whereas [[title]]s in many cultures are commonly solely determined by gender and, in some cases, marital status, the occupation or even work title of a person can be used as a title as a sign of respect in common address in Chinese culture. Because of the prestigious position of a teacher in traditional culture, a teacher is invariably addressed as such by his or her students (e.g. {{zh|c=李老師|p=Lǐ Lǎoshī|l=Teacher Li}}), and commonly by others as a mark of respect. Where applicable, "Teacher Surname" is considered more respectful than "Mr/Mrs/Miss Surname" in Chinese. A professor is also commonly addressed as "teacher", though "professor" is also accepted as a respectful title. By extension, a junior or less experienced member of a work place or profession would address a more senior member as "Teacher".

Similarly, engineers are often addressed as such, though often shortened to simply the first character of the word "engineer" -- {{zh|c=工|p=Gōng}}. Should the person being addressed be the head of a company (or simply the middle manager of another company to whom you would like to show respect), one might equally address them by the title "zŏng" ({{zh|s=总|t=總}}), which means "general" or "overall", and is the first character of titles such as "Director General" or "General Manager" (e.g. {{zh|t=李總|s=李总|p=Lĭ zŏng}}), or, if they are slightly lower down on the corporate hierarchy but nonetheless a manager, by affixing Jīnglĭ ({{zh|s=经理|t=經理}}, manager).

== Variations ==

===Unusual names===
{{see also|Naming laws in the People's Republic of China}}
Because the small number of Chinese surnames leads to confusion in social environments, and because some Chinese parents have a desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the [[Chinese public security bureau]] stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People's Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry's computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names to change them so they can get new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Beginning in at least 2003, the PRC government has been writing a list of standardized characters for everyday usage in life, which would be the pool of characters to select from when a child is given his or her name. Originally the limits were to go in place in 2005. In April 2009, the list had been revised 70 times, and it still has not been put into effect.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Wang Daliang, a [[China Youth University for Political Sciences]] linguistics scholar, said that "Using obscure names to avoid duplication of names or to be unique is not good. Now a lot of people are perplexed by their names. The computer cannot even recognize them and people cannot read them. This has become an obstacle in communication."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Zhou Youyong, the dean of the [[Southeast University]] law school, argued that the ability to choose the name of one's children is a fundamental right, so the PRC government should be careful when making new naming laws.&lt;ref name="Xinhua"/&gt;

While the vast majority of Han Chinese names consist of two or three characters, there are some Han Chinese with longer names, up to 15 characters.&lt;ref name="Xinhua"/&gt; In addition, [[Transcription into Chinese characters|transliteration of ethnic languages into Chinese characters]] often results in long names.

===Taiwan===
[[Han Chinese|Han]] family names on Taiwan are similar to those in southeast China, as most families trace their origins to places such as [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]. The [[Taiwanese aborigines]] have also [[Naming customs of Taiwanese aborigines|adopted Chinese names]] as part of their [[Sinicization]]. The popularity distribution of family names in Taiwan as a whole differs somewhat from the distribution of names among all Han Chinese, with the family name [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] ({{linktext|陳}}) being particularly more common (about 11% on Taiwan, compared with about 3% on the Mainland). Local variations also exist.

Given names that consist of one character are much less common on Taiwan than on the mainland.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

A traditional practice, now largely supplanted, was choosing deliberately unpleasant given names to ward off bad omens and evil spirits. For example, a boy facing a serious illness might be renamed Ti-sái ({{linktext|豬|屎}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "Pig Shit") to indicate to the evil spirits that he was not worth their trouble. Similarly, a girl from a poor family might have the name Bóng-chī ({{linktext|罔|市}}, &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt; "No Takers").

Nicknames ({{linktext|囝|仔|名}}, ''gín-á-miâ'', "child names") are common and generally adopt the [[nanfangren|Southern Chinese]] practice of affixing the prefix "A-" ({{linktext|阿}}) to the last syllable of a person's name. Although these names are rarely used in formal contexts, there are a few public figures who are well known by their nicknames, including former president [[Chen Shui-bian|A-bian]] and the singer [[A-mei]].

===Diaspora===
Among [[Chinese American]]s, it is common practice to be referred to primarily by the Western name and to use the Chinese given name as an often-omitted [[middle name]].

In [[Malaysian Chinese|Malaysia]] and [[Chinese Singaporean|Singapore]], it is equally acceptable for Western names to appear before or after the Chinese given name, in Latin characters. Thus, the [[President of Singapore|Singaporean President]] [[Tony Tan Keng Yam|Tony Tan]] might see his name written as "Tony Tan Keng Yam" or "Tan Keng Yam Tony".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Individuals are free to register their [[legal name]]s in either format on their [[National Registration Identity Card|identity card]]s. In general use, the English name first version is typically preferred as it keeps the correct order for both systems; however, for administrative purposes, the [[Government of Singapore|government]] [[Organisations of the Singapore Government|agencies]] tend to place the English name last to organize lists of names and databases more easily, similar to the Western practice of organizing names with the last name first followed by a comma ("Smith, John").

The [[Hong Kong]] printed media tend to adopt the hybrid name style—for example, [[Andy Lau Tak-wah]]—although some people prefer American-style middle names, such as [[Steven N. S. Cheung]], or simply use English names like [[Henry Lee (actor)|Henry Lee]]. On official records such as the Hong Kong [[identity document|Identity Cards]], family names are always printed first in all-caps Latin characters and followed by a comma for all names, including Chinese ones. Thus, the examples above would have identity cards that read "LAU, Tak-wah Andy" or "CHEUNG, Steven Ng-sheong", with the position of the given names determined at the time of application. Non-Chinese names are printed in similar style: "DOE, Jane".

==Chinese names in English==
[[File:Sun Yat Sen Signature.png|thumb|The signature of [[Sun Yat-sen]]; in English Chinese people usually keep their names in Chinese order unless they live or travel abroad]]
Chinese people, except for those traveling or living outside China, rarely reverse their names to the western naming order (given name, then family name). Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name.

The usual presentation of Chinese names in English differs from the usual presentations of modern [[Japanese name]]s, since modern Japanese names are usually reversed to fit the western order in English. In English the presentation of Chinese names is similar to those of [[Korean names]].&lt;ref name="PowerpC4-2"&gt;Power, p. C4-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 1989, Pinyin became the preferred romanization system in works discussing contemporary China, while English-language books relevant to Japanese history still used the [[Wade–Giles]] system to romanize Chinese names more often than other romanization systems.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, William G.

==Chinese names in Japanese==
In the Japanese language, Chinese names can be pronounced either approximating the original Chinese, the '''Local reading''' (現地読み) of the characters, or using a Sino-Japanese '''On'yomi reading''' (音読み) to pronounce the Chinese characters. Local readings are often written in katakana rather than kanji, but not always. For example, 毛泽东 (Mao Zedong) is pronounced Mō Takutō using an On'yomi reading, whereas Beijing (北京) is spelled with kanji but pronounced Pekin (ペキン), with a local reading (which may also be considered a post-Tōsō-on reading), rather than Hokkyō (which would be the Kan-on reading).

'''Clara Mordan''' (28 September, 1844 – 22 January, 1915) was a British suffragist and benefactor to the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] and [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]].

==Life==
Mordan was born in [[Southwark]] to a family who owned a company who made [[propelling pencils]]. She was the eldest of the two daughters of Augustus and Elizabeth Jane Mordan. Her sister Ada married and had children but Clara was concerned that marriage would mean surrendering the control of her money to her husband. She was engaged but her attentions turned to the cause of women's rights. She was inspired by a lecture by [[John Stuart Mill]] in 1866. Mordan was given a lot of financial freedom by her father and she established her own home and household.&lt;ref name=quare&gt;Deborah Quare, ‘Mordan, Clara Evelyn (1844–1915)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52275, accessed 19 Nov 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1880 she joined the [[London Women's Suffrage Society]] and the [[Central Society for Women's Suffrage]]. Despite suffering from tuberculosis she served on their executive committees, had letterheads made with "Votes for Women on them, and she was generous with her funding to these causes.&lt;ref name=quare/&gt; 

1897 saw her second interest develop. She heard a paper read by [[Annie Rogers]] in London about the need for better women's education. This was just after a proposal to allow women to be awarded degrees was defeated.&lt;ref name="Griffin1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Penny Griffin|title=St Hugh’s: One Hundred Years of Women’s Education in Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vOvCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|date=30 June 1986|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-07725-0|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mordan had no formal education; she is thought to have been educated at home by governesses, but she wanted to support the idea. She set out with her friend [[Mary Gray Allen]] to decide the best deserving college and [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]] was identified. She contracted to supply an annuity of £40 per annum to fund a scholarship on the condition that there was no [[vivisection]] involved in the recipients research.&lt;ref name=quare/&gt;

In 1901 her father died. She was now the only child and he left £117,000.&lt;ref name="spart"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Wmordan.htm|title=Clara Mordan|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=19 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 after many years of interest she joined the militant [[Women's Social and Political Union]] which was led by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], but it was a speech by [[Annie Kenney]] that inspired her. Moreover she has the distinction of being their first benefactor of their newly founded WSPU campaign fund.&lt;ref name="Griffin1986"/&gt; Annie Kenney went round to see her after the event to thank her for the twenty pounds she had sent them towards their expenses.&lt;ref name=spart/&gt;

She spoke on their behalf and attended protest meetings. The 1908 WSPU procession was said to be mainly funded by Mordan and when the protesters reached [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] they listened to speeches including one by Mordan.&lt;ref name="Griffin1986"/&gt; She funded a variety of projects from a WSPU Art exhibition at the [[Prince's Skating Club]] in 1909 to $200 set aside for a "return to militancy" in 1912.&lt;ref name="spart"/&gt;

Mordan was invited to [[Eagle House (suffragette's rest)|Eagle House]] in [[Batheaston]]&lt;ref name=spart/&gt; on 27 April 1910 to plant a holly tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bathintime.co.uk/image/249413/blathwayt-col-linley-ilex-aquifolium-small-leaved-silver-holly-1910|title=Ilex Aquifolium - (small leaved silver holly) 1910, Blathwayt, Col Linley|website=Bath in Time, Images of Bath online|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eagle House was where [[Mary Blathwayt]]'s family entertained visitors at their "Suffragette's Rest". Many notable supporters were invited to the house. [[Emily Blathwayt]] planted trees and shrubs in "Annie's Arboretum" to commemorate achievements and her husband recorded these in photographs. The arboreturm was named after [[Annie Kenney]] and she had a room at Eagle House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hannam|first1=June|title=Suffragette Photographs|journal=Regional Historian|date=Winter 2002|issue=8|url=http://www2.uwe.ac.uk/faculties/CAHE/Documents/Research/Regional-history/RH8Hannam.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
With Mordan's backing, [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]] bought a house called "The Mount" from University College and began to move to their new permanent site in 1913.&lt;ref name="nl2011"/&gt; The house was demolished to make way for the Main Building of the college which was funded by Mordan. Mordan died in [[Bexhill-on-Sea]] in 1915. She was given regular updates and in reply she had said that the college was one of her proudest achievements.&lt;ref name="Griffin1986"/&gt; St Hughes College named their new library Mordan Hall in recognition of her contributions to the college.&lt;ref name="nl2011"&gt;''St Hugh's College Spring Newsletter 2011''; p.9-13&lt;/ref&gt; Mordan left most of her wealth to Mary Gray Allen who had shared her life. When Allen died she left a large bequest to St Hugh's college.

==Life==
Colin Campbell was born in [[Reston, Manitoba]], 1942. Based in [[Toronto]] since 1973, Campbell  produced over 45 tapes. He received his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] from the [[University of Manitoba]] (Gold Medal) and his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from [[Claremont Graduate School]], California. Campbell's first academic position was at [[Mount Allison University]], Sackville, New Brunswick, the subject of his video ''Sackville, I'm Yours''. Campbell moved to Toronto in 1973, where he taught at the [[Ontario College of Art]] and later (from 1980) in the Department of Fine Art at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Jon|last2=Greyson|first2=John|title=People Like Us: The Gossip of Colin Campbell = Des gens comme nous : les potins de Colin Campbell|date=2008|publisher=Oakville Galleries|location=Oakville, Ont.|isbn=9781894707282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell was active in the [[Canadian artist-run centres|artist-run centre]] movement and was a founding member of [[VTape]].

'''Dafydd Cadwaladr''' (1752–1834) was a Welsh Calvinistic [[Methodist]] preacher. He grew up in Llangwm, [[Denbighshire]], where his family had lived for generations. By noting the letters on sheep's backs and then picking his way through the Prayer Book he was able to teach himself to read, and enjoyed reciting works such as the 'Pilgrim's Progress' at the local 'knitting meetings'.

For a while he worked as a farm boy, but c. 1771 he took the position of servant at Fedw Arian, [[Bala, Gwynedd]], working for the [[Methodist]] preacher William Evans. Dafydd knew his bible by heart, and about 1780 himself began preaching. He also enjoyed walking, and thus became favourite preacher throughout [[Wales]].

He died in 1834, and is buried at [[Llanycil]].

'''Dennis Jernigan''' is a [[singer-songwriter]] of [[contemporary Christian music]].  He is native to [[Oklahoma]], and headquarters a music-based [[Christian ministry]] from there. Jernigan now lives in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]] with his wife and their nine children. Jernigan is a self-identified [[ex-gay]], and has been married to his wife for more than 30 years.

Jernigan is a graduate of [[Oklahoma Baptist University]].

== Biography ==
A primary source of inspiration for Jernigan's message and music is an experience he describes as his deliverance from [[homosexuality]]. Jernigan states that this began during a [[2nd Chapter of Acts]] concert in [[Norman, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.precious-testimonies.com/TestimonyCategories/SameSexEmotions/D_MJernigan.htm Jernigan's testimony: A Broken Heart] c/o precious-testimonies.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okbu.edu/news/view_article.php?id=1127 OBU]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jernigan believes his prior identification as homosexual was related to an erroneous childhood perception that he had been rejected by his father.  

Following the experience at the concert, Jernigan developed a ministry based on his personal experience, which he shares at churches and other locations around the world. He has also campaigned against the proposed Hate Crimes Bill (H.R. 1592), saying that the legislation's passage would strip him of his right to speak freely about his self-identification as ex-gay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americansfortruth.com/news/singer-dennis-jernigan-as-former-homosexual-hate-crimes-bill-would-make-him-of-less-value-under-law.html americansfortruth.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a concert at Wynne Baptist Church, Jernigan stated that he does not wish to be labeled as "ex-gay," but instead as "reborn" or as "[God's] new creation."

Jernigan voluntarily resigned his position as vice-chairman from Exodus International in June 2012 after it was revealed that he appeared (inadvertently or otherwise) to be a supporter of anti-sodomy laws in Jamaica - a country long known to be violently dangerous for homosexual people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exodus International Releases New Policy Statement On the Criminalization of Homosexuality|url=https://exgaywatch.com/2012/06/exodus-board-member-dennis-jernigan-resigns-over-jamaica-incident/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dewey Bozella''' (born 1959) is a former [[professional boxer]] who is best known for being [[imprisoned]] for a conviction which was eventually overturned. Convicted in 1983 for the murder of an elderly woman, Bozella served 26 years in prison before his conviction was overturned in 2009.&lt;ref name="dewey001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8837 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121215051348/http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8837 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-15 |title=Former boxer wrongly imprisoned for 26 years to speak Monday |date=April 2, 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-13 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==

Bozella was nine when his father beat his pregnant mother so badly that she later died.  He was a witness to the beating.  His father ran away and never returned. One of his brothers was stabbed to death, another was shot and killed, and a third died of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/story/2011-09-29/dewey-bozella/50611984/1 |title=After long injustice, Bozella will get his fight |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager, Bozella trained for a time with former world champion boxer Floyd Patterson.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/books/review/stand-tall-dewey-bozella-tamara-jones.html?mcubz=3&lt;/ref&gt; At 20,  Bozella was sentenced to nearly three years in prison for attempted robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/GCA00P00/WIQ3/WINQ130 |title=NYS Department of Corrections and Community Supervision |publisher=Nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov |date=2014-11-07 |accessdate=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a bachelor's degree from [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]] and a master’s from New York Theological Seminary.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.innocenceproject.org/dewey-bozella-exonerated-after-26-years/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged offense and wrongful conviction==
In 1977, 92-year-old Emma Crapser was murdered in her [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] apartment. Police alleged that Crapser walked in on a burglary that was being committed by a then 18-year-old Bozella, who then killed her. In 1983, Bozella was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. He continued to claim he was innocent and refused to admit to the crimes he was alleged to have committed, even when in front of the [[parole board]], who denied him parole on four occasions. Bozella contacted the [[Innocence Project]], who agreed to examine his case. When the Innocence Project discovered that there was no DNA evidence remaining to be tested, they referred the case to [[WilmerHale]]. Lawyers at WilmerHale discovered new evidence that had been suppressed by prosecutors showing Bozella was in fact innocent and had been framed. Supreme Court Justice James Rooney of [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]] agreed that the [[Dutchess County]] [[District Attorney]], John King, had failed to disclose crucial evidence which would have proved Bozella's innocence.&lt;ref name="dewey001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the text of the judgment see http://www.nysacdl.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bozella-opinion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dewey002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/article/20110713/NEWS01/107130335/Bozella-accept-ESPY-award-years-after-wrongful-murder-conviction |title=Bozella to accept ESPY award years after wrongful murder conviction |date=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 28, 2009, Bozella was finally released from prison after serving 26 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-16/free-man-bozella-wins-boxing-debut-at-52/3573740 Free man Bozella wins boxing debut at 52] - Australian Broadcasting Corporation - Retrieved 16 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deweybozella.com/friends&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison life===
Bozella was imprisoned in New York State, including at [[Sing Sing Correctional Facility]] in [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining, New York]]. While incarcerated at Sing Sing, he became the prison's light heavyweight boxing champion.&lt;ref name=dewey002 /&gt;

==Life after prison==
On October 28, 2009, after being released from custody, Bozella began working with youths at a local gym in [[Newburgh, New York]]. At the gym, which is now closed, he worked with teenagers teaching them about boxing and about the dangers of joining gangs. He frequently visits various organizations to deliver speeches about his life experiences. Bozella is a frequent sight at New York City area boxing cards.

Bozella currently lives in [[Fishkill, New York]] with his wife, Trena. While accepting an award in 2011, he told an [[ESPN]] reporter that he still dreamed of having at least one professional fight one day. In 2011, boxing champion [[Bernard Hopkins]] helped Bozella's dream come true.&lt;ref name=dewey002/&gt;

===2011 ESPY Awards===
On July 13, 2011, Bozella's life was chronicled in [[ESPN]]'s annual [[ESPY Award]] show in the [[Nokia Theatre L.A. Live|Nokia Theatre]] at [[L.A. Live]] in [[Los Angeles]], where he was honored as the recipient of the [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/article/20110713/NEWS01/107130335/Bozella-accept-ESPY-award-years-after-wrongful-murder-conviction?odyssey=mod |newswell|text|Environment|s ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince '''Diponegoro''' (born ''Bendara Raden Mas Mustahar''; later ''Bendara Raden Mas Antawirya'') (11 November 1785 – 8 January 1855),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogyes.com/en/yogyakarta-tourism-object/museum-and-monument/sasana-wiratama/|title=Sasana Wiratama: Commemorating The Struggle of Prince Diponegoro|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Dipanegara''', was a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] prince who opposed the Dutch [[Colonialism|colonial]] rule. The eldest son of the [[Sultanate of Yogyakarta|Yogyakartan Sultan]] [[Hamengkubuwono III]], he played an important role in the [[Java War]] between 1825 and 1830.

His five-year struggle against the Dutch control of [[Java]] has become celebrated by [[Indonesia]]ns throughout the years, acting as a source of inspiration for the fighters in the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] and nationalism in modern-day Indonesia among others.&lt;ref name="progenitor" /&gt; He is a national hero in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="kms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Daftar Nama Pahlawan Nasional Republik Indonesia (1)|language=Indonesia|url=http://www.kemsos.go.id/modules.php?name=Pahlawan&amp;opsi=mulai-1|publisher=Sekretariat Negara Indonesia|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67WW7R2g9?url=http://www.depsos.go.id/modules.php?name=Pahlawan&amp;opsi=mulai-1|archivedate=9 May 2012|accessdate=9 May 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:DiponegoroLeiden.jpg|thumb|left|Diponegoro (c.1830) &lt;br&gt;(Collection [[Leiden University Library]])]]

Diponegoro was born on 11 November 1785 in [[Yogyakarta]], and was the eldest son of Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono III]] of Yogyakarta. During his youth at the Yogyakartan court, major occurrences such as the dissolution of the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]], the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|British invasion of Java]], and subsequent return to Dutch rule. During the invasion, the Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono II]], pushed aside in his power on 1810 in favor of Diponegoro's father, used the general disruption to regain control. In 1812 however he was once more removed from the throne and exiled off-Java by the British forces. In this process, Diponegoro acted as an adviser to his father and had apparently provided aid to the British forces to the point where [[Sir Stamford Raffles|Raffles]] offered him the ''Sultan'' title which he declined, perhaps due to the fact that his father was still reigning.&lt;ref name="progenitor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Kroef|first1=Justus M.|title=Prince Diponegoro: Progenitor of Indonesian Nationalism|journal=The Far Eastern Quarterly|date=August 1949|volume=8|issue=4|pages=424|doi=10.2307/2049542}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|425–426}}

When the sultan died in 1814, Diponegoro was passed over for the succession to the throne in favor of his younger half brother, [[Hamengkubuwono IV]] (r. 1814-1821), who was supported by the Dutch despite the late Sultan's urging for Diponegoro to be the next Sultan. Being a devout Muslim, Diponegoro was alarmed by the relaxing of religious observance at his half brother's court in contrast with his own life of seclusion, as well as by the court's pro-Dutch policy.&lt;ref name="progenitor" /&gt;{{rp|427}}

In 1821, famine and plague spread in Java. Hamengkubuwono IV died on 1822 under mysterious circumstances, leaving only an infant son as heir. When the year-old boy was appointed as Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono V]], there was a dispute over his guardianship. Diponegoro was again passed over, though he believed he had been promised the right to succeed his half brother - even though such a succession was illegal under Islamic rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diponegoro - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761584175/diponegoro.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbOFGYo?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761584175/diponegoro.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="progenitor" /&gt;{{rp|427}} This series of natural disasters and political upheavals finally erupted into full-scale rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Fighting against the Dutch ==
{{main|Java War}}
[[File:Aanval van de colonne Le Bron de Vexela op Dipo Negoro nabij Gawok.jpg|thumb|Fighting between Diponegoro's forces and the Dutch colonial forces in Gawok (1900 painting)]]

Dutch colonial rule was becoming unpopular among local farmers because of tax rises, crop failures and among Javanese nobles because the Dutch colonial authorities deprived them of their right to lease land. Diponogoro was widely believed to be the [[Ratu Adil]], the just ruler predicted in the [[Satrio Piningit|Pralembang Jayabaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carey|first1=Peter|title=The origins of the Java War (1825–30)|journal=The English Historical Review|date=1976|volume=XCI|issue=CCCLVIII|pages=52–78|doi=10.1093/ehr/XCI.CCCLVIII.52}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52}} [[Mount Merapi]]'s eruption in 1822 and a cholera epidemic in 1824 furthered the view that a cataclysm is inbound, eliciting widespread support for Diponegoro.&lt;ref name="carey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=Peter|title=The power of prophecy : Prince Dipanagara and the end of an old order in Java, 1785-1855|date=2007|publisher=KITLV Press|location=Leiden|isbn=9789067183031|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|603}}

In the days leading up to the war's outbreak, no action was taken by local Dutch officials although rumors of his upcoming insurrection had been floating about. Prophesies and stories, ranging from visions from the tomb of [[Ageng Tirtayasa|Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa]] to his contact with [[Nyai Roro Kidul]], spread across the populace.&lt;ref name="progenitor" /&gt;

The beginning of the war saw large losses on the side of the Dutch, due to their lack of coherent strategy and commitment in fighting Diponegoro's [[guerrilla warfare]].  Ambushes were set up, and food supplies were denied to the Dutch troops.  
The Dutch finally committed themselves to controlling the spreading rebellion by increasing the number of troops and sending [[Hendrik Merkus de Kock|General De Kock]] to stop the insurgency.  De Kock developed a strategy of fortified camps (benteng) and mobile forces. Heavily fortified and well-defended soldiers occupied key landmarks to limit the movement of Diponegoro's troops while mobile forces tried to find and fight the rebels. From 1829, Diponegoro definitively lost the initiative and he was put in a defensive position; first in [[Fort Willem II, Ungaran|Ungaran]], then in the palace of the Resident in Semarang, before finally retreating to [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. Many troops and leaders were defeated or deserted.

== Capture and exile ==
[[File:Raden Saleh - Diponegoro arrest.jpg|thumb|''[[The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro]]'' by [[Raden Saleh]]]]
[[File:Nicolaas Pieneman - The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro to General De Kock.jpg|thumb|''[[The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro to General De Kock]]'', by Dutch painter [[Nicolaas Pieneman]]]]
In 1830 Diponegoro's military was as good as beaten and negotiations were started. Diponegoro demanded to have a free state under a sultan and wanted to become the Muslim leader (caliph) for the whole of Java. In March 1830 he was invited to negotiate under a flag of truce. He accepted and met at the town of [[Magelang]] but was taken prisoner on 28 March despite the flag of truce. De Kock claims that he had warned several Javanese nobles to tell Diponegoro he had to lessen his previous demands or that he would be forced to take other measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Knooppunt Leidse Geschieddidactiek |url=http://iclweb01.fsw.leidenuniv.nl/walhain/eindexamen/Level_4/cse/Indonesie/schoolboeken/Diponegoro/diponego.htm#oorzaken |accessdate=28 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726080051/http://iclweb01.fsw.leidenuniv.nl/walhain/eindexamen/Level_4/cse/Indonesie/schoolboeken/Diponegoro/diponego.htm |archivedate=26 July 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstances of Diponegoro's arrest were seen differently by himself and the Dutch. The former saw the arrest as a betrayal due to the flag of truce, while the latter declared that he had surrendered. Imagery of the event, by Javanese [[Raden Saleh]] and Dutch [[Nicolaas Pieneman]], depicted Diponegoro differently - the former visualizing him as a defiant victim, the latter as a subjugated man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fotouhi|first1=Sanaz|last2=Zeiny|first2=Esmail|title=Seen and Unseen: Visual Cultures of Imperialism|date=2017|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004357013|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DjI9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=25 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after his arrest, he was taken to [[Semarang]] and later to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], where he was detained at the basement of what is today the [[Fatahillah Museum]]. On 1830, he was taken to [[Manado]], [[Sulawesi]] by ship.&lt;ref name="jg"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Resting Place of Indonesian Great Diponegoro|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/the-resting-place-of-indonesian-great-diponegoro/|accessdate=25 November 2017|work=Jakarta Globe|date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several years in [[Manado]], he was moved to [[Makassar]] in July 1833 where he was kept within [[Fort Rotterdam]] due to the Dutch believing that the prison was not strong enough to contain him. Despite his prisoner status, his wife Ratnaningsih and some of his followers accompanied him into exile and he received high-profile visitors including 16 year old Dutch [[Prince Henry of the Netherlands (1820–1879)|Prince Henry]] in 1837. Diponegoro also composed manuscripts on Javanese history and wrote his autobiography, ''Babad Diponegoro'', during his exile. His physical health deteriorated due to old age, and he died on 8 January 1855.&lt;ref name="jg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Jean Gelman|title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories|date=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300097093|page=235|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywyHT4wQvMMC&amp;pg=PA235|accessdate=25 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Said|first1=SM|title=Hari-hari Terakhir Pangeran Diponegoro di Pengasingan|url=https://daerah.sindonews.com/read/1101703/29/hari-hari-terakhir-pangeran-diponegoro-di-pengasingan-1460847447/26|accessdate=25 November 2017|work=Seputar Indonesia|date=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before he died, Diponegoro mandated that he was to be buried in ''Kampung Melayu'', a neighborhood then inhabited by the Chinese and the Dutch. This was followed, with the Dutch donating 1.5 hectares of land for his graveyard which today has shrunk to just 550 square meters. Later, his wife and followers were also buried in the same complex.&lt;ref name="jg"/&gt; His tomb is today visited by pilgrims - often military officers and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zakaria|first1=Anang|title=DPRD Yogya Ziarah ke Makam Diponegoro di Makassar|url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/679670/dprd-yogya-ziarah-ke-makam-diponegoro-di-makassar|accessdate=25 November 2017|work=Tempo|date=30 June 2015|language=id-ID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Diponegoro's dynasty]] would survive to the present day, with their sultans holding secular powers as the governors of [[Special Region of Yogyakarta]]. In 1969, a large monument was erected in Tegalrejo, outside [[Yogyakarta]], with sponsorship from the military where Diponegoro's palace was believed to have stood, although at that time there were little to show for such a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Benedict R.

In 1973, under the presidency of [[Suharto]], Diponegoro was made a [[National Hero of Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="kms"/&gt;

[[Kodam IV/Diponegoro]], [[Indonesian Army]] regional command for the Central Java Military Region, is named after him. The Indonesian Navy has named two ships after him. The first of these was the lead ship ''KRI Diponegoro'': a [[Sigma-class corvette]] purchased from the Netherlands. [[Diponegoro University]] in [[Semarang]] was also named after him, along with many major roads in Indonesian cities. Diponegoro is also depicted in Javanese stanzas, ''[[wayang]]'' and performing arts, including self-authored ''Babad Diponegoro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sumarsam|title=Javanese Gamelan and the West|date=2013|publisher=University Rochester Press|pages=65–73|isbn=9781580464451|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uM5Dj5qDA84C&amp;pg=PA65|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The militancy of people's resistance in Java would rise again during the [[Indonesian Revolution]], which saw the country gain independence from the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simatupang|first1=T.

She has testified before the U.S. House International Relations Committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Moscow Duma, and the Czech Parliament.

Hughes has written extensively on the prevalence of these issues of exploitation of women within Islamic Fundamentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Publications by Donna M.

==Biography==
Hughes was raised on a farm in central [[Pennsylvania]]. She later attended [[Pennsylvania State University]], earning degrees in [[animal science]] before earning a PhD in [[genetics]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=hughes2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hughes | first = Donna | title = Scientific, feminist, and personal epistemologies: conflicts and opportunities | journal = Women's Studies Quarterly, Special Issue: Building Inclusive Science | volume = 28 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 305–312 | date = Spring–Summer 2000 | jstor = 40004462 | ref = harv }} [http://www.feministpress.org/books/sue-v-rosser/building-inclusive-science Via The Feminist Press.] [http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/scifemep.htm Text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student, she started volunteering at a rape crisis center and battered women’s shelter. For several years, she staffed the abuse hotline and co-facilitated support groups for adult survivors of child sexual abuse. During this time, she started to read [[feminist]] analyses of [[violence against women]], particularly sexual violence and exploitation. Hughes writes that she began to feel emotional and [[cognitive dissonance]] between her scientific studies and the feminist activist work she was doing. Initially an instructor in both genetics and women's studies, an increasingly critical view of what she felt was the disconnected nature of science led her to focus on women's studies.&lt;ref name=hughes2000/&gt;

Hughes later served as a lecturer on women's studies at [[University of Bradford]], UK, between 1994 and 1996, before moving on to a full professorship at [[University of Rhode Island]], where she holds the Eleanor M. and Oscar M. Carlson Endowed Chair in Women's Studies. She has also served as Education and Research Coordinator for the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Klein | first1 = Renate | last2 = Hawthorne | first2 = Susan | contribution = Feminist resistance to war and violence in Serbia | editor-last1 = Klein | editor-first1 = Renate | editor-last2 = Hawthorne | editor-first2 = Susan | title = Cyberfeminism: connectivity, critique and creativity | page = 422 | publisher = Spinifex Press | location = North Melbourne | year = 1999 | isbn = 9781875559688 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NT5F5DabEc0C&amp;pg=PA422 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes is a co-founder with Melanie Shapiro of Citizens Against Trafficking.

==Research, Teaching, and Scholarship==

Hughes is a leading international researcher on [[human trafficking]]. She has completed research on the trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation in several countries, including the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and Korea. She does research and writing on women's rights. Her topic areas include: violence, slavery, sexual exploitation, Islamic fundamentalism, and women's organized resistance to violence and exploitation. She has also worked on issues related to women, science and technology.

Additionally, she was the first to publish research and analysis on the role of the [[Internet]] in facilitating sexual exploitation and trafficking of women and girls, and on the [[mail-order bride]] industry. She has also written extensively on women's rights in the [[Islamic world]]. Hughes has also published several articles on the role of [[women in science]] and technology.&lt;ref name=uri/&gt;&lt;ref name=hughes2000/&gt;

==Activism and views==
She is one of the leading advocates of the “prohibitionist” view of sexual labour. She is seen by many as a key figure linking the [[feminist]] and [[social conservative]] movements against sex work, which these movements refer to as "sex trafficking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hughes| first = Donna M.| title = Lilya and Uncle Tom: a landmark work of the contemporary abolitionist movement | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/207426/lilya-and-uncle-tom-donna-m-hughes | work = [[National Review|National Review Online]] | publisher = National Review, Inc. | date = 8 July 2003}}

Hughes suggested that government funded HIV prevention programs should check that sex workers were not victims of abuse, rather than simply hand out condoms. In 2002 she went before the House Committee on International Relations to report several harm-reduction programs that had received US funding, carried out by NGOs such as [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], [[EMPOWER]] Thailand,  International Human Rights Law Group, and the Dutch anti-trafficking organization La Strada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Various | title = Foreign government complicity in human trafficking: a review of the State Department's "2002 Trafficking in Persons Report" | url = http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/intlrel/hfa80288.000/hfa80288_0f.htm | website = commdocs.house.gov | publisher = [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on International Relations, U.S. House of Representatives]] | date = 19 June 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, 2003, she spoke before the Senate subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs "There are billions of dollars being spent on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, and a significant portion is directed for prevention in high risk groups such as women and children in prostitution.

==Prostitution in Rhode Island controversy==
From 2006-2009, Hughes was a leading figure in the campaign to end the decriminalized status of indoor [[prostitution in Rhode Island]],&lt;ref name=carnival/&gt;&lt;ref name=projo2006&gt;{{Cite news | last = Arsenault | first = Mark | title = Cicilline to co-host forum on human trafficking, parlors | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043336/http://www.projo.com/news/politics/content/rihuman25_11-25-06_QA30TMK.338505d.html | archive-date = 29 June 2011 | url = http://www.projo.com/news/politics/content/rihuman25_11-25-06_QA30TMK.338505d.html | work = [[The Providence Journal]] | publisher = [[Local Media Group]] | accessdate = 16 August 2010 | date = 25 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Arditi | first = Lynn | title = Sex workers testify at Senate hearing on prostitution bill | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629021314/http://www.projo.com/news/content/PROSTITUTION_BILL_06-19-09_UIEPAKU_v59.3cd847f.html | archive-date = 29 June 2011 | url = http://www.projo.com/news/content/PROSTITUTION_BILL_06-19-09_UIEPAKU_v59.3cd847f.html | work = [[The Providence Journal]] | publisher = [[Local Media Group]] | accessdate = 16 August 2010 | date = 17 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that police could conduct anti-sex trafficking investigations. She is a founding member of the Rhode Island group, Citizens Against Trafficking (CAT) in 2009. The initial legislative battles over indoor prostitution are documented in the 2009 documentary film ''[[Happy Endings?]]'', in which Hughes appears, speaking at a community forum on [[human trafficking]] and testifying before the state legislature to change the [[Prostitution in Rhode Island|prostitution law]].&lt;ref name=Happy&gt;{{Cite video| people = [[Tara Hurley|Hurley, Tara]] (director)| medium = documentary| publisher = It's Not Easy Productions| title = [[Happy Endings?]] | date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Hughes wrote several opinion pieces in the ''[[Providence Journal]]'' supporting a version of the legislation with stronger penalties for prostitution and taking the [[Rhode Island State Senate]] to task for what she viewed as its de facto support for continuing decriminalization of prostitution.&lt;ref name=carnival/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hughes |first=Donna M. |title=Senators’ prostitution bill is a sham |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629022041/http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_hughes4_09-04-09_2LFI0UK_v9.3f90197.html |archive-date=29 June 2011 |url=http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_hughes4_09-04-09_2LFI0UK_v9.3f90197.html |work=[[The Providence Journal]] |publisher=[[Local Media Group]] |date=4 September 2009 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20101016103945/http://citizensagainsttrafficking.org/uploads/Senators__Prostitution_Bill_Is_a_Sham.pdf Pdf of article, pp. 1-2.]&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the bill was signed into law in November 2009.&lt;ref name="Arditi, Lynn"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Arditi | first = Lynn | title = Bill signing finally outlaws prostitution in R.I. | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111007072124/http://newsblog.projo.com/2009/11/governor-carcieri-signed-into.html | archive-date = 7 October 2011 | url = http://newsblog.projo.com/2009/11/governor-carcieri-signed-into.html | work = [[The Providence Journal]] | publisher = [[Local Media Group]] | accessdate = 3 October 2009 | date = 3 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Rhode Island State Senators wrote editorials disputing Hughes claim that they had kept indoor prostitution legal, with Senator Charles Levesque taking Hughes to task for, in his view, providing a highly distorted reading of the legislation passed by the RI Senate.&lt;ref name=McCaffrey&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Jabour |first1=Paul V. |last2=McCaffrey |first2=Michael J. |author-link1=Paul Jabour |author-link2=Michael McCaffrey |title=Commentary: Fixing 'sex-worker industry': Senate ends prostitution loophole |url=http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_jabour30_08-30-09_2LFGRFR_v9.3f8d393.html |work=[[The Providence Journal]] |publisher=[[Local Media Group]] |accessdate=13 July 2014 |date=30 August 2009 }} Article ID: 152423C09579D550.

Soon after the Rhode Island prostitution law hearings, Hughes was involved in a controversy surrounding the opening of the Center for Sexual Pleasure and Health (CSPH), a [[sexual education]] center in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]] organized by [[Megan Andelloux]], a sex educator who had testified before the Rhode Island Senate in opposition to criminalizing indoor prostitution. Supporters of Andelloux claim that in September 2009, the opening of the CSPH was blocked after an [[email]] was sent by Hughes to Pawtucket city council members (stating, "Hello, A center for 'sexual rights' and 'sexual pleasure' is opening in Pawtucket"),&lt;ref name=pphoenix1&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hauk| first = Alexis| title = Hot controversy over sexuality center in Pawtucket| work = [[Providence Phoenix]]| publisher = [[Phoenix Media/Communications Group]]| accessdate = 11 July 2010| date = 30 September 2009| url = http://thephoenix.com/Providence/News/90630-Hot-controversy-over-sexuality-center-in-Pawtucket/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091009034824/http://thephoenix.com/Providence/News/90630-Hot-controversy-over-sexuality-center-in-Pawtucket/| archivedate = 9 October 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pdd3&gt;{{Cite web| last = Lawrence| first = Matthew| title = Donna Hughes on our nation's autoerotic asphyxiation epidemic (blog) | work = Providence Daily Dose | publisher = PDD via [[WordPress]] | accessdate = 11 July 2010| date = 2 October 2009| url = http://providencedailydose.com/2009/10/09/donna-hughes-on-our-nations-autoerotic-asphyxiation-epidemic/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WeNews&gt;{{Cite news| last = Littlefield| first = Amy| title = Female sexologist awaits Pawtucket Zoning Board | work = [[Women's eNews]] | publisher = Women's eNews, Inc. | accessdate = 11 July 2010 | date = 3 December 2009 | url = http://womensenews.org/story/health/091202/female-sexologist-awaits-pawtucket-zoning-board}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rimonthly&gt;{{Cite news| last = Minkin| first = Tracey| title = The SexEd Warrior-Queen| work = [[Rhode Island Monthly]] | publisher = Rhode Island Monthly Communications | date = April 2010| url=http://www.rimonthly.com/Rhode-Island-Monthly/April-2010/The-SexEd-Warrior-Queen/}}&lt;/ref&gt; also citing remarks made about Andelloux in an earlier ''Providence Journal'' editorial by Hughes,&lt;ref name=carnival/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andelloux-letter/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdd1/&gt;&lt;ref name=rimonthly/&gt; as well as in a bulletin on the Citizens Against Trafficking website.&lt;ref name=rimonthly/&gt;&lt;ref name=cat2&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hughes |first1=Donna |last2=Brooks |first2=Margaret |title=Sex radicals' vision for Rhode Island |journal=Citizens Against Trafficking |date=23 September 2009 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4862316 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20101016104457/http://citizensagainsttrafficking.org/uploads/Sex_Radicals_Vision_for_Rhode_Island.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; A 6-month [[zoning]] battle followed with the city of Pawtucket; the CSPH was eventually allowed to open in early 2010.&lt;ref name=rimonthly/&gt;

'''English names''' are names used in, or originating in, [[England]].
In England as elsewhere in the [[English-speaking world]], a complete name usually consists of a [[given name]], commonly referred to as a first name or Christian name, and a (most commonly [[patrilineal]]) [[family name]] or [[surname]], also referred to as a last name. There can be several given names, some of these being often referred to as a second name, or middle name(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.behindthename.com/glossary/view/english_names | title=English Names | work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Given names==
Most given names used in England do not have English etymology. Most traditional names are [[Roman naming conventions|Latin or Romance]],  [[List of biblical names|Christian or Biblical names]]/[[Hebrew]] (Daniel, David, John, Michael), [[Greek name|Greek]] (Nicholas, Peter, Paul) or [[Germanic names]] adopted via the transmission of [[Old French]]/[[Norman language|Norman]], such as [[Robert]], [[Richard]], [[Henry (given name)|Henry]] or [[William (name)|William]].
There remains a limited set of given names which have an actual English etymology (see  [[Anglo-Saxon names]]); examples include  [[Alfred (name)|Alfred]], [[Edgar]], [[Edmund]], [[Edwin]], [[Harold (given name)|Harold]] and [[Oswald (given name)|Oswald]]. A distinctive feature of Anglophone names is the surnames of important families used as given names, originally to indicate political support or patronage. Many examples have now become normal names chosen because parents like them, and any political sense lost. Most are male names like Cecil, Gerald, Howard, Percy, Montague, Stanley or Gordon, though some have female versions like Cecilia or Geraldine. Other languages have few equivalents, although the saint's surname Xavier is often used by Roman Catholics.

During most of the 19th century, the most popular given names were [[Mary (given name)|Mary]] and either [[John (given name)|John]] or [[William (name)|William]] for girls and boys, respectively. Throughout the Early Modern period, the variation of given names was comparatively small; the three most frequent male given names accounted for close to 50% of male population throughout this period. For example, of the boys born in London in the year 1510, 24.4% were named [[John (given name)|John]], 13.3% were named [[Thomas (name)|Thomas]] and 11.7% were named William.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Galbi. ''Long-Term Trends in Personal Given Name Frequencies in the UK'', 2002 [http://www.galbithink.org/names.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; A trend towards more diversity in given names began in the mid-19th century, and by 1900, 22.9% of the newborn boys, and 16.2% of the newborn girls in the UK shared the top three given names. The trend continued during the 20th century, and by 1994, these figures had fallen to 11% and 8.6%, respectively. This trend is a result of a combination of greater [[individualism]] in the choice of names, and the increasing [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922|ethnic heterogeneity]] of UK population, which led to a wider range of frequent given names from non-European traditions.

==Surnames==
English surnames appeared in about the [[Norman England|11th century]]. The introduction of parish registers in 1538 contributed significantly to the stabilization of the surname system, but it was not until the late 17th century that fixed surnames were introduced throughout England.

According to the [[Office for National Statistics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}, the top ten most frequent surnames in England during the 1990s were:
#[[Smith (surname)|Smith]]
#[[Jones (surname)|Jones]]
#[[Williams (surname)|Williams]]
#[[Taylor (surname)|Taylor]]
#[[Brown (surname)|Brown]]
#[[Davies]]
#[[Evans (surname)|Evans]]
#[[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]]
#[[Thomas (surname)|Thomas]]
#[[Johnson]]

===Compound surnames===
{{main|Double-barrelled name}}

Double-barrelled names may be formed for a variety of reasons, including combining of spouses' surnames upon marriage or, more commonly in the past, adding another family's surname as a condition of inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Denison, David  |author2=Hogg, Richard |date=2008 |title=A History of the English Language|publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages= 334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compound surnames in English feature two words, often joined by a hyphen or hyphens, for example [[Henry Hepburne-Scott, 10th Lord Polwarth|Henry Hepburne-Scott]], with some families having as many as three or four words making up their surname, such as [[Charles Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton]] and [[Alexander Charles Robert Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 9th Marquess of Londonderry]].  However, it is not unusual for compound surnames to be composed of separate words not linked by a hyphen, for example [[Iain Duncan Smith]], a former leader of the [[British Conservative Party|Conservative Party]], whose surname is "Duncan Smith".

'''Fawn Hall''' (born 1959) is a former [[secretary]] to Lieutenant Colonel [[Oliver North]] and a notable figure in the [[Iran-Contra affair]] by helping him shred confidential documents.

==Early life==
Born in [[Annandale, Virginia]], in 1959, Hall graduated from [[Annandale High School]] in 1977. She began working part-time in a clerical position for the [[United States Navy]], beginning in January 1976 while she was in high school.&lt;ref name="INQ"/&gt; After graduating, she began working full-time for the Navy at the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]].

==Involvement in Iran-Contra==
Hall was detached from the Navy to work at the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] on February 26, 1983, to work for Oliver North. She worked for North until she was fired on November 25, 1986, at the height of the scandal.&lt;ref name="INQ"&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1987-02-25/news/26180694_1_iran-contra-fawn-hall-iran-affairs Meet Iran Affair's 'Mystery Woman'], ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', February 25, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall's mother, Wilma Hall, was secretary to [[Robert McFarlane]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Reeves, Richard]]. ''President Reagan: Triumph of Imagination''. New York City: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2005, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan's [[National Security Advisor (United States)|national security advisor]], North's superior and a major player in the Iran-Contra affair.

In one mishap, Hall transposed the digits of a Swiss bank account number, resulting in a contribution from the [[Sultan of Brunei]] to the Contras being credited to a Swiss businessman's bank account instead of the intended account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/22/world/iran-contra-hearings-brunei-regains-10-million.html|title=BRUNEI REGAINS $10 MILLION|date=July 22, 1987|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 1987, Hall, herself, began two days of testimony in front of the [[United States Congress]]. She confessed to altering, [[Paper shredder|shredding]] a large number of documents (so much was destroyed, she said, that the office shredder jammed), and smuggling others in her boots and inside her clothing and giving them to North on November 25, 1986, who was fired after his role in orchestrating potentially illegal aid to the Nicaraguan Contras became public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1987-06-09/news/26185616_1_nsc-files-diversion-memo-fawn-hall Hall Details Effort To Hide North's Role Destroyed Documents On Contra Aid], ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', June 9, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP87"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/tours/scandal/fawnhall.htm|title=washingtonpost.com: Hall Testifies of Necessity 'To Go Above Written Law'|date=June 10, 1987|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among her other testimony was a claim that, "Sometimes you have to go above the law."&lt;ref name="WP87"/&gt; Journalist [[Bob Woodward]] recorded that her legal defense justification was summarized in her words: 'We shred everything'.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Woodward: ''Veil: the Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1987, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, in exchange for her testimony against North for Iran-Contra affair , she was granted immunity from prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, North Trial Testimony, 3/22/89, pp. 5311–16, and 3/23/89, pp. 5373–80, 5385–87; Chapter 5 Fawn Hall 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after the Iran-Contra affair==
After the Iran-Contra affair broke, Hall briefly went back to work for the Navy in 1987. She was invited to the 1987 [[White House Correspondents' Dinner]] by journalist Michael Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-07-06/the-remaking-of-donald-trump |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |title=The Remaking of Donald Trump |first=Joshua |last=Green |date=July 6, 2017 |quote=Ever since 1987, when, in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal, the journalist Michael Kelly brought one of its central figures, Fawn Hall, the documenting-shredding secretary to Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her congressional testimony in June 1987, she left government service and signed with the [[William Morris Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-19/news/vw-679_1_fawn-hall|title=Fawn Hall Signs With Superagent|work=latimes|date=August 19, 1987|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unsuccessfully pursued a media career in the Washington, D.C., area.

The Sugermans lived in an affluent section of Los Angeles called the [[Hollywood Hills]].&lt;ref name="LA"/&gt; It was reported that Sugerman introduced Hall to [[crack cocaine]] shortly after their marriage. She developed an addiction and suffered a non-lethal overdose in 1994. Afterward, she went into rehab.&lt;ref name="LA"/&gt; Sugerman died in 2005 of [[lung cancer]], and in 2007 Hall listed the house for sale for almost $2.5 million.&lt;ref name="LA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestalker.blogspot.com/2007/02/fawns-swan-song.html|title=The Real Estalker: Fawn's Swan Song|date=February 7, 2007|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012 Hall has lived a quiet life in [[West Hollywood]], working at a bookstore and staying out of the public eye.&lt;ref name="LA"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the 2017 film ''[[American Made (film)|American Made]]'', she was portrayed by [[Mickey Sumner]].

She’s mentioned in the [[American Dad]] song on Ollie North.

'''Hermann Müller''' (21 October 1850 in [[Tägerwilen]], [[Thurgau]], Switzerland – 18 January 1927, in [[Wädenswil]], Zurich), was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Botany|botanist]], [[Plant physiology|plant physiologist]], [[Oenology|oenologist]] and grape breeder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D31541.php Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz: Müller [Müller-Thurgau&amp;#93;, Hermann] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geschichte-des-weines.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=401:mueller-thurgau-hermann-1850-1927&amp;catid=45:persoenlichkeiten-a-z&amp;Itemid=83 Gesellschaft für Geschichte des Weines: Müller-Thurgau, Hermann (1850-1927)] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called himself Müller-Thurgau, taking the name of his home canton.

==Biography==
Hermann Müller was born to Konrad Müller, a master baker and vintner, and his wife Maria Egloff, the daughter of Karl Anton Egloff, a wine merchant of [[Oestrich-Winkel|Oestrich, Hessen]]. He attended the Lehrerseminar Kreuzlingen (Kreuzlingen Teachers College) (1869-70). He taught in [[Stein am Rhein]] (1870-72) while studying at the [[ETH Zürich|Polytechnikum Zürich]] (1872 graduate). He then attended the [[University of Würzburg]] for graduate studies under [[Julius von Sachs]], was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PdD]] in 1874 and stayed some time as Sachs' assistant. During the years 1876−1890 he worked at the [[Forschungsanstalt Geisenheim|Prussian Institute for Horticulture and Viticulture]] (''Königlich Preussische Lehranstalt für Obst- und Weinbau'') in [[Geisenheim]], [[Rheingau]] where he led its experimental station for plant physiology. 

In 1891 he returned to Switzerland as director of the newly created Experimental Station and School for Horticulture and Viticulture (''Versuchsstation und Schule für Obst-, Wein- und Gartenbau'') in Wädenswil, where he stayed until his 1924 retirement. From 1902, he was also connected to Polytechnikum Zürich as professor of botany.

He worked on teams which investigated fertility of the vine, vine diseases, and malolactic fermentation in wine.

In 1890, he was made an honorary member of the German Viticultural Association and in 1920 he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Bern]].

Müller researched and published on a wide range of topics in viticulture and winemaking, including the biology of vine flowering, assimilation of nutrients by the vine, vine diseases, [[Fermentation (wine)|alcoholic fermentation of wine]], breeding of [[yeast in winemaking|strains of yeast]] with specific properties, [[malolactic fermentation]], development of [[wine fault]]s, and methods for producing alcohol-free grape juice. 

== Breeding of the Müller-Thurgau grape variety ==
{{main|Müller-Thurgau}}
During his time in Geisenheim, Müller created the grape variety [[Müller-Thurgau]] in a breeding programme initiated in 1882, by crossing [[Riesling]] with [[Madeleine Royale]], although for a long time it was erroneously assumed to be Riesling x [[Silvaner]]. Müller's goal was to combine the aromatic properties of Riesling with the earlier and more reliable ripening of Silvaner. Experimental plantations continued in Geisenheim until 1890, and in 1891 150 plants were shipped to Wädenswil where trials continued under Heinrich Schellenberg (1868−1967). The most successful clone of the trials (serial no. 58) was propagated in 1897 under the designation Riesling x Silvaner 1. Vines of this variety were distributed in Switzerland and abroad from 1908, and in 1913, 100 vines of this variety were taken to Germany by August Dern (1858−1930), who had worked with Müller in Geisenheim. Dern introduced the name "Müller-Thurgau" for the variety, while Müller himself continued to call it Riesling x Silvaner 1, although he did express doubts that this was the actual parentage of the new variety, and speculated that some misidentification of vine material could have occurred in the move from Geisenheim to Wädenswil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wein-plus.eu/en/M%C3%BCller-Thurgau_3.0.1450.html Wein-Plus Glossar: Müller-Thurgau], accessed 23 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="125 Jahre"&gt;[http://www.antes-web.de/125JahreMuellerThurgau.htm 125 Jahre Müller-Thurgau], accessed 14 October 2009 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experimental plantations of Müller-Thurgau in Germany were conducted from 1920, and its breakthrough from 1938 is credited to the grape breeder [[Georg Scheu]] in [[Alzey]].&lt;ref name="125 Jahre"/&gt; By the 1950s it had become the most cultivated of any newly created grape varieties. It was the most planted grape variety of Germany from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s, and is still the second-most planted.

'''Jamil Ibrahim Pasha''' was a [[Syria]]n politician during [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandatory]] rule. He among the leading dignitaries of [[Aleppo]] and during the [[Hananu Revolt]] against the French occupation of northern Syria, he was one of principal intermediaries between the Syrian rebels and the Turkish forces of [[Mustafa Kemal]].

==Biography==
Jamil Ibrahim Pasha was a [[Sunni Muslim]] and was described as an "Arabized Kurd" by historian [[Philip Khoury]].&lt;ref&gt;Khoury, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; A native of [[Aleppo]], he enrolled in the Ottoman Military College in [[Istanbul]] and joined the reformist [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP), which took power in the Ottoman state in 1908 during the [[Young Turk Revolution]]. Ibrahim Pasha served in the [[Ottoman army]] during the [[Balkan Wars]], a series of conflicts between the Ottomans and nationalist forces in their empire's Balkan territories between 1912 and 1913. During [[World War I]] and the 1916 [[Arab Revolt]] against the Ottomans, Ibrahim Pasha advocated for preserving the unity of the Ottoman Empire. However, following the Ottomans' fall, he became allied with the [[Arab nationalist]] forces in Syria.&lt;ref name="Khoury107"&gt;Khoury, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

France gained full control of Syria in 1920 after defeated the Arab government of King [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal I]] in July 1920. During this time, guerrilla groups and political activists and dignitaries opposed to French rule launched a revolt against the French, known as the [[Hananu Revolt]] after its main political leader, [[Ibrahim Hananu]]. Faisal's Arab government had been the main financial backer of the revolt, but after its fall, Hananu and the rebels turned to Turkish guerrillas also fighting the French in southwestern [[Anatolia]], which borders the Aleppo region. Jamil Ibrahim Pasha became a main liaison between the Syrian rebels and the Turkish guerrillas, who were led by [[Mustafa Kemal]]. Jamil Ibrahim Pasha met with Mustafa Kemal in the late summer of 1920 to finalize plans for a Turkish-Syrian military campaign against French forces.&lt;ref name="Khoury107"/&gt; The Hananu revolt dissipated by the summer of 1921.

[[File:National Bloc assembled at Marjeh Square, 1939.jpg|thumb|right|A delegation of National Bloc politicians at the Syrian government's [[Damascus]] headquarters, 1939. Jamil Ibrahim Pasha is the first from the left in the second row]]

Following the revolt's collapse, Ibrahim Pasha maintained strong links to Aleppo's population. Of all of Aleppo's political leaders, Ibrahim Pasha had the closest ties to the inhabitants of Aleppo's nationalist-dominated quarters. At his advice, high school students throughout the city posted themselves at voting booths to encourage would-be voters to boycott the parliamentary elections of 1925, which coincided with the outbreak of the [[Great Syrian Revolt]] (1925–1927) against the French. The effort was a major success, with 23% of registered voters participating in the polls versus 40% in the 1923 elections. Ibrahim Pasha and 42 other Aleppine boycott leaders were subsequently arrested by the French authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Khoury, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, Ibrahim Pasha and many of the other pro-revolt leadership of Syria were amnestied by the French and in March Ibrahim Pasha joined the [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]]. The latter was a political opposition movement that called for Syria's independence. Ibrahim Pasha became one of the leaders of the movement from Aleppo,&lt;ref&gt;Khoury, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the National Bloc Council, the movement's 38-member executive body.&lt;ref&gt;Khoury, pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Boyle''' (born 17 May 1944) is a Scottish gangster and convicted murderer who became a sculptor and novelist after his release from prison.

==Biography==
In 1967, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of another gangland figure, William "Babs" Rooney, but released after 14 years. He has always denied killing Rooney but has acknowledged having been a violent and sometimes ruthless moneylender from the [[Gorbals]], one of the roughest areas of Glasgow. During his incarceration in the special unit of [[Barlinnie Prison]], he turned to art and wrote an autobiography, ''[[A Sense of Freedom]]'' (1977), which has since been filmed and starred [[David Hayman]] as Jimmy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/stop-the-world-i-want-to-change-it-1.792018|title=Stop the world, I want to change it|last=McGlone|first=Jackie|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|location=Glasgow|date=26 September 1992|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle always maintained his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/08/99/edinburgh_festival_99/431661.stm|title=Jimmy Boyle's life less ordinary|work=[[BBC News]]|date=27 August 1999|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his release from prison on 26 October 1981 he moved to [[Edinburgh]] to continue his artistic career. He designed the largest concrete sculpture in Europe called "Gulliver" for the [[Craigmillar Festival Society]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/boyle-sculpture-expected-to-fetch-20-000-at-auction-1.1040386|title=Boyle sculpture expected to fetch £20,000 at auction|last=Laughlan|first=Kim|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|date=10 July 2010|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Boyle set up the Gateway Exchange with his wife, Sarah, and artist [[Evlynn Smith]]; a charitable organisation offering art therapy workshops to recovering drug addicts and ex-convicts. Though the project secured funding from private sources (including [[Sean Connery]], [[Billy Connolly]] and [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|John Paul Getty]]) it lasted only a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;targetRule=10&amp;xml=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F04%2F30%2Fdb3002.xml|title=Obituary: Evlynn Smith|accessdate=22 April 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624021554/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;targetRule=10&amp;xml=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F04%2F30%2Fdb3002.xml |archivedate=24 June 2007}}, ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''; accessed 19 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boyle has published ''Pain of Confinement: Prison Diaries'' (1984), and a novel, ''Hero of the Underworld'' (1999). The latter was adapted for a French film, ''La Rage et le Rêve des Condamnés'' (''The Anger and Dreams of the Condemned''), and won the best [[Documentary film|documentary]] prize at the Fifa [[Montreal]] awards in 2002. He also wrote a novel, ''A Stolen Smile'', which is about the theft of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and how it ends up hidden on a Scottish housing estate. It was rumoured that [[Disney]] bought the film rights but Boyle has denied that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1236102003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050506174657/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1236102003|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 May 2005|title=Scotland on Sunday|publisher=Scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com|accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1446321/Disney-in-2m-deal-for-novel-by-Jimmy-Boyle.html|title=Disney in £2m deal for novel by Jimmy Boyle|last=Cramb|first=Auslan|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 November 2003|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/2485529.stm|title=French fall for Glasgow hardman|work=[[BBC News]]|date=17 November 2002|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he was named as a financial donor of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/161057.stm|title='Luvvies' for Labour|work=BBC News|date=30 August 1998|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character Nicky Dryden in the 1999 film ''[[The Debt Collector]]'' is reportedly loosely based on Boyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/124|title=The Debt Collector|last=Kelly|first=Richard|work=[[Sight &amp; Sound]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joel Silverman''' (born December 21, 1958) is a Hollywood animal trainer who hosted ''[[Good Dog U]]'' on [[Animal Planet]] from 1999-2009.
==Early life==
[[File:Joel_in_Santos_Brazil.jpg|right]]

Joel Silverman grew up in [[Southern California]] and at the age of 13, the first animal he ever trained was the family dog, Shadow. At about the same time, he and his family spent their summer vacations in [[San Diego]] and would go to [[SeaWorld San Diego|SeaWorld]] every year, and after a number of summers watching the trainers riding the [[killer whales]], Silverman developed a fascination with the whales and trainers. At the age of 16, he got hired to pick up trash at [[SeaWorld San Diego|SeaWorld]], and after helping out the trainers and years of hard work, Silverman was hired as a trainer.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Donna J.|title='Good Dog U' trainer Joel Silverman in Hudson today|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/08/good_dog_u_dog_trainer_joel_si.html|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=Cleveland Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|date=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started off with Pacific and Atlantic [[bottle-nosed dolphin]]s, [[California sea lion]]s, and eventually [[killer whales]].

* In 1983 Silverman shifted his focus into training [[animals]] for [[movies]] [[TV shows]] and commercials, and currently training animals for [[film]] and [[TV]].
* 
* From 1988 to 1992 Joel was the trainer of Dreyfuss from the TV series ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]''.
* 
* In 1989, Joel wrote and hosted his first [[dog training]] video called, '''Joel Silverman's Hollywood Dog Training Program'''. It was sold as an [[infomercial]] and had sold over 300,000 videos at that time.
* 
* In 1999, Joel hosted his first TV series called, [[Good Dog U|"GOOD DOG U"]] which aired on [[Animal Planet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dog-training star to answer questions Sunday|url=http://journalstar.com/lifestyles/article_ed75cab7-1e06-5feb-9dd2-0525b3fcf7de.html|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=Journal-Star (Lincoln, NE)|date=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1999-2009.

==Dog Training Style==

Although there are a variety of styles and methods to train dogs, Joel Silverman's style is what he calls a "hybrid" [[dog training]] method. This method combines parts of [[dog training]] he learned from training [[dolphins]], [[sea lions]], and [[killer whales]], as well as the training of [[dogs]]. Joel also adds a personality based [[dog training]] style called '''What Color is Your Dog?®''' This method teaches people that there is no "one size fits all" approach to [[dog training]]. He believes dogs should be trained based solely on their personalities.

'''John Shelby''' "'''Jack'''" '''Spong''' (born June 16, 1931) is a retired [[bishop]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]. From 1979 to 2000, he was the Bishop of [[Episcopal Diocese of Newark|Newark, New Jersey]]. A [[liberal Christian]] [[Theology|theologian]], religion commentator and author, he calls for a fundamental rethinking of Christian belief away from [[theism]] and traditional doctrines.&lt;ref name=ABC1&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/sundaynights/stories/s1238959.htm Interview.] ABC Radio Australia, June 17, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Spong was born in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], and educated in public schools there. He attended the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he was elected to the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honor society and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1952. He received his Master of Divinity degree from the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]] in 1955. He has had honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees conferred on him by Virginia Theological Seminary and [[Saint Paul's College, Virginia]], as well as an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters conferred by [[Muhlenberg College]] in Pennsylvania.

In 2005, he wrote: "[I have] immerse[d] myself in contemporary Biblical scholarship at such places as Union Theological Seminary in New York City, [[Yale Divinity School]], [[Harvard Divinity School]] and the storied universities in [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]."&lt;ref&gt;John Shelby Spong, ''The Sins of Scripture'', HarperCollins 2005, page xi&lt;/ref&gt;

Spong served as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[St. Joseph's Episcopal Church (Durham, North Carolina)|St. Joseph's Church]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]], from 1955 to 1957; rector of Calvary Parish, [[Tarboro, North Carolina]], from 1957 to 1965; rector of [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Lynchburg|St. John's Church]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], from 1965 to 1969; and rector of [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church of Richmond, Virginia|St. Paul's Church]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], from 1969 to 1976. He has held visiting positions and given lectures at major American theological institutions, most prominently at Harvard Divinity School. He retired in 2000. As a retired bishop, he is a member of the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generalconvention.org/ccab/roster?id=208 The General Convention of the Episcopal Church: House of Bishops] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010210738/http://www.generalconvention.org/ccab/roster?id=208 |date=2014-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spong describes his own life as a journey from the literalism and conservative theology of his childhood to an expansive view of Christianity. In a 2013 interview, Spong credits the late Anglican bishop [[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John Robinson]] as his mentor in this journey and says that reading Robinson's controversial writings in the 1960s led to a friendship and mentoring relationship with him over many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readthespirit.com/explore/the-retired-bishop-john-shelby-spong-interview-on-one-of-the-worlds-most-loved-and-feared-books-the-bibles-gospel-of-john/ "The retired Bishop John Shelby Spong interview"], Read the Spirit website, 23 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Spong also honors Robinson as a mentor in the opening pages of his 2002 book ''[[A New Christianity for a New World]]''.

Recipient of many awards, including 1999 Humanist of the Year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://churchofhumanism.org/en/content/section/8/30/ |title=The Humanist Foundation |publisher=Churchofhumanism.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-23}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Spong is a contributor to the [[Living the Questions]] DVD program and has been a guest on numerous national television broadcasts (including ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' with Bill Maher, ''[[Dateline NBC|Dateline]]'', ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and ''[[Larry King Live]]''). Spong's calendar has him lecturing around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnshelbyspong.com/calendar/ Speaking calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spong is the cousin of former Virginia Democratic Senator [[William B. Spong, Jr.]], who defeated the incumbent [[Absalom Willis Robertson]], the father of television evangelist [[Pat Robertson]].

By his own account, he is closely associated with the [[Unity Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnshelbyspong.com/2015/07/23/resurrection-pious-dream-or-reality-part-xi-conclusion/ Question &amp; Answer] (paragraph 3) johnshelbyspong.com, 23 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to The Episcopal Diocese of Newark, Bishop Spong suffered a stroke before a speaking engagement in Marquette, Michigan on Saturday, Sept 10, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Newark Episcopal bishop Spong suffers stroke|url=http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2016/09/former_newark_episcopal_bishop_suffers_stroke.html|website=NJ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Spong's writings rely on [[Bible|Biblical]] and non-Biblical sources and are influenced by modern critical analysis of these sources (see especially Spong, 1991). He is representative of a stream of thought with roots in the [[medieval]] [[universalism]] of [[Peter Abelard]] and the [[existentialism]] of [[Paul Tillich]], whom he has called his favorite theologian.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,153507,00.html Challenging the 'Sins of Scripture']". Interview with [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]. April 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent theme in Spong's writing is that the popular and literal interpretations of Christian scripture are not sustainable and do not speak honestly to the situation of modern Christian communities. He believes in a more nuanced approach to scripture, informed by scholarship and compassion, which can be consistent with both Christian tradition and contemporary understandings of the universe. He believes that [[theism]] has lost credibility as a valid conception of [[God]]'s nature. He states that he is a Christian because he believes that [[Jesus]] Christ fully expressed the presence of a God of compassion and selfless love and that this is the meaning of the early Christian proclamation, "Jesus is Lord" (Spong, 1994 and Spong, 1991). Elaborating on this last idea he affirms that Jesus was adopted by God as his son, (''Born of a Woman'' 1992), and he says that this would be the way God was fully incarnated in Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name=ABC1/&gt;  He rejects the historical truth claims of some Christian doctrines, such as the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]] (Spong, 1992) and the bodily [[resurrection of Jesus]] (Spong, 1994). In 2000, Spong was a critic of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s declaration ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'', because it reaffirmed the Catholic doctrine that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is the [[one true faith|one true Church]] and, perhaps even more importantly, that Jesus Christ is the one and only [[salvation|savior]] for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shelby |first=John |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Christianity/2000/11/Dominus-Iesus-The-Voice-Of-Rigor-Mortis.aspx |title=Dominus Iesus: The Voice of Rigor Mortis |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date=2010-11-05 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spong has also been a strong proponent of the church reflecting the changes in society at large.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/opinion/15kristof.html Liberal Bible-Thumping] The New York Times, May 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Towards these ends, he calls for a new [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], in which many of Christianity's basic doctrines should be reformulated.&lt;ref name=ABC1/&gt;

His views on the future of Christianity are, "...that we have to start where we are. As I look at the history of religion, I observe that new religious insights always and only emerge out of the old traditions as they begin to die. It is not by pitching the old insights out but by journeying deeply through them into new visions that we are able to change religion’s direction. The creeds were 3rd and 4th century love songs that people composed to sing to their understanding of God. We do not have to literalize their words to perceive their meaning or their intention to join in the singing of their creedal song. I think religion in general and Christianity in particular must always be evolving. Forcing the evolution is the dialogue between yesterday’s words and today’s knowledge. The sin of Christianity is that any of us ever claimed that we had somehow captured eternal truth in the forms we had created."&lt;ref&gt;Q &amp; A for 2-14-2013 – electronic newsletter, A New Christianity For a New World, http://johnshelbyspong.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Spong has debated Christian philosopher and apologist [[William Lane Craig]] on the [[resurrection of Jesus]].

In 1991's ''Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism: A Bishop Rethinks the Meaning of Scripture'', Spong argues that [[St. Paul]] was homosexual, a theme satirised in [[Gore Vidal]]'s novel ''[[Live from Golgotha: The Gospel According to Gore Vidal|Live from Golgotha]]''.

=="Points for Reform" of Christianity==
{{Copypaste|section|url=https://www.westarinstitute.org/resources/the-fourth-r/a-call-for-a-new-reformation/|date=July 2016}}
Spong's "Twelve Points for Reform" were originally published in ''The Voice'', the newsletter of the Diocese of Newark, in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.westarinstitute.org/resources/the-fourth-r/a-call-for-a-new-reformation/ A Call for a New Reformation]&lt;/ref&gt; Spong elaborates on them in his book ''A New Christianity for a New World'':
# [[Theism]], as a way of defining God, is dead. So most theological God-talk is today meaningless. A new way to speak of God must be found.
# Since God can no longer be conceived in theistic terms, it becomes nonsensical to seek to understand Jesus as the incarnation of the theistic deity. So the [[Christology]] of the ages is bankrupt.
# The Biblical story of the perfect and finished creation from which human beings fell into sin is pre-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] mythology and post-Darwinian nonsense.
# The [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], understood as literal biology, makes Christ's divinity, as traditionally understood, impossible.
# The miracle stories of the [[New Testament]] can no longer be interpreted in a post-[[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] world as [[supernatural]] events performed by an incarnate deity.
# The view of the cross as the sacrifice for the sins of the world is a barbarian idea based on primitive concepts of God and must be dismissed.
# Resurrection is an action of God. Jesus was raised into the meaning of God. It therefore cannot be a physical resuscitation occurring inside human history.
# The story of the [[Entering Heaven alive|Ascension]] assumed a three-tiered universe and is therefore not capable of being translated into the concepts of a post-[[Copernicus|Copernican]] space age.
# There is no external, objective, revealed standard written in scripture or on tablets of stone that will govern our ethical behavior for all time.
# Prayer cannot be a request made to a theistic deity to act in human history in a particular way.
# The hope for [[Afterlife|life after death]] must be separated forever from the behavior control mentality of reward and punishment. The Church must abandon, therefore, its reliance on guilt as a motivator of behavior.
# All human beings bear God's image and must be respected for what each person is. Therefore, no external description of one's being, whether based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender]] or [[sexual orientation]], can properly be used as the basis for either rejection or discrimination.

==Criticism==
Spong acknowledges that his writings evoke great support and great condemnation simultaneously from differing segments of the Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;Spong, John Shelby (2000) ''Here I Stand: My Struggle for a Christianity of Integrity, Love and Equality'' (Harper Collins), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spong's ideas have been criticized by some other theologians, notably in 1998 by [[Rowan Williams]], the [[Bishop of Monmouth]],  who later became the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Williams described Spong's Twelve Points for Reform as embodying "confusion and misinterpretation".&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{Cite journal|title=No life, here – no joy, terror or tears |journal=Church Times |date=1998-07-17 |first=Rowan |last=Williams |coauthors= |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher=Anglican Ecumenical Society |id= |url=http://anglicanecumenicalsociety.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/bishop-spong-and-archbishop-williamss-response/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a speaking tour in Australia in 2001, Spong was banned by [[Peter Hollingworth]], the [[Anglican Diocese of Brisbane|Archbishop of Brisbane]], from speaking at churches in the diocese. The tour coincided with Hollingworth leaving the diocese to become the Governor-General of Australia. Hollingworth said that it was not an appropriate moment for Spong to "engage congregations in matters that could prove theologically controversial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s318287.htm|date=25 Jun 2001|title=Anglican Church snubs Bishop|accessdate=5 Jan 2016|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/07/anglicanism|date=7 Jul 2001|title=Fear of ideas: The decline and fall of Anglicanism|accessdate=5 Jan 2016|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Spong's book ''Jesus for the Non-Religious'' was published in 2007, [[Peter Jensen (bishop)|Peter Jensen]], the [[Anglican Archbishop of Sydney|Archbishop of Sydney]], banned Spong from preaching at any churches in his diocese. By contrast, [[Phillip Aspinall]], the [[Anglican Primate of Australia|Primate of Australia]], invited Spong in 2007 to deliver two sermons at St. John's Cathedral, Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/bishop-banned-for-gutting-the-faith/story-e6frfkwi-1111114175943|date=14 Aug 2007|title=Sydney Archbishop Jensen bans John Shelby Spong|accessdate=5 Jan 2016|publisher=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Tooley]], a Methodist who is president of the [[Institute on Religion and Democracy]], a think tank noted for its critique of liberal religious groups, criticized Spong in 2010 as "brandishing the stale theologies and ideologies of a half-century ago".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.catholicity.com/commentary/tooley/07870.html|title= My Evening with Bishop John Shelby Spong|last1= Tooley|first1= Mark|date= March 25, 2010|website= www.catholicity.com|publisher= InsideCatholic.com|accessdate=23 Aug 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Bott]], former vice-president of the Wellington Christian Apologetics Society in New Zealand, and [[Jonathan Sarfati]], editorial consultant for Creation Ministries International, criticized Spong's scholarship in an article published by the Apologetics Society's journal in 1995 and updated in 2007, saying he "views the world through the eyes of 19th century rationalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/view/2882/ What’s Wrong With Bishop Spong? Laymen Rethink the Scholarship of John Shelby Spong]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Mohler]], president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], has condemned Spong as a [[Heresy in Christianity|heretic]], claiming that he has "denied virtually every major Christian doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertmohler.com/2007/08/16/heresy-in-the-cathedral-2/ Heresy in the Cathedral]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korean Women's Volunteer Labour Corps''' ({{ko-hhrm|조선여자근로정신대|朝鮮女子勤勞挺身隊}}) or '''Peninsula Women's Volunteer Corps''' ({{ko-hhrm|반도여자정신대|半島女子挺身隊}}) was the Korean part of the {{illm|Women's Volunteer Corps|ja|女子挺身隊}}, which was created in April 1944 as a work group for Japanese and Korean women.&lt;ref name="Palmer152"&gt;Brandon Palmer, ''Fighting for the Enemy: Koreans in Japan's War, 1937-1945 (Korean Studies of the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies)'', University of Washington Press, 2013/7/30, {{ISBN|978-0295992587}}, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Although its official purpose was to give women a chance to serve the [[Empire of Japan]] prior to marriage, it was a means to compel women to perform labor duties.&lt;ref name="Palmer152"/&gt;

== Overview ==
The original meaning of the term ''Volunteer Corps'' is ''take the initiative to organize for the country.'' The term were used for the war support groups in many areas. A labor shortage continued in the war, and the ''Volunteer Corps'' organization was started, followed by the ''Women's Volunteer Corps'' organization consisting of female labors.

It is not clear when the Women's Volunteer Labour Corps started in Korea. Women's shipbuilding began with no legal basis. In August 23, 1944, the legal basis {{illm|Women's Voluntary Labor Ordinance|ja|女子挺身勤労令}} was carried out and the troops were officially launched. The Act was also applied to colonial Korea and Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;교과서포럼, 《대안교과서 한국 근·현대사》, 기파랑, 2008년, p.92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean women without spouses aged from 12 to 40 belonged to the Troops, and they were arranged to the munitions factories. There were many mobilization methods including agency of government offices, public recruitment, voluntary support and propaganda through schools and organizations. 200,000 Japanese and Korean women were mobilized as workers, including 50,000-70,000 Korean people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=103&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0000986898 "총인구 321만에 강제동원 인구 650만?"], 《연합뉴스》, 2005년 4월 26일.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.hankooki.com/lpage/people/200505/wk2005051913552937470.htm 한국 초대석 서울대 경제학부 이영훈 교수"일제 청산, 정확한 사실에 기초해야"사회적 통념에 도전하고 상식의 벽을 넘어선 용기있는 학자"일본군 위안부·징용자 수 과장"국민정서에 反한 주장으로 파문], 《한국i닷컴》, 2005년 5월 19일.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=30050426144804&amp;Section=04 이영훈, "국사 교과서 일제피해 과장됐다" "위안부 수십만-강제 연행 650만은 허구", 국사학계 논란 예고] Pressian 2005년 4월 26일.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000251577 이영훈 교수 "교과서 속 '위안부 20만'에 찬성 못해"], 《[[OhmyNews|오마이뉴스]]》, 2005년 4월 26일.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacy.www.hani.co.kr/section-005000000/2005/04/005000000200504261757996.html 이영훈 교수, 수십만 위안부설은 “허수의 덫”], 《[[The Hankyoreh|한겨레]]》, 2005년 4월 26일.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.asp?Total_ID=32492 이영훈 "국사교과서의 일제 수탈상은 신화"], 《[[JoongAng Ilbo|중앙일보]]》, 2006년 6월 20일.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1944, in [[South Chungcheong Province]] and [[South Jeolla Province]], girls aged from 12 to 14 were recruited with invitation of school and job, forced to work in the military aircraft factory of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries with no payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

It is testified that girls recruited from [[North Gyeongsang Province]] elsewhere were forced to work in logistics company, Fujikoshi Steel Industrial Co., Ltd. Toyama plant. They also did not receive proper wages. In 1943, Kim Kum-jin, who was a student of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Seoul Scientific Housekeeping School|ko|3=경성가정의숙|lt=Seoul Scientific Housekeeping School}} ({{korean|rr=Gyungseong Gajung Uisuk|hangul=경성가정의숙|hanja=京城家政義塾}}), heard the school president {{Interlanguage link multi|Hwang Sin-deok|ko|3=황신덕|lt=Hwang Sin-deok}} ({{korean|hangul=황신덕|hanja=黃信德}}) deploring that "[t]here are no students who support a labor volunteer corps.

It is also pointed out that they worked in Tokyo Textile Corporation Numazu plant, Mitsubishi Nagoya Aircraft Works Doutoku factory, Nagasaki Shipyard, Sagami Navy Yard, and Yawata Steel Works.

==Difference from comfort women==
Korean Women's Volunteer Labour Corps was mobilization of labor and was different from [[comfort women]] who were sexual exploited. The term "Volunteer Corps" was often used interchangeably with the term "comfort women" after the war.&lt;ref name=ildaro20081215&gt;[http://www.ildaro.com/sub_read.html?uid=4675&amp;section=sc1 ‘여러분은 달러를 벌어주는 애국자입니다’ 증언 통해 “기지촌의 숨겨진 진실” 속속 드러나] 2008/12/15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Confusion with 'volunteer corps': Insufficient research at that time led to comfort women and volunteer corps seen as the same |date=August 22, 2014 |publisher=Asahi Shimbun |url=http://www.asahi.com/articles/SDI201408213564.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this misunderstanding, some women who finished forced labor could not explain the fact that they worked as forced labor, because they were afraid to be confused with comfort women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Manuel Delgado Villegas''' ({{IPA-es|manw'el delˈɣaðo βiˈʎeɣas}}; 25 January 1943 – 2 February 1998), also known as '''''El Arropiero''''',{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[serial killer]] active between 1964 and 1971. Delgado claimed to have carried out 48 murders in Spain, [[Italy]] and [[France]] – of these cases the Spanish police were only able to investigate twenty-two in Spain and considered him the definite perpetrator of seven.&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed. Península&lt;/ref&gt; He was never brought to trial, as he was diagnosed with a severe [[mental disorder]], and in 1978 the ''[[Audiencia Nacional of Spain|Audiencia Nacional]]'' ordered that he be preventively detained at Carabanchel Penitentiary Psychiatric Hospital. He was released into the care of a psychiatric hospital in 1996 and died two years later of a smoking-related lung disease.&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed. Península&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Manuel Delgado Villegas was born in [[Seville]], [[Spain]] on January 25, 1943, the son of José Delgado Martín. His mother died while giving birth to him, at the age of 24.&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed. Península&lt;/ref&gt; The itinerant nature of his father's job as a salesman of [[arrope]] (a fruit concentrate produced in southern Spain and used to make sweets), hence the nickname ''El Arropiero'', resulted in Delgado and his sister Joaquina being sent to live with their maternal grandmother in [[Mataró]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findesemana.libertaddigital.com/los-crimenes-de-el-arropiero-1276230426.html|title=Los crímenes de el Arropiero|trans-title=The crimes of the ''arropiero''|publisher=Libertad digital: Fin de semana}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two children lived with their grandmother in the predominantly Andalusian neighbourhood of La Cirera. He attended school but never learned to read and write. Delgado was [[bisexual]] and [[prostitution|prostituted]] himself from early adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed. Península&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, aged 18, Delgado enlisted in the [[Spanish Legion]]. There he learnt [[hand-to-hand combat]] techniques, and one in particular, the ''golpe legionario'' or ''golpe mortal'' (literally "deadly blow"), a blow to the [[larynx]] with the edge of the hand that became one of his preferred methods of killing.

After the army, Delgado left Mataró and became a nomad, wandering along the Mediterranean coast begging, stealing and picking fights with prostitutes and homosexuals. He was arrested several times under the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'' or ''Ley de Peligrosidad Social'' (lit. "Law of Slackers and Crooks" and "Law of Dangerousness to Society") that targeted beggars and homosexuals during the [[Spain under Franco|Francoist dictatorship]], but was never imprisoned. His odd behavior under arrest always led to him being sent to mental institutions, from which he was soon released.&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed. Península&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
Delgado killed his first confirmed victim in 1964, aged 21, and remained active until his arrest at 28 in 1971. He never killed with premeditation. Sometimes a simple trivial comment by the victim would be taken as an insult and unleash Delgado's rage, who would kill them with great violence using a blunt object, strangling them or with his bare hands; Delgado would attack others with the intention of robbing them or, if the victim was female, raping them, which he did [[Necrophilia|only after they were dead]]. The wildly different nature of the crimes and the victims (men and women, young and old, Spanish and foreign, heterosexual and homosexual, rich and poor) and Delgado's nomadic lifestyle made it impossible for law enforcement to connect the killings as the work of a single person before Delgado's confession. Only the last two murders happened in the same place and close in time, precipitating Delgado's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed. Península&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Adolfo Folch Muntaner''' (January 21, 1964), 49 – A chef. He was killed while sleeping on the beach of Llorach in [[Garraf]], near [[Barcelona]]. Folch had gone to the beach that day to take some sand, used at the time to clean the fat from kitchen pots and stoves.
{{quote|"I saw a sleeping man leaning against a wall. I approached him and very slowly, with a large rock that I had picked up close to the wall, hit him over the head. When I realised that he was dead, I took his wallet and the watch on his wrist. He had barely anything in it and the watch was crap!"|sign=Manuel Delgado Villegas}}
* '''Margaret Hélène Thérese Boudrie''' (June 20, 1967), 21 – A French student from [[Lyon]]. She was staying in a small house in Can Planas, a holiday resort five kilometres from [[Ibiza Town]], along with a friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.es/preview/1967/06/23/pagina-9/34372892/pdf.html?search=%22Margaret%20Helene%20Boudrie%22|title=Sigue sin descrubirse al que asesino a una joven francesa|date=23 June 1967|trans-title= The young Frenchwoman's killer is still unknown|publisher=[[La Vanguardia]]|page=9|language=Spanish|format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delgado sneaked into her room and suffocated her with a pillow. Once she was dead, he stabbed her in the back with a [[stiletto]], raped her body and stole a medal that she was wearing around her neck. The body was found with multiple bruises and scratches. Her friend, an American tourist named Jules Morton, was arrested and held in prison for over a year before his innocence was proven.
* '''Venancio Hernández Carrasco''' (July 20, 1968), 71 – Hernández was tending his vineyards by the banks of the [[Tajuña River]] in the town of [[Chinchón]] when Delgado approached him asking for food. Hernández replied that he was young and that if he wanted to eat he ought to work. This comment cost him his life. His body was found floating in the river near the San Galindo dam&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1968/07/21/049.html|title=Los bomberos rescatan el cadaver de un hombre ahogado|publisher=[[Diario ABC|ABC]]|language=Spanish|date=21 July 1968|format=[[PDF]]|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was initially reported as an accidental drowning. Delgado later changed his testimony and claimed that he killed Hernández because he saw him trying to rape a little girl.
* '''Ramón Estrada Saldrich''' (April 5, 1969) – A homosexual furniture dealer from Barcelona and regular client of Delgado, whose services he hired for 300 [[Spanish peseta|peseta]]s. According to Delgado, they were in his dealership when he asked Estrada to give him 1,000 pesetas and he agreed to do so after sex, but he only paid Delgado the usual 300. Delgado hit Estrada in the neck, but he was only knocked out and began to insult Delgado after recovering his senses. Delgado then tore a leg off an armchair and bludgeoned Estrada with it, before finally strangling him until his neck broke.
* '''Anastasia Borrella Moreno''' (November 23, 1969), 68 – Killed in [[Mataró]]. Delgado hit her on the head with a brick and pushed her off a bridge. He then dragged her into a tunnel and strangled her.
* '''Francisco Marín Ramírez''' (December 3, 1970), 28 – Electrician employed in [[Renfe]] and a friend of Delgado, or perhaps a client. Delgado claimed that he killed Marín by punching him twice in the head after he had made sexual advances towards him. His body was found by a fisherman on December 12, floating in the [[Guadalete river]], underneath the ''San Alejandro'' bridge in [[El Puerto de Santa María]], 12 kilometres from the place of the murder.
* '''Antonia Rodríguez Relinque''' (January 18, 1971), 38 – Considered his girlfriend by Delgado, who introduced her as such to his father, and also killed in El Puerto de Santa María.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} http://findesemana.libertaddigital.com/articulo.php/1276230426&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkiller_index/xserienkiller_v.php serial killer true crime library * serial killer news * list of serial killers * serial murder * female serial killers * crime scene investigation * tueur en serie * omicidi seriali *&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Rodríguez was a promiscuous woman and was reputed to suffer from slight mental retardation. While they were having sex behind some bushes, Rodríguez asked Delgado to do something that "disgusted" him and he refused. She then insulted him, saying that he wasn't a man because she had been with men that had done that to her when asked, and Delgado strangled her with her own leggings. Delgado hid the body and returned to have sex with it on three consecutive nights before he was arrested. When asked, Delgado said that he had sex with her because dead or alive she was still his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed. Península&lt;/ref&gt;

====Possible====
Delgado's confirmed crimes are often misreported as eight instead of seven. This probably stems from a 1977 article in the popular weekly newspaper ''El Caso'', that proposed Delgado as the possible murderer of Natividad Romero Rodríguez, a prostitute found dead in a large clay jar in a country house near Barajas, [[Province of Madrid|Madrid]] in 1969. She had been raped and strangled with great violence by a man using only one hand three days before, leading the investigators to suspect someone with military background, possibly an American pilot from the nearby [[Torrejón Air Base]] since the victim had often been seen in such company. The crime, however, remains unsolved and was never linked to Delgado by the police. Another victim often cited is Almudena Sánchez Rus, murdered in El Puerto de Santa María in 1972, but at that time Delgado was already arrested and in custody.

On the other hand, Delgado himself claimed to have killed also a foreign woman in [[Sant Feliu de Guixols]], stabbed another woman in [[Alicante]], strangled a homosexual man with a wire in Barcelona and even to have thrown another homosexual, a client, off a cliff in Garraf after the victim said "Such beauty! Such a view! I wouldn't mind dying right in this place!", to which Delgado replied "Die then" and pushed him. On another occasion, Delgado displayed discomfort upon hearing over the police car radio that 80 bodies had been found buried in a man's garden in [[Mexico]]; he immediately asked the police to be freed for 24 hours, promising not to escape, "so this guy doesn't beat me."&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed.

Following the disappearance of Antonia "Toñi" Rodríguez Relinque, a 38-year-old [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] woman who had been seen on various occasions in the company of Delgado, the police accompanied Delgado to [[El Puerto de Santa María]] police station where he was questioned by [[Cadiz]]'s ''Brigada de Investigación Criminal'' (Criminal Investigation Division) over the disappearance of the person whom they now knew to be his girlfriend. He initially denied killing her, but following the discovery of her body in a secluded spot known as ''Pago Galvecito'', on the outskirts of [[El Puerto de Santa María]], on February 21, 1971, he confessed to her murder – Delgado confessed that he had strangled the woman with her own tights while they were having sex. The local newspaper, the ''[[Diario de Cádiz]]'', dubbed him ''El estrangulador del Puerto'' (The Puerto strangler), though this nickname was dropped later at the request of El Puerto's local authorities, who feared the town's name would be tainted.&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed. Península&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few days he admitted his guilt in the murders of four others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1971/02/23/031.html|title=Manuel Delgado Villegas se confiesa autor de otra muerte|publisher=[[Diario ABC|ABC]]|language=Spanish|page=31|date=23 February 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered the definite perpetrator of seven murders in total (including two that had been originally considered accidents) before the investigation was halted and Delgado put in a mental institution without trial or a proper conviction. While under interrogation, Delgado remained calm and shared many details of the crimes with the police.&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed. Península&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his arrest, it was widely reported that he was diagnosed as having [[XYY syndrome]] which led to claims that this may have been responsible for his violent behaviour. However, the link between XYY syndrome and violent behaviour has been disproven by modern studies of the condition.

In the process of investigating the veracity of his claims the [[investigating magistrate]] of El Puerto de Santa María, Conrado Gallardo Ros, along with detectives involved in the cases, accompanied Delgado to the scenes of the crimes over a period of two years where he re-enacted and explained the crimes. One detective in particular, Salvador Ortega, succeed in gaining Delgado's trust and was the one who was given the most information. Photos taken during the investigation show Delgado smiling and even embracing the detectives, who used the affectionate form of his name – "Manolo" or even "Manolito".&lt;ref&gt;Catalán-Deus, José (2011) ''Criminales, Víctimas y Verdugos: Crónica negra de España (1939–1975)'' Ed. Península&lt;/ref&gt; On a side note, Delgado became the first serial killer to travel the scenes of his crimes by airplane.

===Death===
Manuel Delgado Villegas died on February 2, 1998 at the ''Hospital Can Ruti'' in [[Badalona]] as a result of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].

[[File:Marcelpauker.jpg|thumb|200px|'''Marcel Pauker''']]

'''Marcel Pauker''' (rendered in [[Russian language|Russian]] as ''Марцел Паукер'' - ''Martsel Pauker''; December 6, 1896, [[Bucharest]] &amp;ndash; August 16, 1938, [[Yuzhnoye Butovo District|Butovo]], near [[Moscow]]) was a [[Romania]]n [[communist]] [[Militant (word)|militant]] and husband of the future Romanian Communist leader [[Ana Pauker]].

During his life, Pauker took a series of [[pseudonym]]s, the ones used most being: ''Burghezul'', ''Herman Gugenheim'', ''Paul Lampart'', ''Luximin'', ''Puiu'', ''Priu'', ''Semionovici Marin'', ''Stepan'', and ''Paul Weiss''.

==Early life==

Born to a [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jewish]] family, Marcel Pauker was a [[Multilingual|polyglot]], and noted speaker of [[Esperanto]]. He briefly studied [[engineering]] in [[Zürich]], before enlisting as an [[artillery]] [[cadet]] and becoming a Second Lieutenant in 1916 (during [[World War I]]).  Between 1919 and 1921, he lived in [[Switzerland]] for a second time, receiving his [[diploma]] in engineering.

==Militancy==

In December 1921, Pauker was designated a member of the Provisional Committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]; in 1922, his position became that of member of the Central Committee and the [[Politburo]], being sent as [[delegate]] to the [[Balkan Communist Federation]] Conferences in [[Sofia]] (June 1922) and [[Berlin]] (1923). His activities brought him to the attention of the Romanian authorities: he was arrested and sentenced first to ten years imprisonment, and then to [[Penal labour|labour]] for life. Nevertheless, he managed to escape and flee to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1925, returning to Romania in 1929. On his arrival he was escorted back to prison, only to be released under the terms of an [[amnesty]]. He was yet again arrested in [[Petroşani]], after his activities as an instigator during the [[Jiu Valley]] [[Lupeni Strike of 1929|miners' strike of August 1929]].

==Final years and death==

Marcel Pauker got involved in a political fight with [[Vitali Holostenco]], reflecting the struggle between the Bucharest section and that of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] that had taken hold of the Party's wing inside the Soviet Union around the proceedings of the 4th Congress in [[Kharkiv]]. Again in the Soviet Union, Pauker was reprimanded by the [[Comintern]]. Forbidden from contributing to political activities, he was sent to assist as an engineer in the industrial expansion of [[Magnitogorsk]] (in western [[Siberia]]), a job he undertook between 1930 and 1932. At the same time, [[Joseph Stalin]], whose priority at the time was showing the facade of "unity" within his subject Parties, had Holostenco removed from his position.

In 1935 Pauker was appointed a member of the [[wikt:secretariat|Secretariat]] of the Romanian Communist Party. He spent time in [[Prague]] until 1937,  when he returned to the Soviet Union. He fell victim to the [[Great Purge]]: arrested by the [[NKVD]] on March 21, 1937 and held in the infamous [[Taganka Prison]], Marcel Pauker was first interrogated over a year later, being presented with the charge of [[espionage]] in favor of Romania. Records show that he finally admitted to the charge (most likely after being subjected to [[torture]]). Consequently, he was put on trial, sentenced to death and [[Execution (legal)|executed]] by [[Execution by firing squad|shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;Tudoran&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitation==

Marcel Pauker was [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] by Soviet authorities in 1957 (as part of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)|De-Stalinization]] process under [[Nikita Khrushchev]]). [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]'s rejection of newer Soviet policies prevented this and other such cases from being mirrored in [[Communist Romania]]. While Gheorghiu-Dej was exercising a looser control of the society, he was not ready to question most of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] measures, as these had served to enforce his own rule during the previous decade.

The case was reconsidered under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s further distancing measures. Pauker's name was cleared, but mention of his activities and details of his life were kept secret.

==Family==

Largely thanks to circumstances, Ana Pauker was able to survive her husband's downfall, and she even reached the peak of her political career in the following years.

They had three children together:
*'''Tanio''' (1921-1922)
*'''Vlad''' (1926-2016)
*'''Tatiana''' (1928-2011)

Vlad moved to France.

In 1931 Marcel also fathered a son named '''Yakov''', from his relationship with fellow militant '''Roza Elbert'''.

He also had lengthy affairs with [[Elena Filipovici]] and [[Vanda Nicolschi]].

'''''Martyrs of the Alamo''''' (also known as '''''The Birth of Texas''''') is a 1915 American [[Historical film|historical]] [[War film|war drama film]] written and directed by [[Christy Cabanne]]. The film is based on the historical novel of the same name by Theodosia Harris, and features an ensemble cast including [[Sam De Grasse]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Walter Long (actor)|Walter Long]] and [[Alfred Paget]].&lt;ref name="silentera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/M/MartyrsOfTheAlamo1915.html|title=The Martyrs of the Alamo; or, "The Birth of Texas"|publisher=silentera.com|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairbanks role was uncredited, and was his first role in film, although his first starring role, in ''[[The Lamb]]'', was released prior to this picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/16586 | publisher=American Film Institute | title=The Martyrs of the Alamo | accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film features the [[Siege of Béxar]], [[Battle of the Alamo]] and [[Battle of San Jacinto]].

While making claims to historical accuracy, the film depicts the Mexican population in [[San Antonio]] in 1836 as a group of ill-mannered drunks.  One scene depicts a Mexican officer verbally assaulting a white woman and making advances on her.  The white woman reports the incident to her husband, [[Almeron Dickinson]] who in turn shoots the Mexican officer.  In his book ''Remembering the Alamo'', author Richard R. Flores, argues that the negative portrayal of the Mexican population is due to racism toward Mexicans in 1915, the year the film was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flores|first=Richard R. |title=Remembering the Alamo: Memory, Modernity, and Thew Master Symbol|year=2002|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=0-292-78196-2|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the film is preserved at the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="silentera" /&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16396">The title '''mnemonist''' (derived from the term [[mnemonic]]) refers to an individual with the ability to remember and recall unusually long lists of data, such as unfamiliar names, lists of numbers, entries in books, etc. The duration of superior retention can be minutes, hours, days, or decades. Mnemonists may have superior innate ability to recall or remember,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} or may use techniques such as the [[method of loci]].

==Structure of mnemonic skills==
While the innateness of mnemonists' skills is debated, the methods that mnemonists use to memorize are well-documented. Many mnemonists have been studied in [[psychology]] labs over the last century, and most have been found to use mnemonic devices. Currently, all memory champions at the [[World Memory Championships]] have said that they use mnemonic strategies, such as the [[method of loci]], to perform their memory feats.

Skilled memory theory was proposed by [[K. Anders Ericsson]] and Bill Chase to explain the effectiveness of mnemonic devices in memory expertise. Generally, [[short-term memory]] has a capacity of [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|seven items]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Miller, G. A.|year=1956|title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information|journal=Psychological Review|volume=63|issue=2|pages=343–355|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/| doi=10.1037/h0043158|pmid=13310704}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in order to memorize long strings of unrelated information, this constraint must be overcome. Skilled memory theory involves three steps: meaningful encoding, retrieval structure, and speed-up.&lt;ref name=Ericsson&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Chase, W. G., and Ericsson, K. A.|year=1982|title=Skill and working memory|editor=G. H. Bower|journal=Psychology of Learning and Motivation|volume=16|pages=1–58|doi=10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60546-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encoding===
In encoding, information is encoded in terms of knowledge structures through meaningful associations.  This may initially involve breaking down long lists into more manageable [[chunking (psychology)|chunks]] that fall within the capacity of short term memory. Verbal reports of memory experts show a consistent grouping of three or four. A digit sequence 1-9-4-5, for example, can then be remembered as "the year World War Two ended". Luria reported that [[Solomon Shereshevsky]] used [[synesthesia]] to associate numbers and words as visual images or colors to encode the information presented to him, but Luria did not clearly distinguish between synesthesia and mnemonic techniques like the method of loci and number shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Number_Shape_System | title=Number Shape System | work=Memory Techniques Wiki | accessdate=May 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Luria&gt;{{cite book|author=Luria, A.|year=1987|title=The Mind of a Mnemonist|location=Cambridge|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other subjects studied have used previous knowledge such as racing times or historical information&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ericsson, K., Delaney, P., &amp; Weaver, G.|year=2004|title=Uncovering the structure of a memorist's superior "basic" memory capacity|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=49|issue=3|pages=191–237|url=http://www.chrest.info/Fribourg_Cours_Expertise/Articles-www/II%20Donnees%20empiriques/ericsson-mnemonics.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2004.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; to encode new information. This is supported by studies that have shown that previous knowledge about a subject will increase one's ability to remember it. Chess experts, for example, can memorize more pieces of a chess game in progress than a novice chess player.&lt;ref name=Ericsson/&gt; However, while there is some correlation between memory expertise and general [[intelligence]], as measured by either [[IQ]] or the [[general intelligence factor]], the two are by no means identical. Many memory experts have been shown to be average to above-average by these two measures, but not exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Conway, A.R.A.|title=Working Memory Capacity and its relation to general intelligence|year=2003|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=12|pages=547–552|pmid=14643371|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2003.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrieval===
The next step is to create a retrieval structure by which the associations can be recalled. It serves the function of storing retrieval cues without having to use short term memory. It is used to preserve the order of items to be remembered. Verbal reports of memory experts show two prominent methods of retrieving information: hierarchical nodes and the method of loci. Retrieval structures are hierarchically organized and can be thought of as nodes that are activated when information is retrieved. Verbal reports have shown that memory experts have different retrieval structures. One expert clustered digits into groups, groups into supergroups, and supergroups into clusters of supergroups. However, by far the most common method of retrieval structure is the method of loci.&lt;ref name=Eric&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ericsson K | year = 2003 | title = Exceptional Memorizers: made, not born | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 233–235 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00103-7 | pmid=12804685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method of loci===
{{Main|Method of loci}}
The method of loci is "the use of an orderly arrangement of locations into which one could place the images of things or people that are to be remembered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bower, G.|year=1970|title=Analysis of a Mnemonic Device|journal=American Scientist|volume=58|pages=496–510|url=http://stanford.edu/~gbower/1970/Analysis_of_a_mnemonic_device.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encoding process happens in three steps.  First, an architectural area, such as the houses on a street, must be memorized. Second, each item to be remembered must be associated with a separate image. Finally, this set of images can be distributed in a "locus," or place within the architectural area in a pre-determined order. Then, as one tries to recall the information, the mnemonists simply has to "walk" down the street, see each symbol, and recall the associated information. An example of mnemonists who used this is [[Solomon Shereshevsky]]; he would use [[Gorky Street]], a street he lived on. When he read, each word would form a graphic image. He would then place this image in a place along the street; later, when he needed to recall the information, he would simply "stroll" down the street again to recall the necessary information.&lt;ref name=Luria/&gt;
[[Neuroimaging]] studies have shown results that support the method of loci as the retrieval method in world-class memory performers. An [[fMRI]] recorded brain activity in memory experts and a control group as they were memorizing selected data. Previous studies have shown that teaching a control group the method of loci leads to changes in brain activation during memorization. Consistent with their use of the method of loci, memory experts had higher activity in the medial [[parietal cortex]], retrospenial cortex, and right posterior [[hippocampus]]; these brain areas have been linked to [[spatial memory|spatial memory and navigation]]. These differences were observable even when the memory experts were trying to memorize stimuli, such as snowflakes, where they showed no superior ability to the control group.&lt;ref name=Maguire&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maguire, E.|year=2003|title=Routes to remembering: the brains behind superior memory|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=6|issue=1|pages=90–95|pmid=12483214|doi=10.1038/nn988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acceleration===
The final step in skilled memory theory is acceleration. With practice, time necessary for encoding and retrieval operations can be dramatically reduced. As a result, storage of information can then be performed within a few seconds.  Indeed, one confounding factor in the study of memory is that the subjects often improve from day-to-day as they are tested over and over.

== Learned skill or innate ability ==
The innateness of expert performance in the memory field has been studied thoroughly by many scientists; it is a matter which has still not been definitively resolved.

===Evidence for memory expertise as a learned skill===
Much evidence exists which points towards memory expertise as a learned skill which can only be learned through hours of deliberate practice. Anecdotally, the performers in top memory competitions like the [[World Memory Championships]] and the [[Extreme Memory Tournament]] all deny any ability of a photographic memory; rather, these experts have averaged 10 years practicing their encoding strategies.&lt;ref name=Eric/&gt; Another piece of evidence which points away from an innate superiority of memory is the specificity of memory expertise in memorists. For example, though memory experts have an exceptional ability to remember digits, their ability to remember unrelated items which are more difficult to encode, such as symbols or snowflakes, is the same as that of an average person. The same holds true for memory experts in other fields: studies of [[mental calculator]]s and chess experts show the same specificity for superior memory.&lt;ref name=Ericsson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eric/&gt;&lt;ref name=Maguire/&gt; In some cases, other types of memory, such as [[visual memory]] for faces, may even be impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raz A|title=A slice of pi: an exploratory neuroimaging study of digit encoding and retrieval in a superior memorist|journal=Neurocase|year=2009|volume=15|issue=5|pages=361–72|doi=10.1080/13554790902776896|pmc=4323087|pmid=19585350}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another piece of evidence of memory expertise as a learned ability is the fact that dedicated individuals can make exceptional memory gains when exposed to mnemonics and given a chance to practice. One subject, SF, a college student of average intelligence, was able to attain world-class memory performance after hundreds of hours of practice over two years. His memory, in fact, improved over 70 standard deviations, while his digit span, or [[memory span]] for digits, grew to 80 digits, which was higher than the digit span for all memory experts previously recorded.&lt;ref name=Ericsson/&gt; Similarly, adults of average intelligence taught encoding strategies also show large gains in memory performance. Finally, neuroimaging studies performed on memory experts and compared to a control group have found no systematic anatomical differences in the brain between memory experts and a control group.&lt;ref name=Maguire/&gt; While it is true that there are activation differences between the brains of memory experts and a control group, these are due to the use of spatial techniques to form retrieval structures, not any structural differences.

===Evidence for memory expertise as an innate ability===
Much of the evidence for innate superiority of memory is anecdotal and is therefore rejected by scientists who have moved toward accepting only reproducible studies as evidence for elite performance. There have been exceptions, however, that do not fit skilled memory theory as proposed by Chase and Ericsson. Synesthetes, for example, show a memory advantage for material that induces their synesthesia over a control group. This advantage tends to be in retention of new information rather than learning. However, synesthetes are likely to have some brain differences which give them an innate advantage when it comes to memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Yaro, C., &amp; Ward, J.|year=2007|title=Searching for Shereshevskii: What is superior about the memory of synaesthetes?|journal=Quarterly [[Journal of Experimental Psychology]]|volume=60|issue=5|pages=681–695|pmid=17455076|doi=10.1080/17470210600785208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group which may have some innate memory advantage are [[savant syndrome|autistic savants]]. Unfortunately, many savants who have performed memory feats, such as [[Kim Peek]] and [[Daniel Tammet]], have not been studied in a lab; they do claim to not need to use encoding strategies. A recent imaging study of savants found that there are activation differences between savants and typically developing individuals; these cannot be explained by the method of loci as mnemonic savants do not tend to use encoding strategies for their memory. Savants activated the right inferior [[occipital lobe|occipital areas]] of their brain, whereas control participants activated the left parietal region which is generally associated with attentional processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Neumann, N|year=2010|title=The Mind of the Mnemonists: An MEG and Neuropsychological Study of Autistic Memory Savants|journal=[[Behavioural Brain Research]]|volume=215|issue=1|pages=114–121|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2010.07.008|pmid=20637245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bapu was born on 25 September 1946 in Talgajarda (a small village near the port of Mahuva in the State of Gujarat, India), to Prabhudas Bapu Hariyani and Savitri Ben Hariyani.]&lt;/ref&gt; in Talgajarda near [[Mahuva (Bhavnagar district)|Mahuva]], [[Gujarat]]. He is a popular [[Hindu]] ''kathakaar'' (bard), who has been giving 9 day-long Spiritual
and religious talks/ programs (''[[Katha (storytelling format)|kathaa]]''s) in both [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Hindi]] all over the world&amp;mdash;including in [[India]], the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Africa]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], on a cruise ship in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and on an airplane travelling the world, in the Vatican City and in the foothills of Mount Kailas in Tibet/China&amp;mdash;since his first katha in 1960.

To date, he has conducted over 800 ''kathaa''s, most of them based on the ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'' of [[Tulsidas]] and other such works about [[Rama]] as well as Gopigeet which has the gopis of Vrindavan singing of the glory of [[Krishna]] in Krishna's separation.

==Biography==
Morari Bapu, complete name Moraridas Prabhudas Hariyani was born on 2 March 1946 on auspicious day of ashvin krishan amavasaya and also Shivratri in village [[Talgajarda]] near [[Mahuva (Bhavnagar district)|Mahuva]], [[Gujarat]], to Prabhudas Bapu Hariyani and Savitri Ben Hariyani, in a family of six brothers and two sisters. He is born in a family following religious traditions called Vaishnav Bava Sadhu [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]] (lineage).  He became to be lovingly referred to as "Bapu" (meaning Father or elderly person) by people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogausa.com/saints_morari_bapu.php Morari Bapu Profile] www.yogausa.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moraribapu.org/moraribapu_biography.html Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221140038/http://moraribapu.org/moraribapu_biography.html |date=21 December 2013 }} www.moraribapu.org&lt;/ref&gt; 
His grandfather, Tribhovandasji was a great [[Rama]] Bhakta (devotee of Shri [[Rama]]) and used to make young Morari memorize five verses of the ''Ramcharitamanas'' each day, on his way to school and back. Further, At a young age he was also encouraged via letters from his grandfather younger brother, Mahamandleshwar Vishnu Giriji Maharaj, who was head of "Kailas Ashram" at [[Rishikesh]], to be proficient in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalsabzi.com/books/in_touch_with_masters/sri_morari_bapu.htm Sri Morari Bapu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.incredible-people.com/sant-morari-bapu/ Sant Morari Bapu] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120718090312/http://profiles.incredible-people.com/sant-morari-bapu/ |date=18 July 2012 }} profiles.incredible-people.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morari Bapu started his career as a primary school teacher in a nearby village to Talgajarda. He worked there for several years, while also doing Ram Kathas.

==Career as an author==
Regarding her book ''It Takes a Pillage'', author [[Jim Hightower]] said, "Nomi Prins knows the mind-set, knows how to read spreadsheets, knows the people, and knows [[Wall Street]]'s games. Nomi knows and now Nomi tells." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470529598.html |title=It Takes a Pillage: An Epic Tale of Power, Deceit, and Untold Trillions |publisher=Wiley |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding '''''All the Presidents' Bankers''''':
* "A calm, authoritative elucidation of verifiable history" — ''[[Financial Times]]''
*"Even those who have read ''Secrets of the Temple'', [[William Greider]]'s massive and brilliant 1987 exposé of the [[Federal Reserve]], will find Prins's book worth their time. She presents a new narrative, one that shows how the changing cast of six has shaped America's fortunes under presidents in both parties." — ''[[American Prospect]]''
*"Prins divides her justifiably long text into digestible one- to three-page segments and seamlessly incorporates dozens of prominent banker profiles. Her work is highly recommended both to general readers and to students of financial history." — ''[[Library Journal]]''
*"A revealing look at the often symbiotic, sometimes-adversarial relationship between the [[White House]] and Wall Street... [A] sweeping history of bank presidents and their relationships with the nation's chief executives" — ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''

'''Servetseza Kadın''' ({{Lang-ota|ثروت سزا قادين}}; 1 September 1823{{snd}}25 September 1878), meaning "Worthy of riches",{{sfn|Davis|1986|page=105}} was the first wife and chief consort of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Early life==
Servetseza Kadın was born on 1 September 1823, in [[Maykop]], [[Yegeruqwai|Yegeruqwai Princedom]] of [[Circassia]]. She was a member of the [[Circassians|Circassian]] princely family of [[House of Temyryko]] ({{Lang-kbd|Темырыкъо}}) of princedom of [[Kabardia]] of [[Circassia]]. Her father was Prince Temyryko Mansur and her mother belonged to the [[House of  Dadeshkeliani|Principality of Dadeshkeliani]].{{sfn|Açba|2007|page=22}} She had two elder siblings, a brother Prince Andok Bey (1818 – 1886) and a sister, Princess Fatma Şemsfer Hanım (1821 – 1855),{{sfn|Açba|2007|page=23}} and a younger brother Prince Süleyman Bey (16 March 1825 – 1896).{{sfn|Açba|2007|page=24}}

In 1838 Servetseza left her city of birth and reached Istanbul. She became a lady-in-waiting to Sultan [[Abdul Hamid I]]'s daughter, Mahmud's half sister, Esma Sultan.{{sfn|White|1846|page=10}}

==Marriage==
When Abulmejid ascended the throne, after the death of his father on 2 July 1839, Esma Sultan selected Servetseza as a wife for her nephew, the new Sultan.{{sfn|White|1846|page=10}} Servetseza married him in 1839 and, was given the title of "Baş Kadın".{{sfn|Uluçay|1992|page=203}}{{sfn|Açba|2007|page=22}} Her marriage to Abdulmejid strengthened the relations between the two dynasties.{{sfn|Açba|2007|page=22}} Arter her marriage, he made her sister, Fatma Şemsfer Hanım, hazinedar of the [[Imperial Harem]].{{sfn|Açba|2007|page=23}} 

The harem had felt the utmost of jealousy towards Servetseza and had written ditties against her, pointing to her shrewish nature.{{sfn|Rauf|1995|page=206}} She was an intelligent and a well cultured lady,{{sfn|Açba|2004|page=22}} and was described an interesting and accomplished woman, but not extraordinary for extra charms.{{sfn|White|1846|page=10}}  

Servetseza remained childless. After [[Gülcemal Kadın]]'s death in 1851, Fatma Sultan, Refia Sultan and Şehzade Mehmed Reşad (future [[Mehmed V]]) were enrusted in her care.{{sfn|Uluçay|1992|page=203}} 

When [[Bezmiâlem Sultan]] died in 1853, Servetseza was placed incharge of Abdulmejid's harem. Upon this occasion, [[Şevkefza Kadın]] took courage of Servetseza Kadın's affection for heir Şehzade Mehmed Murad (future Sultan [[Murad V]]) and Abdulmejid's wish to see his son as the next Sultan, and rose in opposition to [[Pertevniyal Sultan]] and her son Şehzade Abdülaziz (the future Sultan [[Abdülaziz]]).{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2007|page=232}}

[[Dürrünev Kadın]], first wife of Sultan Abdülaziz, was a lady-in-waiting to her.{{sfn|Açba|2004|page=122}}

==Last years and death==
After Abdulmejid's death on 25 June 1861 she moved to Kabataş Palace.{{sfn|Necdet|2007|page=575}}{{sfn|Uluçay|1992|page=203}} Servetseza was apparently very fond of Murad, and indiscreetly told many people that [[Abdul Hamid II]] had usurped the throne from Murad.{{sfn|Pars|1985|page=207}}{{sfn|Tuğlacı|1985|page=207}} She died on 25 September 1878, and was buried in the Mausoleum of the imperial ladies at the [[Yavuz Selim Mosque]], [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Uluçay|1992|page=203-4}}{{sfn|Necdet|2007|page=574}}

It is believed by some that Servetseza Kadın, was murdered. One night in Ramadan she is said to have gone to Abdulhamid and warned him. She ordered him to give the throne back to it to its rightful owner. After pretending to heed her warning, he arranged that she be served with a poisoned drink. She died upon her return to her palace.{{sfn|Pars|1985|page=207}}{{sfn|Tuğlacı|1985|page=207}}

'''''The Faith Healers''''' is a 1987 book by magician and skeptic [[James Randi]] with a foreword by [[Carl Sagan]], that documents Randi's exploration of the world of [[faith healing]], and his exposing the [[sleight of hand]] trickery and deceit by its practitioners.

In eighteen chapters Randi explores the origins of faith healing and [[psychic surgery]], and critically analyzes the claims made by [[A. A. Allen]], [[Ernest Angley]], [[Willard Fuller]], [[WV Grant]], [[Peter Popoff]], [[Oral Roberts]], [[Pat Robertson]], and [[Ralph DiOrio]] for his claims of miracles at the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] in the town of [[Lourdes]]. Randi shows how people are tricked with [[Magician (illusion)|magician's]] tricks under the guise of religion.

In 1988, Earl Hautala in a review wrote "an eye opener for the naïve, this book provides a crash course in the methods of skeptical inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Hautala, Earl. (1988). ''The Faith Healers by James Randi''. [[Institute of General Semantics|ETC: A Review of General Semantics]]. Vol. 45, No. 2. p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Scientist]]'' praised the book in a 1990 review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517045.300-money-for-old-soap--review-of-the-faith-healers-by-jamesrandi-.html | title=Money for old soap / Review of 'The Faith Healers' | newspaper=[[New Scientist]] | date= 17 February 1990 | first=Roy | last=Herbert | accessdate =2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tzitzak''' ({{lang-tr|Çiçek}}; died {{circa}} 750), baptised '''Irene''' ({{lang-el|Ειρήνη}}), was a [[Khazar]] [[princess]], the daughter of ''[[khagan]]'' [[Bihar (Khazar)|Bihar]], who became empress by marriage to [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Constantine V]] (r. 741-775).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vnQAAAAMAAJ|title=The Student's Gibbon: The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|date=1894-01-01|page=407|publisher=Harper|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empress==
In 732, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was under threat of invasion from the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Seeking allies, [[Leo III the Isaurian]] sent an embassy to [[Bihar (Khazar)|Bihar]], ''[[Khagan]]'' of the [[Khazars]]. The alliance was sealed with the marriage of Tzitzak to [[Constantine V]], son and junior co-ruler of Leo.

Tzitzak was escorted to [[Constantinople]] for her marriage. Constantine was about fourteen years old, while Tzitzak may have been even younger as she would not give birth for eighteen years.{{fact|date=October 2018}} Tzitzak became a [[Christian]] under the [[baptism]]al name [[Irene (given name)|Irene]]. Tzitzak's wedding gown became famous, starting a new fashion craze in [[Constantinople]] for male robes called ''[[tzitzakion|tzitzakia]]''.

The chronicle of [[Theophanes the Confessor]] records that Tzitzak learned to read [[religious text]]s. He describes her as pious and contrasts her with the "impiety" of her father-in-law and husband. The emperors Leo III and Constantine V were [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|iconoclasts]] while Theophanes was an [[iconodule]] monk. His praise probably reflected the fact that Irene herself shared his views.&lt;ref name="roman-emperors2000"&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/irenev.htm "Irene, wife of Constantine V" (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain whether her mother-in-law [[Maria, wife of Leo III|Maria]] was still the senior empress at the time of Tzitzak's marriage. Leo III died on 18 June 741. Constantine V succeeded him with Irene as his empress consort. However, civil war broke out almost immediately as [[Artabasdos]], brother-in-law of Constantine, claimed the throne for himself. The civil war lasted until 2 November 743. The role of Irene in the war is not described by Theophanes.

On 25 January 750, Constantine and Tzitzak had a son, Leo, who would succeed his father as [[Leo IV the Khazar|Emperor Leo IV]]—better known as "Leo the Khazar". Leo's birth is the last mention of Irene in the historical record. By the following year, Constantine was already married to his second wife [[Maria, wife of Constantine V|Maria]]. Lynda Garland has suggested Tzitzak died in childbirth.&lt;ref name="roman-emperors2000"/&gt;

The word ''tzitzak'' is most likely a [[Greek language|Hellenized]] version of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''[[:wiktionary:çiçek|çiçek]]'', meaning "flower."
