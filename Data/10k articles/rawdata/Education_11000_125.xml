The '''Alabama School of Fine Arts''' ('''ASFA''') is a public, partially residential [[high school]] located in downtown [[Birmingham, Alabama]], United States. It provides career, college preparation, and technical education to students from grades 7-12 and  is a member of the [[Coalition of Essential Schools]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asfa.k12.al.us/index.cfm?event=about |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123113042/http://www.asfa.k12.al.us/index.cfm?event=about |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 23, 2008 |title=Introducing the Alabama School of Fine Arts |publisher=Alabama School of Fine Arts |accessdate=March 29, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essentialschools.org/affiliates/126 |title=Alabama School of Fine Arts |publisher=Coalition of Essential Schools |accessdate=March 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208002546/http://www.essentialschools.org/affiliates/126 |archivedate=December 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialties==
The six specialties of the school are [[music]], [[visual arts]], [[Theatre|theatre arts]], [[creative writing]], [[math]] and [[science]], and [[dance]].  The largest of these is math and science with an enrollment of around 100 students, with the other departments being smaller portions of the student body.

== History ==
The school began in 1968 with a group of Birmingham arts community leaders, James Hatcher and Peggy Beddow Cook, who acquired  funding from Governor [[Lurleen Wallace]] to support instructional programs based in community arts agencies after school.  The [[Alabama Legislature]] formally created the school with a resolution in 1971.  The school was located at [[Samford University]], with the dance program being located at UAB, but moved to [[Birmingham–Southern College]] in 1974.  While there it was consolidated into five arts programs and a core academic program, staffed in part by the [[Birmingham City Schools]].

The school moved to its own temporary downtown Birmingham campus in 1976.  At this time the private, non-profit Alabama School of Fine Arts Foundation was established to raise funding to build an all-new campus complex.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asfa.k12.al.us/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=200888&amp;type=d |title=History |publisher=Alabama School of Fine Arts |accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new law was approved by the Legislature in 1992 to provide for authorization for the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Functional and Organizational Analysis of the Alabama School of the Fine Arts|url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/officials/rdas/SchoolFineArts2012.pdf|work=Alabama School of Fine Arts Functional Analysis and Records Deposition Authority|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The school moved into its new $10&amp;nbsp;million facility in the heart of Birmingham’s cultural district the following year. A theater was added to the campus in 1995, followed by a mathematics and science wing in 1996.  A creative writing wing was added in 1999.  The ASFA Foundation began a new capital campaign in 2006 to raise money for the construction of a new [[Theater (structure)|theatre complex]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  The fundraising took many years, with construction lasting 17 months and costing $8.5&amp;nbsp;million.  The new 500-seat theater, named in honor of Dorothy Jemison Day, was opened on March 30, 2012 with an ASFA theatre department production of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[Our Town]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alabama School of Fine Arts readies to raise curtain on new theater |author=Michael Huebner |url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2012/03/curtain_rises_on_alabama_schoo.html |newspaper=The Birmingham News |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ASFA theatre department was named as one of the nation's outstanding high school theatre programs by ''Stage Directions'' magazine in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stage-directions.com/current-issue/28-feature/3712-diversity-in-excellence.html |title=Diversity in Excellence |date=November 2011 |work=Stage Directions |publisher=Timeless Communications |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admittance==
Admission into the school is competitive. Prospective students must submit an application with test scores, transcripts, essays, and three letters of recommendation. Selected students then audition for their chosen department. For the arts departments, audition is through performance, portfolios, and interview. For the math and science department, audition is through interview and two rounds of testing.

With the school funded by the Alabama Legislature, in-state students pay no tuition. Students from outside the state are charged tuition.

'''Allan M. Collins''' is an American [[Cognitive Science|cognitive scientist]], Professor Emeritus of [[Learning Sciences]] at [[Northwestern University|Northwestern University's]] School of Education and Social Policy.  His research is recognized as having broad impact on the fields of [[cognitive psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], and education.

==Research contributions==

===Psychology===
Collins is most well known in psychology for his foundational research on human [[semantic memory]] and cognition.  Collins and colleagues, most notably M.R. Quillian and [[Elizabeth Loftus]], developed the position that semantic knowledge is represented in stored category representations, linked together in a taxonomically organized processing hierarchy (see [[semantic networks]]).  Support for their models came from a classic series of reaction-time experiments on human question answering.&lt;ref name='Collins1969'&gt;{{cite journal | title=Retrieval time from semantic memory | journal=Journal of verbal learning and verbal behavior | year=1969 | last=Allan M.

===Artificial intelligence===
In [[artificial intelligence]], Collins is recognized for work on [[intelligent tutoring systems]] and [[plausible reasoning]].  With collaborator [[Jaime Carbonell]], Collins produced the first documented example of an intelligent tutor system called SCHOLAR CAI (computer-assisted instruction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Collins, A.M.|author2=Grignetti, M.C.|year=1975|title=Intelligent CAI. Final Report (1 March 1971-31 August 1975)|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/31/67/08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knowledge in SCHOLAR was structured analogously to the then theorized organization of human semantic memory as to afford a variety of meaningful interactions with the system. Collins' extensive research program pioneered discourse analysis methods to study the strategies human tutors use to adapt their teaching to learners.  In addition, Collins studied and developed a formal theory characterizing the variety of plausible inferences people use to ask questions about which their knowledge is incomplete.  Importantly, Collins developed methods to embed lessons learned from such research into the SCHOLAR system, improving system usability and effectiveness.  Subsequently, Collins developed WHY, an intelligent tutoring system that used the [[Socratic method]] for tutoring causal knowledge and reasoning. In conjunction with this project he developed a formal computational theory of Socratic tutoring, derived from analyses of inquiry teaching dialogues.

===Education===
As a cognitive scientist and foundational member of the field of the [[Learning Sciences|learning sciences]], Collins has influenced several strands of educational research and development.  Building upon his work on intelligent tutoring systems, he has conducted numerous projects investigating the use of technology in schools and developing [[educational technologies]] for assessing and improving student learning.  Collins has gradually shifted towards the [[situated cognition]] view of knowledge being embedded in the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used.  In response to conventional practices that often ignore the influence of culture and activity, Collins and colleagues have developed and studied [[cognitive apprenticeship]] as an effective alternative educational practice.  In addition, Collins was among the first to advocate for and outline [[Design-Based Research|design-based research]] methodologies in education.

[[File:Architectural Heritage Fund logo.jpg|right|thumb|The A.H.F. logo.]]
The '''Architectural Heritage Fund''' (AHF) is a registered charity (No. 266780) founded in 1976 to promote the conservation of historic buildings in the United Kingdom. It provides information, advice and finance to [[Building Preservation Trust]]s and other charities in the U.K.&lt;ref name=ahf&gt;[http://www.ahfund.org.uk/ Home.] The Architectural Heritage Fund, 2011. Retrieved 3 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
In order to apply for finance, organisations must have charitable status. The building must be listed, scheduled or in a conservation area and of acknowledged historic merit and projects must involve a change either in the ownership of a property or in its use. The AHF does not provide finance to private and commercial owners and buildings in long-term ownership or use.&lt;ref name=ahf/&gt;

As at 2005, the fund had provided grants of over £3.5 million and loans of over £73 million to over 1000 eligible projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahfund.org.uk/docs/AHFgreen.pdf A Future From The Past.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910213520/http://www.ahfund.org.uk/docs/AHFgreen.pdf |date=September 10, 2011 }} The Architectural Heritage Fund, 2005. Retrieved 3 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
The fund is incorporated as a company limited by guarantee without a share capital and registered at Companies House number 01150304.

==The Challenge Fund==
In June 2011 it was announced that the AHF would be administering the new £2 million ''Challenge Fund'' to rescue historic buildings at risk. The fund is to be formed by a donation of £1 million from the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber|Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation]] over five years and an additional £1 million from [[English Heritage]]. The buildings targeted will be Grade I and Grade II* status buildings on English Heritage's ''Heritage at Risk'' register.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahfund.org.uk/docs/English%20Heritage%20press%20release.doc Boost for Buildings at Risk.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002215351/http://www.ahfund.org.uk/docs/English%20Heritage%20press%20release.doc |date=October 2, 2011 }} English Heritage 11 June 2011.

Thus at age of 22 he landed in [[Bangalore]], where he stayed for the next two years, teaching English during the day at Regional Institute of English on Cunningham Road, and doing radio programmes. Evenings were for amateur theatre, with Bangalore Amateur Dramatics Society and the Bangalore Little Theatre. After arriving in Delhi in 1970, he joined the 'Yatrik' theatre group, staying at the YMCA hostel and working as a freelance teacher in schools and colleges.

'''Bruno Julius Florian Taut''' (4 May 1880&amp;nbsp;– 24 December 1938) was a prolific German [[architect]], [[urban planner]] and author active during the [[Weimar culture|Weimar]] period. He is known for his theoretical works as well as his designs and buildings.

== Early life and career ==
Taut was born in [[Königsberg]] in 1880. After secondary school, he studied at the [[Baugewerkschule]]. In the following years, Taut worked in the offices of various architects in [[Hamburg]] and [[Wiesbaden]]. In 1903 he was employed by [[Bruno Möhring]] in [[Berlin]], where he acquainted himself with ''[[Jugendstil]]'' and new building methods combining [[steel]] with [[masonry]]. From 1904 to 1908, Taut worked in [[Stuttgart]] for [[Theodor Fischer]] and studied urban planning. He received his first commission through Fischer in 1906, which involved renovation of the village church in [[Unterriexingen]].

In 1908, he returned to Berlin to study art history and construction at the ''Royal Technical [[Higher education|Higher]] [[Technische Hochschule|School]] of [[Charlottenburg]]'' (''Königlich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg''), now [[Technical University of Berlin]]. A year later, he established the architecture firm Taut &amp; Hoffmann with Franz Hoffmann.

Taut's first large projects came in 1913. He became a committed follower of the [[Garden City movement]], evidenced by his design for the Falkenberg Estate.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Architectural Theory / Edited by Harry Francis Mallgrave and Christina Contandriopoulos&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Architectural Theory From The Renaıssance to The Present / Bernd Evers&lt;/ref&gt;

Taut adopted the futuristic ideals and techniques of the avante-garde as seen in the prismatic dome of the [[Glass Pavilion]], which he built for the association of the German glass industry for the 1914 [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Werkbund Exhibition]] in [[Cologne]]. His aim was to make a whole building out of glass instead of merely using glass as a surface or decorative material.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He created glass-treaded metal staircases, a waterfall with underlighting, and colored walls of mosaic glass. His sketches for the publication "Alpine Architecture" (1917) are the work of an unabashed [[utopia]]n visionary, and he is classified as a [[Modernism|Modernist]] and, in particular, as an [[Expressionism|Expressionist]]. Much of Taut's literary work in German remains untranslated into English.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Germany ==
In 1910 after training in Berlin, working for [[Theodor Fischer]]'s firm in [[Stuttgart]], and establishing his own firm in Berlin, the experienced architect [[Hermann Muthesius]] suggested that Taut visit [[England]] to learn the garden city philosophy. Muthesius also introduced him to some of the ''[[Deutscher Werkbund]]'' group of architects, including [[Walter Gropius]]. Taut had [[socialist]] sympathies, and before [[World War I]] this hindered his advancement.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Taut's practical activity changed with World War I. He became a [[pacifist]] and so avoided military service. He began to write and sketch, less to escape from the brutalities of war than to present a positive utopia in opposition to this reality. Taut designed an immense circular garden city with a radius of about 7&amp;nbsp;km (4.3&amp;nbsp;mi) for three million inhabitants. The "City Crown" was to be in the very center. "Mighty and inaccessible", it would have been the culmination of a community and cultural center, a skyscraper-like, purpose-free "crystal building". "The building contains nothing but one beautiful room which can be reached by either of two staircases to the right and to the left of the theatre and the little community center. How can I even begin to describe what it is only possible to construct!", said Taut of the City Crown.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Taut completed two housing projects in [[Magdeburg]] from 1912 through 1915, which were influenced directly by the humane functionalism and urban design solutions of the garden city philosophy. The reform estate, created for a housing trust, was built in 1912–15 in the southwest of Magdeburg. The estate consists of one-storey terrace houses and was the first project in which Taut used colour as a design principle. The construction of the estate was continued by [[Carl Krayl]]. Taut served as city architect in Magdeburg from 1921 to 1923. During his time a few residential developments were built, one of which was the [[Hermann Beims estate]] (1925–28) with 2,100 apartments. Taut designed the exhibition hall ''City and Countryside'' in 1921 with concrete [[trusses]] and a central skylight.

[[File:Taut Wilskistrasse Berlin.jpeg|thumb|Onkel-Toms-Hütte, Wilskistrasse, Berlin]]
A lifelong painter, Taut was distinguished from his European modernist contemporaries by his devotion to [[color]]. As in Magdeburg, he applied lively, clashing colors to his first major commission, the 1912 ''[[Gartenstadt Falkenberg]]'' housing estate in Berlin, which became known as the "Paint Box Estates". The 1914 Glass Pavilion, an illustration of the new possibilities of glass, was also brightly colored. The difference between Taut and his Modernist contemporaries was never more obvious than at the 1927 [[Weissenhof Estate|''Weissenhofsiedlung'' housing exhibition]] in [[Stuttgart]]. In contrast to the pure-white entries from [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Walter Gropius]], Taut's house (Number 19) was painted in primary colors. [[Le Corbusier]] is reported to have exclaimed, "My God, Taut is colour-blind!"&lt;ref&gt;Kirch, K., ''The Weissenhofsiedlung'' Rizzoli International Publications, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 Taut was made chief architect of GEHAG, a Berlin public [[housing cooperative]], and was the main designer of several successful large residential developments ("Gross-Siedlungen") in Berlin, notably the 1925 [[Hufeisensiedlung ("Horseshoe Estate")|''Hufeisensiedlung'' ("Horseshoe Estate")]], named for its configuration around a pond, and the 1926 [[Onkel Toms Hütte]] Development ("[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]") in [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]], named for a local restaurant and set in a thick grove of trees. Both of these constructions became prominent examples of the use of colorful details in architecture.

Taut worked for the city architect of Berlin, [[Martin Wagner (architect)|Martin Wagner]], on some of Berlin's [[Modernist Housing Estates]], now recognized as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]]. The designs featured controversial modern flat roofs; access to sunlight, air and gardens; and generous amenities like gas, electric light, and bathrooms. Political conservatives complained that these developments were too opulent for 'simple people'. The progressive Berlin mayor, Gustav Böss, defended them: "We want to bring the lower levels of society higher."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Between 1924 and 1931, Taut's team completed more than 12,000 dwellings. In tribute to Taut, GEHAG incorporated an abstracted graphic of the Horseshoe Estate in its logo. This state housing association was sold by the [[Senate of Berlin]] in 1998; its legal successor is [[Deutsche Wohnen]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Japan ==
Being [[Jewish]] and a noted advocate of socialist political policies, Taut was compelled to look for opportunities to emigrate from Germany when the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] gained power. He was promised work in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in 1932 and 1933, but was obliged to return to Germany in February 1933 to a hostile political environment.

Later in the same year, Taut fled to Switzerland. Then with an invitation from Japanese architect Isaburo Ueno, he traveled to Japan via France, Greece, Turkey and Vladivostok, arriving in [[Tsuruga, Fukui|Tsuruga]], Japan on May 3, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denoon|first1=Donald|title=Multicultural Japan: Paleolithic to Postmodern|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0 521 00362 8|page=250|edition=Paperback}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Taut made his home in [[Takasaki]], [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]], where he produced three influential book-length appreciations of Japanese culture and architecture, comparing the historical simplicity of Japanese architecture with modernist discipline. For a period Taut worked as an industrial design teacher and his models of lamps and furniture sold at the Miratiss shop in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cabeza-Latinez|first1=Jose Maria|editor1-last=Weber|editor1-first=Willi|title=Lessons from Vernacular Architecture|date=2014|publisher=earthscan, Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxfordshire|isbn=978-1-84407-600-0|page=149}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Taut was noted for his appreciation of the stark, minimalist vein of Japanese architecture found at the [[Ise Shrine]] and at the [[Katsura Imperial Villa]] in Kyoto. He was the first to write extensively about the architectural features of Katsura Imperial Villa from a modernist perspective. Contrasting it with the elaborately decorated shrines of shogun [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] at [[Nikkō, Tochigi]], he famously said that "Japan's architectural arts could not rise higher than Katsura, nor sink lower than Nikko".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Varley|first1=H. Paul|editor1-last=Hume|editor1-first=Nancy|title=Japanese Aesthetics and Culture: A Reader - Culture in the Present Age|date=1995|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=0-7914-2399-9|page=321}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Taut's writing on the Japanese minimalist aesthetic found an appreciative audience in Japan and subsequently influenced the work of [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Walter Gropius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phaidon.com/store/architecture/katsura-imperial-villa-9780714862545/ |title=Katsura Imperial Villa I Architecture I Phaidon Store |publisher=Phaidon |date= |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only still extant Taut-designed architectural work in Japan is the extension to the Hyuga Villa at [[Atami, Shizuoka|Atami]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]]. Built in 1936 on a site below the original villa owned by businessman Rihei Hyuga, and part modern and part traditional Japanese in style, the three rooms provided additional space for social events and views over nearby [[Sagami Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyuga Villa Visitor Information|url=http://www.city.atami.shizuoka.jp/page.php?p_id=641|website=Atami City Official Website|publisher=Atami City, Shizuoka|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turkey ==
Offered a position as Professor of Architecture at the "State Academy of Fine Arts" in [[Istanbul]] (currently, [[Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts]]), Taut relocated to [[Turkey]] in 1936. In Ankara he joined other German wartime exiles, including [[Martin Wagner (architect)|Martin Wagner]] and Taut's associate [[Franz Hillinger]], who arrived in 1938.  Some of Taut's work was received unfavorably, however, and labelled as "cubic". In a letter to a Japanese friend he wrote, "They gave me a great opportunity in that they gave me freedom for my craft. I will make a building which is not 'cubic'; they are calling all [[modernism]] cubic. For this building, I am thinking of using some Turkish motifs."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He proceeded to design his own house in İstanbul's [[Ortaköy]] neighborhood, bridging the architectural traditions of his exile existence. His studio resembled that of the [[Einstein Tower]] in Potsdam, while the front view recalled a Japanese pagoda.

After leaving Germany, Taut gradually moved away from modernism. A colleague{{who|date=July 2014}} remarked that, "Like everyone who gets old, Taut is stuck with Renaissance principles and cannot find a way towards the new! I am very disappointed... It is a shame for such an avant-gardist."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Modern ve Sürgün&amp;nbsp;– Almanca Konuşan Ülkelerin Mimarları Türkiye’de / Yüksel Zandel Pöğün&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his death in 1938, Taut wrote at least one more book and designed a number of educational buildings in [[Ankara]] and [[Trabzon]] under commissions from the Turkish Ministry of Education. The most significant of these buildings were the "[[School of Language and History - Geography|Faculty of Languages, History and Geography]]" at [[Ankara University]], "[[Ankara Atatürk Lisesi|Ankara Atatürk High School]]" and "Trabzon High School". His last building project, the "Cebeci School", was left unfinished. Taut's final work, one month before his death, was the [[catafalque]] which was used for the official state funeral of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] on 21 November 1938 in Ankara. It was a simple design, consisting of large wooden columns and a flag that covered the coffin.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;A Comparative Study On The Works of German Expatriate Architects In Their Home-Land And In Turkey During The Period of 1927-1950 / Yüksel Zandel Pöğün / IYTE&lt;/ref&gt;

Taut died on 24 December 1938 and was laid to rest at the [[Edirnekapı Martyr's Cemetery]] in Istanbul as its first and only non-Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eniyion.hurriyet.com.tr/default.aspx?mekanID=1186&amp;siraID=3512&amp;hID=10194735&amp;mKat=0 Newspaper ''Hürriyet''- En İyi On/Bruno Taut Villası] {{tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

The '''College of Health Sciences''' is a publicly run higher education institution in [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.university-directory.eu/Bahrain/College-of-Health-Sciences--Bahrain.html College of Health Sciences, Bahrain], [http://www.university-directory.eu/ University Directory].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By 1959, a small School of Nursing was established in Bahrain in order to train nurses locally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chs.edu.bh/History.aspx History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228222558/http://www.chs.edu.bh/History.aspx |date=2010-12-28 }}, College of Health Sciences, Bahrain.&lt;/ref&gt; The College of Health Sciences itself was established in 1976.&lt;ref name="dean"&gt;[http://www.chs.edu.bh/Welcome.aspx#Dean Dean's Welcome Message], College of Health Sciences, Bahrain.&lt;/ref&gt; It educates and trains health professionals in Nursing and Allied Health under the auspices of the Ministry of Health in Bahrain. Students from other countries in the [[Persian Gulf|Gulf]] region also study at the College.

==Courses==
The College offers BSc degrees programme in [[Nursing]] and five Allied Health subjects: [[Dental Hygiene]], Medical Laboratory Technology, [[Pharmacy]], [[Public Health]], and [[Radiography]].&lt;ref name="dean" /&gt;

==Campus==
The College's campus is in the neighborhood of [[Salmaniya]], in [[Manama]], the capital of Bahrain. It is located within the [[Salmaniya Medical Complex]] (SMC), together with the [[Arabian Gulf University]] and the Salmaniya Hospital.&lt;ref name=Location&gt;[http://www.chs.edu.bh/AboutCampus.aspx College Campus and Facilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110072342/http://www.chs.edu.bh/AboutCampus.aspx |date=2011-01-10 }}, College of Health Sciences, Bahrain.&lt;/ref&gt;
The campus includes an administration and student affairs building, and multiple nursing and laboratory blocks. Additionally, facilities include a three floor building which hosts multiple offices, classrooms, laboratories and the Ahmed al-Farsi library. It also features the 'Al Ma'arif [[Auditorium]]' which provides a venue for special classes, workshops, meetings, [[seminar]]s and conferences.&lt;ref name=Location/&gt; A computer laboratory was installed in 1988.&lt;ref name=Location/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2805">The '''Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information''' ('''CASRAI''') is an international, non-profit  "membership initiative led by research institutions and their partners.".&lt;ref name="CASRAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casrai.org/|title=CASRAI|publisher=CASRAI|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2006, it is a  corporation registered in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, Canada,&lt;ref name="aihit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aihitdata.com/company/00BE33AD/CASRAI/overview|title=CASRAI Overview|publisher=aiHit|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is overseen by a central Board of Directors and national Steering Committees in each country with a national chapter.

The CASRAI '''mission''' is to adapt the principles and best practices of open standards and data governance to lead and facilitate key stakeholders in annual deliberations to develop 'standard information agreements' that serve as bridges between research information users. CASRAI agreements cover all the key information requirements that relate to the management of research throughout its life cycle. This includes information requirements related to applications for funds, CVs, project and funds management, compliance requirements, reporting as well as research data management and scholarly communications. The CASRAI '''vision''' is for all stakeholders (institutions, funders, publishers and software providers) to adopt the resulting 'invisible infrastructure' in their local software and processes so we can collectively enable stable, predictable and comparable results when sharing research information throughout the life cycle.

== History ==
In keeping with Canadian laws governing the creation of not-for-profit corporations CASRAI was founded by private Canadian citizens David Baker, Adil Hamdouna and Abder Loukili when they were co-directors in eVision Inc., a software consultancy based in [[Quebec City]]. The three formed the initial Board of Directors until early members could be appointed - at which point the original founders stepped down. David Baker continued on in the role of Executive Director reporting to the board. CASRAI was founded as the result of expressed interest from two of the three federal government granting councils in [[Canada]] in response to difficulties they were encountering smoothly flowing research information between sister funders and with research institutions. In 2015 CASRAI shifted its governance from a funder-driven model to an institution-driven model with funders as key partners.

The '''Controlled Schools’ Support Council (CSSC)''' is a non-statutory body, currently classified as a Third Sector Organisation, providing services in supporting and representing the [[Education in Northern Ireland|controlled schools sector in Northern Ireland]]

== Education in Northern Ireland ==
{{main|Education in Northern Ireland}}

Northern Ireland has a complex educational structure with a range of bodies involved in its management and administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/globalassets/documents/raise/publications/2016-2021/2016/education/4416.pdf|title=Education system in Northern Ireland|last=|first=|date=2016-08-08|website=NI Assembly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools in Northern Ireland fall under two categories - grant-aided and independent. While nearly all are grant-aided, there are some independent schools. All children between the ages of 4 and 16 are entitled to a free school place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/types-school|title=Types of school {{!}} nidirect|date=2015-10-26|work=nidirect|access-date=2017-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The controlled schools sector ===
According to figures from the Department of Education for 2016/2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/topics/statistics-and-research/statistics|title=Statistics {{!}} Department of Education|date=2015-06-09|work=Education|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are 560 controlled schools, 48% of the total number of schools registered in Northern Ireland making it the largest education sector in Northern Ireland. The modern controlled schools sector is a large, diverse and distinctive education system.  Controlled schools (nursery, primary, special, secondary and grammar schools) are managed by the school's board of governors and the employing authority is the Education Authority (EA).

Although many of these schools were originally Protestant church schools, whose control was transferred to the state in the first half of the twentieth century, they are open to those of all faiths and none.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/nis-controlled-schools-are-not-solely-protestant-some-of-them-are-95-catholic-35503624.html|title=NI's controlled schools are not solely Protestant ...some of them are 95% Catholic - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controlled sector is
* Church related
* Diverse in provision and governance
* Inclusive in making provision for children and young people from all backgrounds
* Aspirational in seeking to provide the best possible education

== Formation of the CSSC ==
After a thorough review of Education Administration in Northern Ireland, in October 2014 an Education Bill&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2014/12/contents|title=Education Act (Northern Ireland) 2014|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was put before the assembly, which created the [[Education Authority]].Alongside this the Minister and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to establish and fund a support body for schools in the controlled sector, there had been no specific support for the controlled sector over the previous 30 years, whilst other educational sectors had support bodies, such as [[Council for Catholic Maintained Schools|CCMS]], NICIE and CnaG.

Given this lack of support for the controlled sector, there are legacy issues which the Controlled Schools’ Support Council (CSSC) will seek to address, especially in the areas of ethos, representation and advocacy.

The CSSC became operational on 1 September 2016. Education Minister [[Peter Weir (politician)|Peter Weir]] said

“''This is an historic day for education in Northern Ireland.  The establishment of the Controlled Schools’ Support Council will help to address a longstanding deficit in representation. It will place the controlled sector on a similar footing with the other sectors in education. The new CSSC will ensure the sector has a strong and effective voice. I am confident that they will make a positive contribution in helping to raise educational standards across the controlled sector. This is an important step towards greater equality and fairness in education"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/new-controlled-schools-support-council-established|title=New Controlled Schools’ Support Council established|date=2016-09-01|work=Northern Ireland Executive|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Directors, representing schools, the Transferor Representatives’ Council and those from a public appointments process were officially elected at the inaugural AGM on 8 March 2017, and will serve for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2017/03/11/news/controlled-schools-body-appoints-first-directors-960526/|title=Controlled schools body appoints first directors|last=Doyle|first=Simon|date=2017-04-11|website=The Irish News|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new council took over from the interim board, a ten-person working group chaired by Uel McCrea, which spent four years developing the vision and setting up an effective support organisation for controlled schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/assembly-business/official-report/committee-minutes-of-evidence/session-2012-2013/december-2012/controlled-schools-support-body-working-party-briefing/|title=Controlled Schools Support Body Working Party Briefing|last=|first=|date=2012-12-12|website=www.niassembly.gov.uk|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CSSC Key Functions ==
The CSSC endeavours to enhance the quality of educational provision within the controlled sector, by advocating on behalf of controlled schools and supporting schools to raise standards of achievement, while working in constructive partnership with schools, the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]], the Education Authority and other sectoral bodies'''.'''

The CSSC seeks to support the interest of the controlled sector through five key functions

* Advocacy - on behalf of individual schools and the wider controlled sector
* Ethos – to develop and maintain the ethos of the controlled sector
* Governance – to support the Education Authority regarding the appointment and training of governors
* Raising standards – to assist schools to further raise levels of achievement
* Area planning – to participate in planning of the controlled schools’ estate

The '''DSH''' ([[German language|German]] [[abbreviation]] for '''Deutsche Sprachprüfung für den Hochschulzugang''') is a language proficiency test required for entry to a German university and to undertake all classes in the German language.

It consists of a written and an oral examination, the written part being a precondition for the oral one.  Students are allowed to use a German–German dictionary during the written examinations and—in case of failing—to only repeat the examination once. The grading scale of DSH is between 1–3 with 3 being the best possible grade. A detailed breakdown of the percentile achieved in each part of the examination will also be given on the certificate.

Proficiency levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR):&lt;br&gt;
DSH 1 (≥57%): Level B2.2&lt;br&gt;
DSH 2 (≥67%): Level C1.1&lt;br&gt;
DSH 3 (≥82%): Level C1.2&lt;br&gt;

==Written examination==

Consists of the following parts:

* Listening comprehension and use of the language from a listening text
* Reading comprehension and use of the language from a reading text
* Comprehension and application of language in academic language

==Oral examination==

As a rule the oral examination lasts about 20 minutes. Some institutions offer the possibility of exonerating the oral examination by showing an excellent level on the written examination.

During the oral examination the following points will be considered:

* Does the language you use correspond adequately to the question/assignment?
* Are you able to express yourself independently with a differentiated viewpoint?
* Is the language you use correct?
* Is your pronunciation and intonation comprehensible?

A '''display board''' is a board-shaped material that is rigid and strong enough to stand on its own, and generally used paper or other materials affixed to it. Display board may also be referred to as ''poster board''. Along with [[quad chart]]s, display boards were an early form of fast communication developed by the [[National Weather Service]] of the [[United States Department of Commerce]]'s [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Government Accountability Office]] report to the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]], [http://www.gao.gov/cbi-bin/getrpt?GAO-05-927 Managing for results enhancing agency use of performance information for management decision making], pg. 28. GAO-05-927, September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folded display boards ==
Traditional tri-fold display boards are single sheet corrugated boards divided into three panels by score marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://student.societyforscience.org/intel-isef-display-and-safety-regulations|title=Intel ISEF Display and Safety Regulations|author=|date=6 March 2017|website=societyforscience.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the two outside panels are half the width of the center panel. Generally placed on a table, they are more stable and able to stand while still giving a theater-like view. Header boards can be added to the top display board and an easel stand can be attached to the back. 

In North America, display boards are often used by students in the public school system for science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.usc.edu/ScienceFairs/|title=The World-Wide Web Virtual Library: Science Fairs|first=Christopher M.|last=Gould|date=10 December 1997|website=physics.usc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; social studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/weareteachers/social-studies-projects-and-lessons/|title=Social Studies Projects and Lessons|author=|date=|website=Pinterest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and English projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/explore/biography-project/|title=Best 25+ Biography project ideas on Pinterest - Biography, Biographies and Reading projects|author=|date=|website=Pinterest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the classroom, students use display boards to promote clubs, recognize athletics and display art projects. The purpose of the display board in that context is to catch the viewer's attention and explain what was performed and what was learned. 

Outside school, display boards are used for business trade shows, marketing, genealogy, life celebrations, arts and crafts, and memorials. 

[[Science fair]] display boards are required to follow published guidelines. Board contents include Project Title, Abstract, Question, Hypothesis, Background, Research, Materials, Procedure, Results, Conclusion and Future Directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencebuddies.org/blog/2012/03/perfecting-the-project-display-board.php|title=Perfecting the Project Display Board|website=Science Buddies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Walter Kelly. [[Westminster, California|Westminster]]: Teacher Created Resource, Inc., 2005. {{ISBN|1576906000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such display boards usually contain images and figures in addition to text.

== Tablet interactive display board ==
An interactive display board may be made by attaching an electronic multimedia device such as a [[Tablet computer|tablet]] to a display board. Methods for attaching tablets to display boards include cutting a window into a display board and fixing a pocket behind the window to insert and hold the tablet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US9129537|title=Display board for multimedia devices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; psching pins into the face of a display board with the tablet resting on the pins, attaching a lanyard to the tablet in order to hang it on the display board,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betterposters.blogspot.com/2012/08/iposter.html|title=iPoster|first=Zen|last=Faulkes|date=16 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or using dual sided adhesive tape to attach the tablet to the display board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.posterpresentations.com/html/science_poster_board_display.php|title=science poster board display|first=Argyris|last=Kotoulas|website=www.posterpresentations.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projex Boards manufactures a display board for tablets, with a pocket, easel and header board. The purpose of tablet display boards is to hold the tablet at eye level on the display board to facilitate better communication between audience and presenter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6492">The '''administration of [[education]] policy in the [[United Kingdom]]''' began in the 19th century. Official mandation of education began with the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] for [[England and Wales]], and the [[Education (Scotland) Act 1872]] for [[Scotland]]. Education policy has always been run separately for the component nations of the United Kingdom, and is now a [[devolution|devolved]] matter (by the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]], the [[Scotland Act 1998]], and the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] - each as amended).

== England ==

{{Main|Education in England|History of education in England}}

As there is no devolved government for England, the administration of education policy for the nation has been carried out by a number of different British central government departments since the 19th century. Key events in Education in England have been the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]], the [[Education Act 1902]], the [[Education Act 1944]], and the [[Education Reform Act 1988]].

=== 19th century ===

Before the latter-part of the 19th century education was a private matter, and there was no governmental policy lead. Some education services were provided by the [[Church of England|Church]] (dating back to a [[Pope|Papal]] proclamation in the 11th century).

A Committee of the [[Privy Council]] was appointed in 1839 to supervise the distribution of certain Government grants in the education field. The members of the Committee were the Lord President of the Council, the Secretaries of State, the First Lord of the Treasury, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. From 1857 a Vice President was appointed who took responsibility for policy, leading to the creation of the '''[[Education Office]]'''.

With the 1870 Act the Education Office was given the task to manage the national process and commission local [[School board (England &amp; Wales)|school boards]] in boroughs and parishes where they were requested.

The [[Board of Education Act 1899]] took effect in 1900, renaming the Education Office to the '''[[Board of Education (United Kingdom)|Board of Education]]''' was created which managed the national process and commissioned local [[School board (England &amp; Wales)|school boards]] in boroughs and parishes where they were found to be needed.

=== 20th century ===

The 1902 Act formalised the relationship between central government and education delivery by abolishing the 2568 school boards set up by the 1870 Act, and transferring their duties (and schools) to local government (borough and county councils) in a new guise as [[local education authority|local education authorities]].

The 1944 Act changed the system of education in England by forming the [[Tripartite System]] wherein [[secondary schools]] were mandated in one of four forms (Grammar, Comprehensive, Secondary Modern, and Secondary Technical schools), and renamed the Board of Education to the '''[[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]]'''.

The '''[[Department of Education and Science]]''' ('''DES''') was created in 1964 as the merger of the Ministry of Education with that of the Ministry of Science following the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]]'s focus on the "white heat of technology".

The 1988 Act brought in the concept of external validation of teacher performance and a support framework for teachers to use as the core of their syllabus, in the form of the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]].

In 1995 the DES was merged with the [[Benefits Agency]] and split off the [[Office of Science and Technology]] to become the '''[[Department for Education and Employment]]''' ('''DfEE''').

=== 21st century ===

After the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 General Election]], the DfEE and the [[Department for Social Security]] were combined and re-split into the '''[[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]]''' ('''DfES''') and the [[Department for Work and Pensions]].

In 2007, when [[Gordon Brown]] became Prime Minister, he split the education ministerial portfolio into two. The '''[[Department for Children, Schools and Families]]''' ('''DCSF''') was formed with board responsibilities for children up to the age of 14, and for some aspects up to 19, taking on some social care responsibilities from the [[Department for Health]]. The '''[[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]]''' ('''DIUS''') took over responsibility for all [[higher education|higher]] and [[further education]] and science policy, taking on the [[Government Office for Science]], which by then included the Office of Science and Technology that had split off from DES in 1994.

In 2009, DIUS was merged with parts of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] to form the '''[[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]]''' ('''BIS'''), but with no change in the scope of its education policy remit.

== Northern Ireland ==

{{Main|Education in Northern Ireland|History of education in Northern Ireland}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}

Education policy in Northern Ireland is run by the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Northern Ireland Department of Education]].

== Scotland ==

{{Main|Education in Scotland|History of education in Scotland}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}

Education policy in Scotland has always been run on its own lines. Since devolution it has transferred from the defunct [[Scottish Office]] to the [[Scottish Executive]].

== Wales ==

{{Main|Education in Wales|History of education in Wales}}
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}

Education policy in Wales was run as with that of England until devolution in 1998. Since then it has been run under the [[Welsh Assembly Government]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3381">'''Elena M. Sliepcevich''' was one of the leading figures in the development of [[health education]] as an academic discipline and profession.

==Biography==
A 1939 graduate of the [[University of Idaho]], Sliepcevich received her master's degree from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1949 and her doctorate in physical education from [[Springfield College]] in 1955. She was a professor of health education at the [[Ohio State University]] in 1961, when she was selected to direct the [[School Health Education Study]] (1961–1969). Most health education curricula developed since have been based on the 10 conceptual areas identified by the School Health Education Study: community health, consumer health, environmental health, family life, mental and emotional health, injury prevention and safety, nutrition, personal health, prevention and control of disease, and drug use and abuse. The Study’s model curriculum became known as the School Health Curriculum Project  (later renamed Growing Healthy)

The Study’s findings were also the major reason for [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]]’s creation of the President's Committee on Health Education in 1971. When the National Center for Health Education (NCHE) was created in 1975 as a result of one of the recommendation of the Committee, Dr. Sliepcevich was one of the Center’s founders. She was one of the principal framers of the NCHE’s first major activity, the Health Education Role Delineation Project (1978–1981).

Following the School Health Education Study, she joined the faculty of [[Southern Illinois University]] at Carbondale (SIUC), where she was Professor in both the Department of Health Education and the School of Medicine, and team taught courses with [[David F. Duncan|David Duncan]], [[Robert S. Gold|Robert Gold]], and Elaine Vitello. She continued to teach at SIUC until her retirement in 1993. She died in [[Norman, Oklahoma]] on March 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.coehs.siu.edu/public/elenamsctr/Dr_S_obit.pdf Obituary of Dr. Elena M. Sliepcevich], SIUC website.

[[File:Equality Network (Scotland) logo.png|200px|right]]
The '''Equality Network''' is one of Scotland's national organisations working for [[LGBTI]] rights and equality. Established by LGBT activists in 1997, it is a [[registered charity of Scotland|registered charity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC037852}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[company limited by guarantee]] (no. SC220213), based in [[Edinburgh]]. In 2011 it had an income of [[Pound sterling|£]]374,000.  

==History==
The Equality Network was founded back in 1997 as a national organisation working for LGBT rights and equality in Scotland and 2014 for LGBTI rights and equality in Scotland. The Equality Network has superseded the work of [[Outright Scotland]].

It is a registered charity governed by a Board of Trustees. It has received funding from some of the following organisations: the Equality Unit of the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Grundtvig programme]] of the [[European Commission]], the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]], the [[Big Lottery Fund]] and the [[Awards for All]] programme. It also raises money from individuals across Scotland.

==Work==
Over the past 17 years the Equality Network has claimed a number of victories for LGBT equality in Scotland including an equal age of consent, the repeal of Section 28, Civil Partnerships, Gender Recognition, adoption and fertility rights, hate crime laws, and most recently same-sex marriage. 

==Awards==
The Equality Network won the Campaign of the Year Award at the Herald Society Awards 2012, and Campaign of the Year at the LGBT Youth Scotland Awards 2012, both for the Equal Marriage campaign - the UK's first campaign for same-sex marriage rights, established by the Equality Network in 2008. It was also shortlisted for Public Campaign of the Year at the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards 2012.&lt;ref name=Gardham&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardham|first=Magnus|title=Political award nominations reflect a momentous year|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/political-award-nominations-reflect-a-momentous-year.19318879|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=The Herald|date=5 November 2012|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the fourth generation [[iPod Touch]] (the first model of iPod Touch equipped with cameras) was announced in conjunction with the device's release on September 8, 2010.

FaceTime for {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} was announced on October 20, 2010, at the "Back to the Mac" Media event on the Apple Campus.

On March 2, 2011, FaceTime support was announced for the newly introduced [[iPad 2]], which gained forward- and rear-facing cameras.

On February 24, 2011, FaceTime left beta and was listed in the [[Mac App Store]] for [[United States dollar|US$]]0.99. Apple claims that it intended to provide the application free of charge, however, a provision of the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] (2002) bars companies from providing an unadvertised new feature of an already-sold product without enduring "onerous accounting measures".&lt;ref name="Macgasm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macgasm.net/2011/02/24/apple-charge-facetime|title=Apple charges for FaceTime|last=Macgasm|date=|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017|12}}, the US$0.99 beta is still available for download from Apple.&lt;ref name="softpedia FT beta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Internet-Utilities/FaceTime.shtml|title=Mac|date=|publisher=Softpedia|at=link within last sentence "The page provides access to FaceTime 0.9 Build 92 version"|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FaceTime is included for free in macOS from {{nowrap|[[Mac OS X Lion]]}} (10.7) onwards and iOS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[AT&amp;T]] allowed customers to use FaceTime as long as they were [[tiered internet|tiered]], but blocked the application from working for customers with unlimited data plans. They were brought before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for [[net neutrality]] violations.&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T v. FaceTime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/oiac/Mobile-Broadband-FaceTime.pdf|title=AT&amp;T/FaceTime Case Study|last=AT&amp;T v. FaceTime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2011, it was found that FaceTime would work seamlessly over 3G on all iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch models that supported it. Even though FaceTime worked only over 3G at that time, it now supports 4G LTE calls on networks all over the world, availability being limited to operators' GSM plans.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;zaone [https://www.idevice.ro/2012/05/18/ios-5-1-1-ne-demonstreaza-ca-apple-va-permite-efectuarea-de-apeluri-facetime-prin-3g/ "iOS 5.1.1 ne demonstreaza ca Apple va permite efectuarea de apeluri FaceTime prin 3G"], "iDevice.ro", May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Apple announced in the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|WWDC]] that FaceTime will support group video and audio calls with up to 32 people in [[iOS 12]] and [[macOS Mojave]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/04/apple-facetime-group-chat-ios-12/|title=Apple's FaceTime offers group chats for up to 32 people|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
[[File:IPhone calling screen.png|thumb|left|150px|The [[iPhone]]'s screen when a call is in progress, showing the FaceTime button (grayed out, middle of bottom row).]]

FaceTime works by establishing a connection between two supported devices. Most Apple devices (such as iPhones, iPads and Macs) introduced after 2011 support FaceTime. FaceTime is currently incompatible with non-Apple devices or any other video calling services. Mac models introduced in 2011 introduced high-definition video FaceTime, which devices use automatically when both ends have a FaceTime HD camera.

Unlike Mac OS X's [[iChat]], FaceTime currently does not support group conferencing but support has been announced for iOS 12. The application is a one-on-one video chat—only two people can talk at once. If a second user calls and the user answers, the video chat with the previous user ends and a new video session begins with the second caller. In iPhone, if a phone call is pending and the user attempts to answer, the video call ends and the phone call begins with the next user.

Incoming notifications on iOS devices are shown during a FaceTime call, but if they are opened, the video will be temporarily paused until the user is back in the FaceTime app. [[File:Paused FaceTime.png|thumbnail|left|Paused FaceTime Screen|219x219px]]

On the iPhone, a user can activate FaceTime during a phone call by pressing the FaceTime button or initiated FaceTime from their call history or the Contacts application. iOS 7 and newer also provide a separate FaceTime app, as there always has been on Apple's non-telephony devices: iPad, iPod Touch, and Mac.

Until the release of iOS 6, FaceTime required a WiFi connection to work. From iOS 6 onwards, FaceTime for the iPhone and iPad has supported FaceTime calls over cellular networks ([[3G]] or [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]) provided the carrier enabled it, which by mid-2013 virtually all carriers worldwide have allowed. FaceTime Audio uses about three [[megabyte]]s of data for every five minutes of conversation, with FaceTime Video using significantly more.&lt;ref name="IW data usage 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/974213|title=How much data does FaceTime audio calling use?|publisher=iPhoneFAQ|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellular talk time/minutes are not used after switching from a voice call to a FaceTime call.

FaceTime calls can be placed from supported devices to any phone number or email address that is registered to the FaceTime service. A single email address can be registered to multiple devices and a call placed to that address rings all devices simultaneously.

==Standards==
The FaceTime protocol is based on numerous open industry standards&lt;ref name="AppleInsider standards 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/06/08/inside_iphone_4_facetime_video_calling.html|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=June 9, 2010|title=Inside iPhone 4: FaceTime video calling|publisher=[[Apple community#AppleInsider|AppleInsider]]|author=Daniel Eran Dilger}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not interoperable with other videotelephony systems:
* [[H.264]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]]-ELD – video and audio [[codec]]s respectively.
* [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] – [[IETF]] signaling protocol for [[VoIP]].
* [[Session Traversal Utilities for NAT|STUN]], [[Traversal Using Relay NAT|TURN]] and [[Interactive Connectivity Establishment|ICE]] – IETF technologies for traversing [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[Network address translation|NAT]].
* [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] and [[Secure Real-time Transport Protocol|SRTP]] – IETF standards for delivering real-time and encrypted media streams for VoIP.

Upon the launch of the iPhone 4, Jobs stated that Apple would immediately start working with standards bodies to make the FaceTime protocol an "open industry standard". While the protocols are open standards, Apple's FaceTime service requires a client-side certificate.&lt;ref name="Packetstan FT open standard 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.packetstan.com/2010/07/special-look-face-time-part-3-call.html|title=Special Look: Face Time (part 3: Call Connection Initialization)|publisher=Packetstan|first=Josh|last=Wright|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FaceTime calls are protected by end-to-end encryption so that only the sender and receiver can access them. Apple cannot decrypt this data.&lt;!-- other reasoning could be political with other companies protecting their own marketplace interests. But not added, as no verifiable cite found! --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://images.apple.com/ipad/business/docs/iOS_Security_Feb14.pdf | title=iOS Security - iOS10 - March 2017 | publisher=Apple | date=March 2017 | accessdate=2017-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to most [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] implementations, Facetime adds techniques that enhance performance at the cost of breaking interoperability:&lt;ref name="Apple's new Facetime - a SIP Perspective"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.krisk.org/2013/09/apples-new-facetime-sip-perspective.html |title=Apple's new Facetime - a SIP Perspective|publisher=Not Just AstLinux Stuff|first=Kristian|last=Kielhofner|date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; port multiplexing, [[Session description protocol|SDP]] minimization and SDP compression.

==FaceTime Audio==
A new audio-only version of FaceTime, named FaceTime Audio, was announced during the annual [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) keynote speech on June 10, 2013, and released with [[iOS 7]] on September 18, 2013. As an audio-only version of FaceTime, it effectively makes the protocol into a [[voice over IP|voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP), that competes with other mainstream providers in the field, including [[Skype]] ([[Microsoft]]).

Based on the same [[AAC-LD]] audio protocol, the service provides high-quality audio. The iOS 7 betas limited FaceTime Audio to calls placed on a Wi-Fi network (the same original limitation of the video version of FaceTime), but the final release has removed that restriction to allow it to work over 3G and LTE data connections, as is the case with most carriers and plans with regard to FaceTime with video. Like the video version, FaceTime Audio is currently only available between Apple devices. The feature is not available to run on the [[iPod Touch]] 4th generation as the device does not support iOS 7 or later. FaceTime streaming over cellular data is unavailable for the [[iPhone 4]] and the [[iPad 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4319|title=Use FaceTime with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limited availability==

===By country===
{{As of|2016|October}}, FaceTime is not enabled on devices bought in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ufone.com/iPhone6/ |title=Ufone: iPhone 6 now available on Ufone, for an amazing 3G experience |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to regulations in these countries that restrict IP-based communications. In addition, on devices bought in [[China]] only FaceTime Audio is disabled, while FaceTime Video is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/facetime-audio-disabled-in-china/ |title=FaceTime audio disabled in China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices bought outside these countries support both video and audio versions of FaceTime.&lt;ref name="Register FT UAE SA limitations 1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/19/facetime |title=Apple wipes smile off FaceTime in the Middle East |newspaper=[[The Register]] |last=Ray |first=Bill |date=October 19, 2010 |accessdate=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Qatar]] and [[Kuwait]] originally disabled FaceTime on the iPhone 4, they later re-enabled the feature through a carrier update for existing phone owners, and made it pre-enabled on any newly purchased iPhone. In March 2018, FaceTime is available for iPhones in [[Saudi Arabia]] upon updating to iOS 11.3.

===By iOS version===
As of April 16, 2014, FaceTime ceased working on earlier versions of iOS which had previously supported it (iOS 4, 5 &amp; 6). This was because the client-side certificate used to authenticate a genuine Apple device with FaceTime servers (amongst other uses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chasechristian.com/blog/2014/04/ios-client-certificate-expiration-april-16-2014/ |publisher=Chase Christian Blog|date=April 21, 2014 |accessdate=February 24, 2016|title=iOS Client Certificate Expiration - April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) expired on that date. Apple chose not to release an update to this certificate for all devices for which a newer major iOS version (with a new, valid certificate) was available. Apple did release a minor update, to the certificate only, for all [[OS X]] versions which could run FaceTime, and also for earlier versions of iOS, but only for the small number of devices which could run FaceTime but which could not run a newer major version of iOS (4th generation iPod touch). The result of this policy was that almost all iOS users had to update the iOS version on their devices if they wished to continue using FaceTime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/ios-6-users-no-longer-able-to-use-facetime-ios-7-upgrade-required/ |publisher=[[TechRepublic]] |date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=February 24, 2016|title=iOS 6 users no longer able to use FaceTime, iOS 7 upgrade required}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This limitation applied even to users of [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbroken]] devices since, even with a legally jailbroken device, it would have been not only difficult but also illegal{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} to extract and install Apple's new certificate, without Apple's permission, in order to work around this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/240ovk/can_we_fix_facetime_on_devices_staying_on_ios6_by/ |publisher=Reddit |date=April 26, 2014 |accessdate=February 24, 2016 |title=Can we fix Facetime on devices staying on iOS6 by backporting the new certificates from 6.0.6/7.1.1?}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{unreliablesource |date=May 2017}}&lt;!--This is a Reddit discussion so clearly is not a reliable source. Further, it does not even clearly conclude it's illegal which makes sense since complicated things like this may not be illegal in all jurisdictions whatever Apple may want--&gt;)

=== On Android &amp; Windows ===
Roughly over 60,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://app.neilpatel.com/en/ubersuggest/overview?keyword=FaceTime+for+android&amp;country=us |publisher=Neil Patel|date=November 10, 2018 |title=UberSuggest}}&lt;/ref&gt; people search for FaceTime for Android on Google. Due to closed proprietorship of FaceTime, it is currently unavailable on other platforms including Android&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://joyofandroid.com/facetime-for-android/ |publisher=John|date=October 17, 2018 |title=Facetime on Android}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Windows.

'''Gordon Memorial College''' was an educational institution in [[Sudan]]. It was built between 1899 and 1902 as part of [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s wide-ranging educational reforms.
Named for General 'Chinese' [[Charles George Gordon]] of the British army, who was killed during the [[History of Mahdist Sudan|Mahdi uprising]] in 1885, it was officially opened on 8 November 1902 by Kitchener himself.

The first students which entered the school in 1903 were primary school students.&lt;ref name = Almanac1949&gt;{{cite book |title=Sudan Almanac 1949|year=1949|publisher=Sudan Government and McCorquodale &amp; Co. (Sudan) Ltd.|location= Khartoum, Sudan|others=Compiled in the Public Relations Office, Civil Secretary's Department, Khartoum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 secondary education courses for assistant engineers and land surveyors were added and in 1906 a four-year course for training primary school teachers was started.&lt;ref Name=uofk.edu&gt;[http://www.uofk.edu/en/about-u-of-k/historical-background.uofk Historical Background] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819144348/http://www.uofk.edu/en/about-u-of-k/historical-background.uofk |date=2012-08-19 }} University of Khartoum, Retrieved 21 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1913 there were about 500 students in the college.&lt;ref name =Almanac1949/&gt;  In 1924 the college commenced  Sharia, Engineering, Teachers' Training, Clerical Work, Accounting and Science vocational courses.&lt;ref Name =uofk.edu/&gt; Post-secondary education courses in Science, Arts, Engineering, Veterinary Science and Law  were started in 1938. There were strong links between courses and Sudan government departments where it was anticipated students would work after graduation. At the beginning of 1945, all these schools were grouped together in a special arrangement with the [[University of London]] and secondary education was moved elsewhere.  In 1948 there were 262 students at the college.&lt;ref name =Almanac1949/&gt;

In 1951, the Gordon Memorial College was merged with the [[Kitchener School of Medicine]] (founded in 1924) and renamed University College Khartoum with the University of London setting the examinations and awarding the degrees. In 1956, the University College became the fully independent [[University of Khartoum]].&lt;ref Name =uofk.edu/&gt;  The University of Khartoum claims to be the oldest University in Sudan based on the founding of the Gordon Memorial College in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Akec, John A.

The college provided high class education to its students who were drawn from all backgrounds of Sudanese youth, enabling them to gain the sort of education previously only available in the great European universities.

Many of the Sudan's Prime Ministers and generals, including [[Mohamed Ahmed Mahjoob]], [[Sirr Al-Khatim Al-Khalifa]], [[Babiker Awadalla]] and [[Ibrahim Abood Ahmed]], studied there.&lt;ref name = PrimeMin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudanembassy.ca/primeMinisters.htm|title=Embassy of Sudan in Canada / Visas Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ismail al-Azhari]], the first prime minister of Sudan, studied at the Gordon Memorial college but graduated from the American University of Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;(2010)  [http://independenceofsudan.blogspot.be/p/presidents-of-sudan.html The Heads of Sudan]  Independence of Sudan, On the anniversary of national independence of the republic of Sudan, Retrieved 22 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian scholar [[Ihsan Abbas]] also began teaching at the College and continued on after it became known as the University of Khartoum.

'''Hans-Peter Kriegel''' (1 October 1948, [[Germany]]) is a German [[computer scientist]] and professor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and leading the Database Systems Group in the Department of Computer Science.

His most important contributions are the [[database index]] structures [[R*-tree]], [[X-tree]] and IQ-Tree, the [[cluster analysis]] algorithms  [[DBSCAN]], [[OPTICS algorithm|OPTICS]] and [[SUBCLU]] and the [[anomaly detection]] method [[Local Outlier Factor|Local Outlier Factor (LOF)]].

In 2009 the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] appointed Hans-Peter Kriegel a "[[fellow]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2009/fellows-2009/ | title=ACM Names 47 Fellows for Innovations in Computing, Information Technology | accessdate=2011-01-25 | author=[[Association for Computing Machinery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of its highest honors. He has been honored in particular for his contributions to "knowledge discovery and [[data mining]], similarity search, [[spatial index|spatial data management]], and access methods for high-dimensional data".

He received the 2013 IEEE ICDM Research Contributions Award for his research on data mining algorithm such as DBSCAN, OPTICS, Local Outlier Factor and his work on mining high-dimensional data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/awards/Kriegel-13.shtml |title=2013 IEEE ICDM Research Contributions Award: Professor Hans-Peter Kriegel |last1=Wu |first1=Xindong |date=2013-10-18 |website=IEEE International Conference on Data Mining |publisher=[[IEEE]] [[International Conference on Data Mining]]|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also awarded the 2015 ACM SIGKDD Innovation Award for his contributions to data mining in clustering, outlier detection and high-dimensional data analysis, in particular for density-based approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=2015 SIGKDD Innovation Award| publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] SIGKDD| date=2015-07-22| accessdate=2015-08-17| url=http://www.kdd.org/blog/2015-sigkdd-innovation-award| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816021034/http://www.kdd.org/blog/2015-sigkdd-innovation-award| archivedate=2015-08-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4721">{{outdated|date=July 2018}}The '''''Horizon Project''''' is an initiative by the [[New Media Consortium]] (NMC) to chart emerging technologies for teaching and learning. Its objective is to help educators and thought leaders across the world build upon the innovation happening at their institutions by providing them with expert research and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mattsmitheducator.net/blog/?p=111 "Horizon Report EdTech Weekly App"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125074835/http://mattsmitheducator.net/blog/?p=111 |date=2014-01-25 }}. Retrieved on 7 Jan 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2002 by [[Laurence F. Johnson]], CEO of NMC, and publishes several reports online detailing trends in the usage of technology in education.

Since 2005, Johnson has collaborated with Rachel S. Smith in the writing of this report.  In 2006, Alan Levine joined the production team, and Keene Haywood joined in 2010.  In 2011, Samantha Adams succeeded Smith as the project's lead researcher and writer.  In 2011, Horizon Report downloads surpassed the 500,000 mark and worldwide readership approached a million people. The NMC’s landmark nine-years-and-counting study of emerging technology continued with the release of the "2011 Horizon Report"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/horizon NMC.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2011. A brand new museum edition was released in October 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/horizon NMC.org]&lt;/ref&gt; to the museum community, along with reports for K-12 education&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/horizon NMC.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and for Australia - New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/horizon NMC.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Horizon Project expanded to Latin America in that year, when for the first time, a Horizon research cycle was conducted completely in Spanish.  The 2010 Horizon Report: Edicion Iberoamericana&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/horizon NMC.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was released in July 2010.

Each report is put together collaboratively by an Advisory Board which consists of an international group of educational experts that are selected by-invitation-only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/ce/stories/detail/cies-wayne-butler-to-serve-on-advisory-board "CIES Wayne Butler to server on advisory board"]&lt;/ref&gt; Reports are released with a [[Creative Commons license]] (attribution-only) and may be freely replicated and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmc.org/horizon-project/horizon-reports "Horizon Reports"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Horizon Project reports have been commonly cited at various trending websites and could be used as guidelines in studying trends in the usage of technology in education. Over the past 10 years, various editions of the reports have been downloaded more than a million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ncccelearning.com/publications/horizon-reports |title="Niagara County Community College eLearning" |access-date=2013-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016040805/http://ncccelearning.com/publications/horizon-reports/ |archive-date=2012-10-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other research projects, the Horizon Project has its fair share of critics (for example, the Higher Ed CIO blog thinks that it is deviating from its original objectives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.thehigheredcio.com/2012/02/23/mind-mapping-the-2012-horizon-report-findings |title="Mind mapping the 2012 Horizon Report Findings" |access-date=2013-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217155920/http://blog.thehigheredcio.com/2012/02/23/mind-mapping-the-2012-horizon-report-findings/ |archive-date=2013-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and supporters (for example the past president of IFEES calls it a "must read"&lt;ref&gt;[http://luenymorell.com/2012/08/02/the-horizon-report-a-must-read-and-resource-for-emerging-use-of-technology-in-education-nmc "The Horizon Report – a Must Read and Resource for Emerging Use of Technology in Education (NMC)"]&lt;/ref&gt;). Various editions of the Horizon Reports are frequently cited by authors of various academic journals and articles. (According to [[Google Scholar]], the 2010 Horizon Report has been cited more than 1000 times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com.sg/scholar?cites=11686582085138472820 "Google Scholar Search"] Retrieved 21 Feb 2014&lt;/ref&gt;)

The '''Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing''' ('''ISTD''') is an international dance teaching and examination board based in [[London]], [[England]]. The registered educational charity, which was established on 25 July 1904 as the ''Imperial Society of Dance Teachers'', provides training and examinations in a range of dance styles and certified dance teacher courses. The ISTD is recognised by the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]] and the [[Council for Dance Education and Training]] and is also a member of the [[British Dance Council]]. It hosts various competitions in many different formats including [[Modern Ballroom]], [[Latin American]], [[Classical Ballet]] and [[Tap Dance]] as well as contemporary styles like Disco Freestyle.

The ISTD is organised into two main faculty boards. [[Dancesport]] coordinates dance techniques that are normally performed in a ballroom or dance hall. [[Theatre dance|Theatre]] is concerned with stage and film performance. The Cecchetti Society is also part of the ISTD. It exists to preserve the [[Cecchetti method]] of classical ballet training.  The ISTD is also represented on the committees of numerous other arts, dance and culture related organisations. 

== History ==
The Imperial Society of Dance Teachers was formed on 25 July 1904 at the Hotel Cecil in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]]. Robert Morris Crompton was its first President. The first ISTD congress was held in 1906 and a congress has subsequently been held every year, with the exception of a brief period during the war years. Its in-house publication ''Dance Journal'' (now titled ''DANCE'') was first published in September 1907.

In 1924 the separate branches, which later became faculties, were formed, and in 1925 the society became the "Imperial Society of Teachers of Dance". In 1945, the ISTD became [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] with [[Victor Silvester]] in the new role of Chairman.

In 1953 the Grand Council of the ISTD was formed. Notable persons from many areas of British society joined the council. It serves to improve communication with key people in British arts and society.

The ISTD is most noted for the use of medal tests, and the ISTD format has been used as a model for similar award systems by many other dance organisations.  The idea of medal tests first came from another dance teaching organisation,&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, Lyndon [1997]. ''The story of British popular dance''. Dance Publications, Brighton. p24: the idea of medal tests was suggested by Edgar Newton in 1932 to the National Association of Teachers of Dancing.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was the ISTD, which first developed the widespread use of the medal test system throughout the UK and internationally.

==Current structure==
The ISTD is a government recognised dance teaching organisation and examination board, which trains and certifies teachers to deliver its syllabus to students in both private and mainstream dance education.  The ISTD offers syllabi in a range of dance styles, which are typically delivered in the form of medal tests or graded examinations.  An accredited awarding body, the ISTD offers qualifications that can be submitted for credit on the [[National Qualifications Framework]].  The organisation structure of the ISTD is divided into three levels, the Administrative Council, Faculty Boards and Faculty Committees.

===Administrative Council===
The Administrative Council is responsible for the overall governance of the ISTD and consists of executives and elected members, headed by ISTD Chair, Sue Passmore. The Council is the principal policy making body of the organisation and rules on recommendations made by the faculty boards and committees, which are represented on the Council. Key administrative duties are performed by executive members, the Finance, Audit &amp; General Purposes Committee and the Nomination &amp; Remuneration Committee. The Administrative Council also includes the Grand Council, a group of eminent dance professionals headed Life President, [[Dame Beryl Grey]].

===Faculty Boards===
The work of the ISTD is divided into two main branches; the Dancesport Faculties Board, commonly known as the Ballroom Branch, and the Theatre Faculties Board, commonly known as the Theatre Branch. These two faculty boards coordinate the work of the faculty committees, which are grouped to reflect the similarities between them.  For example, the Dancesport board consists of dance techniques which are normally performed in a ballroom or dance hall setting, both socially and competitively, whereas the Theatre board, as the name suggests, consists of dance techniques which usually have a connection to stage or film.

===Faculty committees===
The ISTD consists of eleven faculty committees, which are divided between the two Faculty Boards.  Each faculty committee is responsible for the technical and artistic development of a specific dance technique within the ISTD.  The work of a faculty committee includes the continued development of the syllabi for the relevant dance technique, the regulation and control of examinations and the organisation of lectures, teacher training courses, seminars and other events.

== Examinations ==
The ISTD is primarily a dance examination board, with teacher members delivering its syllabi to students in both private and mainstream education.  The majority of people who study the ISTD syllabus are people pursuing dance as a leisure activity and the organisation provides a structured examinations system that caters for pupils from beginner to professional level.  At the higher levels, ISTD teachers can provide training for people wishing to pursue dance as a profession, either as a performer or dance teacher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.istd.org/about/exams/aboutistdexams.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, most subjects have a series of graded examinations.  These progress from Primary and up through numbers Grades (Grade 1, Grade 2, etc.), with Vocational graded examinations at Intermediate, Advanced 1 and Advanced 2 levels.  Some subjects have differing examination systems, some offering medal tests and other awards.

=== Grade exams ===
The grade system is especially adapted to different ages of pupils, and as a basis for dance as an activity in schools or other similar institutions. Grade Examinations may be taken in Classical Ballet (Cecchetti and Imperial methods), Modern Theatre, Tap, National Dance, Classical Greek, South Asian (Kathak and Bharatanatyam), Modern Ballroom, Latin American, Disco Freestyle and Classical Sequence. Grades 1-6 are accredited by [[Ofqual]], but some Faculties have additional Grades prior to Grade 1, that is, Pre-Primary and Primary.

=== Class exams ===
Class Examinations may be taken in Classical Ballet (Cecchetti and Imperial methods), Classical Greek and Modern Theatre.

=== Medal tests ===
[[Medal examinations (dance)|Medal tests]] may be taken in Modern Ballroom, Latin American, Sequence, Disco Freestyle, Rock ‘n’ Roll, Country &amp; Western, Classical Greek, Tap and National. The levels progress from Bronze to Silver, Gold, Gold Star and higher awards for Dancesport medals.

=== Vocational grades ===
The Vocational Grades are accredited by Ofqual and include Intermediate Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced 1 and Advanced 2. These examinations form a cohesive bridge between the work covered in the Grades and the work of the professional examinations.

=== Professional qualifications ===
Dancers who have achieved a high level examination pass in an ISTD dance subject can progress into teacher training with the organisation. The teacher training is provided through approved dance centres and consists of both theory and practical examinations designed to demonstrate the candidates ability and knowledge to teach dance. People who successfully complete the training become registered teachers of the ISTD and may enter students for examinations in the dance subject for which they have qualified.  Some ISTD teacher may progress to further their qualifications further and gain qualifications in other branches of the society. There are various professional examinations, depending on where candidates live.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.istd.org/about/exams/aboutistdexams.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*European Union Theatre Examinations: Teachers entering candidates for ISTD examinations need to gain the ''Diploma in Dance Instruction'', followed by the ''Diploma in Dance Education'' and then may choose to progress to Licentiate and Fellowship.
*Rest of the World Theatre Examinations: For the rest of the world the qualifications are the ''Associate'' and the ''Associate Diploma''. Teachers can enter students for examinations following their Associate examination and once they have obtained their ''Associate Diploma'' can then choose to progress to Licentiate and Fellowship.
*Global Dancesport Examinations: For all Dancesport examinations, regardless of country, the ''Student Teacher'' and ''Associate'' qualifications can be taken. Candidates within the European Union can also take ''Foundation in Dance Instruction'' and ''Certificate in Dance Education'' in some dance genres if they wish. Following Associate, candidates may choose to progress to Licentiate and Fellowship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3815">'''The Integrated Humanities Program''' ('''IHP'''), also known as the Pearson integrated Humanities Program, was a program at the [[University of Kansas]] in the 1970s.  The program was dedicated to the instilling of wonder in and pursuit of truth with underclassmen.  It was led by three faculty: Dr. Dennis Quinn, Dr. John Senior, and Dr. Frank Nelick.

==Academics and Activities==
In the words of Dennis Quinn, the program sought to "teach the [[Great Books of the Western World|Great Books]], the classics, from the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] up through the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and through the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] into the modern times.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/where_wonder_cultivated_catholicity/|title=Where Wonder Cultivated Catholicity|website=National Catholic Register|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to studying the great books, the students also got together for [[poetry]] memorization, singing [[Folk music|folk]] songs, formal [[waltz]]ing lessons, and [[Amateur astronomy|stargazing]], an activity the founders thought to be one of the greatest sources of wonder.

==Controversy==
After numerous conversions on the part of students to [[Catholicism]] and the subsequent publishing of an article on the part of the [[Kansas City Times]] newspaper depicting a [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolution of a [[hippie]] gradually becoming [[Christian monasticism|Catholic monk]], the university administration set up an investigation of the program to determine whether or not the three faculty were [[Proselytism|proselytizing]].  Ultimately, the program was disbanded following the investigations, despite the investigation group having issued a statement saying "In the face of charges of religious indoctrination and proselytizing, the Committee has found no evidence that the professors of the program have engaged in such activities in the classroom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/1995/what-price-truth-death-by-administration|title=What Price Truth?

==Notable alumni==
A number of Catholic leaders in America were formed in the program such as [[James D. Conley|Bishop James Conley]] of the Diocese of Lincoln, Nebraska (who converted to Catholicism with Dr. Senior as his [[Godparent|godfather]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lincolndiocese.org/bishops/bishop-james-conley/biography|title=Biography|website=www.lincolndiocese.org|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Stagg Coakley|Archbishop Paul Coakley]] of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Dom Philip Anderson, abbot of [[Monastery of Our Lady of the Annunciation of Clear Creek|Our Lady Of The Annunciation of Clear Creek Abbey]].

Dr. Robert Carlson, one of the three founders of [[Wyoming Catholic College]], its first academic dean, and the author of its philosophical vision statement, also is an alumnus of the program.

'''Interim Alternative Educational Setting''' ('''IAES''') is a term for an educational setting and program other than the student's current placement that enables the student to continue to receive educational services according to his or her [[Individualized Education Program]].  The Individualized Education Program or [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]] is a plan determined by a team who develops a set of modifications for the educational program of a [[special education]] student.  The setting is designed to allow the student to continue progress in the regular [[curriculum]] to meet the goals set out by the IEP and to allow students to receive services and modifications designed to help students address problem behavior.

The '''International Association for the Study of Child Language''' ('''IASCL''') is an [[academic society]] for [[first language acquisition]] researchers. It was founded in 1970 by a group of prominent language acquisition researchers to promote international and interdisciplinary cooperation in the study of child language. Its major activity is the sponsorship of the triennial International Congress for the Study of Child Language, for which it publishes proceedings.  It also publishes the Child Language Bulletin approximately twice a year.

'''Krishna Kaur Khalsa''' is an African-American teacher of [[Kundalini Yoga]] as taught by [[Yogi Bhajan]].  Born '''Thelma Oliver,''' she pursued a career in films and theater before in 1970 dedicating herself to empowering others through the practice of yoga.

==Early years==
Khalsa was born Thelma Oliver in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on May 6, 1939.  Her father, Cappy Oliver played trumpet with [[Lionel Hampton]]'s band and her mother tried her hand at roller skating, wrestling, and singing before settling down to raise five children.  She studied dance at a school run by [[Jeni Le Gon]] before majoring in Drama and Theatre Arts at the University of California in Los Angeles [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Girl on Broadway," Ebony Magazine, October 1966, p. 57 https://books.google.com/books?id=OkbpkXl3lMwC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=for+thelma,+the+journey+was+uphill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FiM3VODdIOXjsATqrYCoAQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=for%20thelma%2C%20the%20journey%20was%20uphill&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing career==
Oliver dropped out of school in 1961 and went East to pursue her calling as a performer.  Her off-Broadway stage debut was in [[The Blacks (play)]] by French dramatist [[Jean Genet]], where she performed the role of Virtue along with [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]].  Oliver also performed in the musicals Fly Blackbird and Cindy, and the revue The Living Premise, where in 1963 she replaced [[Diana Sands]] for two months.&lt;ref&gt;"New Girl on Broadway," Ebony Magazine, October 1966, p. 52 https://books.google.com/books?id=OkbpkXl3lMwC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=thelma+oliver+actress&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p1NKfk41fP&amp;sig=SEY5SQkTY2R-VlMMsV77Oo9sV8M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZFYiTvzmMpSWtwfL3-ifAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=thelma%20oliver%20actress&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver also took a number of film roles beginning with a part as a "Negro woman" in the hit [[South Pacific (1958 film)]].  Her contribution to the 1961 swashbuckler [[Pirates of Tortuga]] is not credited.  In [[Black Like Me (film)]], released in 1964, Oliver played the role of Georgie.  She performed the role of "Ortiz's girl" in [[Sidney Lumet]]'s [[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]].  The cast included [[Rod Steiger]], [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]], [[Brock Peters]], and [[Morgan Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;Internet Movie Database https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0647014&lt;/ref&gt; It was Oliver's pivotal scene with Rod Steiger near the film's end, that drew controversy at the time, when Oliver exposed her breasts. The film was among the first American movies to feature nudity during the Production Code, and was the first film featuring bare breasts to receive Production Code approval. Although it was publicly announced to be a special exception, the controversy proved to be first of similar major challenges to the Code that ultimately led to its abandonment.

Thelma Oliver's biggest success as a performer came when she landed the role of "Helene" in the Broadway musical [[Sweet Charity]] with [[Gwen Verdon]].  Sweet Charity played at the [[Palace Theatre (New York City)]] from January 1966 to July 1967, 608 performances, garnering twelve [[Tony Award]] nominations, including an award for its choreography.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Stanley, Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre, Boston, MA: Da Capo Press, 1980, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turn to Yoga==
While a 1966 Ebony Magazine profile mentions Oliver's study of "yoga philosophy and breathing," &lt;ref&gt;"New Girl on Broadway," Ebony Magazine, October 1966, p. 57 https://books.google.com/books?id=OkbpkXl3lMwC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=for+thelma,+the+journey+was+uphill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FiM3VODdIOXjsATqrYCoAQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=for%20thelma%2C%20the%20journey%20was%20uphill&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; yoga became her life's calling four years later when she met [[Yogi Bhajan]].  Yogi Bhajan renamed her "Krishna Kaur" - meaning Divine Princess.  Under his direction, she became a yoga teacher with a special dispensation to serve the Black community.  Krishna Kaur established a yoga community in the [[Watts, Los Angeles]] neighborhood with a live-in center, children's school, day care, twice weekly free kitchen and "Sat Nam Street Players" dedicated to bringing music and inspiration to the troubled streets of the ghetto.&lt;ref&gt;Shanti Kaur Khalsa, The History of Sikh Dharma in the Western Hemisphere, Espanola, NM: Sikh Dharma International, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna Kaur's radical spirit found full expression in her yoga mission.  In her words: "The revolution is really one of the mind.  Blacks have got to realize where the power really is.  The struggle is not on a physical level.  It is on the level of the mind."&lt;ref&gt;"Yoga: Something for Everyone, Ebony Magazine, September 1975, p. 102. https://books.google.com/books?id=iVx7JXZQWgEC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=thelma+oliver+krishna+kaur+kundalini+yoga+Ramdas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DSI3VO3MK4eNsQSHi4GgBg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=thelma%20oliver%20krishna%20kaur%20kundalini%20yoga%20Ramdas&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna Kaur's journey into Kundalini Yoga and the [[Sikh]] tradition of Yogi Bhajan took her to the spiritual capital of [[Amritsar]] and the "Golden Temple" or [[Harimandir Sahib]] in December 1970 and again thereafter.  In August 1980 she made history when, through a combination of circumstances she became the first and only woman to have ever sung Sikh hymns within the strictly patriarchal precincts of the Golden Temple.&lt;ref&gt;Shanti Kaur Khalsa, The History of Sikh Dharma in the Western Hemisphere, Espanola, NM: Sikh Dharma International, pp. 13-15, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Krishna Kaur played a central role in the founding of the International Black Yoga Teachers Association.  She also started up Yoga for Youth, dedicated to serving young people in trouble with the U.S. criminal justice system.  Krishna Kaur is currently the Chairman of the Board of Yoga for Youth.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Renfrow Hamilton, "Yoga in Black and White," Yoga Journal, September–October 2000, pp. 104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for her musical talent, Krishna Kaur never gave up performing.  In the 1970s, she toured and recorded with a group called "Sat Nam West." &lt;ref&gt;Gurubanda Singh Khalsa, (1979). "Music the Companion That Soothes Us and Moves Us," in Khalsa, Sardarni Premka Kaur; Khalsa, Sat Kirpal Kaur. The Man Called Siri Singh Sahib. Los Angeles: Sikh Dharma.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she released an album, One Creator.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.krishnakaur.org/one-creator-album-listening-party/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{LGBT orgs series}}
'''LGBT student centers''' are administrative offices of a [[liberal arts colleges in the United States|college]] or [[university]] that provide resources and support for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) [[student]]s.

== Function ==
{{More citations needed|date=November 2009}}
Depending on the campus, an LGBT Campus Center's mission may include [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] support, student [[advocacy]], [[alumnus|alumni]] relations, and/or [[public relations]] with the greater community (especially in response to crisis).

An LGBT Campus Center may provide academic resources related to [[Queer Studies|LGBT Studies]], support social opportunities for LGBT people to interact, and sponsor educational events for the campus as a whole. Most Campus Centers provide referrals to other campus departments or off-campus organizations to help meet student needs.

The [[University of Pennsylvania]] has one of the oldest LGBTQ centers in the country. It enthusiastically support LGBTQ students in many ways; they actively offer peer mentorships, provide spacious space to socialize and study, and many activities every months in order to make LGBTQ students allies and reduce prejudice of straight students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.vpul.upenn.edu/lgbtc/about.php|website=Division of the Vice Provost for University Life University of Pennsylvania|publisher=Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Center|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some LGBT Campus Centers provide psychological [[counseling]] for students struggling with their [[sexual identity|sexual]] or [[gender identity]] and for students coping with internal or external [[prejudice]]. Some example scenarios of when a student might seek out counseling from an LGBT Campus Center:

* A questioning student seeks help understanding their sexual identity
* A self-affirmed transgender student has just experienced a [[hate crime|bias-motivated attack]]
* A [[heterosexual|straight]] student is having difficulty coping with a gay roommate

== Demographics ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
According to a November 2006 report by the [[National Consortium of Directors of LGBT Resources in Higher Education]], there are 115 LGBT Campus Centers that employ professional staff in [[North America]], though this figure is not comprehensive. According to the

Of [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'s "Top 20 Universities for LGBT Students", the [[University of Puget Sound]] is the only one without an explicit LGBT Campus Center. However, the University's Multicultural Student Services office serves LGBT students in addition to other minority student populations. The University of Southern California, a school that received a perfect "GPA" (Gay Point Average) from the Advocate, has both an LGBT Resource Center and a GLBT Student Assembly.

As she traveled, La Meri learned the native dances of the different areas she visited, studying with local dance masters.  She went on to create her own dance works based on the steps and movement vocabularies she learned.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Farrar Burns, "Meri, La," The International Encyclopedia of Dance, Selma Jean Cohen and Dance perspectives foundation, © 1998, 2005 by Oxford University Press, Inc..&lt;/ref&gt; She researched the dance styles of Latin America, Spain, Africa, and Asia extensively. This allowed her to bring authenticity to the stage in a way that rang true to the roots of each dance style. 
    
In 1940, La Meri and Ruth St. Denis founded the "School of Natya", which is Hindu dance, in New York City.  Through the school, La Meri formed ''The Five Natyas'', her first performing company.  In 1945 she absorbed the school of Natya into Ethnologic Dance Center and the Ethnologic Dance Theater, which operated from 1942-1956.  She also performed at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;ref&gt;“The American Museum of Natural History Presents La Meri and Company with Juana in Around the World with Dance and Song,” Program from 1949. Dieman-Bennett Dance Theatre of the Hemispheres records, Iowa Women's Archives, The University of Iowa Libraries, Iowa City.&lt;/ref&gt;
and presented concert programs of young ethnic-dancers from across the globe. In 1944, she choreographed swan lake with the translation into Hindu dance movements. She did not change ballet's music and plot, but added a prologue and a danced fight between the princess and the Rothbart.

La Meri taught regularly at [[Jacob’s Pillow]], gave lecture-demonstrations, and published a number of magazine articles and books, including ''The Gesture Language of Hindu Dance'' (1941) and ''Spanish Dancing'' (1948).  The latter book is considered to be a definitive text on the subject of Spanish dance.  Overall, La Meri’s extensive work in [[ethnic dance]] earned her the reputation of being one of the foremost experts in the ethnic-dance field.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=La Meri, 89, a Dancer, Teacher And Specialist in Ethnic Repertory|author=Jennifer Dunning|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/21/obituaries/la-meri-89-a-dancer-teacher-and-specialist-in-ethnic-repertory.html |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=January 21, 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; La Meri's work helped to inspire other choreographers to show respect for dances of cultures not their own, as well as educating the audience. Her thorough anthropological work embodied the values of each ethnicity she used in her choreography and highlighted the importance of integrity in the dance world.

In 1938 La Meri published a book "Songs and Voyages," with 82 pages of poetry, now very rare.  [Livorno -Arti Grafiche S. Belfort &amp; C. 5 Dicembre 1938 - XVII, printed in Italy] According to the frontispiece, her poetry had appeared in American Poetry Magazine, Literary Digest, Braithwaite Anthology, L'Alouette, The Harp, The Dance Magazine, Independent Poetry Anthology, Lariat, Circle, Buccaneer, Contemporary Verse, Interludes, Gammadion, Texas Anthology, Bozart, American Anthology, Poetry Journal, Bright Scrawl, Unicorn, Home Magazine, Present Day Poets, Wandering Eros, more.

She received [[Capezio#Capezio Dance Award Honorees|Capezio Dance Award]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

The '''Manning Clark House''', designed by Australian architect, [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] in 1952, is a house located at 11 Tasmania Circle, {{ACTcity|Forrest}}, a suburb of [[Canberra]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The house was built for Professor [[Manning Clark]] (1915 – 1991), described as "Australia's most famous historian",&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Davidson and others, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian History'', Oxford University Press 1998, 128&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife, [[Dymphna Clark]], (1916 – 2000), a linguist and educator.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Philip (May 2000) [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/29/guardianobituaries4 ''Dymphna Clark obituary''], theguardian.com; accessed 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The house in now home to '''Manning Clark House Inc.''' (MCH), a community based institution that nurtures creative practice and research in Australian history, human rights, literature, music, visual art, and indigenous culture, as well as discussion and debate on issues of public importance and all areas of scholarly interest. The organisation supports the intellectual and creative community through a network of scholars and community garden. The program includes public lectures, open forums, seminars, conferences, art exhibitions, poetry readings, concerts, book launches, human rights education, and social gatherings in the former home of Manning and Dymphna Clark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manningclark.org.au/index.htm Manning Clark House website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903125814/http://www.manningclark.org.au/index.htm |date=3 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2000 death of Dymphna Clark, the house was transferred to community use.

She did her undergraduate studies at [[Guilford College]], graduating in 1961,{{r|guilford}}
and was initially denied admission for graduate study in mathematics at the University of North Carolina for being a woman. Nevertheless, she persisted,{{r|ggstem}} and earned a master's degree there in 1966 under the mentorship of [[Alfred Brauer]], with a thesis on ''Elementary estimates for the least positive primitive root modulo p&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;''.{{r|brauer}}

After finishing her master's degree, she became a secondary school mathematics teacher. Later, she obtained a teaching position at the University of North Carolina, and while teaching there completed her doctorate in mathematics and mathematics education through a [[distance education]] program{{r|ggstem}} at [[Union Institute &amp; University]].

==Recognition==
In 2008, TODOS gave Leiva their Iris Carl Equity and Leadership Award.{{r|icarl}}
In 2013 the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM) gave her the inaugural Kay Gilliland Equity Lecture Award for "contributions to equity in mathematics education".{{r|gilliland}}
In 2014 the NCTM gave her the Mathematics Education Trust Lifetime Achievement Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics Education.{{r|nctm}}

[[File:Logo of NBLSA.jpg|thumb|Logo of the National Black Law Students Association]]

The '''National Black Law Students Association''' ('''NBLSA'''), founded in 1968, is a nationwide organization formed to articulate and promote the needs and goals of black law students and effectuates change in the legal community.  As the largest student run organization in the country with over 6,000 members, NBLSA includes chapters or affiliates in six different countries including The Bahamas, Nigeria, and South Africa.  NBLSA encourages the development of talented, social conscious lawyers of tomorrow.  NBLSA help start the Black Law Students Association of Canada (BLSAC), The National Latino/Latina Student Association (NLLSA), National Association of Law Students with Disabilities (NALSD), and The National Asian Pacific American Law Student Association (NAPALSA).  The headquarters of NBLSA is located in [[Washington, D.C.]].  Organized into six regions (Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southern, Mid-West, Rocky Mountain and Western Region) the organization has over 200 chapters and is present in all but a few of the nation's accredited law schools, as well as unaccredited law schools.  Each year, the organization holds an annual convention to engage in legal activism and while preparing new generations of black lawyers to "effectuate change."  Additionally, the [[Frederick Douglass]] [[Moot Court]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]] [[Mock Trial]] Competitions are held during its Annual Convention.  

In 1968, [[Algernon Johnson Cooper]], former mayor of [[Prichard, Alabama]], founded the first '''Black American Law Students Association''' at the [[New York University Law School]].  In 1983, BALSA revised its name and the word "American" was deleted to encompass all blacks, including those not of American nationality.  Later, the word "National" was added to reflect the organization's national expansion, which now includes representation in the law schools of forty-eight states and [[Puerto Rico]]. 

The association has ties with the [[National Bar Association]], the Council on Legal Education Opportunity, The National Black Alliance, and the National Black Leadership Roundtable.  However, the most important affiliation and duty this organization has is to the black community—nationally and abroad.

The '''National Education Policy Center''' ('''NEPC''') is a non-profit [[education policy]] research center located in the School of Education at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. It was founded in 2010 and is funded by a variety of governmental organizations, NGOs, and foundations. The Center’s publications are intended for a broad audience that includes academic experts, policy makers, the media, and the general public. The Center's goal is to provide high quality information in support of democratic deliberation about education policy.

The '''New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Inc.''' ('''NEASC''') is an independent, voluntary, nonprofit membership organization which connects and serves over 1500 public, independent, and international learning communities in the US and worldwide. Founded in 1885,&lt;ref name="neaschistory"&gt;[https://www.neasc.org/about/history NEASC History]&lt;/ref&gt; the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) has been working to establish and maintain high standards for all levels of education longer than any other accreditation agency in the United States. A globally recognized standard of excellence, NEASC Accreditation attests to a school’s high quality and integrity. 

NEASC Accreditation&lt;ref name="neascfaq"&gt;[https://www.neasc.org/overview/faq Accreditation FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; is a system of accountability that is ongoing, voluntary, and comprehensive in scope. It is based on a rigorous set of Standards which define the characteristics of high quality, effective learning communities and encompass all aspects of a school, center, or institution’s operation. In accordance with the independent, voluntary nature of accreditation, the Standards are developed and reviewed periodically by the NEASC Commissions and the membership in order to remain in alignment with current research, best practices, and pertinent governmental regulations (in the US and abroad). It does not compare or ranks schools, but rather respects differences in institutional populations, missions, and cultures, and fosters institutional growth grounded in the experience and expertise of practicing educators.

Headquartered in [[Burlington, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref name="directions"&gt;[https://www.neasc.org/contact NEASC map/directions]&lt;/ref&gt;, NEASC focuses on holistic approaches to improving education and partners with schools and other organizations all around the world to do so. NEASC is dedicated to helping schools reach their individual goals, and to supporting a quality educational experience for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neasc.org/about/mission?lang=en|title=NEASC Mission {{!}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
His books focus primarily on the [[American Old West|historical American West]]. His most famous book, [[Warlock (1958 novel)|''Warlock'']], was a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt; The [[Warlock (1959 film)|film adaptation of the same title]], directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]], starred [[Henry Fonda]], [[Richard Widmark]] and [[Anthony Quinn]].  In [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s introduction to [[Richard Fariña]]'s ''[[Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me]]'', Pynchon stated that he and Fariña started a "micro-cult" around ''Warlock''. Another novel, ''The Downhill Racers'', was made into a [[Downhill Racer|film]]  starring [[Robert Redford]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064253/|title=Downhill Racer|date=9 January 1970|work=IMDb|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Wallace Stegner]], Hall was considered the dean of West Coast writers, having supported the early careers of California novelists such as [[Richard Ford]] and  [[Michael Chabon]], both graduates of the well-known writing program at the [[University of California, Irvine]], where Hall taught for many years, and [[Amy Tan]], his student from The Community of Writers at Squaw Valley.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;  Hall's colleagues at Irvine included Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and fellow Iowa graduate [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], and poet and Victorian Scholar [[Robert Peters]]. San Diego—and Hall's one-time San Diego neighborhood of Mission Hills—serve as focal points of two novels, ''Corpus of Joe Bailey'' and ''Love &amp; War in California''.

Oakley Hall married Barbara Edinger Hall, a professional photographer, in 1944, and they were married for 64 years. They had four children: Brett Hall Jones, director of the Community of Writers at Squaw Valley, the writers’ conference that Oakley Hall helped found in 1969; [[Sands Hall]], a teacher, actor, director, and novelist (''Catching Heaven'', 2000, and ''Tools of the Writer’s Craft'', 2005);&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt; Tracy, a schoolteacher; and [[Oakley Hall III|Oakley "Tad" Hall III]], the author of the play ''Grinder’s Stand'',&lt;ref name=ny /&gt; whose tragic fall from a bridge and the brain damage suffered from this fall are documented in Bill Rose's film ''[[The Loss of Nameless Things]]''.&lt;ref name="senate.universityofcalifornia.edu"/&gt;

Hall died May 12, 2008, in [[Nevada City, California]].&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt; Among his many honors are lifetime achievement awards from the [[PEN American Center]] and the [[Cowboy Hall of Fame]].

The '''Octalysis''' Framework is a human-centric gamification design framework that lays out the eight core drives for humans [[motivation]] developed by Yu-Kai Chou.&lt;ref name="Chou2015" /&gt; The framework is based on the premise that systems are “function-focused”, designed to complete a task as quickly as possible, similar to a factory process assuming workers will complete their tasks in a timely manner because they are required to do so. However, human-focused design acknowledges that people, unlike machines in a system have feelings, insecurities, and reasons why they want or do not want to do certain things, and therefore, optimizes for their feelings, motivations, and engagement.

The framework lays out the structure for analyzing the driving forces behind human motivation. It is the process of applying the core behavior drives that motivate a user to complete a task efficiently through an interactive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coronado Escobar|first=Jesús Eduardo|last2=Vasquez Urriago|first2=Angela Rocio|date=2014-01-01|title=Gamification: An Effective Mechanism to Promote Civic Engagement and Generate Trust?|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2691195.2691307|journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance|series=ICEGOV '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=514–515|doi=10.1145/2691195.2691307|isbn=9781605586113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Octalysis framework is used in [[healthcare]], [[Physical fitness|fitness]], [[education]], [[training]], [[company]], and [[product design]] to increase user [[engagement]], ROI and motivation.&lt;ref name="Daphne2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Daphne | first=Economou | last2=Ioannis | first2=Doumanis | last3=Frands | first3=Pedersen | last4=Paresh | first4=Kathrani | last5=Markos | first5=Mentzelopoulos | last6=Vassiliki | first6=Bouki | title=Evaluation of a dynamic role-playing platform for simulations based on Octalysis gamification framework | journal=Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments | publisher=IOS Press | volume=19 | issue=Workshop Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Intelligent Environments | year=2015 | issn=1875-4163 | pages=388–395 | url=http://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-530-2-388 | doi=10.3233/978-1-61499-530-2-388 | accessdate=2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salcu2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gamification applied in affiliate marketing.

== Eight core drives ==
The Octalysis framework suggests that if there are no core drives present, then there is no motivation and no behavior will happen. This is based on the premise that almost all games appeal to certain core drives within us and motivate us towards a variety of decisions and activities. The framework divides these motivations into eight core drives.

=== Epic meaning and calling ===
This Core Drive is in play when a person believes he or she is doing something greater than oneself or was “chosen” to take action. An example would be [[Wikipedia]] volunteers who maintain the page and contribute to the development of its content. Contributors do not receive any extrinsic reward, but they feel that their contribution will help to develop and protect human knowledge. The implementation of this drive can vastly differ, and is not limited to altruistic behavior. Some of the world's worst events and actions have happened with the belief of participating in something greater than oneself.

=== Development and accomplishment ===
Development and accomplishment is our internal drive for making progress, developing skills, achieving mastery, and eventually overcoming challenges. The perception of the challenge is important. For example, a badge or trophy without a challenge is not meaningful for a person. This is the drive that most PBLs: Points, Badges, and Leaderboards focus on.

=== Empowerment of creativity and feedback ===
This drive is expressed when users are engaged in a creative process where they repeatedly figure new things out and try different combinations. People not only need ways to express their creativity, but also need to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and adjust in turn. This is why playing with Legos, playing Minecraft, and making art are intrinsically fun. When properly designed and integrated to empower users to be creative; they often become Evergreen Mechanics: a game designer no longer needs to continuously add content to keep the activity fresh and engaging. The brain simply entertains itself.

=== Ownership and possession ===
This drive refers to users feeling like they own or control something. When a person feels [[ownership]] over something, they innately want to increase and improve what they own. For example, the human desire to accumulate wealth and the overvaluing of objects within one's possession are the result of this drive. People might think their house is worth far more than the market is willing to pay for it, not because of any intrinsic property of the house but because they personally own it.

=== Social influence and relatedness ===
This drive incorporates all the social elements that motivate people, including: [[mentorship]], [[social acceptance]], [[companionship]], and even [[competition]] and [[envy]]. When you see a friend that is amazing at some skill or owns something extraordinary, you become driven to attain the same. Think about how we naturally draw closer to people, places, or events that we can relate to.

=== Scarcity and impatience ===
Scarcity and impatience is the core drive of wanting something simply because it is extremely rare, exclusive, or immediately unattainable. Many games have Appointment dynamics or torture breaks within them (come back in 2 hours to get your reward). The fact that people can’t get something right now motivates them to return to check the availability of the product.&lt;ref name="WuLu2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Wann-Yih|last2=Lu|first2=Hsiao-Yun|last3=Wu|first3=Ying-Yin|last4=Fu|first4=Chen-Su|title=The effects of product scarcity and consumers' need for uniqueness on purchase intention|journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies|volume=36|issue=3|year=2012|pages=263–274 |issn=1470-6423|doi=10.1111/j.1470-6431.2011.01000.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unpredictability and curiosity ===
Unpredictability is the core drive of constantly being engaged because you don't know what is going to happen next. When something does not fall into your regular pattern recognition cycles, your brain kicks into high gear and pays attention to the unexpected. This is the primary core drive behind gambling addictions, but also present in every sweepstake or lottery program that companies run. Think about the controversial Skinner Box experiments, where an animal irrationally presses a lever frequently because of unpredictable results.

=== Loss and avoidance ===
Loss and avoidance is the core drive that motivates us to avoid something negative from happening. On a small scale, it could be to avoid losing previous work or changing one's behavior. On a larger scale, it could be to avoid admitting that everything you did up to this point was useless because you are now quitting. Opportunities that are fading away have a strong utilization of this core drive, because people feel if they didn't act immediately, they would lose the opportunity to act forever. This is commonly known as [[fear of missing out]] and can often be seen in marketing promotions with limited time periods, or [[Speculation|speculative investments]] where any delay may lead to missing out on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

== Left and right brain core drives ==
Everything we do is based on one or more of the eight core drives. If none of them is present, there is zero motivation and no action takes place. Additionally, each of these drives have different natures within them. Some make the user feel powerful, but do not create urgency. Others core drives create urgency, obsession, and even addiction, but make the user feel bad. Some are more short-term extrinsically focused, while some are more long-term intrinsically focused.

As a result, the 8 core drives are charted on an octagon not simply for aesthetic purposes, but because the placement determines the nature of the motivation.

The left side of the Octalysis chart is commonly associated with logic, analytical thought, and ownership. People are motivated by extrinsic elements such as [[Reward system|rewards]], [[money]], [[goal]]s, [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]], [[point (disambiguation)|point]]s, [[badges]], [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]]. However, once people obtain the goal or get used to it, they no longer take the desired behavior.

The right side of the Octalysis chart relies on [[intrinsic motivation]]: creativity, self-expression and social dynamics. You don't need a goal or reward to use your creativity, hangout with friends, or to feel the suspense of unpredictability. Balancing extrinsic and intrinsic core drives is an important task; research shows that extrinsic motivation impairs intrinsic motivation. Because once the companies stop offering the extrinsic motivator, user motivation will often plummet to a level much lower than when the extrinsic motivator was first introduced (the Over-justification Effect).

Keep in mind that left brain and right brain references are not literal in terms of actual brain geography, but merely a symbolic differentiation between two distinct functions of the brain.

== White hat and black hat core drives ==

White hat core drives make us feel powerful, fulfilled, and satisfied. On the Octalysis octagon they are represented on the top. It involves motivations that engage the user on expressing creativity and achievement through mastering of skills, resulting in a higher sense of accomplishments, meaning, and empowerment. While they make us feel powerful, fulfilled and satisfied, they don't attain much urgency ("I am going to save the world, but I need a coffee first”).

Black hat core drives are located at the bottom of the Octalysis chart. Black Hat core drives make us feel obsessed, anxious and addicted. If you are always doing something because you don't know what will happen next, you are constantly in fear of losing something, or because you're struggling to attain things you can't have, the experience will often leave a bad taste in your mouth- even if you are consistently motivated to take these actions.

The white hat core drives are represented by the core drives at the top of the Octalysis diagram:
* Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning and Calling
* Core Drive 2: Development and Accomplishment
* Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback

The black hat core drives are represented by the core drives at the Bottom of the Octalysis diagram:
* Core Drive 6: Scarcity and Impatience
* Core Drive 7: Unpredictability and Curiosity
* Core Drive 8: Loss and Avoidance

Using the Octalysis framework, Magnum created a digital online game that resembles the Super Mario game. After playing the game, the player is returned to Magnum’s main site.

mHealth has developed applications based on the Octalysis framework to assist people in self-care management and self-stress management. They are using framework to map how top rated stress management apps address the right brain drives and to provide motivation to increase adherence.&lt;ref name="Ewais2015" /&gt;

Several companies have used or been inspired by the Octalysis Framework, including [[Accenture]], [[Lego|LEGO]] and Trade Samurai.

== What is 1:1 Computing in Education? ==

In the context of education, '''one-to-one computing''' (sometimes abbreviated as "'''1:1'''") refers to academic institutions, such as schools or colleges, that allow each enrolled student to use an electronic device in order to access the Internet, digital course materials, and [[digital textbook]]s. The concept has been actively explored and sporadically implemented since the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bebel|first=Damian|author2=Rachel Kay|title=One to one computing: A summary of the quantitative results from the Berkshire Wireless Learning Initiative|journal=Journal of Technology, Learning, and Assessment|year=2010|volume=9|issue=2|url=http://napoleon.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/jtla/article/viewFile/1607/1462|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-to-one computing used to be contrasted with a policy of "[[bring your own device]]" (BYOD), which encourages or requires students to use their own laptops, smartphones or other electronic devices in class. The distinction between BYOD and school-issued devices became blurred when many schools started recommending devices for parents to buy (examples for both iPads and Chromebooks being used 1:1 in schools, but being paid for by parents exist, there may be similar evidence for other devices). The term 1:1 computing in education is now redefined to a situation where students have access to a device per individual that is used in the teaching as a tool for learning. 
Historically, the programs have centered around the following devices:
* [[Laptop]]s (with some competing MACs) 1990s-2010.
* [[iPad]]s (with some competing Android and Windows devices) 2010-2014
* [[Chromebook]]s (2015–present) (with ipad+keyboard and other laptop &amp; tablet-computers competing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/as-chromebook-sales-soar-in-schools-apple-and-microsoft-fight-back/ | title=As Chromebook sales soar in schools, Apple and Microsoft fight back}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''
The level of education will influence the type of adoption, through factors such as: user-readiness, budget, expected merits, and cost-benefits.
* For young students, iPads and competing devices remain very popular, but they are not always 1:1. Many more affluent schools provide each of their students with an iPad to use throughout the school year. 
* For students that need to type more, Chromebooks are the most common. Middle and High Schools and, to some extent, colleges have been customers for Chromebooks. 
* For mature/adult students in higher education, the BYOD approach is most employed. Institutions provide WiFi and web-based LMS access. However, chromebooks can be found in many libraries.
*

== What are the Benefits ==

There seems to be consensus that 1:1 availability of devices improves their usefulness. Having to share devices reduces their educational efficacy because of the reduced intensity &amp; length of the experience and the additional time spent on file-management, configuration management, device management and distribution.

Before cloud-computing the main benefits referred to access to devices. As cloud-computing progressed collaboration, cost reduction, going paperless, 21st century skills became more of a focus. Red research included 1:1 and collaboration in its key research findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://one-to-oneinstitute.org/findings|title=Findings|website=one-to-oneinstitute.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One-to-one computing offers the benefits of equal access, standardization, easy upgrades, simple networking and the ability to monitor student progress and online behavior. For these reasons, one-to-one computing is a major part of education policy in many countries. These benefits also underlie the one-to-one model of [[One Laptop per Child]] (OLPC), a charity that aims to issue electronic devices to millions of children in the developing world. With the growth of the internet-connectivity the possibility to use cloud-computing to transfer the data and administration from the devices to cloud-computing has removed the necessity of much of the tech support from the teacher.

The ultimate academic benefits of one-to-one, if any, are unclear. They may not be the same for the different eras of 1:1.

'''In the Laptop Era''' the laptops were often used as add-ons to the established teaching. Their limited use reinforced the doubts about their educational value and whether the high maintenance costs were worth the investment. According to research published by Boston College, the educational value of 1:1 in the laptop era depended on the classroom teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.districtadministration.com/article/one-one-computing-has-failed-our-expectations|title=One-to-one computing has failed our expectations|last=Norris|first=Cathleen|date=May 2010|newspaper=District Administration|accessdate=19 March 2014|author2=Elliot Soloway|quote=Boston College researchers found that the impact of a one-to-one computing implementation is largely a function of the classroom teacher... if extracting value from an innovation is dependent on the teacher, then the value added by the innovation per se is limited.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools have even phased out their one-to-one programs because there was no evidence of academic gains according to the 2007 article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/education/04laptop.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Seeing no progress, some schools drop laptops|last=Hu|first=Winnie|date=4 May 2007|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Though: Please note that the district noted in the article went for a 1:1 Chromebook initiative in April 2017  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpool.k12.ny.us/departments/technology/chromebook-11/|title=Chromebook 1:1 » Liverpool Central School District|website=www.liverpool.k12.ny.us|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; )

Other studies have shown some progress in specific subjects, especially in writing scores, that are correlated with the use of school-issued laptops. The wide range of results for 1:1 programs means there is no consensus on their benefits or drawbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://schooltechleadership.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CASTLEBrief01_LaptopPrograms.pdf|title=What does the research say about school one-to-one computing initiatives?|last=Sauers|first=Nicholas J.|date=1 May 2012|newspaper=Castle Brief|accessdate=19 March 2014|agency=UCEA Center for the Advanced Study of Technology Leadership in Education, University of Kentucky|author2=Scott McLeod|quote="When examining the research related to one-to-one computing programs, it is clear that they have produced a wide range of results."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The iPad Era''' saw increased uptake of iPads (and comparable tablets) in schools and consequently increased 1:1 programs in schools. More and more education specific applications and tools became available as increasing research about educational value and implementation methodologies of 1:1 programs were published.

The popularity was based on their touchscreens, good battery life and the availability of applications as well as their general brand-related image and comparative ease of use compared to Laptops/Desktops. 

'''The Chromebook era''' had several major success-factors (several of which were often also used in iPad 1:1 schools). 
# Very portable: small laptops, lightweight.
# auto-updating devices. Reducing the need for device management and the need to wait while updating.
# Quick start-up/ almost instantaneous wake-up from sleep.
# Battery life (lasted a good school-day)
# Truly device independent. Backed-up files &amp; configuration available anytime, anyplace, anywhere. This allowed distribution of educational content. It also allowed keeping stock of spare-chromebooks available. If a student logged in with his/her account it worked flawlessly. iPads and PCs kept much configuration information on devices making quick swaps hard or impossible.
# Availability of general productivity software that was cloud-based. This allowed note-taking, going paperless. 
# Low cost (compared to iPads and Laptops) both for purchase, and running costs/maintenance (i.e. Cost of Ownership). 
# Increased attention to professional development and to embedding 1:1 use in the teaching of different subjects. 
# Increased involvement of stakeholders like parents and school-boards because of the costs of WiFi, the increased tendency to use the devices at home and the increased awareness of processes for repairs, insurances, temporary replacement etc. 
# Increased use in assessment and tests. 
# Increased collaboration, self-directed learning, inquiry based learning 
 
Because 1:1 computing programs may have many goals, from improving educational outcomes to increasing equality, and are associated with such a wide range of teaching methods, it is also difficult to judge their overall success or value. One notable benefit that has been documented and researched is the potential for 1:1 computing initiatives to support the use of [[Open educational resources|open educational resources (OER)]], available in digital form, for ubiquitous access by learners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paskevicius|first=M.|last2=Knaack|first2=L.|date=2018|title=Tablets and Trees: Equipping Forestry Students with Mobile Tools for Learning in and Out of Classroom {{!}} Des tablettes et des arbres: équiper les étudiants en foresterie d'outils mobiles pour apprendre en et hors de la salle de classe|url=https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/cjlt/index.php/cjlt/article/view/27562|journal=Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology / La revue canadienne de l’apprentissage et de la technologie|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.21432/cjlt27562|issn=1499-6685|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== What are the Disadvantages ==
Disadvantages of 1:1 are controversial, but there are general objections at increasing "screen-time" when the private lives of children also see significant screen-time. There may be psychological and / or physical disadvantages as there are with any technology, including the ones replaced (paper, paint, carrying more books).

Addiction may be a problem (possibly more with touch-devices). There can also be objection against possible effect of exposure to radiation from the screens and WiFi. As stated under advantages there is no general consensus on the scientific evidence on efficacy. In a field as new as 1:1 with the technology used having undergone major changes it may take time for clear patterns to emerge and be agreed on.

The cost itself may be a disadvantage. Schools and districts in areas with low incomes and high rates of homelessness have argued that  Chromebook programs compare positively to paper for homework return-rates.

== What are the Costs ==

One-to-one requires substantial institutional investment. In addition to the cost of purchasing devices, the Cost-of-Ownership is not insignificant and can include connectivity/WiFi, charging-facilities/caddys, implementation, training, software licensing, monitoring, security, upgrades and maintenance. Therefore, the overall cost–benefit ratio of a one-to-one model is not clear.
Aside from the technical costs the changing of the teaching itself is labour-intensive and may require professional development, licensing, re-writing materials, re-designing lesson plans. 
 
Several methodologies exist to make sure all stakeholders are involved and the adoption/implementation is done responsibly. 
One example can be found at The Natpicks Schools 1:1 Program which has the "Red" Logo indicating it is a Project Red Signature District &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.natickps.org/programs/student1to1_program | title=Student 1:1 Program - Natick Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating they followed the Red methodology, as well as an Apple Distinguished District logo (competitors like Google and Microsoft have their own recognition programs). If one looks at the documents they increased their numbers of Chromebooks and have mature planning processes including cooperation with Boston College research.

As the cost of internet services and data charges fall WIFI speeds and accessibility has increased to the point that it is no longer a limiting factor for users of Chromebooks and other devices used for education.

== What are the most recent developments ==

The USA based Chromebook programs may have shown changes in the economics of 1:1 programs. Although 1:1 programs require better WiFi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2017/access-point-unit-sales-are-on-the-rise-in-the-us-b2b-indirect-channel--driven-by-ever-increasing-network-demands-according-to-npd/ | title=Access Point Unit Sales on the Rise &amp;#124; News}}&lt;/ref&gt; than previous programs, they use ChromeOS which automatically updates and patches in the background (lowering the maintenance costs). The purchasing prices of Chromebooks were substantially lower than competing devices. According to IDC research the maintenance costs were significantly lower.&lt;ref&gt;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/intl/en/chrome/assets/education/pdf/IDC-WP-Quantifying.the.Economic.Value.of.Chromebooks.for.K-12.Education-082012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the batteries of Chromebooks easily last a full day, schools experimented with having students charge them at home and only keeping a replacement stock ready in school (for defective, forgotten and out-of-charge Chromebooks) reducing the need for charging equipment/trolleys. GAM (Google Accounts Management) did charge for licensing, but it could remove the necessity of other MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions and other security solutions at lower than Web-authentication level. Some schools also experimented with parents owning the devices (and paying for them). Having less costly equipment on site may also have saved in insurance and rooms may have become available for other purposes. 1:1  also enabled going paperless (i.e. publishers supplied cheaper digital versions of teaching materials) and reducing the cost on paper/printers used. No serious study is known of this, at this point. But individual schools have published costs and savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maine207.org/cms/One.aspx?portalId=743425&amp;pageId=7218926|title=Chromebook costs - Maine Township High School District 207|website=maine207.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Google-Classroom software and G suite in general was instrumental in going paperless. It allowed electronic hand-in, grading and returning of projects to groups of students. Microsoft is trying to copy the classroom functionality in their O365 for education.

== 2007 Uruguay's Project Ceibal ==

Between 2007 and 2016 Project Ceibal was the most successful 1:1 program in the world. It included the right to internet connectivity in school as well as at home besides the right to have a computer "Since its implementation, every child who enters the public education system in any part of the country is given a computer for personal use with free Internet connection at school. In addition, Plan Ceibal provides programs, educational resources and teacher training courses that transform the ways of teaching and learning.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceibal.edu.uy/en/institucional|title=Sobre Nosotros|website=www.ceibal.edu.uy|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 decree specified in it desired outcomes "1.2.3. EXPECTED RESULTS: Have covered 100% of children of school age within a period of 3 years with an Internet connection in their Schools as in their homes." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latu.org.uy/doc/ceibal/Pliego_faseICEIBAL.pdf|title=Wayback Machine version of "Pliegos de la licitación" 2007|last=|first=|date=2007-09-29|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929005438/http://www.latu.org.uy/doc/ceibal/Pliego_faseICEIBAL.pdf|archive-date=29 September 2007|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=2017-12-19|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009 all 300.000 students were equipped with hardware and all schools had WiFi. By 2013 use of Google-drive and apps were added to CREA and By 2015 95% of urban schools had fibre-optic connections. By 2016 Chromebooks were added to the available hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceibal.edu.uy/en/dispositivos/|title=Dispositivos|website=www.ceibal.edu.uy|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the original hardware was Fedora based Uruguay has held the top-spot of Linux uptake for years, according to statcounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/uruguay/#yearly-2009-2017|title=Desktop Operating System Market Share Uruguay {{!}} StatCounter Global Stats|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2016-2017 Mass Uptake in Schools in the United States ==

1:1 Programs in US schools have gained serious momentum somewhere around 2016/2017. In February 2017 edtechmagazine reported more than 50% of teachers reported using 1:1 computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2017/02/more-50-percent-teachers-report-11-computing|title=More Than 50 Percent of Teachers Report 1:1 Computing|last=Staff|first=Edtech|date=2017-02-01|work=EdTech|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017 Futuresource reported Chromebooks had 58% market-share in US-Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futuresource-consulting.com/Press-K-12-Education-Market-Qtr4-0317.html|title=Sales of Mobile PCs into the US K-12 Education Market Continue to Grow - Press Article|website=www.futuresource-consulting.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of Chromebooks in education was reported on by ''The New York Times'' in May 2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/technology/google-education-chromebooks-schools.html|title=How Google Took Over the Classroom|last=Singer|first=Natasha|date=2017-05-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Which explains the success "This became Google’s education marketing playbook: Woo school officials with easy-to-use, money-saving services. Then enlist schools to market to other schools, holding up early adopters as forward thinkers among their peers."

In June 2017 CMS-district was reported to be on a 150.000 Chromebooks 1:1 program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2017/06/chromebooks-and-g-suite-partnership-worth-exploring|title=Chromebooks and G Suite: A Partnership Worth Exploring|date=2017-06-07|work=EdTech|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It looks like 1:1 Chromebook programs have come become very popular on the basis of adoption and evangelizing by enthusiastic users in schools. The suburbs of Chicago are most often mentioned as influencers. Leyden in District 212 has on its main page &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.leyden212.org|title=Leyden High School District 212 / Homepage|website=www.leyden212.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Nick Polyak  saying "Over 2,000 educators from across the country have visited Leyden to learn about teaching and learning in the digital age." which clearly refers to its 1:1 program. The history of Leyden's 1:1 program is clearly told in the 2014 article "How many administrators does it take to get a district to go one to one".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2014-08-20-how-many-administrators-does-it-take-to-get-a-district-to-go-one-to-one|title=How Many Administrators Does It Take to Get a District to Go One-to-One? - EdSurge News|date=2014-08-20|work=EdSurge|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; So there is evidence that successful schools indeed show others the way.

The original legitimization for 1:1 education may have been derived from research by the Red group (mainly financed by Intel) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.one-to-oneinstitute.org/research-overview|title=Research Overview|website=www.one-to-oneinstitute.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose findings describe the potential of transforming education "Our findings demonstrate that schools employing a 1:1 student-computer ratio and key implementation factors outperform other schools, and reveal significant opportunities for improving education return on investment (ROI) by transforming teaching and learning.". The influence of the change in teaching is also stressed academically like in "Chromebooks and the G Suite group of products, like Google Search, Gmail, and Google Docs, have rapidly expanded in American schools during the past 5 years. The impact of one-to-one Chromebook devices and the pervasive use of Google's software products in American education cannot be overstated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/10572317.2017.1383756|title = Device-Driven Research: The Impact of Chromebooks in American Schools| journal=International Information &amp; Library Review| volume=49| issue=4| pages=285–289|year = 2017|last1 = Ahlfeld|first1 = Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahlfeld|first=Kelly|date=Dec 2017|title=Device-Driven Research: The Impact of Chromebooks in American Schools|journal=International Information &amp; Library Review|volume=49 2017|issue=4|pages=Pages 285–289|doi=10.1080/10572317.2017.1383756}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apple is also promoting its own 1:1 iPad programs and there are some signs of uptake of its "classroom" software and iPads for example in San Bernardino.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbsun.com/2017/11/07/why-san-bernardinos-aquinas-high-was-named-an-apple-distinguished-school/|title=Why San Bernardino’s Aquinas High was named an Apple Distinguished School|date=2017-11-07|work=San Bernardino Sun|access-date=2017-12-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other countries where 1:1 programs are successful are Sweden, New Zealand (both mentioned in the NYTimes article mentioned above&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;).

During 1929–30, while still a student, he participated in the making of a handful of documentaries and wrote movie scripts. In 1931, he produced the experimental film ''Světlo proniká tmou''. The [[Directorial debut|first movie he directed]] was 1937's ''[[Filosofská historie]]'', film based on a novel by [[Alois Jirásek]].

His first feature film was 1938's ''Cech panen Kutnohorských'' (engl.: ''The Merry Wives''), starring [[Zdeněk Štěpánek]], [[Adina Mandlová]] and [[Zorka Janů]]. The film was praised by American critics for "first-rate direction, a salty yarn and elaborate production effort", even though it had undergone certain cuts because it was considered too "ribald" by [[Film censorship in the United States|American censors]].&lt;ref name="Variety 1940"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Merry Wives (film review)|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety140-1940-11#page/n75/mode/1up|accessdate=9 May 2018|work=Variety|date=13 November 1940|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janů also played in Vávra's films ''Podvod s Rubensem'' and ''Pacientka Dr. Hegela'', both from 1940. Sister of Janů, Czech actress [[Lída Baarová]] starred in Vávra's films ''Panenství'' (1937), ''Maskovaná milenka'' (1939), ''Dívka v modrém'' (1939), and ''Turbína'' (1941).

After the Communists [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|seized power in 1948]], Vávra adapted quickly to the new political climate and produced films praising the current regime and supporting the new, official interpretation of the past.

In the 1950s he produced the "[[Hussite Revolutionary Trilogy|Hussite Trilogy]]", one of his most famous works, consisting of ''[[Jan Hus (film)|Jan Hus]]'' (1954), ''[[Jan Žižka (1955 film)|Jan Žižka]]'' (1955) and ''[[Against All|Proti všem]]'' (''Against All Odds'', 1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/news/society/iconic-czech-film-director-otakar-vavra-dies-aged-100 |title=Iconic Czech film director Otakar Vávra dies aged 100 |author=Brian Kenety |date=16 September 2011 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 September 2011 |language=Czech |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322030331/http://www.ceskapozice.cz/en/news/society/iconic-czech-film-director-otakar-vavra-dies-aged-100 |archivedate=22 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the government became more liberal in the 1960s, Vávra's cinema entered into his most prolific period, producing ''Zlatá reneta'' (1965), ''[[Romance for Bugle (film)|Romance pro křídlovku]]'' (1966), ''Kladivo na čarodějnice'' (1969), and later ''Komediant'' (1984). His 1967 film ''[[Romance for Bugle (film)|Romance for Bugle]]'' was entered into the [[5th Moscow International Film Festival]] where it won the Special Silver Prize.&lt;ref name="Moscow1967"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1967 |title=5th Moscow International Film Festival (1967) |accessdate=2012-12-16 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194759/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1967 |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970's Vávra produced his "War Trilogy" consisting of semi-documentary movies ''Dny zrady'', ''[[Sokolovo (film)|Sokolovo]]'' and ''Osvobození Prahy'', all being heavily influenced by communist propaganda. The film ''Dny zrady'' (''[[Days of Betrayal]]'', 1973) was entered into the [[8th Moscow International Film Festival]] where it won a Diploma.&lt;ref name="Moscow1973"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1973 |title=8th Moscow International Film Festival (1973) |accessdate=2013-01-03 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116194922/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1973 |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he was a member of the jury at the [[11th Moscow International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Moscow1979"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1979 |title=11th Moscow International Film Festival (1979) |accessdate=2013-01-14 |work=MIFF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403102012/http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1979 |archivedate=2014-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Communists fell from power in 1989, state subsidies for the film industry were dropped and Vávra's plans for an historical epic titled ''Evropa tančila valčík'' had to be scaled down.

In the 1950s, Otakar Vávra, together with a group of fellow Czech film directors, established the Film Faculty of the [[Academy of Performing Arts in Prague]] (Filmová Akademia muzických umění or FAMU), where he taught for over five decades. Among his students were several directors of the 1960s "[[Czechoslovak New Wave|Czech New Wave]]" of art films, including future Oscar-winner [[Miloš Forman]] (''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'').

==Criticism==
Otakar Vávra's decades-long career as a film director, from the 1930s through the 1990s, epitomized the tradition of middle-European filmmaking. This tradition ended in Germany and Austria at the end of World War II and ended in the Czech Republic after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Around that time, Vávra began his autobiography ''Podivný život režiséra'' (''Strange Life of a Movie Director''), which concluded with "...and now I wait for the end. My end."

Otakar Vávra is often called the "father of Czech cinema". In 2001, he was awarded the ''Czech Lion'' (''Český lev'') for his lifelong contribution to Czech culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfn.cz/ceskylev.php?rocnik=2001 |title=Filmové recenze, novinky v kinech, české filmy - Kinobox.cz |publisher=Cfn.cz |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004071935/http://www.cfn.cz/ceskylev.php?rocnik=2001 |archivedate=2008-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he received the presidential ''Medal of Merit'' (''Medaile za zásluhy'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrad.cz/cms/en/statni_vyznamenani/med_zasluhy_seznam.shtml |title=Medal of Merit |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207155940/http://hrad.cz/cms/en/statni_vyznamenani/med_zasluhy_seznam.shtml |archivedate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vávra's critics point to his willingness to accommodate the Communist regime.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14947676 |title=Otakar Vavra dies aged 100 |accessdate=2011-09-18|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2003 article ("Playing the Villain", ''The Globe and Mail'', May 15, 2003) about his documentary film, ''Hitler and I'' that he shot in Prague, David Cherniack described the following encounter with his former FAMU Head Professor:

{{quote|Having lived in a police state for four years and seen the difficult choices that people make between ends and means, I decide to interview my head professor from the academy, National Artist Otakar Vavra. Now 92 but still very sharp, Vavra made 50 feature films under every regime from the thirties on, including the seven years of the Nazi occupation. Though he maintains he was serving his films and the public by doing the minimum necessary to co-operate, others are of the view that he was serving himself. The films of his that I've seen tend to be rather didactic history lessons.

I meet him at the Theatre Restaurant where he lunches every day and still conducts business. Behind the bluster and razor-sharp intellect that is still very much present, I sense a sad and isolated old man who feels he should be enjoying the adulation of his country and not being as ignored as he is. My own [[Fritz Gerlich]] (a Catholic newspaper editor executed in [[Dachau]] during the [[Night of the Long Knives]]) was our teaching assistant, the [[Czech New Wave|New Wave]] director [[Evald Schorm]]. Unlike Vavra, he refused to sign a paper agreeing with the 1968 occupation by the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Schorm went to his own Dachau. He was forced to leave the school and filmmaking and go direct operas in Brno. One of the Czech actors on the set tells me he died an embittered man shortly before the [[Velvet Revolution]]. Reality is always more complex than the stories we tell about it.}}

Vávra's ''[[Krakatit]]'' (1948) is based on [[Karel Čapek]]'s 1924 [[Krakatit|novel of the same name]] and contains a strong anti-war message. It centers around an inventor of explosives who tries to keep his invention hidden from those who want to use it to rule the world. The black-and-white original was followed by a 1980 color remake, ''Temné slunce'', which brings the storyline into the modern era. The later version is generally seen as one of Vávra's lesser efforts.

Otakar Vávra's most acclaimed work is widely considered to be ''Romance pro křídlovku'' (1966). This black-and-white film is based on a poem by Czech lyrical poet [[František Hrubín]] and concerns an ill-fated summer romance between two young lovers of different backgrounds.

'''Outward Bound''' ('''OB''') is an international network of [[outdoor education]] schools that was founded in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Kurt Hahn]] and [[Lawrence Holt]] in 1941. Today there are schools in 33 countries which are attended by more than 250,000 people each year. '''Outward Bound International''' is a [[non-profit]] membership and licensing organisation for the international network of Outward Bound schools.&lt;ref name="obi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Outward Bound International|url=https://www.outwardbound.net|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''The Outward Bound Trust''' is an educational [[Charitable organization|charity]] established in 1946 to operate the schools in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outwardbound.org.uk/about-us/history-of-the-trust/|title=Our History|last=|first=|date=|work=The Outward Bound Trust|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210140707/http://www.outwardbound.net:80/about/history/expansion.html|title=INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate organizations operate the schools in each of the other countries in which Outward Bound operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outwardbound.net/schools/|title=OB Schools|last=|first=|date=|work=Outward Bound International|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outward Bound helped to shape the U.S. [[Peace Corps]] and numerous other outdoor adventure programs.&lt;ref name="priest&amp;gass" /&gt; Its aim is to foster the [[personal growth]] and [[social skills]] of participants by using challenging expeditions in the outdoors.

==History==

The first Outward Bound school was opened in [[Aberdyfi|Aberdovey]], [[Wales]] in 1941 by [[Kurt Hahn]] and [[Lawrence Holt]] with the support of the [[Blue Funnel Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outwardbound.net/history/|title=History|work=Outward Bound International|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birth of Outward Bound"&gt;Outward Bound International (2004). ''[http://www.outwardbound.net/about/history/ob-birth.html Birth of Outward Bound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110062628/http://www.outwardbound.net/about/history/ob-birth.html |date=2007-11-10 }}''. Retrieved December 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Outward Bound grew out of Hahn's work in the development of the [[Gordonstoun]] school and what is now known as the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Award]]. Outward Bound's founding mission was to improve the survival chances of young [[seaman|seamen]] after their ships were torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic.&lt;ref name="priest&amp;gass"&gt;{{cite book|title=Effective Leadership in Adventure Programming|edition=3|date=2017|last1=Priest|first1=Simon|last2=Gass|first2=Michael|publisher=Human Kinetics|pages=74-6|isbn=9781492547860 |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=ZuM2DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix1amP6sLbAhWBfbwKHQbZDtEQ6AEIRDAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Hogan (outdoor educator)|James Martin Hogan]] served as warden for the first year of the school.&lt;ref name="Aberdovey"&gt;''[http://www.outward-bound.org/docs/info/Aberdovey.htm Outward Bound Wales, Aberdovey]''.  Retrieved August 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This mission was established and then expanded by Capt. J. F. 'Freddy' Fuller who took over the leadership of the Aberdovey school in 1942 and served the Outward Bound movement as senior warden until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;James, David, (1957) "Outward Bound" Routledge and Kegan Paul, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller had been seconded from the Blue Funnel Line following wartime experience during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] of surviving two successive [[U-boat|torpedo attacks]] and commanding an open lifeboat in the Atlantic Ocean for thirty-five days without losing a single member of the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outward Bound USA: Crew Not Passengers|authors= Miner, Joshua L., Boldt, Joe|year=2002|publisher=Mountaineers Books|isbn=978-0-89886-874-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

An educational [[Charitable organization|charity]], named The Outward Bound Trust, was established in 1946 to operate the school.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A second school followed in England at [[Eskdale Green]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="priest&amp;gass" /&gt; The first Outward Bound program for females was conducted in 1951. During the next decade, several other schools opened around the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="priest&amp;gass" /&gt; [[Outward Bound Australia]] was founded in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outwardbound.org.au/about-outdoor-education/history/|title=History {{!}} Outward Bound Australia|work=Outward Bound Australia|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A school in [[Lumut, Malaysia]] was opened in 1958.&lt;ref name="priest&amp;gass" /&gt; The first [[Outward Bound USA]] course was run in 1961 for the [[Peace Corps]], which it helped to shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://issuu.com/outwardbound.org/docs/ob_viewbook|title=Outward Bound 2015 Program Guide|website=Issuu|access-date=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Outward Bound New Zealand]] was founded in 1962 and [[Outward Bound Singapore]] was established in 1967.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

From the inception of Outward Bound, community service was an integral part of the program, especially in the areas of sea and mountain rescues and this remains an important part of the training for both staff and students.&lt;ref name="Aberdovey" /&gt; During the period 1941 to 1965 in the United Kingdom, the philosophy of the schools evolved from ‘character‐training’ to ‘personal growth’ and ‘self‐discovery’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Mark|date=2010-12-13|title=From ‘character‐training’ to ‘personal growth’: the early history of Outward Bound 1941–1965|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0046760X.2010.507223?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=thed20|journal=History of Education|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–43|doi=10.1080/0046760x.2010.507223|issn=0046-760X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outward Bound International was founded in 2004 to license the use of the brand name 'Outward Bound' and to provide support for the international network of schools.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Name==
[[Image:ICS Papa.svg|thumb|The [[International maritime signal flags|Blue Peter]] nautical flag indicates that a vessel is "outward bound". Outward Bound schools use and raise this flag to symbolise the journey starting for OB students at the start of a programme.]]
The name Outward Bound derives from a nautical expression that refers to the moment a [[ship]] leaves the harbor. This is signified by Outward Bound's use of the nautical flag, the [[International maritime signal flags|Blue Peter]] (a white square inside a blue square). JF Fuller adapted the Outward Bound motto, "To Serve, To Strive and not To Yield," from the poem "[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]" by [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;... Come, my friends.
Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are --
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Current==
Since its founding in the middle of the last century, Outward Bound has encouraged individuals to test their physical and emotional limits in challenging outdoor adventure programs.  The experiences are a means of building inner strength and a heightened awareness of human interdependence.&lt;ref&gt;Outward Bound USA: Crew not Passengers, Josh Miner and Joe Boldt (Seattle: The Mountaineer Books, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Outward Bound operates more than 30 schools in various countries and reports serving over 250,000 students each year.&lt;ref name="obi" /&gt; The Compass Rose serves as the logo for almost all the schools around the world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.outwardbound.net/licensing/|title=Licensing|work=Outward Bound International|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course specifics==
[[Image:OutwardBoundTrip.jpg|250px|right|thumb|An Outward Bound excursion at [[Lake Superior Provincial Park]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]
Outward Bound courses follow a kind of recipe or formula, termed the ''Outward Bound Process Model'' which is well described by Walsh and Golins (1976) as:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Walsh, V., &amp; Golins, G. L. (1976). ''[http://wilderdom.com/theory/OutwardBoundProcessModel.html The exploration of the Outward Bound process]''. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Taking a ready, motivated learner
# into a prescribed, unfamiliar physical environment,
# along with a small group of people
# who are faced with a series of incremental, inter-related problem-solving tasks
# which creates in the individual a state of dissonance requiring adaptive coping and
# leads to a sense of mastery or competence when equilibrium is managed.
# The cumulative effect of these experiences leads to a reorganisation of the self-conceptions and information the learner holds about him/herself.
# The learner will then continue to be positively oriented to further learning and development experiences (transfer).

In a typical class, participants are divided into small patrols (or groups) under the guidance of one or more instructors. The first few days, often at a base camp, are spent training for the [[outdoor education]] activities that the course will contain and in the philosophy of Outward Bound. After initial confidence-building challenges, the group heads off on an expedition. As the group develops the capacity to do so, the instructors ask the group to make its own decisions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Rethinking Mathematics: Teaching Social Justice by the Numbers''''' is a 2005 book (2nd edition 2013) edited by Eric Gutstein and Bob Peterson, advocating a [[mathematics education]] curriculum that intertwines [[mathematics]] with [[social justice]]. The various essays in the book, including "Home Buying While Brown or Black" and "Sweatshop Accounting", advocate using social-justice issues to motivate the teaching of rigorous mathematical concepts, and the use of mathematics education as a way of promoting ideas of social justice.

Critics derided the work as an attempt to subvert mathematics education for partisan political purposes, while the authors defended it as a useful way to motivate  a wide range of students in mathematics.

The Maryland class is video conferenced to a school in [[Ayrshire]], Scotland, with some of their children visible on the screens.

A '''school breakfast club''' is a provision for children to eat a healthy breakfast in a safe environment before their first class.  The term "breakfast club"  is commonly used to describe such facilities in the [[United Kingdom]].

Breakfast clubs generally enhance both academic performance and behavior, especially for children whose parents might not otherwise be able to afford to provide them with regular meals.  Breakfast provision is however less prevalent compared with school lunch, both in the UK and worldwide. As of 2013, only about half the school children in the UK have access to a breakfast club.

Attendance of a breakfast club is not mandatory; many parents prefer to feed their children at home.  The clubs are often run by schools, but can also be community run.  Schools themselves are the most common location for breakfast clubs, but they can also be found in churches, community halls or even commercial premises. Breakfast clubs are sometimes open to children from more than one school.

==History==
The earliest known modern advocate for school dinners was [[Count Rumford]] in the late 18th century. School dinners became more widely available in the 19th and 20th century, though generally only lunch was provided. This began to change after the introduction of the [[Oslo breakfast]] in 1932, an uncooked meal of nutritional ingredients. Between the wars the ''Oslo breakfast'' became famous worldwide; claims were widely reported that it helped children fed on it grow several inches taller than they would otherwise. Similar initiatives were launched in several countries across the world. In the United States, a major step forward in the provision of breakfast for schoolchildren was the 1966 launch of the  [[School Breakfast Program]].&lt;ref name = "Institutions"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, breakfast clubs were introduced in the 1990s, driven not just by concern for children's nutrition but by parental demand for a supervised place to leave their children in the early morning.  Changes in gender roles and more demanding workplaces meant an increasing number of women were no longer able to look after their children until the start of school.  By 1999 there were over 700 breakfast clubs operating in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;   After the [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|lasting global inflation in the price of food]] that began in late 2006, there were increased efforts to set up new breakfast clubs, in part due to greater awareness of children who arrived at school suffering from [[hunger]], a condition that reduced their ability to concentrate and sometimes led to disruptive behavior.  A 2011 report by [[Kellogg's]] found that the number of breakfast clubs had increased to over 20,000, though also that several thousand had or were at risk of closure due to lack of funds.&lt;ref name = "frontline"&gt;

The Conservative's 2017 election manifesto had included a promise to provide free school breakfasts to all primary school children, though by 2018 this had been abandoned. Yet a commitment remains for the government to provide £26 million extra funding for new and existing breakfast clubs. &lt;ref&gt;

==Structure==
There is no standard model for a breakfast club.  Some are run by and physically located in schools.  Others are run by community groups, businesses or churches, or by a combination of such actors working in partnership. Some clubs make a small charge for breakfast, providing them free only to those who qualify for free school meals. Other clubs provide free breakfasts for all children, to avoid those from poor families suffering from [[stigmatization]]. Guidance, funding and general support for running breakfast clubs in the UK is available from a number of sources, including from County Councils,&lt;ref name ="council"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Breakfast clubs typically  stay open for between 45 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes, and close before the children's first morning lesson.&lt;ref name ="council"/&gt; Sometimes the clubs are staffed by volunteers, though sometimes there are paid caterers, and clubs in schools can be supervised by teachers or support staff.&lt;ref name = "Institutions"/&gt;

==Benefits==
Breakfast clubs can be especially valuable for children whose parents are not able to afford to provide them with regular morning meals.  They can provide both short- and long-term health benefits. Children who receive breakfast often perform better at learning, and can also be better behaved. Breakfast clubs can also improve the child's long-term health by providing a well balanced nutritious meal.  Secondary benefits of breakfast clubs include improving attendance, helping to prevent disadvantaged children from experiencing social isolation, and helping with children who would otherwise not have adult supervision in the first hour or so before school. A significant majority of teachers hold the view that school breakfast clubs are beneficial in achieving educational goals.. For example,  in a 2013 survey of 552 teachers,  387  (71%) said they believed breakfast clubs have a positive effect on pupil's concentration,  but four teachers (0.7%) said it had a negative impact. Questioned about the impact on behavior,  325 (60.2%) were positive, while 11 (2%) said breakfast clubs have a negative effect.&lt;ref name = "Institutions"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "frontline"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "rescue"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ATLMarch2013"/&gt; 

Various studies in both the U.S and Europe, some dating back to the 20th century, found that breakfast provision at schools boost pupil's educational attainment. Older studies have been criticised for their methodology however.&lt;ref name ="MBfullReport"/&gt;  Some studies also found evidence of negative behaviour effects, and even that in certain circumstances a majority of children were unhappy with breakfast clubs: when either there was insufficient care given to ensure the clubs were stimulating enough to avoid boredom,  or when access had been restricted just to poorer children, which could leave participants feeling picked on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 report, funded by the [[Education Endowment Foundation]] and the [[Department for Education]], based on research by the [[National Children's Bureau]] and the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], found that free school breakfast clubs can boost children's educational attainment by as much as two months. The study found the benefits arose not just from the eating of a nutritious breakfast, but from also from attending the club itself.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''South Asian Institute of Management''' (SAIM) is an independent management institute based in [[Nepal]]. The Institute was opened by a group of professionals who wanted to create an institute of learning, [[research]], and consultancy in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saim.edu.np/about_us/who_we_are.php South Asian Institute of Management website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202200402/http://saim.edu.np/about_us/who_we_are.php |date=2010-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a [[for profit|profit-making]] venture, the Institute's board decided from the beginning to retain a majority proportion of profits toward institution building and the promotion of [[entrepreneurship]], including backing any promising [[business venture]]s from its own graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=7608 myrebulica web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''specialist degree''' is an [[academic degree]] conferred by a [[college]] or [[university]]. The degree is formatted differently worldwide and may be either a five year program or a doctoral level graduate program that occurs after a master's degree but before a doctoral degree.

== The Specialist degree in the Commonwealth of Independent States ==

The Specialist diploma ({{Lang-ru|специалист}}) is a five-year higher-education diploma that was the only first higher-education diploma in the former [[Soviet Union]] (the Candidate of Sciences was the first graduate degree while the Doctor of Sciences was the highest academic credential) and continues to be offered throughout the USSR successor states in parallel with the new bachelor’s degree.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.alberta.ca/documents/IQAS/russia-international-education-guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the number of instructional hours it is typically, 35 to 42 classroom hours per week, 34 weeks of instruction plus 6 weeks of exams per academic year. Commonly referred to simply as "Diplom", the Soviet/Russian-style Specialist diploma is believed to have originated in the [[engineering education]] in the [[Russian Empire]].

In the early 1990s the ''bakalavr'' and ''magistr'' were introduced in all countries of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] except [[Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan and Tajikistan]]. However, the specialist diploma (five years) is still conferred in [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]] and [[Tajikistan]]. The specialist diploma was discontinued in [[Ukraine]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://life.pravda.com.ua/technology/2016/07/11/215073 Ministry of Education cancels the "experts" and "Ph.D."], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (11 July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=  http://www.onlinepsychologydegrees.com/specialty/industrial-organizational-psychology/| title= www.onlinepsychologydegrees.com/specialty/industrial-organizational-psychology/ }} Wednesday, 24 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Commonwealth of Independent States' education law, the specialist [[diploma]] requires a minimum of five years of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai/%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8B/885 |title=О высшем и послевузовском профессиональном образовании |accessdate=2017-09-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510144156/http://xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai/%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8B/885 |archivedate=May 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are some examples of specialist "degrees" in the CIS:
*''specialist-ekonomist'' - first degree in [[economy]] or [[management]] (including [[engineering management]])
*''specialist-inzhener'' - the [[engineer's degree]] in the CIS
*''specialist-uchitel '' - the first degree for [[teacher]]s
*''specialist-vrach'' - this degree type includes the respective degrees of [[physician]]s, [[dentist]]s and [[veterinarian]]s in the CIS.

==Specialist degree in the United States==
In the United States, the Specialist's degree is hierarchically above the Master's degree and below the Doctorate. It was invented by colleges and schools of education as an alternative to obtaining a doctorate, and focused on subjects pertinent to K-12 education - such as leadership and counseling, and educational psychology.

Degrees commonly available include:
* Ed.S or Sp.Ed. – [[Educational Specialist|Specialist of Education]]
* Psy.S. – [[Specialist in Psychology]]
* S.S.P. – Specialist in School Psychology
* Sp.A. – Specialist in Arts (offered by [[Eastern Michigan University]])
* S.C.C.T. – Specialist in Community College Teaching (offered by [[Arkansas State University]])
* S.L.I.S. – Specialist in Library and Information Science (offered by the School of Informatics and Computing at [[Indiana University Bloomington]]).

The American Specialist degree typically requires 30 semester hours or 45 quarter hours beyond the Master's degree (60 semester hours or 90 quarter hours beyond the Baccalaureate) and can be completed in one to three academic years of continuous full-time or part-time enrolment. Depending on the particular program, [[practicum|practica]] and / or [[internship]] and / or practical field work may be required. Students admitted directly from the baccalaureate may earn a [[Master's degree]] in progression toward the Specialist's degree; or the institution may accept applications only from students who already hold a Master's degree.

The coursework for an Ed.S. or Sp.A. in Education program is approximately the same workload as a second Master's in terms of credits. But whereas coursework for the initial Master's degree is from the introductory and lower intermediate levels of graduate study (e.g. Levels 500 and 600 at institutions that use 100 - 900 level course numbering systems), work for the Specialist's degree will be in the intermediate and upper levels (e.g. 600, 700 and 800 level courses). According to the U.S. Department of Education's International Affairs Office's leaflet, entitled, "Structure of the U.S. Education System: Intermediate Graduate Qualifications," (Feb 2008), the Ed.S., as a degree, is equivalent to the D.Min. or Psy.D. / D.Psy. This reflects the degree's origin as an alternate to professional doctorates.

Ed.S. programs lead to [[professional degree]]s in the application of advanced educational theory but do not typically place an emphasis on conducting original research such as in [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D. / D.Ed.]] or [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] programs.

''[[School Psychology]]'' and ''[[Curriculum and instruction|Curriculum and Instruction]]'' are two of the most common areas where a specialist degree is found. In the field of [[school psychology]], the degree is typically an Ed.S. or SSP. Despite being virtually identical in scope and function, the Ed.S. and SSP both exist within the field of school psychology because training programs can be offered within the departments of psychology or education. They simply designate the type of program from which the degree originated. As another alternative, some programs within psychology departments have begun offering a Psy.S. degree instead of an SSP.

In many fields outside of education, the ''[[postgraduate certificate]]'' fills the same need as a Specialist degree - but differs in being an academic ''certificate'' rather than an academic ''degree''. Postgraduate or graduate certificates typically require one-third to one-half the coursework of a Master's degree and an offered in a specific topical area, such as a Certificate in Historic Preservation.

Certain graduate programs are ''de facto'' specialist degrees. In the field of Engineering, the [[Engineer's degree#United States|Engineer's degree]] is a post-Master's degree, offered at a modest number of US universities (but including some prestigious ones such as [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]), which is relatively analogous to the Specialist degree. In French higher education, the ''[[Mastère Spécialisé]]'' is a degree designed essentially as a post-Master's degree, offered as a full-time, one-year program (although there are "Executive" versions of this degree, designed for working professionals, which take a little longer to complete). As such, this French degree also forms a close analogy to its US counterpart, although the ''Mastère Spécialisé'' is offered in a variety of fields such as business, informatics, and aeronautics.

It now offers more courses in such diverse subjects as Technology Management, Business Management, Islamic Economics, Marketing, Engineering, Technology, Medicine, Education, Architecture, as well various Applied, Social and Engineering Sciences. In 2015, the UQU annual budget hovered around ''SR 3 billion'' (USD $801,399,900).

==History==
In 1949 King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Al Saud]] established the College of Sharia (Islamic Law) in [[Mecca]], making it the first higher education institution in the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  It constituted the kernel of Umm Al-Qura University. It was followed by the establishment of the Teachers' College in 1952. This continued until 1959 when the College of Shari'a took the responsibility of teachers' preparation and became the College of Shari'a and Education. In 1962 the College of Education was established as an independent college.

In 1971 the Colleges of Shari'a and Education became part of [[King Abdul Aziz University]] in [[Jeddah]] and constituted its branch in Mecca. However, The University of Umm Al-Qura was established in 1981 by the royal decree number 39 of 1981 and the colleges of Shari'a and Education were detached from [[King Abdul Aziz University]] and joined by new departments to form the new university.

Currently, it has [[student exchange program]]s with [[Purdue University]], [[Tufts University]], and [[King's College London]].
