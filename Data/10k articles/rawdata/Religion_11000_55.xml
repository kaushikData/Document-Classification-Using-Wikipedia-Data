'''Achziv''' (classical literature, also known as '''Ecdeppa''', '''Ecdippon''') is an ancient site on the Mediterranean coast of northern [[Israel]], between the border with [[Lebanon]] and the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] - 15 kilometers north of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], within the municipal area of [[Nahariya]]. Today it is an [[National parks and nature reserves of Israel|Israeli national park]]. The legally disputed "[[micronation]]" of "[[Akhzivland]]" is located in the immediate vicinity.

Excavations have unearthed a fortified Canaanite city of the second millennium BCE. The Phoenician town of the first millennium BCE is known both from the [[Hebrew Bible]] and Assyrian sources. Phoenician Achzib went through ups and downs during the Persian and Hellenistic periods. In Roman times ''Acdippa'' was a road station. The [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Bordeaux Pilgrim]] mentions it in 333-334 CE still as a road station; Jewish sources of the Byzantine period call it ''Kheziv'' and ''Gesiv''. There is no information about settlement at the site for the Early Muslim period. The Crusaders built a new village with a castle. During the Mamluk and Ottoman periods a modest village occupied the old [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] (archaeological mound). This village was depopulated during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]]. The only permanent resident of Achziv is an Israeli who has been welcoming visitors to a small stretch of beach where he has lived since 1975.

==History==
[[Image:Akhziv03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The mosque of al-Zib, restored at Achziv National Park]]

===Bronze Age===
Achziv was the first fortified settlement found by archaeologists, is a large Canaanite port city from the Middle Bronze Age IIB (1800-1550 BCE).&lt;ref name=Prausnitz75&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Planning of the Middle Bronze Age Town at Achzib and its Defences |author=M. W. Prausnitz |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |date=1975 |volume= 25| issue =  4 |publisher=Israel Exploration Society |pages=202–210 |jstor=27925533 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Negev&gt;{{cite book |work=Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land |title=Achzib (b) A Canaanite city on the Mediterranean coast |author=Avraham Negev and Shimon Gibson |year=2001 |location=New York and London |publisher=Continuum |page=16 |isbn=0-8264-1316-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The massive ramparts, some 4.5&amp;nbsp;m (15&amp;nbsp;ft) high, protected the city proper and a large area of port facilities. To the north and south the city extended to the two nearby rivers, which the Canaanite engineers connected by a fosse, thus transforming Achzib into an island.&lt;ref name=Prausnitz75/&gt; A substantial destruction level from the beginning of the Late Bronze Age proves that even these fortifications were eventually not sufficient.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Iron Age===
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the area including the [[Phoenicia]]n city of Achzib was assigned to the tribe of [[Asher]], but the Asherites did not manage to conquer it from the Phoenicians:&lt;ref name=Perseus&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DE%3Aentry+group%3D1%3Aentry%3Decdippa-geo]&lt;/ref&gt;
::And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher ... and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib. ({{Bibleref2|Joshua 19:24-29}})
::Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, ... or of Achzib ... ({{Bibleref2|Judges 1:31}})
[[King David]] added the city into his Kingdom, but [[King Solomon]] returned it to [[Hiram I]] as part of the famous pact.

During the invasions of [[Sennacherib]] the Assyrians conquered the city.&lt;ref name=Gutenberg&gt;[https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/gutenberg.org/1/7/3/2/17328/17328-h/17328-h.htm Project Gutenberg, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic era===

====Hellenistic period====
During the reign of the Seleucids the border was established at [[Rosh HaNikra grottoes|Rosh HaNikra]], just north to Achziv, making it a border city which they called ''Ekdippa'' (Έκδιππα in [[Ancient Greek]]) and put it under the control of [[Akko|Acre]].

====Roman and Byzantine periods====
A maritime city named Cziv, nine miles (14&amp;nbsp;km) north of Acre, is mentioned by [[Josephus Flavius]] and later by [[Eusebius]].
Achziv (Cheziv) is mentioned in Jewish [[rabbinic writings]], for example Midrash [[Vayikra Rabba]] 37:4. Additionally, Achziv is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, and by the relating Middle Age commentators, concerning the location of Achziv in regards to historical borders of Israel.

===Middle Ages===

====Crusader period====
During the [[Crusades|Crusader]] period, the site was known as Casale Umberti,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.huji.ac.il/depart/BIBLICAL/EILATM/achziv.asp Institute of Archaeology, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]]&lt;/ref&gt; or Casal Humberti, after Hubert of Pacy who held the casale and is documented in 1108.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Alan, ''The Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: A Dynastic History 1099-1125'' (Unit for Prosopographical Research, Linacre College, Oxford, 2000) p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; European farmers settled there in 1153 under [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]]. In 1232 it was the site of the [[Battle of Casal Imbert]] between German and French Crusaders as part of the [[War of the Lombards]].

====Mamluk period====
The Arab village of [[Az-Zeeb]] was established during the Mamluk period, the houses erected using the stones of the Crusader castle.

===Ottoman period===
The town existed during Ottoman rule in the region.

===British Mandate===
In 1946, [[The Jewish Resistance Movement]] attempted to blow up the railroad bridge over the creek at Achziv in an operation known as [[Night of the Bridges]]. A monument to the 14 soldiers killed there was erected on the site. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] the Arab villagers of az-Zib fled to Lebanon.

===Israel===
[[File:1אכזיב.jpg|thumb|Achziv at sunset]]
Achziv became an [[National parks and nature reserves of Israel|Israeli national park]].

==Archaeology==
[[Image:Akhziv01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ancient grinding stones at Achziv National Park]]
Remnants of ancient Achziv, now known as Tel Achziv, are located on a sandstone mound between two streams, Kziv on the north and Shaal on the south, close to the border with Lebanon.

An ancient port was located on the coast, and another secondary port is located 700 m to the south.

Archeological excavations have revealed that a walled city existed at the location from the Middle Bronze period. History of Achziv goes back to the Chalcolithic period (4500-3200 BC).

The city is a pilgrimage site in Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;Gurmukh Singh (2009), [http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx Anandpur Sahib], Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Editor in Chief: Harbans Singh, Punjab University; Quote: "Being one of the supremely important pilgrimage centres of the Sikhs, it is reverently called Anandpur Sāhib. Takht Sri Kesgaṛh Sāhib, one of the five Takhts (lit. thrones) or seats of highest religious authority for Sikhs".&lt;/ref&gt; It is the venue of the largest annual Sikh gathering and festivities during [[Hola Mohalla]] in the spring season.&lt;ref name=eosanand&gt;Gurmukh Singh (2009), [http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx Anandpur Sahib], Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Editor in Chief: Harbans Singh, Punjab University&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib - Anandpur Sahib.jpg|thumb|Front view of the Gurudwara Sri Anandpur Sahib]]

==Location==
Anandpur Sahib is located on [[National Highway 503 (India)|National Highway 503]] that links [[Kiratpur Sahib]] and [[Chandigarh]] to [[Nangal]], [[Una, Himachal Pradesh|Una]] and further [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh]]. It is situated near the [[Sutlej]] river, the longest of the five rivers that flow through the historic crossroads region of Punjab. 

==History==
Anandpur Sahib was founded in June 1665 by the ninth [[Sikh Guru]], [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]]. He previously lived in Kiratpur, but given the disputes with Ram Rai – the elder son [[Guru Har Rai]] and other [[sects of Sikhism]], he moved to village in Makhoval. He named it ''Chakk Nanaki'' after his mother. In 1675, Guru Tegh Bahadur was tortured and beheaded for refusing to convert to Islam under the orders of the Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]], a martyrdom that led Sikhs to rename the town to Anandpur and coronate his son Gobind Das (also known as Gobind Rai)&lt;ref&gt;Gurmukh Singh (2009), [http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx Anandpur Sahib], Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Editor in Chief: Harbans Singh, Punjab University; Quote: "Naming his young son, Gobind Dās (Later, Siṅgh), hardly nine years of age, his spiritual successor, he set out on the journey, preaching the holy word in towns and villages he passed through. In Delhi, he was taken into custody, tortured and executed publicly under the orders of Emperor Aurangzib in the Chandni Chowk on 11 November 1675".&lt;/ref&gt; as his successor and famous as [[Guru Gobind Singh]].&lt;ref name="McLeod2014p34"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

The village grew into town, likely dramatically state Louis E. Fenech and W. H. McLeod, as Sikhs moved near Guru Gobind Singh.&lt;ref name="McLeod2014p34"/&gt; The growing strength of Sikhs in Anandpur under the tenth Guru, after the execution of the ninth Guru, raised concerns of the neighboring Pahari rajas - the vassals of the Mughal Empire, along with the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb.&lt;ref name="McLeod2014p34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenech2013"/&gt;{{rp|14}} In 1693, Aurangzeb issued an order that banned large gatherings of Sikhs such as during the festival of [[Baisakhi]].&lt;ref name="Fenech2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Sikh Zafar-namah of Guru Gobind Singh: A Discursive Blade in the Heart of the Mughal Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUUfAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993145-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} In 1699, Guru Gobind Singh founded the Khalsa panth and gathered a large armed militia. This triggered Aurangzeb and his vassal Hindu kings around Anandpur to blockade Anandpur.&lt;ref name="McLeod2014p34"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E. Fenech|author2=W. H.

* [[First Battle of Anandpur]] (1700), against the Mughal army of Aurangzeb, who had sent 10,000 soldiers under the command of Painda Khan and Dina Beg.&lt;ref name="Jaques2007p48"/&gt; In a direct combat between Guru Gobind Singh and Painda Khan, the latter was killed. His death led to the Mughal army fleeing the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Jaques2007p48"/&gt;
* The siege of Anandpur Sahib (1701), against the neighboring Hindu kingdom chiefs who controlled the mountain kingdoms. This was accompanied by a battle wherein Jagatullah was killed by Sikh forces.&lt;ref name="Jaques2007p48"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Jaques|title=Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: A-E|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3amnMPTPP5MC |year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing  |isbn=978-0-313-33537-2 |pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hill chiefs laid a siege of Anandpur, and the Guru had to temporarily leave Anandpur as a condition for peace.&lt;ref name="Rinehart2011p22"/&gt; According to Louis Fenech, his wars with kings of the Himalayan kingdoms was likely triggered by the growing army of Sikhs, which then raided and plundered villages in nearby mountainous kingdoms for supplies; the Hindu kings joined forces and blockaded Anandpur.&lt;ref name="Fenech2013"/&gt;{{rp|14}}
* [[Second Battle of Anandpur]] (1704), against the Mughal army led first by Saiyad Khan and then by Ramjan Khan;&lt;ref name="Jaques2007p48"/&gt; The Mughal general was fatally wounded by Sikh soldiers, and the army withdrew. Aurangzeb then sent a larger army with two generals, Wazir Khan and Zaberdast Khan in May 1704, to destroy the Sikh resistance.&lt;ref name="Jaques2007p48"/&gt; The approach the Islamic army took in this battle was to lay a protracted siege against Anandpur, from May to December, cutting off all food and other supplies moving in and out, along with repeated battles.&lt;ref name="FenechMcleodp9"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

According to Louis Fenech, Anandpur's history during the late 17th century and early 18th century was complex and war prone because the relationship of Guru Gobind Singh with his neighbors was complex. Sometimes the hill chiefs and Guru Gobind Singh cooperated in a battle, sometimes they fought against each other, where the difficult mountainous terrain made it difficult for the Mughal to subdue everyone with force and the terrain made it easier for Pahari chieftains to rebel against the Mughals routinely.&lt;ref name="Fenech2013"/&gt;{{rp|8–11}}

===Gurdwaras===
Anandpur Sahib is in Punjab state of India, close to the Himachal Pradesh border. It is about {{convert|31|km}} north of Ropar (Rupnagar) and {{convert|29|km}} south of Nangal.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt; Anandpur has been significant to the Sikh history. These historical locations now feature the following Gurdwaras:
*'''Gurudwara [[Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib]]''': is the principal Sikh temple in the town. It marks the birthplace of Khalsa and one of the five religious authorities (Five Takhts) of Sikhism. Standing on a hillock, the present complex was built between 1936 and 1944. The plan of the building is a square set inside a {{convert|30|m2}} square courtyard. In it are the Takht's office and a Gurdwara. The Gurdwara has a {{convert|16|m2}} square hall, inside which is {{convert|5.5|m2}} square sanctum with the Sikh scripture and old weapons used by Guru Gobind Singh's Khalsa, signifying the ''miri'' and ''piri'' aspects of the Sikh faith. The dome of the Gurdwara is fluted lotus. The lower levels of the complex has a langar (free community kitchen run by volunteers), a {{convert|55|m2}} square divan hall, and a row of rooms for pilgrims called the Dashmesh Nivas. Nearby is a {{convert|80|m2}} square ''sarovar'' (holy water tank) for pilgrims to take their pilgrimage dip.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt;
*'''Gurdwara Sisganj''': built by Ranjit Singh to mark the place where Guru Tegh Bahadur's severed head after his execution in Delhi, was cremated in 1675.&lt;ref name="Fenech2014p446"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E. Fenech|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8I0NAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA446|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-969930-8|pages=446–447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Gobind Singh had a platform and shrine built on the site of the cremation. He entrusted an [[Sects of Sikhism|Udasi]] Sikh named Gurbakhsh to protect this shrine when he left Anandpur in 1705. The Gurdwara was enlarged and renovated in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt; This Sikh temple features a pinnacled dome under which is the sanctum. Around the sanctum is a {{convert|4.5|m}} wide circumambulation path with carved marble pillars.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt;
*'''Gurudwara Bhora Sahib''': A three-storey domed Gurdwara which was the residence of [[Guru Teg Bahadur]]. The basement level has a room with a {{convert|1.5|m2}} platform that is {{convert|0.5|m}} high, where the 9th Guru used to meditate and compose hymns. It now houses the ''Guru Granth Sahib''.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt;
*'''Gurudwara Thara Sahib''': A {{convert|5|m2}} platform in the front of Damdama Sahib where Bhai Kripa Ram Dutt along with other 16 Kashmiri Pandits sought his help in 1675. They came to seek protection from Aurangzeb and requested Guru Teg Bahadur to save them from forcible conversions to Islam.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pashaura Singh and Louis Fenech|title=The Oxford handbook of Sikh studies|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014|isbn= 978-0-19-969930-8|pages= 236–445, Quote:"This is the reputed place where several Kashmiri pandits came seeking protection from Auranzeb's army."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gurudwara Akal Bunga Sahib''': This Gurdwara is opposite to Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib. It was built by a pujari named Man Singh in 1889. Here Guru Gobind Singh after the cremation of the "head of Guru Teg Bahadur" had delivered a sermon after the beheading of his father Guru Teg Bahadur in Delhi.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt;
*'''Gurudwara Damdama Sahib''': Close to Gurdwara Sisganj Sahib, it shares the compound with Anandpur Bhora Sahib and Thara Sahib, which is also called Guru ke Mahal. This Gurdwara remembers the residential quarters of Guru Tegh Bahadur. He used to welcome and counsel Sikh sangats who would visit him. Guru Gobind Singh was designated as the tenth guru at this place. The octagonal domed building here was built in 20th century.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt;
*'''Gurudwara Manji Sahib / Gurudwara Dumalgarh Sahib''': This Gurdwara is on the northern side of Takht Shri Keshgarh Sahib. Here, Guru Gobind Singh used to train his sons. This place was used as playground; wrestling and other competitions were held here.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt;
*'''Gurdwara Shaeedhi Bagh''': This Gurdwara is located on the road between Takhat Shri Kesh Garh Sahib &amp; Kila Anand Garh Sahib. In early days of eighteenth century this place was a big garden during skirmishes between Sikh Army and Bilaspur Army, many Sikh soldiers laid their lives here in this garden, hence this place is termed as Gurdwara Shaeedhi Bagh.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt;
*'''Gurdwara Mata Jit Kaur''': Mata Jit Kaur, wife of Guru Gobind Singh had a vision "[[Divya-drishti]]" of the atrocities and cruelties on Sikhs and young sons. She was cremated near Quilla Holgarh Sahib. This place is now termed Gurdwara Mata Jit Kaur.&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt;
*'''Gurdwara Guru Ka Mahal''': It was the first building of Chak Nanaki, Anandpur Sahib. The foundation stone was laid here. Guru Gobind Singh, Mata Gujri, Mata Jit Kaur, Mata Sundar Kaur, Mata Sahib Kaur and four sons of the Guru had been living here: Jujhar Singh, Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh were born here. Gurdwara Bhora Sahib, Gurdwara Manji Sahib and Gurdwara Damdama Sahib are part of Gurdwara Guru Ka Mahal Complex.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Forts===
10th Sikh Guru [[Guru Gobind Singh]] made five forts on the border of the city. The buildings to commemorate each of these were built between late 1970s and the late 1980s:&lt;ref name=eosanand/&gt;
*'''Qila Anandgarh Sahib''': This was the main fort, after which the city was also named Anandpur Sahib. The Army once resided here.
*'''Qila Holgarh Sahib'''
*'''Qila Lohgarh Sahib''': Here the weapons for the Army were made.
*'''Qila Fatehgarh Sahib'''
*'''Qila Taragarh Sahib'''

===Sacred sites near Anandpur Sahib===
*Guru-Ka-Lahore: It is situated about 11&amp;nbsp;km on Sri Anandpur Sahib-Ganguwal route leading to the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]], India. On 25 January 1686, the 10th Guru's wedding to Mata was celebrated here. Two trickling springs, claimed to be dug out from the stony mountain-side by the 10th Guru, still exist today.
*Bhai Kanhaiya : Bhai Kanhaiya offered first aid to friendly and enemy forces alike across the area spanning the now-almost dried up rivulet Charan Ganga and below the Taragarh hill. His unbiased service has been compared to the functions of the Red Cross.

== Festivals and fairs ==
[[File:Hola Mohalla Holi festival and sports, Anandpur Sahib Punjab India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Anandpur Sahib is the site for the annual Hola Mohalla gathering and martial sports.]]
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
Anandpur Sahib features a major festival and gathering of Sikhs every year on the occasion of [[Hola Mohalla]]. This tradition dates back to the times of the 10th Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. The guru decreed that the occasion of the festival of [[Holi]] be the occasion for the display of the martial spirit of his people. He gave this festival of Holi the Sikh name of 'Hola Mohalla'. Each year Hola Mohalla marks the congregation of nearly 100,000 Sikhs from all over the country for a festival of colour and gaiety. The festival, among other things, remembers the creation of Khalsa on the Baisakhi day in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;Gurmukh Singh (2009), [http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx Anandpur Sahib], Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Editor in Chief: Harbans Singh, Punjab University; Quote: "On Baisakhi day, 30 March 1699, Guru Gobind Singh carried out the supreme task of his career converting the sangat into Khalsa. Instructions had been sent out during the previous year to sangats, or Sikh communities, in various parts not to recognize any longer the masands as the Guru's representatives and to come to Anandpur for the following Baisakhi festival in large numbers. ".&lt;/ref&gt;

The fair lasts for three days. The Gurudwaras are specially decorated for the occasion. During Hola Mohalla, Anandpur Sahib wears a festive appearance and hums with activities in March. Community conferences and religious functions are also organized. On this occasion, Nihangs from all over the country gather for the celebrations. The highlight is a huge procession by the Nihangs, clad in their traditional dress and weapons, on the last day of the fair. The procession starts from the headquarters of the Nihangs, opposite Gurudwara Anandgarh Sahib, and passes through the bazaar, goes to village Agampur and reaches the fort of Holgarh, the place where Guru Gobind Singh used to celebrate this fair. Thereafter, the procession heads toward the sandy bed of Charan Ganga, where demonstration of martial games including riding, tent pegging, sword-wielding, etc. are witnessed by a large number of people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rupnagar.nic.in/html/festivals.htm Festivals/Melas - Rupnagar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baisakhi]] in 1999, at Anandpur Sahib marked the completion of 300 years of the birth of the [[Khalsa]]. It was on Baisakhi day in 1699 that Guru Gobind Singh baptised the ''Panj Pyaras'' at the place where [[Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib]] stands.

'''Hayyim Samuel Jacob Falk''' ({{lang-he-n|חיים שמואל יעקב דפאלק מרדיולה לנידו}}; Also known as the '''Baal Shem of London''' and '''Doctor Falckon'''; 1708 – 17 April 1782) was a [[rabbi]], [[Practical Kabbalah|Practical Kabbalist]] and [[alchemy|alchemist]].

==Biography==
Falk was born in either [[Fürth]] in Bavaria or [[Pidhaytsi]] in [[Podolia]]. After having narrowly escaped being [[burnt at the stake]] by the authorities in [[Westphalia]] who had charged him with [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]], the German Count Alexander Leopold Anton von Rantzau secretly gave him refuge in Holzminden. During this stay in 1736, Falk made his impressive kabbalistic performances in Rantzau’s castle witnessed by noblemen and Alexander’s son Count Georg Ludwig Albrecht von Rantzau. In his famous ''Mémoires du comte de Rantzow'', which are referred to by many researchers as an original standard source, this young Count gives a thorough and detailed account of all these mystic demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=9gZcAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=memoires+du+comte++Rantzau+%22Je+suis+fils+d%27Alexandre%22+Mars+1714+batis%C3%A9+%C3%A0+Holczmunden&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gIeFVb_eIuW_ywP0v4HoAg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=memoires%20du%20comte%20Grande%20%20Bretagne%20Rantzau%20%22Je%20suis%20fils%20d%27Alexandre%22%20Mars%201714%20batis%C3%A9%20%C3%A0%20Holczmunden%20George&amp;f=false Rantzow, George Louis Albert. "Mémoires du comte de Rantzow" p. 2 and pp. 197-223, Oxford Univ.; German translation: "Die Memoiren des Grafen von Rantzau" p. 1 and pp. 70-79]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after 1736, Falk arrived in London. He lived at 35 Prescott Street, London, United Kingdom and at [[Wellclose Square]], London until his death. He was a neighbour of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and there is some evidence that he had a significant influence on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodrick-Clarke|first=Nicholas|title=Review:Emanuel Swedenborg, Secret Agent on Earth and in Heaven: Jacobites, Jews, and Freemasons in Early Modern Sweden|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Jacob Emden]] accused him of being a [[Sabbatean]], a supporter of [[Sabbatai Zevi]], as he invited Moses David of Podhayce, a known Sabbatean with connections to [[Jonathan Eibeschutz]], to his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mysticism, Magic and Kabbalah in Ashkenazi Judaism|last=Grözinger|first=Karl-Erich|author2=Dan, Joseph|year=1991|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=3-11-013744-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 17 April 1782 and was buried in Alderney Road Cemetery, Mile End, London &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewisheastend.com/sacred.html&lt;/ref&gt; Falk bequeathed in his will an annual sum of 100 pounds to the [[Great Synagogue of London]] as well as some [[Sefer Torah]]s.

==Folklore==
Many stories exist regarding Falk's extraordinary powers. According to one account, Falk made secretive visits to [[Epping Forest]] in his carriage, where he was said to have buried some treasure. On one of these occasions a wheel came loose from the vehicle on the [[Whitechapel Road]], but followed the carriage all the way to the forest. When Falk ran short of coal, he was said to have performed a magical feat involving three shirts and a ram's horn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ceremonies, Customs, Rites, and Traditions of the Jews|last=Isaacs|first=Hyam|year=1850|publisher=William Buck|pages=355–356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falk was also able to keep candles burning miraculously, and to transport objects from one place to another.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Some claimed that he had saved the [[Great Synagogue of London|Great Synagogue]] from fire by writing something in [[Hebrew]] on the pillars of the door.

== Diary  ==
Falk kept a diary containing records of dreams and the Kabbalistic names of angels. This can be found in the library of the [[United Synagogue]] in London. In 2002 Michal Oron published the diary and a biography of Falk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Oron|first= Michal|title= Samuel Falk, The Baal shem of London מ'בעל שד' ל'בעל שם'|publisher=[[Bialik]] Institute|year= 2002 |isbn= 965-342-850-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diary is written in [[Hebrew]] and is very cryptic. The diary was published together with the diary of Falk's assistant, Tsvee Hirsch of Kalish.

'''Beer Shmuel Issachar Leyb ben Judah Moses Eybeschuetz Perlhefter''' (ca. 1650 in [[Prague]] – after 1713 in Prague) was a Jewish scholar and rabbi. His educated wife [[Bella bat R. Jakob Perlhefter]] (Isabell, Bella, Bilah, died 1710 in [[Prague]]), corresponded in Hebrew and wrote the preface on the Yiddish book “Beer Sheva”.  Perlhefter taught the German [[Christian Hebraist]] [[Johann Christoph Wagenseil]] Hebrew and Jewish literature. Beer Perlhefter is consider an important figure of the [[Sabbatian]] movement. After the death of the pseudo-Messiah [[Sabbatai Zevi]] (1626-1676), he restored the Sabbatian theology at the school of [[Abraham Rovigo]] and called the Pseudomessiah [[Mordecai Mokiach]] to [[Italy]].

In [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], a pilgrimage is a long [[quest|journey]] or [[wikt:search|search]] of great [[moral]] significance. Sometimes, it is a journey to a sacred place or [[shrine]] of importance to a person's [[belief]]s and [[faith]]. Members of every major religion participate in pilgrimages. A person who makes such a journey is called a [[pilgrim]].

There are number of historical '''Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India'''.

==Primary sites==
{{BuddhasHolySites}}
[[Buddhism]] offers four major sites of pilgrimage: the  Buddha's birthplace at [[Lumbini]], the site where he attained Enlightenment [[Bodh Gaya]], where he first preached at [[Benaras]], and where he achieved [[Parinirvana]] at [[Kusinagara]].
Some Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India are listed below:
* '''[[Bodh Gaya]]''', [[Bihar]] — The site of the enlightenment of [[Gautama Buddha]]  under a tree and top site in the list of world heritage sites in India.
* '''[[Sarnath]]''', outside [[Varanasi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] — The site of the first sermon and where Buddha taught the four noble truths about life &amp; death.
* '''[[Kushinagar]]''', [[Uttar Pradesh]] — the site of the Buddha's [[parinirvana]] and home of many famous [[meditation]] &amp; prayer offering sites in India.

These are three of the four holiest sites in [[Buddhism]]. The fourth, [[Lumbini]], the birthplace of the Buddha, is now in southern [[Nepal]].

Water-filled basins, called ''[[chōzubachi]]'', are used by worshippers for washing their left hands, right hands, mouth and finally the handle of the water ladle to purify themselves before approaching the main [[Shinto shrine]] or {{nihongo4||社殿|shaden}}. This symbolic purification is normal before worship and all manned shrines have this facility, as well as many Buddhist temples and some new religious houses of worship.

The ''temizuya'' is usually an open area where clear water fills one or various stone basins. Wooden dippers are usually available to worshippers.

Originally, this purification was done at a spring, stream or seashore and this is still considered the ideal. Worshippers at the Inner Shrine at Ise still use this traditional way of ablution.

The '''Deceased Correa''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]  '''La Difunta Correa''') is a semi-[[Paganism|pagan]] [[folk saint|mythical figure]] in folk-religion, for which a number of people in [[Argentina]]  and [[Chile]], especially among the popular classes, feel a great devotion. It has spread, in a limited way, to neighbouring countries such as [[Uruguay]]. Every year since its inception in 1840, miracles are said to have occurred at the shrine of La Difunta Correa, and thousands of people have visited there to pay their respects. The shrine is situated in the small town of Vallecito, 1160&amp;nbsp;km from Buenos Aires and 63&amp;nbsp;km from the city of San Juan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sacredsites.com/americas/argentina/difunta_correa.html|title=Difunta Correa|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of a popular saint==
According to popular legend, the husband of Deolinda Correa was forcibly recruited around the year 1840, during the Argentine civil wars. When he became sick, he was abandoned by the ''[[Montoneras]]'' [partisans]. In an attempt to reach her sick husband, Deolinda took her baby and followed the tracks of the ''Montoneras'' through the desert of [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan Province]]. When her supplies ran out, she died. Her body was found days later by [[gauchos]] who were driving cattle through. They were astonished when they saw the dead woman's baby was still alive, feeding from her  "miraculously" ever-full breast. The men buried her body in present-day [[Vallecito, San Juan|Vallecito]] in the [[Caucete Department]] of San Juan, and took her baby with them.

==Sanctuary==
Once the folk tale became known, the inhabitants of the nearby areas started visiting Deolinda Correa's grave, building after time an oratory that slowly became a sanctuary.

The [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] to the ''Difunta Correa'' is that of an unofficial popular saint, not recognised by the [[Catholic Church]]. Her devout followers believe her to perform miracles and intercede for the living. The survival of her child would have been her first miracle.

Cattle keepers first, then truck drivers, disseminated the figure of the Difunta, creating [[wayside shrine]]s in many roads throughout the country, with images and sculptures of the ''Deceased''. They there leave bottles of water as [[votive offering]]s, "to calm her eternal thirst".

Since the 1940s her sanctuary at Vallecito, at first merely a cross on the top of a hill, has been transformed into a small town in which there are several votive chapels (17 as of 2005), full of offerings. The chapels are donated by her followers, whose names are engraved on plates fixed to the doors.

In the chapel located on the top of the hill there is a life-size statue depicting the ''Difunta'' lying face to the heavens, with her child at her breast. The sanctuaries are segregated by themes. For instance, one of the chapels is full of wedding dresses offered to the ''Difunta'' by women whose prayers to get married were fulfilled. Car registrations and scale-model houses can be found all around the hill to the main sanctuary.

Visits to the Difunta Correa's Vallecito shrine take place during the whole year, but they are more numerous during [[Easter]] or at [[All-Souls' Day]] (November 2) and on dates special to truck drivers and gauchos, mostly in summer. On such occasions, crowds of 200,000 people have been claimed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5218">'''Féth fíada''' ({{lang-sga|féth fíada}}, féth fiada, feth fiadha, fé fíada, faeth fiadha), in [[Irish mythology]] is a '''magic mist''' or veil which the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] uses to enshroud themselves, rendering their presence invisible to human eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;"1 féth: A magic mist, veil, which renders those under it invisible  (Cf.  the Germ. Tarn- kappe) the secret of which was possessed by the Tuatha D.D.: " ([http://www.dil.ie/ eDIL])&lt;/ref&gt; ''Féth'' denotes this mist in particular, and ''fíada'' originally meant "knower", then came to mean "lord, master, possessor".&lt;ref&gt;"fíada.. orig. a part. pres. = `Knower' .. A lord, master, possessor:  .. (eDIL) "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}},p.217. Lists various alternate spellings of féth fiada.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of usage occurs in the ''Altram Tige Dá Medar'' ("Fosterage of the House of Two Milk-Vessels"), where [[Manannán mac Lir]] makes an assignment to each member which [[Sidhe]] (fairy mound) they should dwell in, raising the feth fiada to conceal themselves from mortal men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dobbs|1929}}, Altrom Tighe Da Medar, "in Feth Fiadha", p.192; tr. p.193 (also Feth Fiar, Fed Fiar)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackillop|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Lebor Gabála Érenn]], one passage declares that the Tuatha Dé Danann came "without ships or barks, in clouds of fog [over the air, by their might of druidry]", but an ensuing passage soon after offers a rational explanation, that "..it was as a sea-expedition the Tuatha De Danann came to Ireland, and burnt their ships. It was owing to the fog of smoke that rose from them as they were burning that others have said that they came in a fog of smoke".&lt;ref&gt;Macalister ed. tr. &amp;para;321,322,327&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn is accompanied by a prose explanation of how it came to be created. &lt;blockquote&gt;The high king [[Lóegaire mac Néill]], with the will to prevent the saint and his band from coming to [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] to spread the faith, sent out troops to find and intercept them.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Galanthis''' or '''Galinthias''' was the woman who interfered with [[Hera]]'s plan to hinder the birth of [[Heracles]] in favor of [[Eurystheus]], and was changed into a [[weasel]] or [[cat]] as punishment for being so insolent as to deceive the goddesses of birth that were acting on Hera's behalf.

== Mythology ==

=== Ovid's account ===
In the version followed by Ovid in ''Metamorphoses'', Galanthis was the red-gold haired servant of [[Alcmene]], who assisted her during the birth of [[Heracles]]. When Alcmene was in labor, she was having difficulty giving birth to a child so large. After seven days she called for assistance from [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], the goddess of childbirth (that is, the Greek [[Eileithyia]]). However, Lucina did not help her due to the wishes of [[Hera]]. Instead, she clasped her hands and crossed her legs, preventing the child from being born. Alcmene struggled in pain, cursed the heavens, and became close to death. Galanthis noticed Lucina and deduced Hera's plans. She told the goddess that the baby was born; this so startled her that she jumped up and unclasped her hands. This freed Alcmene, and she was able to give birth. Galanthis laughed and ridiculed Lucina, and as a punishment was turned into a weasel or cat. She continued to live with Alcmene after her transformation, thus initiating the practice of weasels being kept as household animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 9.273-323&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antoninus' account ===
The account of [[Antoninus Liberalis]] makes Galinthias a daughter of the Theban [[Proetus]], and a playmate of Alcmene. In his version, Eileithyia and the [[Moerae]] came to Alcmene and held her tight to make her labor pains last longer, so as to please Hera. Galinthias confused them by telling that Alcmene had given birth by the will of [[Zeus]], and accordingly all the rites in honor of the birth goddesses had been cancelled. The goddesses were taken aback and loosened their grip so Alcmene delivered. The Moerae, enraged by the fact that a mortal was able to deceive them, changed Galinthias into a weasel, an animal that in ancient times was believed to conceive through the ear and give birth through the mouth via the curse of the scorned deities. [[Hecate]], however, took pity on her and made the weasel her own sacred animal. When Heracles grew up, he built a sanctuary to Galinthias and sacrificed to her; the practice of honoring Galinthias in Thebes lasted down to late times.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'', 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of Galanthis is also briefly mentioned by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]: he recounts the [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Theban]] version of the story, which referred to the heroine as '''Historis''', called her a daughter of [[Tiresias]], and made no mention of her transformation. In this version, she deceived the female agents of Hera known as the Pharmacides ("Herbalists" or "Sorceresses") who had been keeping Alcmene from giving birth, by announcing the birth of the child, which made the Pharmacides leave and let Alcmene be delivered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 9. 11. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legends and Epics period===
A discourse of [[Bhishma|Bhishma Pitamah]] in the Vana Parva (Tirtha-yatra Parva) Section XC of [[The Mahabharata]] notes:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03090.htm Yudhishthira] [[Mahabharata|The Mahabharata]], translated by [[Kisari Mohan Ganguli]] (1883 – 1896), Book 3: Vana Parva: Tirtha-yatra Parva: Section XC, p 204.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''O! [[Yudhishthira]], the spot where [[Ganges|Ganga]] rusheth past, cleaving the foremost of mountains which is frequented by [[Gandharvas]] and [[Yakshas]] and [[Rakshasas]] and [[Apsaras]], and inhabited by hunters, and [[Kinnaras]], is called ''Gangadwara'' (Haridwar). O! King, [[Sanatkumara]] regardeth that spot visited by [[Brahmarshi]]s, as also the [[Tirtha (Hinduism)|Tirtha]] [[Kankhal|Kanakhala]] (that is near to it), as sacred.''

According to Hindu texts, King [[Daksha]] [[Prajapati]], father of [[Dakshayani]] ([[Dakshayani|Sati]]), Lord Shiva's first wife, was a ruler here. He performed a [[yagna]], to which he deliberately did not invite Lord Shiva. When he arrived uninvited, he was further insulted by the king, seeing which [[Dakshayani|Sati]] felt infuriated and self-immolated herself in the Yagna Kund, or Sati Kund as it is called now, situated in [[Kankhal]]. The heart and navel of  [[Dakshayani|Sati]] had fallen at the place which is the present site of the [[Maya Devi Temple, Haridwar]], dating back to the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.ua.nic.in/uttaranchaltourism/districts/haridwar/haridwar_temple.htmlHaridwar sites]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Uttarakhand Govt. Official website.&lt;/ref&gt; Daksha was later killed by the demon [[Virabhadra]], born out of Shiva's anger. Subsequently, the king was brought to life and given a goat's head by [[Shiva]].

[[Skanda Purana]] mentions a legend, in which ''Chanda-Munda'', the Army Chief of local Demon Kings ''Shumbh'' and ''Nishumbha'' were killed here by goddess [[Chandi]] at a place, which got the name [[Chandi Devi Temple, Haridwar|Chandi Devi Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blessingsonthenet.com/newtemple/temple.asp?serialno=3&amp;tempid=T027&amp;desctitle=Legend Legend] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708013522/http://www.blessingsonthenet.com/newtemple/temple.asp?serialno=3&amp;tempid=T027&amp;desctitle=Legend |date=8 July 2011 }} [[Chandi Devi Temple, Haridwar]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sage [[Kapila]] had an [[Ashram]] here. The legendary King [[Bhagiratha|Bhagirath]], the great-grandson of the [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] King [[Sagara (Vedic king)|Sagar]], (an ancestor of [[Rama]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiantemples.com/beliefs/gangadesc.htm Story of Bhagirata]&lt;/ref&gt; is said to have brought the river [[Ganges]] down from heaven, through years of penance in [[Satya Yuga]], for the salvation of 60,000 of his ancestors from the curse of the saint [[Kapila]].&lt;ref name="Gangotri1"&gt;[http://www.gangotri.org/ "Uttarakhand Information Centre – Gangotri Information"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616165346/http://www.gangotri.org/ |date=16 June 2008 }} ''The Complete Uttarakhand Travel Guide''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mankodi, Kirit (1973) "Ganga Tripathaga" ''Artibus Asiae'' 35(1/2): pp. 139–144, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord [[Vishnu]] is said to have left his footprint on the stone that is set in the upper wall of Har-Ki-Pauri (literally, "footsteps of the Lord"), where the Holy Ganges touches it at all times. Devout [[Hindu]]s perform ritualistic bathing here on the banks of the river [[Ganges]], an act considered to be the equivalent of washing away one's sins to attain [[Moksha]].

Seven sages or [[Saptarishi]]s, namely [[Kashyapa]], [[Vashistha|Vashisht]], [[Atri]], [[Vishwamitra]], [[Jamadagni]], [[Bharadwaja]] and [[Gautama Maharishi|Gautam]], are said to have meditated at the site of '''Sapt Rishi Ashram &amp; Sapt Rishi Sarovar''', a place near Haridwar, where the Ganges split into seven currents, so that the [[Rishi]]s would not be disturbed by the flow.

In the Vanaparva of the [[Mahabharat]], where sage Dhaumya tells [[Yudhishthira]] about the [[Tirtha (Hinduism)|tirtha]]s of India, Gangadwar, i.e. Haridwar and [[Kankhal]], have been referred to;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ignca.nic.in/cd_07006.htm Historical, Cultural and Social Perspectives] Chapter 3, The Cultural Dimension of Ecology, Baidyanath Saraswati, 1998, [[Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts]]. {{ISBN|81-246-0102-X}}. ignca.nic.in. Vanaparva (The Book of the Forest) is third parva (book) of Mahabharata.&lt;/ref&gt; the text also mentions that [[Agastya]] Rishi did penance here, with the help of his wife, [[Lopamudra]] (the princess of [[Vidharba]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03097.htm Lopamudra] [[Mahabharata|The Mahabharata]], translated by [[Kisari Mohan Ganguli]] (1883 -1896), Book 3: Vana Parva: Tirtha-yatra Parva: Section XCVII.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that while [[Pandavas]] were going to [[Himalayas]] through Haridwar, prince [[Bhima]] drew water from the rocks here, by thrusting his knee (goda) into the ground at the present site of 'Bhimagoda' situated at a distance of about 1&amp;nbsp;km from Har-ki-Pauri.

===Ancient period===
Archaeological findings have proved that [[terra cotta]] culture dating between 1700 BCE and 1200 BCE existed in this region.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://haridwar.nic.in/history.htm#history Haridwar History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210151555/http://haridwar.nic.in/history.htm |date=10 December 2007 }} '' Haridwar Official website''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haridwar came under the rule of the [[Maurya Empire]] (322–185 BCE), and later under the [[Kushan Empire]] (c. 1st–3rd centuries).

It is believed that the sacred Ghat '''[[Har ki Pauri]]''' was constructed by King [[Vikramaditya]] (1st century BC) in memory of his brother [[Bharthari (king)|Bharthari]], who had come to Haridwar and meditated on the banks of holy Ganges and died here.

First ancient era written evidence of Haridwar is found in the accounts of a Chinese traveller, [[Xuanzang|Huan Tsang]], who visited India in 629 AD,&lt;ref name=kub/&gt; during the reign of [[Harsha|King Harshavardhan]] (590–647). He records Haridwar as 'Mo-yu-lo', the remains of which still exist at Mayapur, a little to the south of the modern Haridwar town; among the ruins are a fort and three temples, decorated with broken stone sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hardwar |volume=12 |page=944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gaze&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V13_058.gif Hardwar] [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], v. 13, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/ Digital Library] ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', Oxford, 1908, Vol.13, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; He also mentions the presence of a temple, north of Mo-yu-lo called 'Gangadwara', Gateway of the Ganges.&lt;ref name=gaze/&gt;

It is believed that [[Shankaracharya|Adi Shankracharya]] had visited this region and the existing main statue of '''[[Chandi Devi Temple, Haridwar|Chandi Devi Temple]]''' was established by him in 8th century A.D.

===Medieval period===
Haridwar region was a part of [[Delhi Sultanate]]. The armies of Emperor [[Timur]] (1336–1405), a Turkic conqueror, had passed through this region on 13 January 1399 to attack [[Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V02_401.gif&amp;volume=2 History] ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', v. 2, p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his visit, first Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]] (1469–1539) bathed at Haridwar's 'Kushwan Ghat', wherein the famous, 'watering the crops' episode took place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurmat.info/sms/smspublications/gurunanakforchildren/chapter7/.

''page 50-52''.&lt;/ref&gt; His visit is today commemorated by a [[gurudwara]] (Gurudwara Nanakwara); according to two Sikh [[Janamsakhis]], this visit took place on the [[Baisakhi]] day in 1504 AD.

''[[Mughal Empire|The Mughal period]]'': [[Ain-e-Akbari]], written by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazal]] in the 16th century during the reign of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar]], refers to Maya (Mayapur), known as Hardwar on the [[Ganges]], as sacred city of Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00702050%26ct%3D0 Sacred Places of Pilgrimage] ''[[Ain-e-Akbari]]'', Vol. III, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions that during his travels, and also while at home, [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] drank water from the [[Ganges]] river, which he called 'the water of immortality'. Special people were stationed at Sorun and later Haridwar to dispatch water, in sealed jars, to wherever he was stationed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00702015%26ct%3D48%26rqs%3D60 Hardwar] ''[[Ain-e-Akbari]]'', by Abul Fazl 'Allami, Volume I, A´I´N 22.

Calcutta, 1873–1907. “His Majesty calls this source of life “the water of immortality,” and has committed the care of this department to proper persons.... Both at home and on travels, he drinks Ganges water.”&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that Akbar's famous Commander-in-Chief, Raja [[Man Singh]] of [[Amber, India|Amber]], laid the foundation of the present day city of Haridwar and also renovated the ghats at Har-ki-pauri. After his death, his ashes are also said to have been immersed at Brahma Kund by Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] himself. ''[[Brahma]] Kund'' (literally “Brahma's reservoir”) at [[Har ki Pauri]], Haridwar is one among the four sites where drops of the elixir of immortality, [[Amrita]], accidentally spilled over from [[Kumbha|the pitcher]], in which it was being carried away by the celestial bird [[Garuda]], after the [[Samudra manthan]] by the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and the [[Asuras]]. The famous [[Kumbh Mela]]s are held at these four sites in rotation, to commemorate the event. [[Thomas Coryat]], an English traveller, who visited the city in the reign of Emperor [[Jahangir]] (1596–1627) mentions it as 'Haridwara', the capital of Shiva.&lt;ref name=gaze/&gt;

===Post Independence period===
In 1947, when India achieved independence from the [[British Raj|British]] colonial subjugation, the region of present Haridwar district was a part of the then [[Saharanpur district]], in the [[United Province]] of the [[British Raj]]; the province was renamed as [[Uttar Pradesh]] state of India. The Haridwar district came into existence on 28 December 1988 as part of [[Saharanpur division|Saharanpur Divisional Commissionary]].&lt;ref name=geo&gt;[http://haridwar.nic.in/history.htm#Geography Geography of Haridwar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210151555/http://haridwar.nic.in/history.htm |date=10 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 1998 [[Uttar Pradesh]] Legislative Assembly passed the 'Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Bill', 1998';&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt; eventually the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] also passed the [[List of Indian Federal Legislation|Indian Federal Legislation]] – 'Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000' – and thus on 9 November 2000,&lt;ref name="Uttarakhand"/&gt; Haridwar district became part of the newly formed [[Uttarakhand]] (then Uttaranchal), the 27th state in the [[Republic of India]].

==Economy==
Agriculture is the mainstay of this well irrigated district. Industrialisation had commenced with the establishment of Central Government owned Public Sector plants (PSUs) of [Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd (IDPL)] and [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]], in pre-Uttarakhand 1960s period. The [[State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand]] (SIDCUL) has now established one new 'industrial development zone' in the district, adjacent to [[Shivalik Nagar, Haridwar|Shivalik Nagar]] near Haridwar, to encourage industrialisation; with industrial giants like Hindustan Lever, Dabur, Mahendra &amp; Mahendra and Havells having moved in, it is making the desired progress. Not insignificant to the district's economy is the contribution of Hindu pilgrims who visit the holy places and attend the religious fairs in large numbers.

==Education==
Haridwar district has several academic institutions, covering studies in sciences, engineering, technology and advanced research in the town of [[Roorkee]].

Education in [[Sanskrit]] based classics and Hindu religious/cultural disciplines is an age-old tradition in the district, mainly centred in and around [[Haridwar]] city. Some of the important institutions of this genre are:

'''''In a Glass Darkly''''' is a collection of five [[short story|short stories]] by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], first published in 1872, the year before his death. The second and third are revised versions of previously published stories, and the fourth and fifth are long enough to be called [[novella]]s.

The title is taken from [[1 Corinthians 13:12]], a deliberate misquotation of the passage which describes humanity as perceiving the world "through a glass darkly".

==Stories==
The stories, which belong to the [[Gothic horror]] and mystery genres, are presented as selections from the posthumous papers of the [[occult detective]] Dr. Martin Hesselius.

==="Green Tea"===
An English clergyman named Jennings confides to Hesselius that he is being followed by a demon in the form of an ethereal monkey, invisible to everyone else, which is trying to invade his mind and destroy his life. Hesselius writes letters to a Dutch colleague about the victim's condition, which gets steadily worse with time as the creature steps up its methods, all of which are purely psychological. The title refers to Hesselius' belief that [[green tea]] was what unsealed Jennings's "inner eye" and led to the haunting. [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s book ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' (1749) is cited on the power of demons.

==="The Familiar"===
A revised version of "The Watcher" (1851). A sea captain, living in [[Dublin]], is stalked by "The Watcher", a strange dwarf who resembles a person from his past. He starts to hear accusatory voices all about him and eventually his fears solidify in the form of a sinister bird, a pet owl owned by his fiancée, Miss Montague.

==="Mr. Justice Harbottle"===
A revised version of "An Account of Some Strange Disturbances in Aungier Street" (1853). A cruel judge in the Court of Common Pleas, Elijah Harbottle, finds himself under attack by vengeful spirits, and in a disturbing dream he is condemned to death by a monstrous [[doppelgänger]]. The story is set between 1746 and 1748 and is retold by a Londoner, called Anthony Harman, from the account related in letters by an elderly friend.

==="The Room in the ''Dragon Volant''"===
Not a [[ghost story]] but a notable mystery story, in 26 chapters, which includes the theme of [[premature burial]]. A naïve young Englishman in France attempts to save a mysterious countess from her intolerable situation.

==="Carmilla"===
{{main article|Carmilla}}
A tale of a female vampire, set in [[Duchy of Styria|Styria, Austria]]. This story was to greatly influence [[Bram Stoker]] in writing ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897). It also served as the basis for several works in other media, such as Danish director [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]]'s film ''[[Vampyr]]'' (1932), [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]]'s film ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'' (1970) and ''[[Carmilla (series)|Carmilla]]'' a Canadian web series starring [[Natasha Negovanlis]] and [[Elise Bauman]] and also directed by [[Spencer Maybee]].

'''Jewish culture''' is the [[culture]] of the [[Jewish people]] from the formation of the Jewish nation in [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|biblical times]] through life in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] and the modern state of [[Israel]]. [[Judaism]] guides its adherents in both practice and belief, so that it has been called not only a [[Judaism|religion]], but an [[orthopraxy]].&lt;ref&gt;Biale, David, ''Not in the Heavens: The Tradition of Jewish Secular Thought'', Princeton University Press, 2011, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all individuals or all cultural phenomena can be classified as either "secular" or "religious", a distinction native to [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Biale, David, ''Not in the Heavens: The Tradition of Jewish Secular Thought'', Princeton University Press, 2011, pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish culture in its etymological meaning retains linkage to the Jewish people's [[Land of Israel|land of origin]], the people named for the [[Kingdom of Judah]], study of Jewish [[Torah study|texts]], practice of community [[Tzedakah|charity]], and [[Jewish history]]. The term "secular Jewish culture" therefore refers to many aspects, including: Religion and World View, Literature, Media, and Cinema, Art and Architecture, Cuisine and Traditional Dress, attitudes to Gender, Marriage, and Family, Social Customs and Lifestyles, Music and Dance.&lt;ref&gt;Torstrick, Rebecca L., ''Culture and customs of Israel'', Greenwood Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; "Secular Judaism," is a distinct phenomenon related to Jewish secularization - a historical process of divesting all of these elements of culture from their religious beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Beit-Hallahmi, Benjamin]], "The Secular Israeli (Jewish) Identity: An Impossible Dream?", in Barry Alexander Kosmin, Ariela Keysar, eds., ''Secularism &amp; secularity: contemporary international perspectives'', [[Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture]], [[Trinity College, Hartford]], 2007, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secular Judaism]], derived from the philosophy of [[Moses Mendelssohn]],&lt;ref&gt;Biale, David, ''Not in the Heavens: The Tradition of Jewish Secular Thought'', Princeton University Press, 2011, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  arose out of the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment, which was itself driven by the values of the Enlightenment. In recent years, the academic field of study has encompassed Jewish Studies, History, Literature, Sociology, and Linguistics. Historian David Biale&lt;ref&gt;David Biale is the [[Emanuel Ringelblum]] Professor of Jewish History and the Chair of the Department of History at the [[University of California, Davis]].&lt;/ref&gt; has traced the roots of Jewish secularism back to the pre-modern era. He, and other scholars highlight the Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]], who was dubbed "the renegade Jew who gave us modernity" by scholar and novelist [[Rebecca Goldstein|Rebecca Newberger Goldstein]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebecca Newberger Goldstein]], ''Betraying Spinoza: The renegade Jew who gave us modernity'', Schocken/Nextbook, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in an intellectual biography of him. Today, the subject of Jewish secularization is taught, and researched, at many North American and Israeli universities, including [[Harvard]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[UCLA]], [[Temple University]] and [[City University of New York]] which have significant Jewish alumni. Additionally, many schools include the [[Jewish studies|academic study]] of Judaism and Jewish culture in their curricula.

Throughout history, in eras and places as diverse as the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] world, in Europe before and after the [[Age of Enlightenment]], in [[Al-Andalus]], North Africa and the Middle East, in [[Indian Jews|India]] and [[History of the Jews in China|China]], and in the contemporary United States and [[Israel]], Jewish communities have seen the development of cultural phenomena that are characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious. Some factors in this come from within Judaism, others from the interaction of Jews with host populations in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], and others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community, as opposed to religion itself. This phenomenon has led to considerably different variations of Jewish culture unique to their own communities.

==History==
[[File:Stèles funéraires provenant d'un cimetière juif parisien du XIIIe siècle.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tombstones from a Jewish cemetery, 13th century, Paris]]

There has not been a political unity of Jewish society since the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]]. Since then [[Israelite]] populations were always geographically dispersed (see [[Jewish diaspora]]), so that by the 19th century the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] were mainly in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]]; the [[Sephardi Jews]] were largely spread among various communities in the [[Mediterranean region]]; [[Mizrahi Jews]] were primarily spread throughout [[Western Asia]]; and other populations of Jews were in [[Central Asia]], [[Ethiopia]], the [[Caucasus]], and India. (See [[Jewish ethnic divisions]].)

Although there was a high degree of communication and traffic between these communities — many Sephardic exiles blended into the Ashkenazi communities in Central Europe following the [[Spanish Inquisition]]; many Ashkenazim migrated to the [[Ottoman Empire#Decline and modernization (1828–1908)|Ottoman Empire]], giving rise to the characteristic Syrian-Jewish family name "Ashkenazi"; Iraqi-Jewish traders formed a distinct [[Indian Jews#Baghdadi Jews|Jewish community]] in India; many of these populations were cut off to some degree from the surrounding cultures by [[ghetto]]ization, by [[Muslim]] laws of ''[[Dhimmi|dhimma]]'', and traditional discouragement of contact with [[Idolatry|polytheistic]] populations.

[[Medieval]] Jewish communities in Eastern Europe continued to display distinct cultural traits over the centuries. Despite the universalist leanings of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (and its echo within Judaism in the [[Haskalah]] movement), many [[Yiddish]]-speaking Jews in Eastern Europe continued to see themselves as forming a distinct national group — ''" 'am yehudi"'', from the Biblical Hebrew — but, adapting this idea to Enlightenment values, they assimilated the concept as that of an ethnic group whose identity did not depend on religion, which under Enlightenment thinking fell under a separate category.

[[Constantin Măciucă]] writes of "a differentiated but not isolated Jewish spirit" permeating the culture of Yiddish-speaking Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Măciucă, Constantin, preface to [[Israil Bercovici|Bercovici, Israil]], ''O sută de ani de teatru evriesc în România'' ("One hundred years of Yiddish/Jewish theater in Romania"), 2nd Romanian-language edition, revised and augmented by Constantin Măciucă. Editura Integral (an imprint of Editurile Universala), Bucharest (1998). {{ISBN|973-98272-2-5}}. ''See the [[Israil Bercovici|article on the author]] for further information.''&lt;/ref&gt; This was only intensified as the rise of [[Romanticism]] amplified the sense of [[Nationalism|national identity]] across Europe generally. Thus, for example, members of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were generally non-religious, and one of the historical leaders of the Bund was the child of converts to [[Christianity]], though not a practicing or believing Christian himself.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
[[File:Napoleon stellt den israelitischen Kult wieder her, 30. Mai 1806.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Napoleon grants freedom to the Jews, herald  of Jewish emancipation in Europe]]
The [[Haskalah]] combined with the [[Jewish Emancipation]] movement under way in Central and Western Europe to create an opportunity for Jews to enter secular society. At the same time, [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe provoked a surge of migration, in large part to the United States, where some 2 million Jewish immigrants resettled between 1880 and 1920.
By 1931, shortly before [[The Holocaust]], 92% of the World's Jewish population was Ashkenazi in origin. Secularism originated in Europe as series of movements that militated for a new, heretofore unheard-of concept called "secular Judaism". For these reasons, much of what is thought of by English-speakers and, to a lesser extent, by non-English-speaking Europeans as "secular Jewish culture" is, in essence, the Jewish cultural movement that evolved in Central and Eastern Europe, and subsequently brought to North America by immigrants.
During the 1940s, the Holocaust uprooted and destroyed most of the Jewish communities living in much of Europe. This, in combination with the [[History of the State of Israel|creation of the State of Israel]] and the consequent [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]], resulted in a further geographic shift.
[[File:1900 photo of a Sephardi couple from Sarajevo.png|thumb|200px|Sephardi Jewish couple from Sarajevo in traditional clothing. Photo taken in 1900.]]
Defining secular culture among those who practice traditional Judaism is difficult, because the entire culture is, by definition, entwined with religious traditions: the idea of separate ethnic and religious identity is foreign to the Hebrew tradition of an ''" 'am yisrael"''. (This is particularly true for [[Orthodox Judaism]].) [[Gary Tobin]], head of the [[Institute for Jewish and Community Research]], said of traditional Jewish culture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The dichotomy between religion and culture doesn't really exist. Every religious attribute is filled with culture; every cultural act filled with religiosity. [[Synagogue]]s themselves are great centers of Jewish culture. After all, what is life really about? Food, relationships, enrichment … So is Jewish life. So many of our traditions inherently contain aspects of culture. Look at the [[Passover Seder]] — it's essentially great theater. Jewish education and religiosity bereft of culture is not as interesting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/About_Jewish_Culture/JewishCulturalIdentity.htm The Emergence of a Jewish Cultural Identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028095634/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/About_Jewish_Culture/JewishCulturalIdentity.htm |date=2005-10-28 }}, undated (2002 or later) on MyJewishLearning.com, reprinted from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today very many [[Secularity (non-religiosity)|secular]] Jews take part in Jewish cultural activities, such as celebrating Jewish holidays as historical and nature festivals, imbued with new content and form, or marking life-cycle events such as birth, bar/bat mitzvah, marriage, and mourning in a secular fashion. They come together to study topics pertaining to Jewish culture and its relation to other cultures, in ''havurot'', cultural associations, and secular synagogues, and they participate in public and political action coordinated by secular Jewish movements, such as the former movement to free Soviet Jews, and movements to combat pogroms, discrimination, and religious coercion. Jewish secular [[humanism|humanistic]] education inculcates universal moral values through classic Jewish and world literature and through organizations for social change that aspire to ideals of justice and charity.&lt;ref name="Malkin, Y p. 107"&gt;Malkin, Y. "Humanistic and secular Judaisms." ''Modern Judaism An Oxford Guide'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In North America, the secular and cultural Jewish movements are divided into three umbrella organizations: the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] (SHJ), the [[Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations]] (CSJO), and [[Workmen's Circle]].

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Jewish Philosophy}}
{{See also|List of Jewish philosophers}}
[[File:Guide for the Perplexed by Maimonides.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|[[The Guide for the Perplexed]], [[Maimonides]] (circa 1190)]]
Jewish philosophy includes all philosophy carried out by Jews, or in relation to the religion of Judaism. The Jewish philosophy is  extended over several main eras in [[Jewish history]], including the ancient and biblical era, medieval era and modern era (see [[Haskalah]]).
The ancient Jewish philosophy is expressed in the bible. According to Prof. Israel Efros the principles of the Jewish philosophy start in the [[bible]], where the foundations of the Jewish monotheistic beliefs can be found, such as the belief in [[Monotheism|one god]], the separation of god and the world and nature (as opposed to [[Pantheism]]) and the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation of the world]]. Other biblical writings that associated with philosophy are [[Psalms]] that contains invitations to admire the wisdom of God through his works; from this, some scholars suggest, Judaism harbors a Philosophical under-current&lt;ref&gt;"Medieval Philosophy and the Classical Tradition: In Islam, Judaism and Christianity" by John Inglis, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ecclesiastes]] that is often considered to be the only genuine philosophical work in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; its author seeks to understand the place of human beings in the world and life's meaning.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to Philosophy" by Dr Tom Kerns&lt;/ref&gt; Other writings related to philosophy can be found in the [[Deuterocanonical books]] such as [[Sirach]] and [[Book of Wisdom]].
During the [[Hellenistic era]], [[Hellenistic Judaism]] aspired to combine Jewish religious tradition with elements of Greek culture and philosophy. The philosopher [[Philo]] used philosophical allegory to attempt to fuse and harmonize [[Greek philosophy]] with Jewish philosophy. His work attempts to combine Plato and Moses into one philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Edward | last=Moore | date=June 28, 2005 | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/midplato/#SH6a | title=Middle Platonism - Philo of Alexandria | accessdate=December 20, 2012 | work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | issn=2161-0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an allegoric approach of interpreting holy scriptures (the bible), in contrast to (old-fashioned) literally interpretation approaches. His allegorical [[exegesis]] was important for several Christian [[Church Fathers]] and some scholars hold that his concept of the [[Logos]] as God's creative principle influenced early [[Christology]]. Other scholars, however, deny direct influence but say both Philo and [[Early Christianity]] borrow from a common source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Keener | first= Craig S | title=The Gospel of John: A Commentary | location=Peabody, Mass. | publisher=Hendrickson | year=2003 | volume=1 | pages=343–347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Spinoza Ethica.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|The opening page of Spinoza's magnum opus, ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'']]
Between the [[Ancient era]] and the [[Middle Ages]] most of the Jewish philosophy concentrated around the [[Rabbinic literature]] that is expressed in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]. In the 9th century [[Saadia Gaon]] wrote the text [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] which is the first systematic presentation and philosophic foundation of the [[dogmas]] of Judaism. The [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]] included many influential Jewish philosophers such as [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Yehuda Halevi]], [[Isaac Abravanel]], [[Nahmanides]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], [[Nissim of Gerona]], [[Bahya ibn Paquda]], [[Abraham bar Hiyya]], [[Joseph ibn Tzaddik]], [[Hasdai Crescas]] and [[Isaac ben Moses Arama]]. The Most notable is [[Maimonides]] who is considered, beside the Jewish world, as a prominent philosopher and polymath in the Islamic and Western worlds. Outside of Spain, other philosophers are [[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]], [[Elia del Medigo]], [[Jedaiah ben Abraham Bedersi]] and [[Gersonides]].

Philosophy by Jews in [[Modern era]] was expressed by philosophers, mainly in Europe, such as [[Baruch Spinoza]] founder of [[Spinozism]], whose work included modern [[Rationalism]] and [[Biblical criticism]] and laying the groundwork for the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=tws9907&gt;{{cite news |title=The Spinoza Problem |first=Irvin |last=Yalom |work=The Washington Post |date=21 February 2012 |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-02-21/entertainment/35442915_1_history-teacher-novel-theories |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112073417/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-02-21/entertainment/35442915_1_history-teacher-novel-theories |archivedate=12 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work has earned him recognition as one of [[Western philosophy]]'s most important thinkers; Others are [[Isaac Orobio de Castro]], [[Tzvi Ashkenazi]], [[David Nieto]], [[Isaac Cardoso]], [[Jacob Abendana]], [[Uriel da Costa]], [[Francisco Sanches]] and [[Moses Almosnino]].

He has been referred to as the father of Reform Judaism, though Reform spokesmen have been "resistant to claim him as their spiritual father".&lt;ref&gt;Wein (1997), p. 44.

The Jewish Enlightenment philosophy included [[Menachem Mendel Lefin]], [[Salomon Maimon]] and [[Isaac Satanow]]. The next [[century|19th century]] comprised both secular and religious philosophy and included philosophers such as [[Elijah Benamozegh]], [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Moses Hess]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], [[Samuel Hirsch]], [[Nachman Krochmal]], [[Samuel David Luzzatto]], [[Nachman of Breslov]] founder of [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]] and [[Karl Marx]] founder of [[Marxist]] worldview.

==Education and politics==
{{Main|Jewish education}}
{{See also|Jewish political movements|List of Jews in politics}}
A range of moral and political views is evident early in the history of Judaism, that serves to partially explain the diversity that is apparent among secular Jews who are often influenced by moral beliefs that can be found in Jewish scripture, and traditions. In recent centuries, secular Jews in Europe and the Americas have tended towards the liberal [[left-wing politics|political left]]{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}, and played key roles in the birth of the 19th century's [[labor movement]] and [[socialism]]. While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the [[conservatism|conservative]] side of the political spectrum, even politically conservative Jews have tended to support [[Jewish views of religious pluralism|pluralism]] more consistently than many other elements of the [[right-wing politics|political right]]. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Elazar, [http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/jud-democ.htm Judaism and Democracy: The Reality]. Undated. Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. Accessed 11 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; attribute this to the fact that Jews are not expected to [[Missionary#Jewish missions|proselytize]], derived from [[Halakha]]. This lack of a universalizing religion is combined with the fact that most Jews live as minorities in diaspora countries, and that no central Jewish religious authority has existed since [[Sanhedrin#Dissolution|363 CE]].

==Economic activity==
[[File:Portrait of David Ricardo by Thomas Phillips.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|[[David Ricardo]] (1772–1823). He was one of the most influential of the [[classical economics|classical economists]]&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas (2006). ''On classical economics''. New Haven, CT: [[Yale University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policonomics.com/david-ricardo/|title=David Ricardo - Policonomics|website=www.policonomics.com|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], European laws prevented Jews from owning land and gave them powerful incentive to go into other professions that the indigenous Europeans were not willing to follow.&lt;ref&gt;The section on banking is drawn largely from the article [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=58&amp;letter=U "Usury"] in the [[public domain]] ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' (1901–1906).&lt;/ref&gt; During the medieval period, there was a very strong social stigma against lending money and charging interest among the Christian majority. In most of Europe until the late 18th century, and in some places to an even later date, Jews were prohibited by [[Roman Catholic]] governments (and others) from owning land. On the other hand, the Church, because of a number of Bible verses (e.g., [[Leviticus]] 25:36) forbidding [[usury]], declared that charging any [[interest]] was against the divine law, and this prevented any mercantile use of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] by pious Christians. As the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] did not apply to Jews, they were not liable to the ecclesiastical punishments which were placed upon [[usury|usurers]] by the [[pope]]s. Christian rulers gradually saw the advantage of having a class of men like the Jews who could supply capital for their use without being liable to [[excommunication]], and so the money trade of western Europe by this means fell into the hands of the Jews.

However, in almost every instance where large amounts were acquired by Jews through banking transactions the property thus acquired fell either during their life or upon their death into the hands of the king. This happened to [[Aaron of Lincoln]] in England, [[Ezmel de Ablitas]] in [[Navarre]], [[Heliot de Vesoul]] in [[Provence]], [[Benveniste de Porta]] in [[Aragon]], etc. It was often for this reason that kings supported the Jews, and even objected to them becoming Christians (because in that case they could not be forced to give up money won by usury). Thus, both in England and in France the kings demanded to be compensated for every Jew converted. This type of royal trickery was one factor in creating the stereotypical Jewish role of banker and/or merchant.

As a modern system of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] began to develop, loans became necessary for commerce and industry. Jews were able to gain a foothold in the new field of finance by providing these services: as non-Catholics, they were not bound by the ecclesiastical prohibition against "usury"; and in terms of Judaism itself, [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] had long ago re-interpreted the Torah's ban on charging interest, allowing interest when it's needed to make a living.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The strong Jewish tradition of religious scholarship often left Jews well prepared for secular scholarship. In some times and places, this was countered by banning Jews from studying at [[university|universities]], or admitted them only in limited numbers (see [[Jewish quota]]). Over the centuries, Jews have been poorly represented among land-holding classes, but far better represented in academia, professions, finance, commerce and many scientific fields. The strong representation of Jews in science and academia is evidenced by the fact that 193 persons known to be Jews or of Jewish ancestry have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize]], accounting for 22% of all individual recipients worldwide between 1901 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/nobels.html|title=Jewish Nobel Prize Laureates|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of whom, 26% in [[physics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Nobels_Physics.html|title=Jewish Nobel Prize Winners in Physics|first=|last=JINFO|website=www.jinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 22% in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Nobels_Chemistry.html|title=Jewish Nobel Prize Winners in Chemistry|first=|last=JINFO|website=www.jinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 27% in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Nobels_Medicine.html|title=Jewish Nobel Prize Winners in Medicine|first=|last=JINFO|website=www.jinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fields of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], 31% of [[Turing Award]] recipients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Computer_ACM_Turing.html|title=Jewish Recipients of the ACM Turing Award|first=|last=JINFO|website=www.jinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 27% of [[Fields Medal|Fields Medal in mathematics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Fields_Mathematics.html|title=Jewish Recipients of the Fields Medal|first=|last=JINFO|website=www.jinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; were or are Jewish.

The early Jewish activity in science can be found in the [[Hebrew bible]] where some of the books contain descriptions of the [[physical world]]. [[Biblical cosmology]] provides sporadic glimpses that may be stitched together to form a Biblical impression of the physical universe. There have been comparisons between the Bible, with passages such as from the [[Genesis creation narrative]], and the astronomy of classical antiquity more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, J. H., and T. D. Simonton. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNk0AAAAMAAJ The Bible and Astronomy; An Exposition of the Biblical Cosmology, and Its Relations to Natural Science]. Philadelphia: Lindsay &amp; Blakiston, 1857.&lt;/ref&gt; The Old Testament also contains various cleansing rituals. One suggested ritual, for example, deals with the proper procedure for cleansing a [[Tzaraath|leper]] ({{bibleverse|Leviticus|14:1-32|NASB}}). It is a fairly elaborate process, which is to be performed after a leper was already healed of leprosy ({{bibleverse|Leviticus|14:3|NASB}}), involving extensive cleansing and personal hygiene, but also includes sacrificing a bird and lambs with the addition of using their blood to symbolize that the afflicted has been cleansed.

The [[Torah]] proscribes [[Intercropping]] (Lev. 19:19, Deut 22:9), a practice often associated with sustainable agriculture and organic farming in modern [[agricultural science]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, D.J., A.H.

[[Albert Einstein]] was a German-born theoretical physicist and is considered as one of the most prominent scientists in history, often regarded as the "father of modern physics". His revolutionary work on the [[relativity theory]] transformed theoretical [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] during the 20th century.

==Literature and poetry==
{{Main|Jewish literature|Hebrew poetry (disambiguation){{!}}Jewish poetry}}
{{See also|Yiddish literature|Ladino language#History|Hebrew literature|Jewish American literature|List of Jews in literature and journalism}}
In some places where there have been relatively high concentrations of Jews, distinct secular Jewish subcultures have arisen. For example, ethnic Jews formed an enormous proportion of the literary and artistic life of [[Vienna]], Austria at the end of the 19th century, or of New York City 50 years later (and Los Angeles in the mid-late 20th century). Many of these creative Jews were not particularly religious people. In general, Jewish artistic culture in various periods reflected the culture in which they lived.
[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|270px|thumbnail|[[Gutenberg Bible]]. The [[Bible]] was [[Authorship of the Bible|authored]] by Jews during the [[Iron Age]]s and the [[Classical era]]. It comprise cultural values, basic human values, mythology and religious beliefs of both Judaism and Christianity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature|title=biblical literature|website=britannica.com|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Literary and theatrical expressions of secular Jewish culture may be in specifically Jewish languages such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] or [[Ladino language|Ladino]], or it may be in the language of the surrounding cultures, such as English or [[German language|German]]. Secular literature and theater in Yiddish largely began in the 19th century and was in decline by the middle of the 20th century. The revival of Hebrew beyond its use in the liturgy is largely an early 20th-century phenomenon, and is closely associated with [[Zionism]]. Apart from the use of Hebrew in Israel, whether a Jewish community will speak a Jewish or non-Jewish language as its main vehicle of [[discourse]] is generally dependent on how isolated or assimilated that community is. For example, the Jews in the [[shtetls]] of Poland and the [[Lower East Side]] of [[New York City|New York]] during the early 20th century spoke [[Yiddish]] at most times, while assimilated Jews in 19th and early 20th-century Germany spoke German, and American-born Jews in the United States speak English.

Jewish authors have both created a unique [[Jewish literature]] and contributed to the national literature of many of the countries in which they live. Though not strictly secular, the Yiddish works of authors like [[Sholem Aleichem]] (whose collected works amounted to 28 volumes) and [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] (winner of the 1978 Nobel Prize), form their own canon, focusing on the Jewish experience in both Eastern Europe, and in America. In the United States, Jewish writers like [[Philip Roth]], [[Saul Bellow]], and many others are considered among the greatest American authors, and incorporate a distinctly secular Jewish view into many of their works. The poetry of [[Allen Ginsberg]] often touches on Jewish themes (notably the early autobiographical works such as ''[[Howl]]'' and ''[[Kaddish (poem)|Kaddish]]''). Other famous Jewish authors that made contributions to world literature include [[Heinrich Heine]], German poet, [[Mordecai Richler]], Canadian author, [[Isaac Babel]], Russian author, [[Franz Kafka]], of Prague, and [[Harry Mulisch]], whose novel ''[[The Discovery of Heaven]]'' was revealed by a 2007 poll as the "Best Dutch Book Ever".&lt;ref name="Gulf Daily News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=290610|title=Leading Dutch writer Mulisch dies|date=1 November 2010|work=[[Gulf Daily News]]|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Secular Jewish culture embraces literary works that have stood the test of time as sources of aesthetic pleasure and ideas shared by Jews and non-Jews, works that live on beyond the immediate socio-cultural context within which they were created.

[[Hebrew poetry (disambiguation)|Hebrew poetry]] is expressed by various of poets in different eras of Jewish history. [[Biblical poetry]] is related to the poetry in biblical times as it expressed in the [[Hebrew bible]] and Jewish sacred texts. In medieval times the Jewish poetry was mainly expressed by [[piyyut]]im and several poets such as [[Yehuda Halevi]], [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] and [[Dunash ben Labrat]]. [[Modern Hebrew poetry]] is mostly related to the era of and after the [[revival of the Hebrew language]], pioneered by [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in the [[Haskalah]] era and succeeded by poets such as [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]], [[Nathan Alterman]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]].

==Theatre==
===Yiddish theatre===
{{Main|Yiddish theatre}}
[[File:HANA ROVINA THE DYBBUK 1920.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|[[Hana Rovina]] in [[The Dybbuk]] (1920), a play by [[S. Ansky]]]]
The [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Jew [[Abraham Goldfaden]] founded the first professional [[Yiddish language|Yiddish-language]] theatre troupe in [[Iași]], [[Romania]] in 1876. The next year, his troupe achieved enormous success in 
[[Bucharest]]. Within a decade, Goldfaden and others brought Yiddish theater to Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Germany, New York City, and other cities with significant [[Ashkenazi]]c populations. Between 1890 and 1940, over a dozen Yiddish theatre groups existed in New York City alone, in the [[Yiddish Theater District]], performing original [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[musical theatre|musicals]], and Yiddish translations of theatrical works and [[opera]]. Perhaps the most famous of Yiddish-language plays is ''[[The Dybbuk]]'' (1919) by [[Shloime Ansky|S. Ansky]].

Yiddish theater in New York in the early 20th century rivalled English-language theater in quantity and often surpassed it in quality. A 1925 ''[[New York Times]]'' article remarks, "…Yiddish theater… is now a stable American institution and no longer dependent on immigration from Eastern Europe. People who can neither speak nor write Yiddish attend Yiddish stage performances and pay [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] prices on [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]]." This article also mentions other aspects of a New York Jewish cultural life "in full flower" at that time, among them the fact that the extensive New York Yiddish-language press of the time included seven daily newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Melamed, S.M., "The Yiddish Stage", ''New York Times'', September 27, 1925 (X2).&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, however, the next generation of American Jews spoke mainly English to the exclusion of Yiddish; they brought the artistic energy of Yiddish theater into the American theatrical mainstream, but usually in a less specifically Jewish form.

Yiddish theater, most notably [[Moscow State Jewish Theater]] directed by [[Solomon Mikhoels]], also played a prominent role in the arts scene of the Soviet Union until Stalin's 1948 reversal in government policy toward the Jews. (See [[Rootless cosmopolitan]], [[Night of the Murdered Poets]].)

Montreal's [[Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre]] continues to thrive after 50 years of performance.

===European theatre===
[[File:Sarah Bernhardt, par Nadar, 1864.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|[[Sarah Bernhardt]], 1864]]
From their [[Jewish Emancipation|Emancipation]] to World War II, Jews were very active and sometimes even dominant in certain forms of European theatre, and after the [[Holocaust]] many Jews continued to that cultural form. For example, in pre-Nazi Germany, where [[Nietzsche]] asked "What good actor of today is not Jewish?", acting, directing and writing positions were often filled by Jews. Both MacDonald and Jewish Tribal Review would generally be counted as anti-Semitic sources, but reasonably careful in their factual claims. "In Imperial Berlin, Jewish artists could be found in the forefront of the performing arts, from high drama to more popular forms like [[cabaret]] and [[revue]], and eventually film. Jewish audiences patronized innovative theater, regardless of whether they approved of what they saw."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/content/exhibitions/special/berlin/berlin_cabaret.html Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890–1918] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105030050/http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/content/exhibitions/special/berlin/berlin_cabaret.html |date=2005-11-05 }}, on the site of The Jewish Museum, New York. Accessed 12 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], commenting on Jewish contributions to European culture at the [[Fin de siècle]], writes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The area where Jewish influence was strongest was the theatre, especially in Berlin. Playwrights like [[Carl Sternheim]], [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Erwin Piscator]], [[Walter Hasenclever]], [[Ferenc Molnár]] and [[Carl Zuckmayer]], and influential producers like [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]], appeared at times to dominate the stage, which tended to be modishly [[left-wing]], [[Republicanism|pro-republican]], experimental and sexually daring. But it was certainly not revolutionary, and it was cosmopolitan rather than Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul (1987). ''A History of the Jews'', pg. 479. New York: Harper Perennial. – Erwin Piscator was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Protestant]] ([[Nazi Party|Nazi]] propagandists had claimed since 1927 that he was a “Jewish Bolshevik”, though).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Jews also made similar, if not as massive, contributions to theatre and drama in Austria, Britain, France, and Russia (in the national languages of those countries). Jews in Vienna, Paris and German cities found [[cabaret]] both a popular and effective means of expression, as German cabaret in the [[Weimar Republic]] "was mostly a Jewish art form".&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Weiss, [http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/4555/format/html/displaystory.html Jewish cabaret singer brings songs of Berlin to Berkeley], ''The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California'', September 27, 1996. Accessed 12 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The involvement of Jews in Central European theatre was halted during the rise of the Nazis and the purging of Jews from cultural posts, though many emigrated to [[Western Europe]] or the United States and continued working there.

In the early 20th century the traditions of New York's vibrant Yiddish Theatre District both rivaled and fed into Broadway. In the English-speaking theatre Jewish émigrés brought novel theatrical ideas from Europe, such as the [[theatrical realism|theatrical realist]] movement and the [[Stanislavski's system|philosophy]] of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]], whose teachings would influence many Jewish-American acting teachers such as the Yiddish theatre-trained acting theorist [[Stella Adler]]. Jewish immigrants were instrumental in the creation and development of the [[genre]] of [[musical theatre]] and earlier forms of theatrical entertainment in America, and would innovate the new, distinctly American, art form, the Broadway musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/broadway-celebrates-100-years-of-national-yiddish-theatre-tonight-356008|title=Broadway Celebrates 100 Years of National Yiddish Theatre Tonight - Playbill|website=Playbill|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Brandeis University]] Professor Stephen J.

&lt;blockquote&gt;…the Jewish experience has always been best expressed by music, and Broadway has always been an integral part of the Jewish-American experience… The difference is that one can expand the definition of "Jewish Broadway" to include an interdisciplinary roadway with a wide range of artistic activities packed onto one avenue--theatre, opera, symphony, ballet, publishing companies, choirs, synagogues and more.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries the European [[operetta]], a precursor the musical, often featured the work of Jewish composers such as [[Paul Abraham (composer)|Paul Abraham]], [[List of operettas|Leo Ascher]], [[List of Austrian Jews#Composers|Edmund Eysler]], [[List of Austrian Jews#Musicians|Leo Fall]], [[List of operettas#Bruno Granichstaedten|Bruno Granichstaedten]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Emmerich Kalman]], [[Sigmund Romberg]], [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]] and [[Rudolf Friml]]; the latter four eventually moved to the United States and produced their works on the New York stage. One of the [[libretto|librettists]] for [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' (not an operetta proper but rather a work of the earlier [[Opéra comique]] form) was the Jewish [[Ludovic Halévy]], niece of composer [[Fromental Halévy]] (Bizet himself was not Jewish but he married the elder Halevy's daughter, many have suspected that he was the descendant of Jewish converts to Christianity, and others have noticed Jewish-sounding intervals in his music).&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Mostel, [http://www.forward.com/main/article.php?ref=mostel200405051021 Carmen Comes Home], ''[[The Forward]]'', May 7, 2004.

By 1910 Jews (the vast majority of them immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]]) already composed a quarter of the population of New York City, and almost immediately Jewish artists and intellectuals began to show their influence on the cultural life of that city, and through time, the country as a whole. Likewise, while the modern musical can best be described as a fusion of operetta, earlier American entertainment and [[African-American]] culture and music, as well as Jewish culture and music, the actual authors of the first "book musicals" were the Jewish [[Jerome Kern]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Morrie Ryskind]]. From that time until the 1980s a vast majority of successful musical theatre composers, lyricists, and book-writers were Jewish (a notable exception is the Protestant [[Cole Porter]], who acknowledged that the reason he was so successful on Broadway was that he wrote what he called "Jewish music").&lt;ref&gt;Michael Billig, [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/Music/AmericanJewishMusicTO/ShowTunes.htm Creating the American Musical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050928231838/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/Music/AmericanJewishMusicTO/ShowTunes.htm |date=2005-09-28 }}.

One explanation of the affinity of Jewish composers and playwrights to the musical is that "traditional [[Jewish music|Jewish religious music]] was most often led by a single singer, a [[Hazzan|cantor]] while [[Christianity|Christians]] emphasize choral singing."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Baron, [http://www.machar.org/bm_jbaron.html Jewish Composers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228123724/http://www.machar.org/bm_jbaron.html |date=2004-12-28 }}, ''Machar, The Washington Congregation for Secular Humanistic Judaism'', June 2, 2005.

Many of these writers used the musical to explore issues relating to [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], the acceptance of the outsider in society, the racial situation in the United States, the overcoming of obstacles through perseverance, and other topics pertinent to Jewish Americans and Western Jews in general, often using subtle and disguised stories to get this point across.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Gomberg, [http://www.talkinbroadway.com/rialto/past/2004/02_16_04.html ''op. cit.'']&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Kern, Rodgers, Hammerstein, the Gershwins, [[Harold Arlen]] and [[Yip Harburg]] wrote musicals and operas aiming to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urging racial harmony; these works included ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' and ''[[The King and I]]''. Towards the end of Golden Age, writers also began to openly and overtly tackle Jewish subjects and issues, such as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' and ''[[Rags (musical)|Rags]]''; Bart's ''[[Blitz!]]'' also tackles relations between Jews and Gentiles. [[Jason Robert Brown]] and [[Alfred Uhry]]'s ''[[Parade (musical)|Parade]]'' is a sensitive exploration of both [[anti-Semitism]] and historical American [[racism]]. The original concept that became ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' was set in the [[Lower East Side]] during Easter-Passover celebrations; the rival gangs were to be Jewish and [[Italian-American|Italian]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Laurents, [http://www.leonardbernstein.com/studio/element.asp?FeatID=8&amp;AssetID=18 Theater: West Side Story; The Growth of an Idea], ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', August 4, 1957.

Jewish playwrights have also contributed to non-musical drama and theatre, both Broadway and regional. [[Edna Ferber]], [[Moss Hart]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Arthur Miller]] and [[Neil Simon]] are only some of the prominent Jewish playwrights in American theatrical history. Approximately 34% of the plays and musicals that have won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] were written and composed by Jewish Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinfo.org/Pulitzer_Drama.html|title=Jewish Recipients of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama|first=|last=JINFO|website=www.jinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebrew and Israeli theatre===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 14066 Habimaquot; Theatre.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right|[[Habima]] theater, 2011]]
The earliest known [[Hebrew language]] drama was written around 1550 by a [[History of the Jews in Italy|Jewish-Italian]] writer from [[Mantua]].&lt;ref&gt;Shimon Levy, [http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=199 The Development of Israeli Theatre– a brief overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050816061641/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=199 |date=2005-08-16 }}. Credited to Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jerusalem, 2000. Accessed 12 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A few works were written by [[rabbis]] and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] in 17th-century [[Amsterdam]], where Jews were relatively free from persecution and had both flourishing religious and secular Jewish cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=467&amp;letter=D Jewishencyclopedia.com], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. ''Could not access 12 February 2006.''&lt;/ref&gt; All of these early Hebrew plays were about Biblical or mystical subjects, often in the form of [[Talmud]]ic [[parable]]s. During the post-Emancipation period in 19th-century Europe, many Jews translated great [[History of theatre#Western theatre history|European plays]] such as those by [[Shakespeare]], [[Molière]] and [[Schiller]], giving the characters Jewish names and transplanting the plot and setting to within a Jewish context.

Modern Hebrew theatre and drama, however, began with the development of [[Hebrew language#Modern Hebrew|Modern Hebrew]] in Europe (the first Hebrew theatrical ''professional performance'' was in Moscow in 1918)&lt;ref&gt;Shimon Levy, [http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=199 ''op. cit.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050816061641/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=199 |date=2005-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was "closely linked with the Jewish national renaissance movement of the twentieth century. The historical awareness and the sense of primacy which accompanied the Hebrew theatre in its early years dictated the course of its artistic and aesthetic development".&lt;ref&gt;Orna Ben-Meir, [http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/publications/ASSAPHTH11/BEN-MEIR.html Biblical Thematics in Stage Design for the Hebrew Theatre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050415082533/http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/publications/ASSAPHTH11/BEN-MEIR.html |date=2005-04-15 }}, ''Assaph'', Section C, no. 11 (July 1999), p. 141 ''et. seq.''. Accessed 12 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These traditions were soon transplanted to [[Culture of Israel#Film and theatre|Israel]]. Playwrights such as [[Natan Alterman]], [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]], [[Leah Goldberg]], [[Ephraim Kishon]], [[Hanoch Levin]], [[Aharon Megged]], [[Moshe Shamir]], [[Avraham Shlonsky]], [[Yehoshua Sobol]] and [[A. B. Yehoshua]] have written Hebrew-language plays. Themes that are obviously common in these works are the [[Shoah|Holocaust]], the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], the meaning of Jewishness, and contemporary secular-religious tensions within Jewish Israel. The most well-known Hebrew theatre company and Israel's national theatre is the [[Habima Theater|Habima]] (meaning "the stage" in Hebrew), which was formed in 1913 in [[Lithuania]], and re-established in 1917 in Russia; another prominent Israeli theatre company is the [[Cameri Theater|Cameri Theatre]], which is "Israel's first and leading repertory theatre".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/hebrewtheatre/history.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:49:21 History of Israeli Theatre], on a [[Geocities]] site, credits [http://www.habima.org.il habima.org.il] and [http://www.cameri.co.il cameri.co.il].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==
{{see also|Cinema of Israel|List of Jewish film directors}}
In the era when Yiddish theatre was still a major force in the world of theatre, over 100 films were made in Yiddish. Many are now lost. Prominent films included ''[[Shulamith (1931 film)|Shulamith]]'' (1931), the first Yiddish musical on film ''[[His Wife's Lover]]'' (1931), ''[[A Daughter of Her People]]'' (1932), the anti-Nazi film ''[[Wandering Jew|The Wandering Jew]]'' (1933), ''The [[Yiddish King Lear (film)|Yiddish King Lear]]'' (1934), ''[[Shir Hashirim (film)|Shir Hashirim]]'' (1935), the biggest Yiddish film hit of all time ''[[Yidl Mitn Fidl]]'' (1936), ''[[Where Is My Child?]]'' (1937), ''[[Green Fields]]'' (1937), ''[[The Dybbuk (play)|Dybuk]]'' (1937), ''[[The Singing Blacksmith]]'' (1938), ''[[Tevya (film)|Tevya]]'' (1939), ''[[Mirele Efros]]'' (1939), ''[[Lang ist der Weg]]'' (1948), and ''[[God, Man and Devil]]'' (1950).

The roster of Jewish entrepreneurs in the English-language American film industry is legendary: [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], [[the Warner Brothers]], [[David O. Selznick]], [[Marcus Loew]], and [[Adolph Zukor]], [[William Fox (producer)|Fox]] to name just a few, and continuing into recent times with such industry giants as super-agent [[Michael Ovitz]], [[Michael Eisner]], [[Lew Wasserman]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Steven Spielberg]], and [[David Geffen]]. However, few of these brought a specifically Jewish sensibility either to the art of film or, with the sometime exception of Spielberg, to their choice of subject matter. The historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] described the situation as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Interesting Times : A Twentieth-Century Life
|last=Hobsbawm|first= E. J.|publisher= Knopf Publishing Group|year=2003|isbn= 9780375422348|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It would be ... pointless to look for consciously Jewish elements in the songs of Irving Berlin or the Hollywood movies of the era of the great studios, all of which were run by immigrant Jews: their object, in which they succeeded, was precisely to make songs or films which found a specific expression for 100 per cent Americanness.}}

A more specifically Jewish sensibility can be seen in the films of the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Mel Brooks]], or [[Woody Allen]]; other examples of specifically Jewish films from the Hollywood film industry are the [[Barbra Streisand]] vehicle ''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]'' (1983), or [[John Frankenheimer]]'s ''[[The Fixer (1968 film)|The Fixer]]'' (1968).

==Radio and television==
The first radio chains, the [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]] and the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]], were created by the [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] [[David Sarnoff]] and [[William S. Paley]], respectively. These Jewish innovators were also among the first producers of televisions, both black-and-white and [[color television|color]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''op. cit.' p. 462-463.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Jewish immigrant communities of America there was also a thriving [[Yiddish language]] radio, with its "golden age" from the 1930s to the 1950s.

Although there is little specifically Jewish television in the United States ([[National Jewish Television]], largely religious, broadcasts only three hours a week), Jews have been involved in American television from its earliest days. From [[Sid Caesar]] and [[Milton Berle]] to [[Joan Rivers]], [[Gilda Radner]], and [[Andy Kaufman]] to [[Billy Crystal]] to [[Jerry Seinfeld]], Jewish stand-up comedians have been icons of American television. Other Jews that held a prominent role in early radio and television were [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Al Jolson]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Walter Winchell]] and [[David Susskind]]. More figures are [[Larry King]], [[Michael Savage]] and [[Howard Stern]]. In the analysis of Paul Johnson, "The Broadway musical, radio and TV were all examples of a fundamental principle in [[Jewish diaspora]] history: Jews opening up a completely new field in business and culture, a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' on which to set their mark, before other interests had a chance to take possession, erect [[guild]] or [[professional]] fortifications and deny them entry."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''op. cit.'' p. 462-463.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first televised [[situation comedy|situation comedies]], ''[[The Goldbergs (broadcast series)|The Goldbergs]]'' was set in a specifically Jewish milieu in [[the Bronx]]. While the overt Jewish milieu of ''The Goldbergs'' was unusual for an American television series, there were a few other examples, such as ''[[Brooklyn Bridge (TV series)|Brooklyn Bridge]]'' (1991–1993) and [[Bridget Loves Bernie]]. Jews have also played an enormous role among the creators and writers of television comedies: [[Woody Allen]], [[Mel Brooks]], [[Selma Diamond]], [[Larry Gelbart]], [[Carl Reiner]], and [[Neil Simon]] all wrote for Sid Caesar; Reiner's son [[Rob Reiner]] worked with [[Norman Lear]] on ''[[All in the Family]]'' (which often engaged [[anti-semitism]] and other issues of [[prejudice]]); [[Larry David]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]] created the hit sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', [[Lorne Michaels]], [[Al Franken]], [[Rosie Shuster]], and [[Alan Zweibel]] of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' breathed new life into the [[variety show]] in the 1970s.

More recently, American Jews have been instrumental to "novelistic" television series such as ''[[The Wire]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]''. Variously acclaimed as one of the greatest television series of all time, ''The Wire'' was created by [[David Simon]]. Simon also served as executive producer, head writer, and [[show runner]]. [[Matthew Weiner]] produced the fifth and sixth seasons of ''The Sopranos'' and later created ''[[Mad Men]]''.
More remarkable contributors are [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], creators of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' TV series; [[Ron Leavitt]] co-creator of ''[[Married... with Children]]''; [[Damon Lindelof]] and [[J. J. Abrams]], co-creators of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''; [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]] and [[Marta Kauffman]], creators of ''[[Friends]]''; [[Tim Kring]] creator of ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''; [[Sydney Newman]] co-creator of ''[[Doctor Who]]''; [[Darren Star]], creator ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[Melrose Place]]''; [[Aaron Spelling]] co-creator of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]''; [[Chuck Lorre]], co-creator of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''; [[Gideon Raff]], creator of ''[[Prisoners of War (TV series)|Prisoners of War]]'' which ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'' is based on; [[Aaron Ruben]] and [[Sheldon Leonard]] co-creators of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''; [[Don Hewitt]] creator of ''[[60 Minutes]]''; [[Garry Shandling]], co-creator of ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''; [[Ed. Weinberger]], co-creator of ''[[The Cosby Show]]''; [[David Milch]], creator of ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]''; [[Steven Levitan]], co-creator of ''[[Modern Family]]''; [[Dick Wolf]], creator of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''; [[David Shore]], creator ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''; [[Max Mutchnick]] and [[David Kohan]] creators of ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. There is also a significant role of Jews in acting by actors such as [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[William Shatner]], [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[Zac Efron]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[David Duchovny]], [[Fred Savage]], [[Zach Braff]], [[Noah Wyle]], [[Adam Brody]], [[Katey Sagal]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Alyson Hannigan]], [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], [[David Schwimmer]], [[Lisa Kudrow]] and [[Mayim Bialik]].

==Music==
{{Main|Jewish music}}
{{see also|Secular Jewish music}}
Jewish musical contributions also tend to reflect the cultures of the countries in which Jews live, the most notable examples being [[European classical music|classical]] and [[popular music]] in the United States and Europe. Some music, however, is unique to particular Jewish communities, such as [[Music of Israel|Israeli music]], [[Israeli folk|Israeli Folk music]], [[Klezmer]], [[Sephardic music|Sephardic and Ladino music]], and [[Mizrahi music]].

===Classical music===
[[File:Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.jpg|210px|thumbnail|right|The [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]]'s 70th Anniversary]]
Before [[Jewish Emancipation|Emancipation]], virtually all Jewish music in Europe was [[Jewish music|sacred music]], with the exception of the performances of [[klezmer|klezmorim]] during weddings and other occasions. The result was a lack of a Jewish presence in [[European classical music]] until the [[19th century]], with a very few exceptions, normally enabled by specific aristocratic protection, such as [[Salamone Rossi]] and [[Claude Daquin]] (the work of the former is considered the beginning of "Jewish art music").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jmi.org.uk/westernclassicalmusic/|title=JEWISH MUSIC INSTITUTE - Western Classical Music|website=www.jmi.org.uk|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Jews were admitted to mainstream society in [[England]] (gradually after their return in the [[17th century]]), [[France in the nineteenth century|France]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[German Empire]], and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russia]] (in that order), the Jewish contribution to the European music scene steadily increased, but in the form of mainstream European music, not specifically Jewish music. Notable examples of Jewish Romantic composers (by country) are [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], [[Paul Dukas]] and [[Fromental Halevy]] from France, [[Josef Dessauer]], [[Karl Goldmark]] and  [[Gustav Mahler]] from Bohemia (most [[List of Austrian Jews|Austrian Jews]] during this time were native not to what is today [[Austria]] but the outer provinces of the Empire), [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] from Germany, and [[Anton Rubinstein|Anton]] and [[Nikolai Rubinstein]] from Russia. Singers included [[John Braham]] and [[Giuditta Pasta]]. There were very many notable Jewish violin and pianist virtuosi, including [[Joseph Joachim]], [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]], [[Carl Tausig]], [[Henri Herz]], [[Leopold Auer]], [[Jascha Heifetz]], and [[Ignaz Moscheles]]. During the 20th century the number of Jewish composers and notable instrumentalists increased, as did their geographical distribution. Sample Jewish 20th-century composers include [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] from Austria, [[Hanns Eisler]] and [[Kurt Weill]] from Germany, [[Viktor Ullmann]] and [[Jaromír Weinberger]] from Bohemia and later the [[Czech Republic]] (the former perished at the [[Auschwitz]] extermination camps), [[George Gershwin]] and [[Aaron Copland]] from the United States, [[Darius Milhaud]] and [[Alexandre Tansman]] from France, [[Alfred Schnittke]] and [[Lera Auerbach]] from Russia, [[Lalo Schifrin]] and [[Mario Davidovsky]] from Argentina and [[Paul Ben-Haim]] and [[Shulamit Ran]] from Israel.  There are some genres and forms of classical music that Jewish composers have been associated with, including notably during the Romantic period [[France|French]] [[Grand Opera]]. The most prolific composers of this genre included [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], [[Fromental Halévy]], and the later [[Jacques Offenbach]]; Halevy's ''[[La Juive]]'' was based on [[Eugène Scribe|Scribe's]] [[libretto]] very loosely connected to the Jewish experience.

While orchestral and operatic music works by Jewish composers would in general be considered secular, many Jewish (as well as non-Jewish) composers have incorporated Jewish themes and motives into their music. Sometimes this is done covertly, such as the [[klezmer]] band music that many critics and observers believe lies in the third movement of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler's]] [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 1]], and this type of Jewish reference was most common during the [[19th century]] when openly displaying one's Jewishness would most likely hamper a Jew's chances at [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. During the [[20th century]], however, many Jewish composers wrote music with direct Jewish references and themes, e.g. [[David Amram]] (''Symphony – "Songs of the Soul"''), [[Leonard Bernstein]] (''[[Symphony No. 3 (Bernstein)|Kaddish Symphony]]'', ''[[Chichester Psalms]]''), [[Ernest Bloch]] (''[[Schelomo]]''), [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco]] (''Violin Concerto no. 2'') [[Kurt Weill]] (''[[Kurt Weill#Works 1936-1950|The Eternal Road]]'') and [[Hugo Weisgall]] (''Psalm of the Instant Dove'').

In the late twentieth century, prominent composers like Morton Feldman, Gyorgy Ligeti or Alfred Schnittke gave significant contributions to the history of contemporary music

===Popular Music===
The [[Great American Songbook#Songwriters and songs|great songwriters and lyricists]] of American [[traditional popular music]] and [[jazz standards]] were predominantly Jewish, including [[Harold Arlen]], [[Jerome Kern]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Frank Loesser]], [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[Irving Berlin]].

==Dance==
{{Main|Jewish dance}}
Deriving from Biblical traditions, Jewish dance has long been used by Jews as a medium for the expression of joy and other communal emotions. Each [[Jewish diaspora|Jewish diasporic]] community developed its own dance traditions for wedding celebrations and other distinguished events. For [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in [[Eastern Europe]], for example, dances, whose names corresponded to the different forms of [[klezmer]] music that were played, were an obvious staple of the wedding ceremony of the [[shtetl]]. Jewish dances both were influenced by surrounding [[Gentile]] traditions and Jewish sources preserved over time. "Nevertheless the Jews practiced a corporeal expressive language that was highly differentiated from that of the non-Jewish peoples of their neighborhood, mainly through motions of the hands and arms, with more intricate legwork by the younger men."&lt;ref&gt;[http://borzykowski.users.ch/EnglYidDance.htm Yiddish, Klezmer, Ashkenazic or 'shtetl' dances], Le Site Genevois de la Musique Klezmer. Accessed 12 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, however, in most religiously traditional communities, members of the opposite sex dancing together or dancing at times other than at these events was frowned upon.

Compared to music or theater, there is less of a specifically Jewish tradition in the [[visual arts]]. The most likely and accepted reason is that, as has been previously shown with Jewish music and literature, before [[Jewish Emancipation|Emancipation]] Jewish culture was dominated by the [[Aniconism in Judaism|religious tradition of aniconism]]. As most [[Rabbi]]nical authorities believed that the [[Ten Commandments#Jewish interpretation|Second Commandment]] prohibited much visual art that would qualify as "graven images", Jewish artists were relatively rare until they lived in assimilated European communities beginning in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ismar Schorsch, [http://learn.jtsa.edu/topics/parashah/5755/vayakhel.shtml Shabbat Shekalim Va-Yakhel 5755], commentary on [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 35:1 - 38:20.

A Jewish tradition of [[illuminated manuscript]]s in at least [[Late Antiquity]] has left no survivors, but can be deduced from borrowings in Early Medieval Christian art. A number of luxury pieces of [[gold glass]] from the later Roman period have Jewish motifs.  Several [[Hellenistic]]-style floor [[mosaic]]s have also been excavated in synagogues from Late Antiquity in Israel and Palestine, especially of the [[signs of the Zodiac]], which was apparently acceptable in a low-status position on the floor. Some, such as that at [[Naaran]], show evidence of a reaction against images of living creatures around 600 CE.  The decoration of [[sarcophagi]] and walls at the cave cemetery at [[Beit She'arim National Park|Beit She'arim]] shows a mixture of Jewish and Hellenistic motifs. However, for a period of several centuries between about 700 and 1100 CE there are scarcely any survivals of identifiably Jewish art.

[[Jews in the Middle Ages|Middle Age]] [[Rabbinical literature|Rabbinical]] and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] literature also contain textual and graphic art, most famously illuminated haggadahs such as the [[Sarajevo Haggadah]], and other manuscripts like the [[Nuremberg Mahzor]].  Some of these were illustrated by Jewish artists and some by Christians; equally some Jewish artists and craftsmen in various media worked on Christian commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Roza Bieliauskiene and Felix Tarm, [http://www.artcult.fr/_Peintures/Fiche/art-0-1310482.htm Brief History of Jewish Art], Jewish Art Network. Accessed January 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside of Europe, [[Yemeni silver|Yemenite Jewish silversmith]]s developed a distinctive style of finely wrought silver that is admired for its artistry.  Johnson again summarizes this sudden change from a limited participation by Jews in visual art (as in many other arts) to a large movement by them into this branch of European cultural life:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, the arrival of the Jewish artist was a strange phenomenon. It is true that, over the centuries, there had been many animals (though few humans) depicted in Jewish art: lions on [[Torah]] curtains, owls on Judaic coins, animals on the [[Capernaum]] capitals, birds on the rim of the fountain-basis in the 5th century [[Naro]] [[synagogue]] in [[Tunis]]; there were carved animals, too, on timber synagogues in [[eastern Europe]] - indeed the Jewish [[woodcarving|wood-carver]] was the prototype of the modern Jewish [[Plastic arts|plastic artist]]. A book of Yiddish folk-[[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], printed at [[Vitebsk]] in 1920, was similar to Chagall's own [[bestiary]]. But the resistance of pious Jews to portraying the living human image was still strong at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, ''op.cit.'', p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There were few Jewish ''secular'' artists in Europe prior to the [[Jewish Emancipation|Emancipation]] that spread throughout Europe with the Napoleonic conquests. There were exceptions, and [[Salomon Adler]] was a prominent portrait painter in 18th-century [[Milan]]. The delay in participation in the visual arts parallels the lack of Jewish participation in European classical music until the nineteenth century, and which was progressively overcome with the rise of [[Modernism (art)|Modernism]] in the 20th century. There were many Jewish artists in the 19th century, but Jewish artistic activity boomed during the end of World War I. The Jewish artistic Renaissance has its roots in the 1901 Fifth Zionist Congress, which included an art exhibition featuring Jewish artists E.M. Lilien and Hermann Struck.  The exhibition helped legitimize art as an expression of Jewish culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/spec/kiev/expressions/about.htm|title=GW Libraries at the George Washington University - GW Libraries|website=www.gwu.edu|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nadine Nieszawer, "Until 1905, Jews were always plunged into their books but from the first Russian Revolution, they became emancipated, committed themselves in politics and became artists. A real Jewish cultural rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Assoun, [http://www.ejpress.org/article/culture/1788 Jewish artists in Montparnasse] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092306/http://www.ejpress.org/article/culture/1788 |date=2007-09-29 }}. European Jewish Press, 19 July 2005. Accessed 12 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual Jews figured in the modern artistic movements of Europe— With the exception of those living in isolated Jewish communities, most Jews listed here as contributing to secular Jewish culture also participated in the cultures of the peoples they lived with and nations they lived in. In most cases, however, the work and lives of these people did not exist in two distinct cultural spheres but rather in one that incorporated elements of both.

During the early 20th century Jews figured particularly prominently in the [[Montparnasse]] movement, and after World War II among the [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionists]]: [[Alexander Bogen]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Al Held]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[Mark Rothko]], and [[Louis Schanker]] as well as among [[List of contemporary artists|Contemporary artists]], [[List of modern artists|Modernists]] and [[Postmodern art|Postmodernists]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/artists.html Jewish Artists], Jewish Virtual Library, 2005. Accessed 12 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jews]] were prominent in the art of [[scenic design]], particularly the aforementioned Chagall and Aronson, as well as the revolutionary [[Léon Bakst]], who like the other two also painted. One [[List of Mexican Jews|Mexican Jewish]] artist was [[Pedro Friedeberg]]; historians disagree as to whether [[Frida Kahlo]]'s father was Jewish or Lutheran. [[Gustav Klimt]] was not Jewish, but nearly all of his patrons and several of his models were. Among major artists Chagall may be the most specifically Jewish in his themes. But as art fades into [[graphic design]], Jewish names and themes become more prominent: [[Leonard Baskin]], [[Al Hirschfeld]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Art Spiegelman]] and [[Saul Steinberg]].

Jews have also played a very important role in medias other than painting; in photography some notable figures are [[André Kertész]], [[Robert Frank]], [[Helmut Newton]], [[Garry Winogrand]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Steve Lehman (photographer)|Steve Lehman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foto8.com/issue02/tibetans2.html foto8.com], John Levy, "Review of The Tibetans", photo 8, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1884167365 amazon.com], Lehman, Steve, The Tibetans: A Struggle to Survive (New York: How Town / Umbrage), 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adi Nes]]; in installation art and street art some notable figures are [[Sigalit Landau]],&lt;ref&gt;See: Ohad Meromi in the online exhibition "Real Time" &lt;http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2008/realtime/Meromi_e.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414013107/http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2008/realtime/Meromi_e.html |date=2012-04-14 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dede (artist)|Dede]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boulos|first=Nick|title=Show and Tel Aviv: Israel's artistic coastal city|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/middle-east/show-and-tel-aviv-israels-artistic-coastal-city-8861131.html|accessdate=1 April 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michal Rovner]].

[[Graphic arts|Graphic art]], as expressed in the art of comics, has been a key field for Jewish artists as well. In the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver ages]] of American comic books, the Jewish role was overwhelming and large number of the medium's foremost creators have been Jewish.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Comic Books"&gt;{{cite book |last=Booker|first=M.

[[Max Gaines]] was a pioneering figure in the creation of the modern comic book when in 1935 he published the first one called ''[[Famous Funnies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/famous-f.htm|title=Don Markstein's Toonopedia: Famous Funnies|first=Donald D.|last=Markstein|website=www.toonopedia.com|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he founded, with [[Jack Liebowitz]] and [[Harry Donenfeld]], [[All-American Publications]] (the AA Group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reformjudaismmag.net/03fall/comics.shtml|title=UAHC - Reform Judaism Magazine|website=reformjudaismmag.net|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication is known for the creation of several superheroes such as the original ''[[Atom (Al Pratt)|Atom]], [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]], [[Green Lantern]], [[Hawkman]]'', and ''[[Wonder Woman]]''.

{{Main|Jewish cuisine}}
Jewish [[cooking]] combines the food of many cultures in which Jews have settled, including Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Spanish, German and Eastern European styles of cooking, all influenced by the need for food to be [[kosher]]. Thus, "Jewish" foods like [[bagels]], [[hummus]], [[stuffed cabbage]], and [[blintz]]es all come from various other cultures. The amalgam of these foods, plus uniquely Jewish contributions like [[tzimmis]], [[cholent]], [[gefilte fish]] and [[matzah ball]]s, make up Jewish cuisine.

The '''Jogeshwari Caves''' are some of the earliest Buddhist cave temples sculptures located in the Mumbai suburb of [[Jogeshwari]], India. The caves date back to 520 to 550 CE.{{cn|date=December 2017}} These caves belongs to the last stage of the Mahayana Buddhist architecture, which later taken by Hindus.  According to historian and scholar Walter Spink, Jogeshwari is the earliest major cave temple in India and (in terms of total length) "the largest".&lt;ref name="SpinkStudies1967"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter M. Spink|author2=University of Michigan. Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies|title=Ajanta to Ellora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PwsNAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 April 2012|year=1967|publisher=Marg Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The caves are located off the Western Express Highway, and are surrounded by encroachments.
The caves are accessed through a long flight of stairs into the main hall of this cavernous space. It has many pillars and a [[Lingam]] at the end. Idols of [[Dattatreya]], [[Hanuman]], and [[Ganesh]] line the walls. There are also relics of two doormen. The cave also has a [[murti]] and [[footprints]] of goddess [[Yogeshwari|Jogeshwari (Yogeshwari)]], whom the area is named after. The goddess is considered a [[Kuladevi]] by some Marathi people, and also worshipped by some migrant groups from Gujarat.

Ron Hubbard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23088615-5007146,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905015907/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23088615-5007146,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=Cruise's flim-flam works for Scientology |first=Roger |last=Coombs |date=2008-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article3197189.ece | work=The Times | location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511192929/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article3197189.ece| title=Tom Cruise Scientology video tops Oprah moment | first=Lucy | last=Bannerman | date=16 January 2008 |archivedate=11 May 2008| accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1575759/Tom-Cruise-Scientology-video-leaked-on-web.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Tom Cruise Scientology video leaked on web | first1=Emma | last1=Henry |last2=and agencies| date=17 January 2008 | accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strickler|first=Jeff|title=Cruise Control|newspaper=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis,St. Paul|date=2008-01-17|url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/13880686.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dated 7 February 1965, it lays out ten points concerning the exact application and preservation of "Standard Tech" in Dianetics and Scientology, and the eradication of "non-standard tech", more commonly referred to in Scientology as "squirreling."

It is one of the most important and oft-repeated policies in Scientology. It was the principal subject discussed by [[Tom Cruise]] in his leaked video of January 2008.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

==Content==

# "Having the correct technology": Which Hubbard asserts has been done.
# "Knowing the technology": He claims many do know this.
# "Knowing it is correct": Hubbard says this comes from application and observation.
# "Teaching correctly the correct technology": He claims this is being done worldwide.
# "Applying the technology": Again, he says this is already happening.
# "Seeing that the technology is correctly applied": He says instructors and supervisors do this.
# "Hammering out of existence incorrect technology": The first problem area according to Hubbard, where he says it is a "weak point" and is only handled by a few.
# "Knocking out incorrect applications": Hubbard says this isn't worked on hard enough.
# "Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology": Hubbard says this is "impeded by the 'reasonable' attitude of the not quite bright."
# "Closing the door on incorrect application": Hubbard says this is "seldom done with enough ferocity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS, TECHNOLOGY, AND SCIENCE: THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE E‐METER IN SCIENTOLOGY TEACHINGS |journal=Zygon |year=2016 |last=Bigliardi |first=Stefano |volume=51 |issue=3 |page=668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten directives Hubbard listed in the 1965 policy letter, when considered as a whole, “seek to ensure the proper and continued application of Scientology “standard tech” along with the eradication of anything counter to it,” according to ''Scientology in Popular Culture: Influences and Struggles for Legitimacy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first1=Stephen A. |last2=Raine |first2=Susan |title=Scientology in Popular Culture: Influences and Struggles for Legitimacy |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2017 |isbn= 978-1440832499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

L. Ron Hubbard claims that the main stumbling blocks he listed all pertain to "incorrect technologies" and "incorrect applications" listed in the last four items.  He claims that the reasons for the problems with the last four items are due to poor certainty that the "technology" works, people with low IQs, people trying to "defend themselves against anything they confront", and "the bank" (Scientology jargon which basically refers to the "reactive mind" that supposedly contains negative memories), which defends itself by trying to "knock out the good and perpetuate the bad."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tep-online.info/laku/usa/reli/scien/SECRETDOX/1965_69.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard states, "I know what a group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable 'technology'.  By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroy good technology." He also states, "See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish." The remainder of the document is further justifications for why "incorrect technologies and applications" have to be ruthlessly hammered out of existence to keep Scientology working, including one example where Hubbard claims that a failure to do this for one student of Scientology meant that "his wife died of [[cancer]] resulting from physical abuse."

In Janet Reitman’s ''Inside Scientology'', she quotes Hubbard: “Never let anyone be half-minded about being Scientologists,” he wrote in Keeping Scientology Working. “When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined for the duration of the universe – never permit an ‘open-minded approach.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reitman |first1=Janet |title=Inside Scientology: The Story of America’s Most Secretive Religion |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2011 |accessdate=2016-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholar Shannon Trosper Schorey, the KSW “was a statement of the re-assertion of official church control over the proliferation of adaptations and interpretations of church practice.” At the core of KSW is “the mandate that Scientology technology must at all times be practiced in consonance with official Church of Scientology guidelines.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first1=J. |title=Handbook of Scientology |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Germany===
The German Office for the Protection of the Constitution has cited this passage as one of its reasons for designating Scientology an organization opposed to the democratic order.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/SHOW/vsbericht_2004_engl.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019054034/http://www.verfassungsschutz.de/download/SHOW/vsbericht_2004_engl.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2007 |title=2004 Annual Report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution |publisher=Federal Ministry of the Interior of the Federal Republic of Germany |page=270 |format=PDF |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a section on  KSW point 4 "teaching correctly the correct technology" Hubbard states: "The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs (organisations) where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology.  Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles... When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don't make students into good Scientologists..The proper instruction attitude is, 'You're here so you're a Scientologist. Now we're going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We'd rather have you dead than incapable." This last sentence has been cited in a report by the state government of [[Baden-Württemberg]], as evidence that Scientology represents a totalitarian ideology.&lt;ref name="Landtag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.landtag-bw.de/WP12/Drucksachen/5000/12_5841_d.pdf |title=Mitteilung der Landesregierung 5.

[[File:S03 06 01 018 image 2408.jpg|thumbnail|left|Egypt - Ketussi, Nubia. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
The '''Kiosk of Qertassi''' is "a tiny Roman [[kiosk]] with four slender papyrus columns inside, [and] two [[Hathor]] columns at the entrance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/projects/epi/chb7-2.html Chicago House Bulletin] "The Sitts go to sea: Egypt doesn't end at Aswan" by the University of Chicago, Vol.7 No.2 (April 15, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a small but elegant structure that "is unfinished and not inscribed with the name of the architect, but is probably contemporary with [[Trajan]]'s Kiosk at Philae."&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A complete guide to Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson 1993 paperback, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; According to Günther Roeder--the first scholar to publish research on this building--the kiosk of Qertassi dates to the Augustan or early Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Roeder, Debod bis Bab kalabsche, (Cairo, 1911-12), pp.146-179&lt;/ref&gt; 
The structure "is only twenty-five feet square, and consists of a single Hathor court oriented north or south, and originally surrounded by fourteen columns connected by screen walls."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret A. Murray, Egyptian Temples, Dover Publications, 2002. p.192&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 14 pillars, only 6 have survived in place.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, pp.192-193&lt;/ref&gt; The pillars or columns were made of brown sandstone; the structure itself was "perhaps connected to a small [[Egyptian temple|temple]] on the East Bank [of the Nile] which was still in existence in 1813."&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Nigel Strudwick, Sabine Gardiner, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2003. p.192&lt;/ref&gt; 

This charming kiosk has now been moved to the site of [[New Kalabsha]] in Southern Egypt but "once stood to the entrance to the sandstone quarries" of Qertassi.&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Oakes, Pyramids, Temples and Tombs of Ancient Egypt: An Illustrated Atlas of the Land of the Pharaohs, Hermes House:Anness Publishing Ltd, 2003. p.209&lt;/ref&gt; Its capitals "are decorated with [[Hathor]] heads, in honour of the goddess who was [the] patron of quarry-men and miners.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, p.209&lt;/ref&gt; Since Hathor was often associated with [[Isis]], as she is at [[Philae]], it has been suggested that "this kiosk and the small temples of [[Temple of Debod|Dabod]] and [[Temple of Dendur|Dendur]] were way stations on the processional route taken by priests bearing the image of Isis around [[Lower Nubia]], which was held to be her estate."&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, p.209&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the paucity of timber in the arid region of Nubia, the kiosk's roof was constructed with sandstone slabs that were supported by architraves on its long sides.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, Oxford University Press, 1999. p.240&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''list of Protestant authors''' presents a group of authors who have expressed membership in a Protestant [[Christian denomination|denomination]]al church or adherence to spiritual beliefs which are in alignment with [[Protestantism]] as a religion, culture, or identity. The list does not include authors who, while considered or thought to be Protestant in faith, have rarely expressed or declared their affiliation in a public forum. Anglicanism, which is a hybrid of Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, and Eastern Orthodoxy has not been included due to the diversified foundational beliefs of the church. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are also not included.

Criteria for inclusion on the list are those authors that have received worldwide recognition for their contributions in religious literature. Areas of specialty and denominations are added according to consensus, as needed. Current specialties include the following:  
{|
|
* [[Allegory]]
* [[Anthropology]]
* [[Apologetics]]
* [[Bibliography|Bibliology]]
|
* [[Biography]]
* [[Christology]]
* [[Cosmology]]
* [[Ecclesiology]]
|
* [[Christian eschatology|Eschatology]]
* [[Exegesis]]
* [[Exposition (literary technique)|Expository]]

[[File:Sirjonathansacks.jpg|thumb|Jonathan Sacks Principal 1984-1990]]
The '''London School of Jewish Studies''' (commonly known as '''LSJS''', originally founded as '''Jews' College''')  is a [[London]]-based organisation providing adult educational courses and training to the wider Jewish community. Since 2012 LSJS also offers rabbinical training, returning to its roots.  

Many leading figures in British Jewry have been associated with the School, including [[Michael Friedländer]], Principal from 1865 to 1907;  [[Isidore Epstein]], Principal 1948–1961; [[Louis Jacobs]], Moral Tutor 1959–1961; and in recent years [[Jonathan Sacks]] (later [[Lord Sacks]]), Principal 1984–1990.

==History==
The '''London School of Jewish Studies''' was founded as '''Jews' College''' in 1855, a rabbinical seminary in [[London]]. The organisation was re-focussed and given its present name in 1999, with an emphasis on providing a broader range of adult educational courses and training to the wider Jewish community.  The rabbinical training programme was suspended, and much of the historical holdings of the library were sold off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/hebraica/lsjsrep.html Hebraica Libraries Group Report: London School of Jewish Studies], via Cambridge University Library, accessed 11 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  LSJS has had growing success in its new role, and since 2012 once again offers rabbinical training, in partnership with the programme set up by the London Sephardi community.

===Jews' College===
'''Jews' College''' was opened in [[Finsbury Square]], [[London]] as a rabbinical seminary in 1855 with the support of [[Chief Rabbi]] [[Nathan Marcus Adler|Nathan Adler]] and of [[Sir Moses Montefiore]], who had conceived the idea for such a venture as early as 1841. The college quickly established itself as a place where high quality [[rabbi]]nical training was available and its alumni and staff often became prominent in [[Anglo-Jewry]].

In 1881, the College moved to larger premises in [[Tavistock Square]], close to [[University College London|University College]], where it was envisaged that Jews’ College students would be able to combine their religious studies and university studies to degree level. As early as  1904, the [[University of London]] granted an [[Honours degree]] in Hebrew and Aramaic, all of the candidates being from Jews’ College. In 1932, with the building of [[Woburn House]], a centre for Anglo-Jewry, still in Tavistock Square, Jews' College moved again.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], despite the [[The Blitz|bombing of London]], the College kept its doors open. Apart from the rabbinical studies and degree course, [[Chazzan]]ut courses and teacher training programmes were now offered.

In 1954, the College moved, yet again, to larger premises in [[Montagu Place]]. That building in central London was sold in the early 1980s, and now houses the [[Embassy of Sweden, London|Embassy of Sweden]].  The College operated from temporary premises at Finchley Synagogue for a number of years, under the leadership of Rabbi Dr [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]. Under the auspices of Rabbi Dr [[Jonathan Sacks]] and with the financial backing of [[Stanley Kalms]], chairman of [[Dixons Retail|Dixons]], the College relocated in 1984 to its current building, now known as Schaller House, in [[Hendon]], North-West London, close to the hub of London’s Jewish community.

===London School of Jewish Studies===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
In 1998, the University of London announced that it would be terminating the "Associated Institute" status that the College and three other small institutions enjoyed. Jews' College was forced to seek an academic partner within the University in order to be able to continue its degree programmes. Without the freedom to determine its own curriculum and the financial security that came from student fee income, it became increasingly difficult for the College to survive in its previous form. Rabbinic training was also uneconomic as many students looked to the Torah centres of Israel and America for their education and the number of available rabbinic posts in the UK decreased.

In 2002, the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS) decided to terminate its relationship with LSJS, which threatened the organisation's status. A small team of young community leaders and educators, led by the late Marc Weinberg, presented the then Chair of Council, Howard Stanton, with a proposal to use the human and financial resources available to refocus the School's activities and to secure its future as a hub of academic study and lifelong learning, catering to a wide spectrum of the community.

Since then, under the leadership of Dr Raphael Zarum and Dr Tamra Wright, LSJS has welcomed hundreds of students to a range of academic courses and events. In addition to numerous community focused offerings, more formal programs include:
*The LSJS, as of 2012, offers a ''[[Semicha]]'' programme  [http://www.lsjs.ac.uk/london-montefiore-semicha-programme-2/], in conjunction with [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews#In Britain|The Judith Lady Montefiore College]]. The part-time programme is of four years' duration (38 study weeks per year; 16 lecture hours per week). The course focuses on Halacha, but the curriculum also includes [[Tanakh]], history and ethics, as well as practical community-directed subjects such as counselling, public speaking, life events, [[Hazzan|''hazanut'']] and teaching skills.[http://www.montefioreendowment.org.uk/college/semicha/] 
*LSJS also hosts The Montefiore [[Kollel]],[http://www.montefioreendowment.org.uk/college/kollel/] comprising an "intensive" one-year programme focused on in-depth [[Gemara#Argumentation and debate|Gemara study]] with emphasis on [[halacha|halachic applications]]. Applicants to the Semicha programme may be required to first spend one year in the Kollel.
*The LSJS also, once again, offers various degree opportunities: the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in [[Jewish Studies]] with [[King's College, London]] [http://www.lsjs.ac.uk/research-and-degrees/]; and the [[BA (Hons)]] and MA in [[Jewish education]] [http://www.lsjs.ac.uk/ba-hons-jewish-education/] with [[Middlesex University]].

==Alei Tzion==
The London School of Jewish Studies also houses the synagogue Alei Tzion. The synagogue refers to itself as a "young and vibrant congregation ". Services take place regularly. These include; Shacharit, Mincha and Maariv prayer. The highlight of the week are the complete shabbat services which include 2 children's services.

'''Madeline Montalban''' (born '''Madeline Sylvia Royals'''; 8 January 1910&amp;nbsp;– 11 January 1982) was an English [[astrology|astrologer]] and [[ceremonial magic]]ian. She co-founded the [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] organisation known as the Order of the Morning Star (OMS), through which she propagated her own form of [[Luciferianism]].

Born in [[Blackpool]], [[Lancashire]], Montalban moved to [[London]] in the early 1930s, immersing herself in the city's esoteric subculture, and influenced by [[Hermeticism]] she taught herself ceremonial magic. She associated with significant [[occultism|occultists]], including [[Thelema|Thelemites]] like [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Kenneth Grant]], and [[Wicca]]ns like [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]]. From 1933 to 1953 she published articles on astrology and other esoteric topics in the magazine ''[[London Life]]'', and from then until her death in the nationally syndicated magazine ''Prediction''. These were accompanied by several booklets on astrology, released using a variety of different pseudonyms, including '''Dolores North''', '''Madeline Alvarez''' and '''Nina del Luna'''.

In 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, with whom she entered into a relationship. After moving to [[Southsea]] in [[Hampshire]], they founded the OMS as a [[correspondence course]] in 1956, teaching subscribers their own magical rites. Viewing [[Lucifer]] as a benevolent angelic deity, she believed Luciferianism had its origins in ancient [[Babylon]], and encouraged her followers to contact angelic beings associated with the planetary bodies to aid their spiritual development. After her relationship with Heron ended in 1964, she returned to London, continuing to propagate the OMS. She settled in the [[St. Giles, London|St. Giles]] district, where she became known to the press as "The Witch of St. Giles". She died of lung cancer in 1982.

Having refused to publish her ideas in books, Montalban became largely forgotten following her death, although the OMS continued under new leadership. Her life and work was mentioned in various occult texts and historical studies of esotericism during subsequent decades; a short biography by Julia Philips was published by the [[Atlantis Bookshop]] in 2012.

Willie and Marion had married on 28 June 1909, followed by Madeline's birth seven months later.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=23–24}} In early life, Madeline was afflicted with [[polio]], resulting in a lifelong withered leg and limp. Bedridden for the course of the illness, she read literature to entertain herself, enjoying the works of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[H.&amp;nbsp;Rider Haggard]] and [[E.&amp;nbsp;T.&amp;nbsp;A. Hoffman]]. She also read the Bible in her youth, becoming particularly enamored with the texts of the [[Old Testament]], and was convinced that they contained secret messages, a theme that became a central tenet of her later Luciferian beliefs.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=25–26}}

[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Crowley, whom Montalban met in London]]

In the early 1930s, she left Blackpool, and moved south to London. Her reasons for doing so have never been satisfactorily explained, and she would offer multiple, contradictory accounts of her reasoning in later life. According to one account, her father sent her to study with the famed occultist and mystic [[Aleister Crowley]], who had founded the religion of [[Thelema]] in 1904; Montalban's biographer Julia Philips noted that while she met Crowley in London, this story remains implausible. Another of Montalban's accounts held that she moved to the capital to work for the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper; this claim has never been corroborated, and one of the paper's reporters at the time, Justine Glass, has claimed that she never remembered Montalban working there.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=29–30}} Montalban often changed her stories, and informed later disciple [[Michael Howard (Witch)|Michael Howard]] that upon arrival in London, the ''Daily Express'' sent her to interview Crowley. According to this story, when she first visited him at his lodgings in Jermyn Street, he was suffering from an [[asthma]] attack, and having had experience with this ailment from a family member she was able to help him, earning his gratitude. They subsequently went to the expensive [[Café Royal]] in [[Regent Street]], where after their lunch, he revealed that he was unable to pay, leaving Montalban to sort out payment.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=6}}

Although her own accounts of the initial meeting are unreliable, Montalban met with Crowley, embracing the city's occult scene.{{sfnm|1a1=Douglas|1a2=Sheridan|1y=2007|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2pp=31–33}} Having a deep interest in [[western esotericism]], she read widely on the subject, and taught herself the practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] rather than seeking out the instruction of a teacher.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=73–74}} She was particularly interested in [[astrology]], and in 1933 wrote her first article on the subject for the magazine ''[[London Life]]'', entitled "The Stars in the Heavens". Her work continued to see publication in that magazine until 1953, during which time she used different pseudonyms: Madeline Alvarez, Dolores del Castro, Michael Royals, Regina Norcliff, Athene Deluce, Nina de Luna, and the best known, Madeline Montalban, which she created based upon the name of a film star whom she liked, the Mexican actor [[Ricardo Montalbán]].{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=22–23}}

===Marriage and ''London Life'': 1939–1951===
By the end of the 1930s, Montalban was living on Grays Inn Road in the [[Borough of Holborn]].{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=35}} In 1939, she married fireman George Edward North in London. They had a daughter, Rosanna, but their relationship deteriorated and he left her for another woman.{{sfnm|1a1=Heselton|1y=2000|1p=300|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2pp=26–27}} She later informed friends that during the [[Second World War]], George had served in the [[Royal Navy]] while she served in the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS), although such claims have never been corroborated.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=27}} [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of [[Gardnerian Wicca]] – known for his unreliable stories{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=239}} – claimed that he met Montalban during the war, when she was wearing a WRNS uniform, and that at the time she was working as a "personal clairvoyant and psychic advisor" to [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]]. Various individuals who knew her would comment that she had in her possession a framed blurry picture of Mountbatten with an individual who looked like her.{{sfnm|1a1=Valiente|1y=1989|1pp=49–50|2a1=Heselton|2y=2000|2p=301|3a1=Philips|3y=2012|3pp=27–28}}

She continued her publication of articles under an array of pseudonyms in ''London Life'', and from February 1947 was responsible for a regular astrological column entitled "You and Your Stars" under the name of Nina del Luna.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=65}} She also undertook other work, and in the late 1940s, Michael Houghton, proprietor of [[Bloomsbury]]'s esoteric-themed [[Atlantis Bookshop]], asked her to edit a manuscript of Gardner's novel ''High Magic's Aid'', which was set in the Late Middle Ages and which featured practitioners of a Witch-Cult; Gardner later alleged that the book contained allusions to the ritual practices of the [[New Forest coven]] of Pagan Witches who had initiated him into their ranks in 1939.{{sfnm|1a1=Valiente|1y=1989|1p=49|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2pp=224, 244|3a1=Heselton|3y=2000|3p=300|4a1=Heselton|4y=2003|4pp=245–246, 377}} Gardner incorrectly believed that Montalban "claimed to be a Witch; but got {{sic|evrything}} wrong" although he credited her with having "a lively imagination."{{sfn|Heselton|2003|p=246}} Although initially seeming favourable to Gardner, by the mid-1960s she had become hostile towards him and his Gardnerian tradition, considering him to be "a 'dirty old man' and sexual pervert."{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=69}} She also expressed hostility to another prominent Pagan Witch of the period, [[Charles Cardell]], although in the 1960s became friends with the two Witches at the forefront of the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n tradition, [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and his wife, [[Maxine Sanders]], who adopted some of her Luciferian angelic practices.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=69–70}} She personally despised being referred to as a "witch", and was particularly angry when the esoteric magazine ''[[Man, Myth &amp; Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth and Magic]]'' referred to her as "The Witch of St. Giles", an area of Central London which she would later inhabit.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=70}}

In his 1977 book ''Nightside of Eden'', the Thelemite [[Kenneth Grant]], then leader of the [[Typhonian Order|Typhonian OTO]], told a story in which he claimed that both he and Gardner performed rituals in the St. Giles flat of a "Mrs. South", probably a reference to Montalban, who often used the pseudonym of "Mrs North". The truthfulness of Grant's claims have been scrutinised by both [[Doreen Valiente]] and Julia Philips, who have pointed out multiple incorrect assertions with his account.{{sfnm|1a1=Grant|1y=1977|1pp=123–124|2a1=Valiente|2y=1989|2p=50|3a1=Philips|3y=2012|3pp=33–35}}

===''Prediction'' and The Order of the Morning Star: 1952–1964===
From August 1953, Montalban ceased working for ''London Life'', publishing her work in the magazine ''Prediction'', one of the country's best-selling esoteric-themed publications. Starting with a series on the uses of the [[tarot]], in May 1960 she was employed to produce a regular astrological column for ''Prediction''.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=64–66}} Supplementing such esoteric endeavours, she penned a series of romantic short stories for publication in magazines.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=66}} Throughout the 1950s she released a series of booklets under different pseudonyms that were devoted to astrology; in one case, she published the same booklet under two separate titles and names, as Madeline Montalban's ''Your Stars and Love'' and Madeline Alvarez's ''Love and the Stars''. She never wrote any books, instead preferring the shorter booklets and articles as mediums through which to propagate her views, and was critical of those books that taught the reader how to perform their own [[horoscope]]s, believing that they put professional astrologers out of business.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=63}}

[[File:ParadiseLButts1.jpg|thumb|upright|Montalban considered Lucifer – depicted here by [[William Blake]] – to be a benevolent deity who had aided humanity since ancient times.]] 
In 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, with whom she entered into a relationship. An engraver, photographer and former journalist for the ''[[Brighton Argus]]'', he shared her interest in the occult, and together they developed a magical system based upon [[Luciferianism]], the veneration of the deity [[Lucifer]], or Lumiel, whom they considered to be a benevolent angelic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the Morning Star, or ''Ordo Stella Matutina'' (OSM), propagating it through a [[correspondence course]].{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=81–82}} The couple sent out lessons to those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained ''The Book of Lumiel'', a short work written by Montalban that documented her understanding of Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=95–97}} The couple initially lived together in Torrington Place, London, from where they ran the course, but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of [[Southsea]] in Essex, where there was greater room for Heron's engraving equipment.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=81}}

She encouraged members of her OMS course to come and meet with her, and developed friendships with a number of them, blurring the distinction between teacher and pupil.{{sfnm|1a1=Douglas|1a2=Sheridan|1y=2007|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=20}} Meetings of OMS members were informal, and rarely for ritual, with the majority of the organisation's rites requiring solitary work.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=89}} According to later members of her Order, Montalban's basis was in [[Hermeticism]], although she was heavily influenced by Mediaeval and Early Modern [[grimoires]] like the ''[[Picatrix]]'', ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'', ''[[The Heptameron (grimoire)|The Heptameron]]'' of [[Pietro d'Abano]], ''[[The Key of Solomon]]'', ''[[The Book of Abramelin]]'', and [[Cornelius Agrippa]]'s ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Douglas|1a2=Sheridan|1y=2007|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=89}} Unlike the founders of several older ceremonial magic organisations, such as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] or the [[Fraternity of the Inner Light]], she did not claim any authority from higher spiritual beings such as the [[Ascended master]]s or [[Secret Chiefs]].{{sfnm|1a1=Douglas|1a2=Sheridan|1y=2007}} She believed that the Luciferian religion had its origin among the [[Chaldea]]n people of ancient [[Babylon]] in the Middle East,{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=85}} and believed that in a former life, the OMS's members had been "initiates of the Babylonian and Ancient Egyptian priesthood" from where they had originally known each other.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=6}} She considered herself the reincarnation of King [[Richard III]], and was a member of the [[Richard III Society]]; on one occasion, she visited the site of Richard's death at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] with fellow OMS members, wearing a suit of armour.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=18–19}} In March 1964, Montalban broke from her relationship with Heron, and moved back to London.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=83}}

===Later life: 1964–1982===
From 1964 until 1966 she dwelt in a flat at 8 Holly Hill, [[Hampstead]], which was owned by the husband of one of her OMS students, the Latvian exile and poet Velta Snikere.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=35}} After leaving Holly Hill, Montalban moved to a flat in the Queen Alexandra Mansions at 3 Grape Street in the St. Giles district of Holborn. Here, she was in close proximity to the two primary bookstores then catering to occult interests, Atlantis Bookshop and Watkins Bookshop, as well as to the [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=36, 39}} She offered one of the rooms in her flat to a young astrologer and musician, Rick Hayward, whom she had met in the summer of 1967; he joined the OMS, and in the last few months of Montalban's life authored her astrological forecasts for ''Prediction''. After her death, he continued publishing astrological prophecies in ''Prediction'' and ''Prediction Annual'' until summer 2012.{{sfn|Douglas|2013|p=32}}

In 1967, Michael Howard, a young man interested in witchcraft and the occult wrote to Montalban after reading one of her articles in ''Prediction''; she invited him to visit her at her home. The two became friends, with Montalban believing that she could see the "Mark of [[Cain]]" in his [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]].{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1pp=5&amp;ndash;6}} She invited him to become a student of the ONS, which he duly did.{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=6|2a1=Gregorius|2y=2013|2p=243}} Over the coming year, he spent much of his time with her, and in 1968 they went on what she called a "magical mystery tour" to the [[West Country]], visiting [[Stonehenge]], [[Boscastle]] and [[Tintagel]].{{sfn|Howard|2010|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}} In 1969, he was initiated into Gardnerian Wicca, something she disapproved of, and their friendship subsequently "hit a stormy period" with the pair going "[their] own ways for several years."{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=8}}

A lifelong smoker, Montalban developed lung cancer, causing her death on 11 January 1982.{{sfnm|1a1=Douglas|1a2=Sheridan|1y=2007|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=99}} The role of sorting out her financial affairs fell to her friend, Pat Arthy, who discovered that despite her emphasis on the magical attainment of material wealth, she owned no property and that her estate was worth less than £10,000.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=88, 99}} The copyright of her writings fell to her daughter, Rosanna, who entrusted the running of the OMS to two of Montalban's initiates, married couple Jo Sheridan and Alfred Douglas, who were authorised as the exclusive publishers of her correspondence course.{{sfnm|1a1=Douglas|1a2=Sheridan|1y=2007}} Sheridan – whose real name was Patricia Douglas – opened an alternative therapy centre in [[Islington]], [[North London]], in the 1980s, before retiring to [[Rye, East Sussex]] in 2002, where she continued running the OMS correspondence course until her death in 2011.{{sfn|Howard|2012|p=44}}

==Personal life and magico-religious beliefs==
According to her biographer Julia Philips, Montalban had been described by her magical students as "tempestuous, generous, humorous, demanding, kind, capricious, talented, volatile, selfish, goodhearted, [and] dramatic".{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=7}} Philips noted that she was a woman who made a "definite impression" in all those whom she encountered, but who equally could be quite shy and disliked being interviewed in anything other than print.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=7}} Philips asserted that Montalban had a "mercurial personality" and could be kind and generous at one moment and fly into a violent temper the next.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=11}} Several of her friends noted that she was prudish when it came to sexual matters,{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=34}} and her friend [[Maxine Sanders]] stated that even as an elderly lady Montalban boasted of only taking men under the age of twenty-five as her lovers.{{sfn|Sanders|2008|p=239}} She would take great pleasure in causing arguments, particularly between a couple who were romantically involved.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=37}}

Describing herself as a "[[paganism (contemporary)|pagan]]", Montalban's personal faith was Luciferian in basis, revolving around the veneration of Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom she considered to be a benevolent angelic being who had aided humanity's development. Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=26, 85–86}} Montalban considered astrology to be a central part of her religious worldview, and always maintained that one could be a good magician only if they had mastered astrology.{{sfn|Philips|2012|p=86}} Her correspondence course focused around the seven planetary bodies that were known in the ancient world and the angelic beings that she associated with them: [[Michael]] ([[Sun]]), [[Gabriel]] ([[Moon]]), [[Samael]] ([[Mars]]), [[Raphael]] ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), [[Sachiel]] ([[Jupiter]]), [[Anael]] ([[Venus]]) and [[Cassiel]] ([[Saturn]]). Each of these beings was in turn associated with certain days, hours, minerals, plants, and animals, each of which could be used in the creation of [[talisman]]s that invoked the angelic power.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=86–87}} Montalban disliked the theatrical use of props and rites in ceremonial magic, such as that performed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, preferring a more simplistic use of ritual.{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2pp=32–33}}

==Legacy==
In his book on the [[history of Wicca]], ''[[The Triumph of the Moon]]'' (1999), historian [[Ronald Hutton]] of [[Bristol University]] noted that Montalban was "one of England's most prominent occultists" of the 20th century.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=268}} Michael Howard referred to Montalban's teachings in his book on Luciferian mythology, ''The Book of Fallen Angels'' (2004),{{sfn|Howard|2004}} with [[religious studies]] scholar Fredrik Gregorius noting that Howard played an "important [role] in furthering an interest" in Montalban's ideas.{{sfn|Gregorius|2013|p=244}}

In 2012, Neptune Press – the publishing arm of Bloomsbury's Atlantis Bookshop – published a short biography of Montalban entitled ''Madeline Montalban: The Magus of St Giles'', written by Anglo-Australian Wiccan Julia Philips. Philips noted that for much of the project she found it difficult separating fact from fiction when it came to Montalban's life, but that she had been able to nevertheless put together a biographical account, albeit an incomplete one, of "one of the truly great characters of English occultism."{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=7–8}}

The '''Miracle Chapati''' or '''Chapati Jesus''' is a [[chapati]], or flat unleavened bread, roughly eight centimeters in diameter with, what believers claim, is an [[Images of Jesus|image of Christ]] miraculously burnt on it. The chapati was baked by Shella Anthony of [[Bangalore]], [[India]] in early September 2002, enshrined in Bangalore, and visited by thousands of believers and curious onlookers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2484195.stm BBC NEWS | South Asia | India marvels at 'miracle chapati'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The baker of the Miracle Chapati, Shella Anthony, a devout [[Catholic]], baked dozens of chapatis daily. One day in September 2002, she had given her children some to eat. Her daughter refused to eat one, remarking that it was burnt. Anthony was on the verge of discarding it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1283232002 Edinburgh Evening News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but on inspection noticed that the burn mark resembled Christ, an opinion confirmed by her daughter and many of her neighbours. She handed it over to her parish priest, George Jacob, who agreed and promptly pronounced it a miracle. It was then put it in a glass case for exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfredplacechurch.org.uk/sermons/mark8.htm The Lord Christ'S First Miracle Of Healing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publicity==
Over the next few days, nearly 20,000 Christians traveling from as far as [[Mysore]] and [[Chennai]] went to the central shrine of the Retreat Centre, where the chapati was on display, to pay homage and offer prayers to this piece of bread. Apart from Christians, a number of Hindus and Muslims also visited the Centre to view the chapati. Information on the chapati was broadcast on Indian national television and reported by [[The Times of India]], [[The Times]] and the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ufoinfo.com/roundup/v07/rnd0747.shtml UFO ROUNDUP Volume 7 Number 47&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Believers and skeptics ==

One Indian journalist, initially skeptical,  claimed to have "different feelings" on witnessing the bread in person.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Skeptics{{who|date=June 2014}} assert that the mind often sees what it wishes to, and that the chapati does not actually resemble Jesus any more than it could resemble South America, albeit from a different angle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kuznetsov.uklinux.net/holy.php&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as there are no contemporary descriptions or likenesses of Jesus known, it is impossible to know what Jesus looks like.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8135">'''Mision Cristiana Elim Internacional''' is a [[pentecostal]] [[megachurch]]  (known as "Elim Central") and a worldwide organization of churches based in [[San Salvador]], [[El Salvador]].  The senior pastor of this community is [[Mario Vega (pastor) | Mario Vega]] since 1997. In 2015, the attendance is 120,000 people only in the central sede.

==History==

In May 1977, the church  began operations in a small space of the Santa Lucia de Ilopango in [[San Salvador]], El Salvador, with Sergio Daniel Solórzano Aldana. &lt;ref&gt; Elim, [https://elim.org.sv/historia/ Historia], Official Website, El Salvador, retrieved September 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; J. Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann, ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, page  963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Bird, outreachmagazine.com, [http://www.outreachmagazine.com/ideas/11952-pray-plan-coach-grow-elim-christian-mission.html  El Salvador: Pray, Plan, Coach, Grow at Elim Christian Mission], USA, June 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;The attendance is nine people, after an evangelistic campaign conducted on May 28, by Dr. Othoniel Rios Paredes, Pastor of Elim Christian Mission in Guatemala. 

In 1983, the mission in El Salvador separated from that of Guatemala over disagreements as to their doctrinal positions, but the separation did not involve a name change due to the difficulty of starting this type of proceeding in the country which was still wracked by civil war. The church in El Salvador is still called "Misión Cristiana Elim de El Salvador" until today (the church in Guatemala changed its name to "Partners Area Elim Ministries" and later "Elim Ministries").

In 1985 the church in San Salvador had about 3,000 people. Elim decide to develop the prayer cell concept of [[Yoido Full Gospel Church]], South Korea. &lt;ref&gt;Sammy Alfaro, Néstor Medina, "Pentecostals and Charismatics in Latin America and Latino Communities", Springer, USA, 2015, page 115&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 1986 the church opened a radio station named "Radio Restoration" which became one of the country's top after their kind ever since. In 1988, the attendance is 20,000.

In the mid 1990s Pastor Solorzano experienced a spiritual crisis in his personal life that would eventually result in the naming of a new senior pastor to look after MCEI.  He eventually overcame his doubts and went on to establish another world impact ministry, ''"La Palabra Viva"'' (The Living Word) in the late 1990s, which continues to flourish to this day. 

In 1997, [[Mario Vega (pastor) | Mario Vega]] became senior pastor. &lt;ref&gt; Elim, [https://elim.org.sv/historia/ Historia], Official Website, El Salvador, retrieved September 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered as a resource person to shed light on some social issues. &lt;ref&gt;Paul Glader, washingtonpost.com, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/04/08/christianity-is-growing-rapidly-in-el-salvador-along-with-gang-violence-and-murder-rates/ Christianity is growing rapidly in El Salvador], USA, April 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Valencia, elfaro.net, [http://www.salanegra.elfaro.net/es/201209/entrevistas/9589/%E2%80%9CSi-la-tregua-se-rompe-a-la-sociedad-le-espera-una-situaci%C3%B3n-muy-dif%C3%ADcil%E2%80%9D.htm “Si la Tregua se rompe, a la sociedad le espera una situación muy difícil”], El Salvador, September 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

MCEI owns 6 radio stations under the name "Radio Restauracion" in El Salvador and Los Angeles and is in the process of building an 11,000 seat auditorium and television studio in San Salvador.

In 2007, the Pastors Cesar Flores (Elim San Fernando Valley) and Nelson Martinez (Elim Guatemala) forged a division of enormous scope that separates nearly half of its branches within Elim Mission. They are still called Elim International despite winning the non-repudiation of dissidents and this forms the third Elim International with its headquarters in the capital of Guatemala.

These pastors divided mission Elim Elim internationally separating all of Mexico Guatemala, South America and some of North America.

They pointed out that international Elim had stopped believing in the rapture pretribulational to believe in a rapture or posttribulational midtribulacional basing these accusations on isolated cases of Elim pastors and teachings of CETI (Theological Institute which teaches Elim pastors, but that is not the mission. The divisions of this third Elim U.S. pastors were discontent with Rene Molina (by having friendly ties with churches and pastors G12 movement to which he was accustomed Elim not related).

Amid the scandal over 33 subsidiaries were separated. Elim tries to recover the areas founding new churches and has established position denying any wrongdoing.

Once known as the second largest single church in the world, the ministry has a membership that surpasses 115,000 people and has, at its peak, numbered as much as 200,000. MCEI has more than 500 full-time pastors in El Salvador alone. The church is known for its ''"Time of Restoration"'' events in which hundreds of thousands of people gather from all around the world to worship together. These events have sometimes been held simultaneously in all the major sports stadiums in El Salvador. 

In 2015, the Church has 50,000 peoples, 75,000 with cell grup. &lt;ref&gt; Donald E. Miller, Kimon H. Sargeant, Richard Flory, ''Spirit and Power: The Growth and Global Impact of Pentecostalism'', OUP USA , USA, 2013, page  152&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Warren Bird, [http://leadnet.org/world/ World megachurches], Leadership Network, USA, retrieved August 21, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Bird, outreachmagazine.com, [http://www.outreachmagazine.com/ideas/11952-pray-plan-coach-grow-elim-christian-mission.html  El Salvador: Pray, Plan, Coach, Grow at Elim Christian Mission], USA, June 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other facts==

On July 3, 2008, members of the church who were driving a private bus after a religious service are drifting down the river in the Salvadoran capital Acelhuate 31 people died, [9] This fact shocks the Salvadoran society and reopens a debate about the care of the environment and the status of risk mitigation works.

In August of that same year one of the members of the council of elders elected by the National Conciliation Party of El Salvador as a presidential candidate of these in the 2009 elections, [10] that application is not supported by the authorities the church and again puts the Elim church in the foreground in the country, but later his candidacy is withdrawn.
Organization

Elim Christian Mission International is run by a global spiritual Directive, a Council of Ministers (acting as an advisory and consultative body) people led by Mario Vega, who in turn is the Senior Pastor of the church in San Salvador, so practically it is the highest authority of the mission not only locally but internationally speaking.

Each church subsidiary or daughter, has at least one pastor who is the spiritual and administrative guidance of the congregation, also a council of elders who collaborates with the local pastor or leader or principal in local projects, their system of government is autonomous and each church is therefore self-financing and self-propagate. Pastors meet quarterly akin to be encouraged by the preaching of Pastor accountable while cell growth obtained in these three months.

Internally each congregation to develop two types of service area: the exteriors and interiors. those who develop the cellular system outside or outside the congregation are: supervisors, leaders, assistant leader, hosts, secretaries, treasurers, leaders of children, etc. internal servers: they develop their service during religious celebrations being deacons, deaconesses, committee support, protocol area, children's church, radio committee, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4392">'''The Moroccan-British Society (MBS)''' was created on 23 February 2003.&lt;ref name=mbsedi&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial|url=http://www.mbs.ma/En/index.htm|publisher=MBS|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is ‘to provide means and allow Moroccans and British people to acquire a better mutual understanding of their civilizations, cultures and political, academic, scientific, economic, financial, and commercial institutions so as to promote and foster their friendly relations and their cooperative ties in every domain.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.mbs.ma/En/about.htm|publisher=Moroccan British Society|accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lalla Joumala is president of the MBS since its inception.

Lalla Joumala called for greater dialogue between faiths. Speaking at a 2007 conference on the necessity for [[Muslim]]s to adopt democracy, she said that there was a ‘vital necessity’ to increase dialogue between the three religions ([[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]]); that ‘values shared by these religions transcend the theological differences of our spiritual pluralism’; and that a better understanding of ‘what we share can help us better accept and respect what separates us.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslims need to adopt political system that guarantees respect of law and religion|url=http://www.maroc.ma/NR/exeres/AE9A0238-41AD-4453-A8C9-76656F52E953.htm|publisher=Government of Morocco|accessdate=21 April 2012|date=3 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701110928/http://www.maroc.ma/NR/exeres/AE9A0238-41AD-4453-A8C9-76656F52E953.htm#|archive-date=2007-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
In 2007, the MBS became the main sponsor of ‘Sacred: Discover what we share’, a [[British Library]] project that displayed the oldest surviving texts of the [[Abrahamic faiths]] side by side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sacred texts that reveal a common heritage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/26/religion.books|accessdate=21 April 2012|newspaper=Guardian|date=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joumala described the project as ‘aiming to foster inter-religious dialogue in these times of prevalent political and religious tensions internationally’. She went on: ‘The Moroccan British Society, in contributing to this event, seeks to underline
the Moroccan example, where interfaith respect is the norm. [[Islam]] in [[Morocco]] has always opposed extremism and enabled people to live in peace, harmony and good intelligence with all faiths and religious communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Moroccan British Society at "Sacred": Discover What we Share|url=http://www.mbs.ma/En/images/Press_Kit.pdf|publisher=Moroccan British Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversial donation==
In 2004, the Middle East Centre (MEC) at [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony’s College]] of [[Oxford University]] received a £1.5m donation from the Moroccan British Society (MBS) to establish ‘the King Mohammed VI Fellowship in Moroccan and Mediterranean Studies’.&lt;ref name=simcox/&gt; In 2007, Eugene Rogan wrote that ‘The King Mohammed VI Fellowship in Moroccan and Mediterranean Studies has served as the basis for extending cooperation between Moroccan academics and Great Britain, and has enabled the MEC to develop its work in [[North Africa]] significantly.’ However, although Rogan regarded the donation as a merely academic exercise, for the donors it was seen as a diplomatic move aimed at benefiting the Moroccan state and its unelected rulers. Examples contributing to this can be found on the website of the Moroccan British Society. Because there is little mention of academic goals, but the public relations aspect of the Fellowship and its goal of ‘raising the profile of Morocco at Oxford and in the UK in general’ are emphasised.&lt;ref name=simcox&gt;{{cite web|last=Simcox|first=Robin|title=A Degree of Influence|url=http://w.socialcohesion.co.uk/files/1301651125_1.pdf|publisher=The Centre for Social Cohesion|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4697">'''Naftali Hertz ben Yaakov Elchanan (Bacharach)''' (17th century) was a German rabbi, born in [[Frankfurt]], author of the controversial work ''Emeq HaMelekh'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mystic Tales from the Emek HaMelech|url = https://www.amazon.com/Mystic-Tales-HaMelech-DovBer-Pinson-ebook/dp/B00ZGTXOHG|publisher = Iyyun Publishing|date = 2015-06-10|first = R. DovBer|last = Pinson|first2 = R. Naftali|last2 = Hertz}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Valley of the King'', 1648, [[Amsterdam]]) on the subject of the [[Isaac Luria|Lurianic Kabbalah]].

== Biography ==
His most well-known work ''Emeq HaMelekh'' was based mainly on [[Israel Sarug]]'s ''Limmudei Azilut'' (published 1897), incorporating large portions of that text. It seems very likely that Bacharach borrowed heavily from many sources (including [[Sarug]], [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]], and [[Shabbetai Horowitz]]) without acknowledging the debt (Scholem 1974).  The book had a major impact on later kabbalah as it was regarded among many, including the [[Chabbad Hasidim|Chabad Hasidim]] and the followers of the [[Vilna Gaon]], as an authoritative statement of Luria's kabbala. Its influence is also evident in [[Ramchal]]'s system. The book indicates that, prior to the conquest of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Babylonian captivity]], the prophet [[Jeremiah]] hid the treasures of [[Solomon's Temple]], with the assistance of five others.

Although ''Emeq HaMelekh'' contained approbations from well-respected scholars {{Harv|Goldworm|1989|p=158}}, it also met with substantial disapproval from contemporary kabbalists such as [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai]],  [[Berechiah Berak]], and [[Moses Hagiz]].  See Scholem (1974) for more details.
[[File:Hébron Synagogue Avraham Avinou.jpg|thumb|The historic Avraham Avinu synagogue in Hebron.]]
The book ''Emeq HaMelekh'' is the source for the famous story about the historic [[Avraham Avinu Synagogue|Avraham Avinu synagogue]] in [[Hebron]]. According to the introduction, a stranger appeared on the evening of Yom Kippur to serve as the 10th man of the minyan and thus complete the required number of people for a prayer service. After Yom Kippur, the rest of the congregation couldn't find him. That night the [[hazzan]] of the synagogue dreamed that the man was speaking to him and told him that he was Avraham Avinu, the Patriarch of the Jewish people who is buried nearby in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs|Cave of Machpela]]. The full text of this story and the original cover of the book today hangs on a plaque in the Avraham Avinu synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Avraham Avinu Synagogue: Miracle past and present by David Wilder|url = http://www.hebron.com/english/article.php?id=590|website = www.hebron.com|access-date = 2016-01-14|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055238/http://www.hebron.com/english/article.php?id=590|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first '''National Meeting of Black Women''' ({{lang-pt|I Encontro Nacional de Mulheres Negras}}, I ENMN) took place between 2 and 4 December 1988, in [[Valença, Rio de Janeiro]], with the participation of 450 women from 17 Brazilian states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfemea.org.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1152&amp;Itemid=129|title=Encontro Feminista Latino-Americano e do Caribe: Negros tempos para o Feminismo|publisher=Centro Feminista de Estudos e Assessoria|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Encontro Nacional resulted from a great impulse to organize among black women, mainly the fluminenses, who already prepared the I Encontro Estadual de Mulheres Negras of [[Rio de Janeiro]], in 1987.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The Encontro Estadual represented a mark in the [[feminist movement]] guaranteeing that only black women participated in the event, created the opportunity for constituting an "introspective organisation". That posture was challenging not only in front of some sectors of the feminist movement, as well as of traditional leaders of the black movement. Even with the caused tension, it was imperative that black women constituted their expressing spot in an independent way. The meeting, that occurred in the Brazilian city of [[Nova Iguaçu]], counted with a considerable participation of state black women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=I Encontro Nacional de Mulheres Negras: o pensamento das feministas negras na década de 1980, In: PEREIRA, A. M. (Org.); SILVA, J. (Org.). O Movimento de Mulheres Negras: escritos sobre os sentidos de democracia e justiça social no Brasil.|date=2014|publisher=Editora Nandyala|edition=1|location=Belo Horizonte|last1=DA SILVA|first1=Joselina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a medium for the organisation of the Encontro Estadual, the fluminense black women also participated in the IX Encontro Nacional Feminista, in [[Garanhuns]] (PE). After a long road trip and the challenges imposed by the lack of resources, already in a first moment, they could note the racial thematic was not in the main subjects of the event.{{Clarify|date=December 2016}} As Sandra Bello tells, the class question was present in the meeting, because many feminists didn't accept the active participation of black women with a profile related to the suburban and to the [[favela]]s. Also, these women represented a rupture with the eurocentric feminist vision, through which white feminists "defined the quotas of participation of black women in the Meetings".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Versing about the preparation process of I ENMN, Joselina da Silva recognises that the IX Encontro Nacional Feminista made the responsibility of black women of Rio de Janeiro in relation to the enacting of the state event appear, while the same became part of the organisation of the Encontro Nacional that would unite Brazil's black women. As a participant of the organisation of the national event, Joselina highlights the high level of difficulty, both in financial, political and cultural aims, considering that the organising commission was integrated by women of different movements and day-to-day life experiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the preparations for the national event, reunions followed gathering an ever greater participation of more Brazilian states, getting the presence of nine states in the reunion at São Paulo. In these occasions several organisational aspects and two commissions were created, one executive and one organisational. The Executive Commission was in charge of fourteen black women from Rio de Janeiro, elected by direct and secret vote. The Organisational Commission was formed by the States present in the national reunions. At the same time, several public activities were organised to offer divulgation and visibility to the Meeting, as well as a course for the selection of the visual identity of the event.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Joselina da Silva highlights that one of the problems found in the consecution of the national event was the place of its enaction, based in the available money.{{Clarify|date=December 2016}} In respect to the difficulty found by the Executive Commission to find a place where the event could be enacted, there was chosen a hotel where the activities would take place; while others scattered around the city of Valença would guard the participants and their families.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
During the meetings that culminated in this first meeting at a national level, the organisers were able to bring to the discussion and listen to the demands of black women from the most diverse regions of the country and socioeconomic realities. During the meeting itself, black women found a space to fulfill their specific, everyday demands, derived from the [[intersectionality]] between, mainly, gender, race and class. If, on one hand, they could show the falsity of the abolition of slavery, in its centenary; on the other hand, also would denounce the domestic violence suffered by black women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

I ENMN was looking for a greater pluralisation of social demands, expliciting conflicts beyond those related to the dynamics of social classes. Everyday questions, intimately connected to relations of power, could be transformed. Under this view, new analytic possibilities would be capable of promoting collective transforming actions. This thought was important in defining one of the general objectives of the meeting: "make emerge the most diverse forms of fight and autodetermination against the forms of existing discrimination". Another general objective focused in the construction of new analytic places: "set an unitary perspective of fight inside the social, cultural and political diversity of the women present at the Meeting".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Generally, the Meeting covered six distinct methodologies, recognising the multiple identity aspects by offering voice to women belonging to different social, academic and political origins. To guarantee inclusion, it was necessary that a significant number of women would be inserted in the organisation team and that a division into different sectors would be needed. According to Joselina, the group of subjects present in the terms developed by the participants shows that race and gender were the analyses's deflagrators. Other contributions should also be received, because black women could be victims of different discriminatory manifestations on social subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the same time, according to the opening talk of the Meeting, spoken by Maria José Lopes da Silva (member of the executive commission), in that moment, the question of the black woman was essential in the reconstruction process of the Brazilian democracy:

&lt;!--Portuguese: "No processo de revisão do lugar da mulher na sociedade brasileira, desencadeado pelo movimento de mulheres há uma década, a questão da mulher negra passa assim a se constituir um dos agentes fundamentais da reconstrução democrática deste país. A partir desta expectativa, então, surge o nosso primeiro encontro nacional. Ao lado da reflexão do papel da mulher negra na realidade brasileira pretende-se nesse encontro desenvolver uma discussão acerca da relação entre mulher negra e principais atividades da vida social com a necessidade de aprofundar nessa relação que envolve a participação de mulheres de vários setores como: movimentos negros, movimentos de mulheres, sindicatos, associações comunitárias e entidades organizadas do movimento social que levou a se empreender esse primeiro encontro tendo como tema central a mulher negra. Na busca do enriquecimento do debate e visando ampliar o seu alcance este encontro está aberto a participação de delegações de todo o país cabendo ao Estado do Rio de Janeiro a responsabilidade de sediá-lo".--&gt;
"In the process of review of the place of the woman in the Brazilian society, triggered by the women movement one decade ago, the question of the black women becomes constituting one of the fundamental agents of democratic reconstruction of this country. So, from this expectation, appears our first national meeting. Aside from reflecting the purpose of the black woman in the Brazilian reality it is pretended in this meeting to develop a discussion about the relation of black woman and main activities of social life with the necessity of improving that relation that involves the participation of women from various sectors like: black movements, women movements, syndicates, communitary associations and organised entities of the social movement that led to this first meeting having as its central theme the black woman. In the search for enrichening the debate and willing to widen its range, this meeting is opened to participation of delegations of the entire country, having the State of Rio de Janeiro the responsibility of hosting it."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eventos.livera.com.br/trabalho/98-1020549_01_07_2015_02-16-26_8633.PDF|title=Memórias dos I e II Encontros Nacionais de Mulheres Negras pelo olhar das ativistas baianas|website=eventos.livera.com.br|last1=Santos|first1=Ana Cristina Conceição}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of this opening talk, itis inferred the big amplitude of this Meeting, making it the reflection point about the condition of black women in society. In this space, black activists could formulate strategies that “retrofed” their day-to-day fights against several lived exploitation forms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

==Historical contexts==
{{main | New Rome}}

Revival of things Roman and their co-option for symbolic importance have a long history. ''Nova Roma'' (in Latin, literally "New Rome") in its deliberate revival of grandiose remnants of the past thus parallels and echoes other New Romes such as:

* the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] or Eastern Roman Empire as a surviving embodiment of [[Roman ideals]] based on [[Constantinople]] (sometimes chartacterised as [[Names of Constantinople|"New Rome" or the "Second Rome"]]) after the decline of the Roman imperium in the  West.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
* the doctrine of the [[Third Rome]] as justification for imperial Muscovite and Russian ambitions from the 15th century onwards&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:OrdoAurumSolisseal.gif|thumb|right|The Great Star, official seal of Ordo Aurum Solis]]
'''Ordo Aurum Solis''' ("Order of the Gold of the Sun") is a [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] and [[Theurgic]] order founded in England in 1897 by [[George Stanton]] and Charles Kingold. It is a vehicle of the Ogdoadic Tradition, itself an important element of the [[Western Mystery Tradition]]. Ordo Aurum Solis is best known through the published works of two of its past Grand Masters, Vivian Godfrey and Leon Barcynski. Better known by their pseudonyms, Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips, the husband and wife team together authored many books (some reappearing in newer editions) that cover different aspects of magical practice, such as the ''Llewellyn Practical Guide to Astral Projection'' and ''Llewellyn Practical Guide to Creative Visualization'', as well as their seminal work (reprinted in three volumes) outlining the philosophy and practices of Ordo Aurum Solis: ''The Magical Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;Denning, Melita, and Osborne Phillips. ''Llewellyn Practical Guide to Astral Projection.'' Woodbury: Llewellyn Publications, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denning, Melita, and Osborne Phillips. ''Llewellyn Practical Guide to Creative Visualization.'' Woodbury: Llewellyn Publications, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denning, Melita 2000"&gt;Denning, Melita, and Osborne Phillips. ''The Foundations of High Magick: The Magical Philosophy.'' St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denning, Melita, and Osborne Phillips. ''The Sword and the Serpent: The Two-Fold Qabalistic Universe.'' St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denning, Melita, and Osborne Phillips. ''Mysteria Magica: Fundamental Techniques of High Magick.'' St. Paul: Llewellyn Publications, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a few similarities to the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], some of its descendants, various [[Thelema|Thelemic]] orders, and other groups stemming from the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] revival of the 19th century, Ordo Aurum Solis represents a distinct and unique system of magical philosophy and practice based on the Ogdoadic Tradition

==Ogdoadic Tradition==
The Ogdoadic Tradition stems from the [[Mediterranean]] [[mystery religions]] of [[ancient Greece]] as well as the Theurgic practices of the priesthoods of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. Its signature symbol is the Eight-pointed Star of Regeneration, an emblem signifying the Regeneration of the Soul and Divine Inspiration. Its philosophy and practices appear in the works of early Hermetists and the teachings of the [[Neoplatonic]] schools of [[Alexandria]], [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]], and [[Athens]] in [[Late Antiquity]]. According to its [[initiates]], the father-figure of the Tradition is [[Hermes Trismegistus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aurumsolis.org/tradition Tradition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbols and philosophy of the Ogdoadic Tradition were also expressed in [[Byzantine art]]. The Ogdoadic Tradition, as mentioned in ''The Foundations of High Magick'' (''The Magical Philosophy'', vol. 1) by Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips, made itself evident in the frescos painted by [[Giotto]] (1270-1337) and was also incorporated into the construction of the Baptistery at Florence.&lt;ref name="Denning, Melita 2000"/&gt;

==Initiatory structure==

The initiatory structure of Ordo Aurum Solis consists of three "Halls", preceded by a special training in the ''Circle of the Pronaos''. The three grades associated with the Halls of the Order are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721184804/http://www.aurumsolis.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53:initiatory-structure&amp;catid=63:initiation&amp;Itemid=119&amp;lang=en]&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Servitor'', or ''Servitor of the Secret Flame''
# ''Adeptus Minor'', or ''Priest of the Gnosis''

==History ==

===Birth of the Golden Chain===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Various initiatic traditions existed in ancient Greece. These were called ''Mysteries''. In [[Greece]] the [[Mysteries of Eleusis]], [[Samothrace]], [[Orpheus]], and [[Dionysus]] were among the most important, and in [[ancient Rome]] and across its empire, the [[Mithraic]] and Isiac Traditions. These effectively combined the sacred Mysteries with the rationalism of [[Philosophy]], which constituted the real genius of such [[esoteric]] traditions.

[[Greeks|Greek]] initiates were strongly present in Alexandria, in the latest period of [[Egypt]]ian history known as the [[Ptolemaic period]]. They brought with them the Greek initiatic system of the Mysteries, which was then incorporated by the [[ancient Egyptian]] priests into their traditions, thereby giving a new, coherent structure to the same. According to Ordo Aurum Solis and its initiates, this was the real birth of the Hermetic Theurgic Tradition, later to be known as the Ogdoadic Tradition, or Ordo Aurum Solis. As [[Sumer]]ian and Egyptian magic also found their place in the clear system of the ancient Greek Mysteries, the Western initiatic tradition was born.

===Rebirth of the Order===
Just before the dawn of the 20th century, there were a number of "antiquarian" and "folklore" societies in England that chronicled curiosities and pursued their own chosen researches. One such society was known as the ''Societas Rotae Fulgentis'' (i.e., “Society of the Blazing Wheel”) and had been slowly amassing a wealth of knowledge and research from its various antecedents in the Ogdoadic Tradition.
To this society belonged two dedicated [[occultists]], Charles Kingold and George Stanton. In the changing religious and political environment of the late 19th century, they decided to take the core philosophy of the Societas Rotae Fulgentis and constitute it into a living magical and initiatory order, establishing Ordo Aurum Solis in 1897 and reawakening the Golden Chain of the Greek and Egyptian initiatic heritage.

===Denning and Phillips===
Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips are the pen-names of Vivian Godfrey and Leon Barcynski, who together authored many books in the early days of [[Llewellyn Publications]]. Chief among these was the formal presentation of the Order Aurum Solis' philosophy and praxis: ''The Magical Philosophy''.
 
Melita Denning, a [[Jungian]] scholar, was the first female Grand Master of the Order. She led the Order from 1976 to 1987, and from 1988 till her death on March 23, 1997. Earlier in her life, she had traveled throughout the [[Middle East]] and the Mediterranean in search of [[occult]] knowledge. It was after six years of research that she finally came upon Ordo Aurum Solis.

Osborne Phillips was Grand Master of the Order from 1997 to 2003. He received magical training early in his life at the hands of Ernest Page, a [[London]] [[astrologer]] of some repute. In the early 1970s, he was in charge of [[psychic]] investigation as conducted by certain initiates of Ordo Aurum Solis. Phillips was also a student of [[Maung Maung Gyi (scholar)|U Maung Maung Ji]], who specialized in Eastern [[philosophical]] systems and was a co-worker of the UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aurumsolis.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=116&amp;Itemid=145&amp;lang=en Grand Masters]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carl Llewellyn Weschcke===
7th Grand Master of the Aurum Solis, Carl Llewellyn Weschcke was also the chairman of Llewellyn Worldwide, Ltd. until his death in 2015. He wrote several books on psychic empowerment and published, through Llewellyn, books of the Ordo Aurum Solis. Weschcke reaffirmed his support to the Hermetic Tradition in the foreword to Jean-Louis de Biasi's ''The Divine Arcana of the Aurum Solis''.&lt;ref&gt;Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn (2011). 'Foreword'. The Divine Arcana of the Aurum Solis: Using Tarot Talismans for Ritual &amp; Initiation. Woodbury, Minn. Llewellyn Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean-Louis de Biasi (Lifetime Grand Master)===
[[Jean-Louis de Biasi]], an author and [[philosopher]] born in [[Southern France]], has been involved in the Mystery Traditions for the past forty years. He has been Grand Master of Ordo Aurum Solis since 2003, as shown on the Order Aurum Solis' website. De Biasi has written books on the Ogdoadic Tradition, the [[Tarot]], the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]], and [[Freemasonry]]. As per his website, he now seems to be actively writing books in English. He wrote ''Secrets and Practices of the Freemasons: Sacred Mysteries, Rituals and Symbols Revealed'' and has written two books directly related to Ordo Aurum Solis: ''The Divine Arcana of the Aurum Solis'' and ''Rediscover the Magick of the Gods and Goddesses''.&lt;ref name="Biasi 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Biasi|first=Jean-Louis De|title='Secrets and Practices of the Freemasons: Sacred Mysteries, Rituals and Symbols Revealed|year=2010|publisher=[[Llewellyn Publications]]|location=Woodbury, Minn.|isbn=9780738723402|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqwxFGSl1LsC|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biasi|first=Jean-Louis de|title=The Divine Arcana of the Aurum Solis: Using Tarot Talismans for Ritual &amp; Initiation|publisher=[[Llewellyn Publications]]|location=Woodbury, Minn.|isbn=9780738720869|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbqSPpAj0sEC|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biasi|first=Jean-Louis de|title=Rediscover the Magick of the Gods and Goddesses|publisher=[[Llewellyn Publications]]|location=Woodbury, Minn.|isbn=9780738739977|url=http://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738739977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another book contains practices coming from the Aurum Solis.

==The Order today==
Vivian Godfrey (Melita Denning) was diagnosed with cancer early in 1997 and died on March 23 of that same year.

On June 14, 2003, Leon Barcynski (Osborne Phillips) retired as Grand Master and was succeeded by [[Jean-Louis de Biasi]], the current Grand Master, who subsequently made a declaration that bore witness to the Hermetic nature of the work of the Order.&lt;ref&gt;de Biasi, J.-L. (June 2003). [http://www.aurumsolis.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46:declaration&amp;catid=25&amp;Itemid=56&amp;lang=en 1st Declaration of the Grand Master]. Retrieved on 4/4/07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aurumsolis.org/about-us Official declaration]&lt;/ref&gt;

This initiatic order is present on several continents and has been one of the few to maintain a direct lineage through 120 years of existence. The current Grand Master Jean-Louis de Biasi continues to maintain the high moral standards of this tradition and its original system of teachings with countless unpublished material that is provided to its initiates. The practice of classical theurgy and philosophy as a way of life has been highlighted in the past years and seems an obvious continuation of this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aurumsolis.org/about-us About&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:stmaris.gif|thumb|The statue of ''Our Lady Star of the Sea'' venerated in the church of [[Sliema]], [[Malta]]]]
'''Our Lady, Star of the Sea''' is an ancient title for the [[BVM(RC)|Virgin Mary]].  The words ''Star of the Sea'' are a translation of the [[Latin]] title '''''Stella Maris'''''.

The title has been in use since at least the [[early medieval period]]. Originally arising from a [[scribal error]] in a supposed etymology of the [[Mary (name)|name ''Mary'']], it came to be seen as allegorical of Mary's role as "guiding star" on the way to Christ. Under this name, the Virgin Mary is believed to intercede as a guide and protector of seafarers in particular, the [[Apostleship of the Sea]], and many coastal churches are named ''Stella Maris'' or Star of the Sea.

==Etymology and history==
[[File:Sterrederzee.jpg|thumb|180px| The miraculous statue of Our Lady, Star of the Sea in [[Basilica of Our Lady (Maastricht)]], the most important Marian shrine of the [[Netherlands]].]]
The name ''stella maris'' is first applied to the Virgin Mary in the manuscript tradition of  [[Jerome|Saint Jerome]]'s Latin translation of the  [[Eusebius' Onomasticon|''Onomasticon'']] by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hinckley Allen, ''Star Names and Their Meanings'' (1899), p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt; although this is in fact a [[misnomer]] based on a [[transcription error]]. 
For reaching this meaning the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name ''Miryam'' (מרים) had to go through a series of transformations: in [[Judeo-Aramaic]] it became  ''Maryām'', rendered in [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''Mariam'' (Μαριάμ).
It was this form that was etymologized by Eusebius. He interpreted ''Maryām'' as ''mar-yam''  (מר-ים) "drop of the sea", based on  מר ''mar'', a rare biblical word for "drop"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Isaiah 40:15}} is the only instance in the [[Hebrew Bible]] where it takes this meaning;
''Strong's Concordance'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H4752&amp;t=KJV H4752], from the root מרר "trickle" ([https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H4843 H4843])&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yam (god)| ים ''yam'']]  "sea".&lt;ref name=Abarim&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Miriam.html#.ViYI_9IrKVN |title=Etymology and meaning of the name Miriam |work=Abarim Publications |author=Arie Uittenbogaard |date= |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jerome|St Jerome]] adopted this interpretation and translated the name into [[Latin]] as ''[[:wikt:stilla#Latin|stilla]] maris'', "drop of the sea", but at some later stage a copyist transcribed this into ''stella maris'', "star of the sea", and this transcription error became widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15464a.htm |title=The Name of Mary |last=Maas |first=Anthony |date=1912 |work=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another opinion{{huh|date=April 2017}} states that Jerome himself interpreted the name as meaning "star of the sea" or Stella Maris, by relating it to a Hebrew word for star, מאור (ma'or), from the verb אור ('or), to be light or shine.&lt;ref name=Abarim/&gt;

The etymologization of the name of Mary as "star of the sea" was widespread by the early medieval period. It is referenced in [[Isidore of Sevilla|Isidore]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (7th century).  The [[plainsong]] hymn "[[Ave Maris Stella]]" ("Hail, Star of the Sea") dates from ca the 8th century.
[[Paschasius Radbertus]] in the 9th century has an allegorical explanation of the name, writing that Mary is the "Star of the Sea" to be followed on the way to Christ, "lest we capsize amid the storm-tossed waves of the sea." 
In the medieval period, ''stella maris'' came to be used as a name of [[Polaris]] in its role as [[Pole star|lodestar]] (guiding star, north star); it may have been used as such since Late Antiquity, as it is referred to  as ἀειφανής "always visible" by [[Stobaeus]] in the 5th century, even though it was still some eight degrees removed from the [[celestial pole]] at that time. 

In the  twelfth century, Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] wrote: ''"If the winds of temptation arise;'' 
''If you are driven upon the rocks of tribulation look to the star, call on Mary; If you are tossed upon the waves of pride, of ambition, of envy, of rivalry, look to the star, call on Mary. Should anger, or avarice, or fleshly desire violently assail the frail vessel of your soul, look at the star, call upon Mary."''&lt;ref&gt;Hom. II super "Missus est," 17; Migne, P. L., CLXXXIII, 70-b, c, d, 71-a. Quoted in [[Doctor Mellifluus]] 31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony of Padua]] also wrote of Mary as Star of the Sea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/StAnthonyOfPaduaDoctorOfTheChurchUniversal#page/n57/mode/2up Huber, Raphael M., ''St. Anthony of Padua'', Milwaukee, The Bruce Publishing Company, 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Pius XII]] in his encyclical, [[Doctor Mellifluus]], also quoted Bernard of Clairvaux in saying; ''Mary ... is interpreted to mean 'Star of the Sea.' This admirably befits the Virgin Mother.. (for) as the ray does not diminish the brightness of the star, so neither did the Child born of her tarnish the beauty of Mary's virginity.''&lt;ref&gt;Bernard of Clairvaux quoted in [[Doctor Mellifluus]] 31&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stella maris'' was occasionally also used in reference to Christ. [[Robert Bellarmine]] (writing c. 1600) deprecated this use of the title, preferring the allegory of Christ as the [[Observations and explorations of Venus#Historical observations and impact|morning star]] as the "brightest star of all", classing the less-bright polar star as "paltry" (''exigua'').&lt;ref&gt; ''Haec appellatio stelle maris tribui solet Beate Virgini. Fortasse melius de Christo diceretur 'stella splendida et matutina' . . . . [N]am stella maris est stella polaris, quae exigua est. Stella splendida et matutina est stella omnium fulgentissima, quae ab astrologis dicitur stella Veneris''

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devotional application==
The idea of Mary as a guiding star for seafarers has led to devotion to Our Lady, Star of the Sea in many Catholic coastal and fishing communities. Numerous churches, schools and colleges are dedicated to ''Stella Maris, Our Lady Star of the Sea'', or ''Mary, Star of the Sea''.

[[Stella Maris Monastery]], the foundation house of the [[Carmelites|Carmelite order]] was established on Mount Carmel, Israel, in the early thirteenth century. The abbey was destroyed several times, but a refounded Stella Maris monastery is still considered the headquarters of the order.

Devotions to this title of Mary are found in the popular Catholic hymn, ''[[Hail Queen of Heaven, the Ocean Star]]'' and the ancient prayer ''[[Ave Maris Stella]]''. The widely sung "Sicilian Mariners Hymn", [[O Sanctissima]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsMPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA386 |title=The Sicilian Mariner's Hymn to the Virgin |editor-first=Isaac |editor-last=Reed |journal=[[European Magazine and London Review]] |volume=22 |number=5 |date=November 1792 |pages=385–386 |accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGEHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA176 |title=Stimmen der Völker in Liedern |chapter=An die Jungfrau Maria: Ein sizilianisches Schifferlied |first=Johann Gottfried |last=Herder |date=1807 |pages=175–176 |accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; also reflects this devotion.

===Patronage===
Our Lady, Star of the Sea is the patroness of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/p/patronage-of-nations.php Roten S.M., Johann. "Patronage of Nations", International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Roman Catholic Church honors Our Lady, Star of the Sea, with a feast day assigned to September 27.

==Seafarers==
The Apostleship of the Sea (AOS) is often known locally as Stella Maris, whom seafarers recognise for providing pastoral, practical and spiritual support via their port chaplains and ship visitors in ports around the world. Our Lady Star of the Sea is the patron of the AOS.&lt;ref name=Dayton&gt;[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/s/stella-maris.php Duricyy, Michael P., "Stella Maris: The Apostleship of the Sea", Marian Library, University of Dayton, February 3, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apostleship of the Sea]] has for many years now, been commemorating the Feast of Stella Maris, Our Lady, Star of the Sea, with Mass each year in September for seafarers. It is a day to pray for all seafarers and give thanks for their contribution to global trade. The dates, times and venues of Stella Maris Masses for 2018 in England and Scotland can be found [https://www.apostleshipofthesea.org.uk/stella-maris-masses-2018 here]. At a gathering during the Stella Maris Mass in [[Westminster Cathedral]] in 2016, Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal [[Vincent Nichols]] said, "Caring for seafarers is profoundly Christian thing to do".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3733">[[Protestantism]] has had a very minor impact on Spanish life since the [[Reformation]] of the 16th century, owing to the intolerance of the Spanish government towards any non-[[Catholic]] religion and the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. However, it has become more prevalent in the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Recent history==

===Francoist persecution===
Protestantism made a comeback following the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] of 1868, which resulted in the granting of greater religious liberties; this was rescinded again during [[caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Spanish State]].

In Franco's [[authoritarian]] [[Spanish State]], Protestantism was deliberately marginalised and persecuted. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|rebel forces]] persecuted the country's 30,000&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Payne, Stanley [https://books.google.com/books?id=JGoqcg22N4gC&amp;dq Spanish Catholicism: An Historical Overview], p. 186 ,1984 [[University of Wisconsin Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants, and forced many pastors to leave the country. Once authoritarian rule was established, non-Catholic [[Bible translations|translations]] of the [[Bible]] were confiscated by the police and Protestant schools were closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772711,00.html | work=Time | title=Religion: Protestant Persecution | date=21 April 1941 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 1945 Spanish Bill of Rights granted freedom of ''private'' worship, Protestants suffered legal discrimination and non-Catholic religious services were forbidden in public, to the extent that they could not be in buildings which had exterior signs indicating it was a house of worship and that public activities were prohibited.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, James Edward [https://books.google.com/books?id=pKEUoZinc6wC&amp;dq Church and State in the Modern World], p. 3,  2005 Greenwood Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|Catholic Church]] was declared official and enjoyed a close relation to the state, ethnically [[Basque people|Basque]] clergymen harboured [[Basque nationalism|nationalist ideas]] opposed to Spanish centralism and were persecuted and imprisoned in a "[[Concordate jail]]" reserved for criminal clergy.

===Present status===
At present, the Spanish government observes the [[1978 Constitution of Spain]] and the Law of Religious Freedom of 1980, thus guaranteeing many religious liberties to minorities. As of 2009, there are at least 1.5 million Protestants residing in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwrn.org/articles/27149/ "Protestants call for 'equal treatment'"], by "[[El Pais]]," December 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant denominations and groups include:
*[[Spanish Evangelical Church]]
*[[Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church]] - an [[Extra-provincial Anglican churches|extra-provincial church]] of the [[Anglican Communion]]
*[[Union of Evangelical Baptists of Spain]]
*[[Reformed Churches in Spain]]

There are also a number of accredited seminaries in the country. These include:

*The [[Protestant Faculty of Theology at Madrid (UEBE)]]
*The Assemblies of God Faculty of Theology in Barcelona

[[File:Pzcedcz Jewish memorial plaque.jpg|thumb|250px|Memorial plaque for the Jews of Przedecz, [[Chamber of the Holocaust]], [[Mount Zion]], [[Jerusalem]] ]]
The '''Jewish community of Przedecz''',   which accounted for a large proportion of the population of [[Przedecz]], a town in western Poland, was wiped out in the [[Holocaust]]. In [[Yiddish]] the city was known as ''Pshaytsh''. The town, which dates from the 14th century, is located midway between [[Chodecz]] and [[Kłodawa]]. It is {{convert|75|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Łódź]], {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Warsaw]] and {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Poznań]]. On the southeast, it borders on Lake Przedecz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.przedecz.net/index.php?en=1&amp;dzial=&amp;strona=&amp;kronika=&amp;nr= Przedecz.net - Nieoficjalny Serwis Miasta Przedecz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The earliest mention of Przedecz is in the 12th century, when it was owned by the Archbishops. In the second half of the 14th century, King Kazimierz purchased Przedecz and the surrounding lands from the Archbishops. It became  a transit station for traders travelling from south to north and east to west, and a commercial center for the surrounding farms.

Przedecz was granted city status before the end of the 14th century.

During the period of the Archbishops, Jews were forbidden to live there. Jewish settlement in Przedecz began towards the end of the 14th century. The Jewish cemetery is about six hundred years old.

In 1538,  a major fire destroyed most of Przedecz. Ten years later, the king granted the  right to produce and market [[liqueur]]s without paying [[tax]]es and allowed a market day each week.

During the war with Sweden in the mid-17th century, Przedecz was destroyed. Only forty houses remained. The financial situation of Przedecz flourished at the beginning of the 18th century when the king gave permission to have two market days each week and a [[fair]] six times a year.

==Jewish life==
[[File:Przedecztombstone.jpg|thumb|250px|Memorial at the site of the Przedecz Jewish cemetery]]
In a 1793 census, the population of Przedecz was 355, 139 of them Jews. By 1827, the town had grown to 1,935 persons, 346 of them Jews. Over the next three decades, the total population  increased by only 2,000, whereas the Jewish population rose to 606. In other words, during these thirty years, the percentage of Jews radically increased. This occurred because Jews from the neighbouring villages moved to Przedecz. By 1921, the population was 3,040, of whom 840 were Jews.

Przedecz consisted of a few streets, but it had all the components of Jewish community life: a synagogue, ''[[Beth midrash]]'', ''mikva'', Jewish schools, a [[yeshiva]], Jewish library, Jewish cemetery, ''[[eruv]]'', welfare and cultural organisations. Przedecz had its own [[rabbi]], ''[[shochet]]'' and ''[[mohel]]''.

In the early days, the ''shechitah'' of animals took place in the butcher's backyard,  and the ''shechitah'' of fowl in the ''shochet'''s backyard. Prior to the Second World War, a large [[abattoir]] was built under the auspices of the Local Council. In this new abattoir, sanitary conditions were better and there was regular [[veterinary]] inspection by the Polish authorities.

Many Jews were tailors, hatmakers, cobblers, etc. They worked from their homes assisted by their children and other employees, sometimes traveling from city to city to sell their wares. Other were small traders.

Each village had its market day; for Przedecz it was Monday. On Mondays, the non-Jews would come from their farms to sell butter, eggs and chickens, and stock up on items they needed produced by the Jews. From morning to evening, the market was crowded with people.

Apart from the big synagogue of Przedecz, there was a ''Chevrat Tehillim''. This served as a synagogue for the artisans of the city. Services were also held in the ''Bet Hamedrash''. The ''Bet Hamedrash'' had its own library. On Fridays two boys aged 13–14 went around the houses collecting money to buy new books and pay for the rebinding of the old ones.

The ''mikvah'' was situated very near to the lake and quite near to the ''Chevrat Tehillim''. The city had its own ''eruv'', which enabled the Jewish residents to carry in the streets on [[Shabbat]]. On occasions when the ''eruv'' was down,  the children would carry the ''[[siddur]]im'' and ''tallitot'' to the synagogue and bring the ''[[cholent]]'' to the houses from the bakery.

The religious affairs of the community were controlled by a committee (''Parnasai Ha’ir''). Every year members of the community would meet in the ''Bet Hamedrash'' and elect eight members to this committee. The function of the committee was to fix the salary of the rabbi and other religious officials, the price for ''shechitah'', the charge for the ''mikvah'', etc. A tax was levied on the families in order to pay for these services.

In Przedecz, there was a state elementary school. There was no high school and thus pupils who wished to study in a high school had to go to neighbouring cities. The elementary school was attended by both Jewish and non-Jewish children of the city. At first it was situated in the same building as the town hall, the school being upstairs and the town hall downstairs, but later a new large building was built on Stoldona Street.

For their religious instruction there was a ''Bet Sefer Ivri'', which would meet after regular school hours. Subjects such as ''Tanakh'' ([[Bible]]) and ''Dinim'' ([[Jewish law]]) were taught in this ''Bet Sefer Ivri''. In the religious education of the children, particularly of the boys, a love for [[Eretz Israel]] was prominent. In addition there was a ''Bet Ya’acov'' school for the more religious girls, although most of the Jews in Przedecz were observant. In the courtyard of the ''Bet Hamedrash'' there was another more religiously-oriented school. There was also a ''yeshivah'', whose principal was Rabbi Joseph Alexander Zemelman, the rabbi of Przedecz. For those who wanted to learn a trade such as tailoring, hatmaking or shoemaking, there were evening classes.

The city had a Jewish library that also functioned as a cultural centre. People met there in the evenings to read books, dance, listen to lectures, watch theatre performances, etc. The more religiously observant used the ''Agudah'' or ''[[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrachi]]'' facilities.

There were also welfare organisations in Przedecz, such as the ''Bikur Cholim'' society, which looked after the sick, and a "Benevolent Fund" which granted interest-free loans to needy Jews.

In 1926, with the assistance of the "Joint" a Jewish bank was set up in Przedecz. The main purpose of this bank was the granting of loans. These loans were made according to usual banking procedures and required two guarantors who were acceptable to the bank. This bank closed in 1936 as a result of the difficult financial situation of the Jews at that period.

During the 20th century, various [[Zionist]] groups were established in Przedecz, including branches of the [[General Zionists]], [[Poale Zion|Poale Zion Yemin]], [[Hashomer Hatzair]], the [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] and the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionists]]. Money was collected in Przedecz for the J.N.F. There were also a few [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Bundists]].

In 1937 there were seventy people who had voting rights for delegates to the 20th Zionist Congress held in Zurich that year, of whom all but three utilised their rights. The establishment of these groups caused friction between those of the right and those of the left. As a result, those of the left stopped coming to the Jewish library. For the younger people there was the Young Mizrachi and [[Betar]]. The programmes of these youth groups included activities on Shabbat afternoons.

[[Agudat Yisrael]] also had a branch in Przedecz, most of its members being [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerrer Hassidim]]. One of the people active in this branch was the Rabbi of Przedecz, Rabbi Zemelman.

There was even ''[[Hakhshara|Hachsharah]]'' (preparing people for ''[[aliyah]]'' to Eretz Israel) in Przedecz. This group had some fields in which young people planted and grew vegetables which they then sold in Przedecz.

The houses in Przedecz were mostly just one story high. Some were owned by the Jewish residents and others were rented from non-Jews. There was no running water in the houses. In the centre of Przedecz was a pump. Electricity was only installed in 1928. Before that, the residents used gas lights. There were very few telephones in Przedecz and radio was a luxury.

==German occupation==
In September 1939, Germany entered Poland and the Second World War began. A few weeks later on the night of the Festival of [[Shemini Atzeret]], 4 October 1939, the Germans set fire to the Przedecz synagogue. On the day after the Festival, the Germans summoned the Rabbi of the city together with some of the leaders of the community and they were forced to sign a statement that the Jews themselves had burnt down the synagogue and in addition they had to pay a fine for so doing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zachor.michlalah.edu/english/manhigim/manhigim_t.asp?num=38&amp;chug=manhigim&amp;color=144B5B Rabbi Yosef Alexander Zemelman, Przedecz and Warsaw, Poland]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans changed the name of the city to Moosburg.

In 1940 there were 769 Jews in Przedecz and nearly half of them were sent to forced labour camps. The majority of them died there from hunger and disease. The Germans set up a [[ghetto]] in Przedecz which was situated in the Old Market. In early 1942, the Germans packed the remaining Jews into the local church, where they were left with no food or water for three days. Many of them died from lack of air. On 24 April 1942 - 7 [[Iyar]] 5702, the remaining Jews were sent to the [[Chełmno extermination camp]] and the Jewish community of Przedecz was thus finally liquidated.

The 7th of Iyar has become the Memorial Day for this community.

The Rabbi of Przedecz managed to escape to [[Warsaw]], where he took an active part in the [[Warsaw Ghetto uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://zachor.michlalah.edu/english/manhigim/manhigim_t.asp?num=38&amp;chug=manhigim&amp;color=144B5B Rabbi Yosef Alexander Zemelman, Przedecz and Warsaw, Poland]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
Since the mid-1960s, former residents of Przedecz and their descendants have gone back to visit. Where the synagogue had formerly stood, the Poles built houses. All that remains of the Jewish cemetery is an empty field and trees. All the tombstones have disappeared. Today there are no Jews in Przedecz. A memorial to the Jews was erected in the cemetery. Very few survived the Holocaust, but some managed to leave Poland on the eve of the war, settling in [[Israel]], the United States and Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5767">{{About|teachers and spiritual leaders in [[Hinduism]] and [[Sikhism]]|other uses|Sant (disambiguation)}}
In [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], a '''sant''' is a human being revered for his or her knowledge of "self, truth, reality" and as a "truth-exemplar".&lt;ref name=william/&gt;{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=1-17|ps=}} In [[Sikhism]] it is used to describe a being who has attained spiritual enlightenment and divine knowledge/power through the union with the monotheistic God. &lt;ref name=Khalsa&gt;{{cite book | title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib: English Translation of Sri Guru Granth Sahib | publisher=Hand Made Books (Mandeep Singh) | author=Khalsa, Sant Singh  | year=2007 | location=Arizona | page=12-263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Sant'' is sometimes translated as "[[saint]]", but this is a [[false cognate]] (there is no [[etymology|etymological]] commonality).{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=3|ps=}} ''Sant'' is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] [[Verb|root]] ''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|sat]]'', which can mean "truth, reality, essence", and saint is derived from Latin ''sanctus'', which means "holy, sacred",&lt;ref name=william&gt;William Pinch (1996), Peasants and Monks in British India, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520200616}}, page 181 footnote 3&lt;/ref&gt; from Indo-European root ''sak-'', "to sanctify"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Watkins |first1=Calvert |url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/indoeurop.html#IR094600 |title=American Heritage Dictionary Indo-European Roots Appendix |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schomer and McLeod explain ''Sant'' as preceptor of ''Sat'' or "truth, reality", in the sense of "'one who knows the truth' or 'one who has experienced Ultimate Reality', that is a person who has achieved a state of spiritual enlightenment or mystical self-realisation".{{sfnp|Hawley|1987|p=57|ps=}}{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=2|ps=}} William Pinch suggests the best translation of ''sant'' is "truth-exemplar".&lt;ref name=william/&gt;

== Usage ==
''Sant'' differs from ''saint'' not merely in the etymological sense but also in usage. The word is used in various contexts:{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=1-17|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hawley|1987|p=57|ps=}}&lt;ref name=hawleymark&gt;John Hawley and Mark Juergensmeyer (2008), Songs of the Saints of India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195694208}}, pages 2-8&lt;/ref&gt;
*In fifteenth- and sixteenth-century India under Islamic rule,  it was used generally to describe teachers and poet-scholars who led worshippers and communities the praises of god or goddess within the [[Bhakti movement]] in [[Hinduism]].

*In modern era, the term sometimes describes any holy man or woman who advocates a particular form of spirituality or members of the group that leads a ''[[Sant Mat]]'' (teachings of a spiritual congregation).
*The term is also used in a generic sense and in this respect is similar to the usage of ''saint'' to indicate a morally good person. As such, it has been applied to a wide range of [[guru]]s (not to be confused with [[Sikh gurus]]) and other religious leaders.

== Sikhism ==
*In Sikhism, a ''Sant'', ''[[Brahmgiani]]'', or ''[[Bhagat]]'' is any human being that has attained God realization and spiritual communion with God. Sikhs believe that the divine energy of God can be experienced by humans on Earth. This is attained through continual recitation and spiritual internalization of God's name ([[Naam Japo]]/''Naam Simran''). Sikhs commonly utilize [[Waheguru]] as the name of God which translates into "Wondrous Guru". 
*Sants can originate from any religion. Figures such as [[Kabir]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdev]], and others are known as "Sants" or "Bhagats", despite some being of [[Islam]] or [[Hindu]] faith. Divine knowledge is universal, and their knowledge after obtaining enlightenment through ''Naam Simran'' has been compiled and included in the holy book of Sikhism, the [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]],
* Sants are holy persons of very exhalted status, one of being the ideal human being. As such, Sikhs are encouraged to seek the company and holy congregation of ''Sants'' (Sadh-Sangat), learn from them, and attain "santhood" through intensive reading and contemplation of Sikh scripture ([[gurbani]]) and ''Naam Simran''. 
*The virtuous life associated with a ''sant'' or a ''brahmgyani'' (one who has a perfect knowledge of God) is strenuously defined in Sikh [[gurbani]], most notably in the ''Sukhmani Sahib'' passage of the [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]]. Sikhism advocates for people of all faiths to realize and become one with God, and attaining union with God is the highest form of spiritual enlightenment. {{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=251-267|ps=}} &lt;ref name=Khalsa&gt;{{cite book | title=Sri Guru Granth Sahib: English Translation of Sri Guru Granth Sahib | publisher=Hand Made Books (Mandeep Singh) | author=Khalsa, Sant Singh  | year=2007 | location=Arizona | page=12-263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Satanic holidays''' have been described by both [[Satanists]] and by Christian authors, as well as by historians of [[witchcraft]], who in turn relied on Christian accounts.

==Satanist portrayal of Satanic days==
In ''[[The Satanic Bible#Religious Holidays|The Satanic Bible]]'', [[LaVeyan Satanism|Satanist]] [[Anton LaVey]] writes that "after one's own birthday, the two major Satanic holidays are [[Walpurgisnacht]] and [[Halloween]] ". Other holidays are the two [[solstice]]s and the two [[equinox]]es. Five to six weeks after each of the solstices and equinoxes are the "legendary Satanic revels" (a reference to the [[cross-quarter days]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the [[First Satanic Church]], an "Annual Black X-Mass Show" is also held every December, hosted by LaVey's daughter, [[Karla LaVey]].

==Christian portrayal of Satanic days==
Christian authors have written dozens of anti-Satanic books with lists of alleged "Satanic ritual days".&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/ra_date.htm Satanic Holidays - Days Of Celebration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance, some authors appear to lack major direct knowledge of Satanism, often making claims without citation or substantiation.&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"/&gt;

In ''[[The Edge of Evil]]'' "Grand High Climax" is said to be a major holiday celebrated by [[Satanism|Satanists]] on December 24.  Evangelical Christian author Jerry Johnston writes in this book that it is a celebration meant to juxtapose the Christian holiday of [[Christmas Eve]], when the birth of [[Jesus Christ]] is celebrated. However this goal to blaspheme is not always prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Jerry (1989). The Edge of Evil. Word Publishers, pg. 211. {{ISBN|0-8499-0668-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Johnston claims that Grand High Climax is traditionally celebrated with a [[Black Mass]], followed by great excesses of food, drink, sex, and merriment, but a rite called "Grand High Climax", and the details of the activities involved, is not a rite acknowledged by all Satanic groups. It was once part of the [[Satanic ritual abuse#As a moral panic|Satanic panic]] and beliefs about the [[Witches' Sabbath]].

'''Shemay''' (also '''Shemai''') was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian official and later [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] toward the end of the [[8th Dynasty]] (22nd century BCE) during the [[First Intermediate Period]], mainly known for being the beneficiary of most of the [[Coptos Decrees]].&lt;ref name="hayes46"/&gt; His career has been interpreted as a glaring sign of the extreme weakness of the central power, forced to bestow great privileges to maintain the loyalty of powerful local governors.&lt;ref name=Gardiner&gt;[[Alan Gardiner]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=lzhBbsElbKAC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Egypt of the Pharaohs: an introduction''], Oxford University Press, 1964, p.&amp;nbsp;108; quote: "But perhaps the most persuasive evidence of their short-lived domination is offered by some inscriptions discovered by Raymond Weill at Coptos in 1910–11. Under the ruins of a structure of Roman date were found carefully towed away a number of decrees carved in hieroglyphic on slabs of limestone, some dating from the reign of Pepy II, and most of them designed to protect the temple of Min and its priesthood from interference and the corvee. But among them as many as eight were apparently dispatched on the same day in the first year of a King Neferkare, the last king but one in the series of the Abydos list. The addressee was in each case the vizier Shemai and each royal command was concerned either with him or some member of his family. One of the decrees confirmed him in his vizierate in all the twenty-two nomes of Upper Egypt, while another recorded the appointment of his son Idi to the post of Governor of Upper Egypt in the seven southernmost nomes. A third decree grants precedence over all other women to Shemai's wife Nebye, who is described as a 'King's eldest daughter', and perhaps even more remarkable is a fourth making elaborate arrangements for the funerary cult of both husband and wife in all the temples of the land. There is no hint of unrest or political disturbance in any of these texts, though we may possibly read into them a desperate anxiety on the king's part to conciliate one specially powerful Upper Egyptian magnate."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt; Shemay is buried in a mudbrick mastaba just south of Coptos.&lt;ref name="gilbert"/&gt;

==Attestations==
Shemay is known primarily from the [[Coptos Decrees]], a series of decrees by various king of the [[Eighth Dynasty of Egypt|8th Dynasty]] granting titles and honours to him and his family. Shemay is also known from several rock inscriptions in the [[Wadi Hammamat]]&lt;ref&gt;Jules Couyat and Pierre Montet: ''Les inscriptions hiéroglyphiques et hiératiques du Ouadi Hammâmât'', MIFAO 34, Cairo 1912, pp. 90–92, pls. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; and from his tomb located just south of Coptos.&lt;ref&gt;Maha Farid Mostafa: ''Kom el-Koffar, part II: Datierung und historiche Interpretation des Textes B'', Annales du Services des Antiquites de l'Egypte 71, pp. 169–184, pls. I-II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maha Farid Mostafa: ''The autobiography 'A' and a related text (Block 52) from the tomb of Shemai at Kom el-Koffar/Qift'', Studies in honor of Ali Radwan II, Cahiers Supplement aux Anales du Service des antiquites de l'Egypte 34, ed. Khaled Daoud, Shafia Bedier and Sawsan Abd el-Fatah, pp.  161–195, pls. I-IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Career===
The earliest mention of Shemay came from the three Coptos Decrees “g” to “i” which are generally attributed to [[pharaoh]] [[Neferkaure]], and one of these is datable to his Year 4. These documents were displayed in the temple of [[Min (god)|Min]] at [[Coptos]] and were addressed to the ''[[Overseer of Upper Egypt|Governor of Upper Egypt]]'' Shemay — who had been [[nomarch]] of the ''[[Nomos of Harawî|Two Falcons nome]]'' with Coptos as capital — and concerning administrative matters about the cult of pharaoh [[Pepi II]] and the temple of Min. The earliest of the three decrees mention the new nomarch of Coptos named Idy who very likely was the same person of [[Idy (vizier)|Idy]], son of Shemay; furthermore, the latest of the three decrees ensured to Shemay the responsibility over the 22 [[nome (Egypt)|nome]]s of [[Upper Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;[[Toby Wilkinson]], ''The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt: The History of a Civilisation from 3000BC to Cleopatra'', London, Bloomsbury, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-7475-9949-4}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, king Neferkaure was succeeded by [[Neferkauhor]] and Shemay managed to marry his eldest daughter, princess Nebyet; in a single day of his Year 1 (possibly in the same day of his accession to the throne, the "Month 2 of ''[[Season of the Emergence|Peret]]'', Day 20"&lt;ref name="hayes46"&gt;[[William C. Hayes]], "Royal decrees from the temple of Min at Coptus", ''JEA'' 32, 1946, p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rice, ''Who is who in Ancient Egypt'', 1999 (2004), Routledge, London, {{ISBN|0-203-44328-4}}, p.&amp;nbsp;133&lt;/ref&gt;) Neferkauhor promulgated 8 of the Coptos Decrees (“j” to “q”), the beneficiary of which was always the newly promoted [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] Shemay as well as various member of his family.&lt;ref name=Gardiner/&gt;

The first decree concerned Nebyet's particular status — as well as Shemay's one, for being the son-in-law of the new pharaoh. Subsequent decrees established other new benefits for Shemay's sons: Idy again filled the vacuum left by his father, occupying the office of Governor of Upper Egypt (although he was responsible only of the 7 southernmost nomes of Upper Egypt&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Bunson, ''Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt''. Infobase Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|1438109970}}, p.&amp;nbsp;371.&lt;/ref&gt;) while another son earned a title in the temple of Min.&lt;ref name="hayes46"/&gt; Shemay and Nebyet also gained some privilege that were unprecedented for non-royal people: in fact, some priests were assigned to the [[funerary cult]] of their ''[[Ka (Egyptian soul)|ka]]'', and the couple was allowed to make their own mortuary monuments from royal-exclusively red [[granite]].&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;

It seems that Shemay was already defunct when the last of the Coptos Decrees (“r”) was issued by the ''[[Horus name|Horus]]'' Djemedjibtawy, who has been tentatively identified with both [[Wadjkare]] and [[Neferirkare]]: in fact it was addressed to the vizier Idy,&lt;ref name="hayes46"/&gt; providing evidence that once again the son followed his father's footsteps.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;

=== Titles===
In life, he gathered an impressive amount of titles and offices, in a decree he is called ''"...the god's father, beloved of god, king's (foster) child, pyramid-town overseer and vizier, overseer of scribes of the king's document, governor of Upper Egypt, sole companion, chamberlain, herdsman of [[Hierakonpolis]], chief of [[El Kab]], lector priest, overseer of the priest of Min"''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Eyre, ''The use of documents in pharaonic Egypt'', Oxford University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-19-967389-6}} pp.&amp;nbsp;224–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Further high titles are found in his tomb ''[[iry-pat]]'' (hereditary prince) and ''[[Haty-a]]'' (count).&lt;ref name="gilbert"/&gt;

== Tomb==

===Excavations===
Shemay is buried in a tomb {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Coptos on a hill within the flood plain, in modern Kom el-Koffar also known as Kom el-Momanien and Naga el-Kom. The tomb was first excavated in 1956 by [[Labib Habachi]] and then from 1979 until 1982 by Rabia Hamdan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Labib Habachi]]: ''God's Fathers and the Role They Played in the History of the First Intermediate Period'', ASAE 55 (1958), pp. 170–172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Labib Habachi: ''The Tomb of Princess Nebt of the VIIIth Dynasty discovered at Qift'', SAK 10 (1983), pp. 205–211&lt;/ref&gt; More recent excavation works have taken place in 2000 and 2002.&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;Gregory Gilbert: "Three recently excavated funerary stelae from the eighth dynasty tomb of Shemai at Kom el-Momanien, Qift", Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 90, pp. 73 – 79, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layout===
The tomb consists of a large mudbrick mastaba with a pillared hall in its center, which is entered from the North side via a forecourt and a {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} long causeway.&lt;ref name="gilbert"/&gt; All these structures are paved with limestone while the walls of the pillared hall were adorned with offering scenes.&lt;ref name="gilbert"/&gt; A red [[granite]] [[false door]] is located on the south-east wall of the hall. Several stelae representing Shemay were discovered in niches on the external northern face of the mastaba were offerings to Shemay would possibly have been made.&lt;ref name="gilbert"/&gt;

An inscription on the East wall of the hall is dated to the first year of the reign of [[Neferkauhor]], fourth month of the [[Season of the Harvest|Shemu]] season, day 2.&lt;ref&gt;Maha Farid Mostafa: ''The Mastaba of SmAj at Naga' Kom el-Koffar, Qift'', Vo. I, Cairo 2014, pp. 88-90, figs. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; This inscription is the sole contemporary attestation of Neferkauhor beyond the Coptos Decrees. The upper register of the wall shows on the left Shemay with his wife. In front of him are workmen dragging a stone. In the middle register is shown the slaughtering of a bull and the dragging of another stone. In this register king Neferkauhor is mentioned twice. The lowest register shows a boat fight in the marshes.&lt;ref&gt;Maha Farid Mostafa: ''The Mastaba of SmAj at Naga' Kom el-Koffar, Qift'', Vo. I, Cairo 2014, pp. 79-106&lt;/ref&gt; Another inscription details what Shemay's son Idy did for his father, giving offerings and ordering repair works in the necropolis.&lt;ref name="strudwick"&gt;Nigel C.

[[File:Gurudwara Athens Shri Guru Nanak Darbar.jpg|right|thumb|A Sikh temple in [[Athens]]]]
{{Sikhism sidebar}}

[[Sikhi]] in [[Greece]] dates back to 1942, when during the [[Axis occupation of Greece|Axis occupation]] of the country, the Sikhs came to the country as a part of the [[British Indian Army]].

==History==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
[[Sikhs]] have fought and passed through Greece in both [[World Wars]], in large number as part of the [[British Indian Army]]. [[Guru Nanak]] is also known to have passed through Greece in one of his journeys. A cemetery of [[Sikh]] soldiers of the [[British Indian Army]],still exists in [[Salonika]]. It was built in 1920,to bury the bodies of the [[British Indian Army|Sikh]] soldiers of the [[First World War]].However, The first Sikh community was formed in the 1950s by Sikh immigrants. They worked as farmers or fishermen in the [[Greek islands]]. Till the 1970s, the population of Sikhs in Greece was less than 200 people. After the 1970s, Sikh immigrants came to Greece through [[Turkey]]. Some of them started their own farm stores and recruited other immigrants to work with them.

In the 1990s the number of immigrants further increased. The Sikh community in Athens formed a small organization for their religious and social needs, which led to the building of [[Gurudwara]] Shri [[Guru Nanak]] Darbar. They called a [[granthi]], brought some ''saroops'' of [[Guru Granth Sahib]] and rented a large industrial space that served as the temple. It was known by the Greeks as the "Indian Organization of Tavros, Athens", however the [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] characters on the temple board translate to "Sikh Temple Shri Guru Nanak Darbar, Athens". This was done to prevent the possible future attacks on a foreign religious monument. Following Athens' Sikh community, some other Sikh immigrants also made temples in [[Oinofita]], [[Oropos]], [[Kranidi]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. A large place has been bought by the committee of one of the old Gurdwaras of [[Oinofita]],for the construction of new [[Gurdwara]], outside [[Schimatari]] and near to the Military Airport of [[Tanagra]]. Even though,a new construction of a [[Gurdwara]] needs lot of money, most of needed money has been donated by nearby-living [[Sikhs]] as [[Daswand]]. The saroop of [[Guru Granth Sahib]] was moved from the old building and moved to the new one,even though it is half-completed. It is the only non-rented and bought [[Gurdwara]] in [[Greece]]. The constructions are supposed to finish almost in 2018.

==Religious freedom==
The Sikhs are free to wear [[turbans]] except when riding motorcycles. They are free to wear [[the Five Ks]] except the ''[[kirpan]]'' in schools and public places. There are still many cases of  discrimination against the [[Sikhs]] in Greece.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Present==
The number of Sikhs living in Greece is estimated to be around 20, 000. Their main centers are Athens, [[Megara]], [[Chalkida]] and [[Psachna]]. Sikhs have the lowest number of people in prison. Sikhs in Greece consist of only two generations, the one that migrated from India and the other that was born there. Migration to Greece is very unpopular among [[Punjabis]], in general and [[Sikhs]] in particular. Practising [[Sikhs]] who wear turbans are often confused with [[Pakistanis]] or [[Radical Muslims]] and are often called racist names, assaulted and bullied on streets and schools. Attacks on Sikh properties particularly on Sikh [[Gurudwaras]] have been frequent, since the rise of [[Neo-nazi]] groups. Sikhs in Greece have still a long way to go to win many of their rights. Many Sikhs tend to migrate to other western countries like [[Sikhism in the United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Sikhism in Canada|Canada]], where the Sikh community is well-established.

==Attack on Sikh temples==

More than three times,{{says who|date=January 2018}} [[Molotov cocktail]] bottles have been thrown on the complex of the Athens [[Gurdwara]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} A small-scale{{weasel inline|date=January 2018}} demonstration was made by the Greek residents of [[Schimatari]]-[[Tanagra]],against the building of the new [[Gurdwara]] in [[Schimatari]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} The police,which was called for help by [[Sikhs]], made the mob to retire but they arrested many builders and charged them for not having certain licenses. The police released them after some{{weasel inline|date=January 2018}} hours.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Two gurdwaras in Marathon was attacked with Gunshots with no reported casualty. These are uttered as common by local Sikhs and is believed to be racially motivated crimes and been targeted by right wing and Neo nazi parties.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from [http://www.sikh24.com/2014/09/22/breaking-gunshots-fired-at-two-gurdwaras-in-greece/#.VB_BOMleAmQ Gunshots Fired at Two Gurdwaras in Greece]: sikh24.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4500">The '''Sojourners Community''' is an [[intentional community]] that was started in the early 1970s by a group of students at [[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]].{{sfn|Miller|1999|pp=99–100}} The founders had the desire to further explore the relationship between their orthodox [[Protestant]] faith and the social crisis that surrounded them,{{sfn|Miller|1999|pp=99–100}} particularly around the [[Vietnam War]]. In the fall of 1971, they began publishing the ''Post American'', a newspaper that expressed the group's commitment to the faith and ideas about social change. The Sojourners Community is most widely known for ''[[Sojourners]]'' magazine and for the writing and speaking of its founding member [[Jim Wallis]].

==History==
In the summer of 1971, the group organized an [[intentional community]] in [[Rogers Park, Illinois]].{{sfn|Miller|1999|p=100}} However, in 1974, the community disintegrated.{{sfn|Miller|1999|p=100}} The remaining members decided move to the [[inner city|inner-city]] neighborhood of [[Columbia Heights, Washington, D.C.|Columbia Heights]], [[Washington, D.C.]], where they could better address urban problems and national politics.{{sfn|Miller|1999|p=100}} Combining their assets and incomes, the group gradually established households and a network of social outreach programs.{{sfn|Miller|1999|p=100}} The community lived together in these common households together, shared a common purse, formed a worshiping community, got involved in neighborhood issues, organized national events on behalf of peace and justice and continued to publish ''[[Sojourners]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=about_us.history | work = Sojourners | title = History |accessdate=May 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vestige of the Sojourners' intentional living community remains its intern community, a group of individuals who are hired as year-long interns and who live together in intentional Christian community for that year as part of the internship experience.

Other [[Evangelical]]s have critiqued the Sojourners Community due to their combination of strict evangelical Protestant beliefs (though the Sojourners living community and wider organizational network has also long included [[mainline Protestant]]s and [[Catholic]]s) and radical "social priorities [which] run in markedly different directions".{{Sfn | Miller | 1999 | p = 100}}  Also, Sojourners differentiates from other evangelicals in its condemning of [[militarism]], corporate excesses, and the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of people in the [[Third World]].{{sfn|Miller|1999|p=100}} However, other social critiques are similar to those of other evangelicals on issues such as condemning of [[abortion]] (as part of a wider pro-life stance that includes protection of life from cradle to grave, i.e. anti-war and anti-hunger stances). Sojourners advocates economic justice and expanded services for the poor.{{Sfn | Miller | 1999 | p = 100}}

'''''The Men Who Stare at Goats''''' (2004) is a non-fiction work by [[Jon Ronson]] concerning the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s exploration of [[New Age]] concepts and the potential military applications of the [[paranormal]]. The title refers to attempts to kill [[goat]]s by staring at them and stopping their hearts. The book is companion to a three-part TV series broadcast in Britain on [[Channel 4]]—''Crazy Rulers of the World'' (2004)—the first episode of which is also entitled "The Men Who Stare at Goats". The same title was used a third time for a loose [[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|feature film adaptation]] in 2009.

==Content==

===Book synopsis===
The book's first five chapters examine the efforts of a handful of U.S. Army officers in the late 1970s and early 1980s to exploit [[paranormal]] phenomena, [[New Age]] philosophy, and elements of the [[human potential movement]] to enhance U.S. military intelligence-gathering capabilities as well as overall operational effectiveness. These include the ''[[First Earth Battalion|First Earth Battalion Operations Manual]]'' (1979) and a "psychic spy unit" established by Army Intelligence at [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade]], Maryland, in the late 1970s. (This was the [[Stargate Project]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Heard|Heard, Alex]] (10 April 2010), [http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050410/news_lz1v10close.html "Close your eyes and remote view this review"], ''[[U-T San Diego|Union-Tribune San Diego]]'', Union-Tribune Publishing Co.

Friedman (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=F4-p5TIyoNMC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=%22stargate%22+%22Ronson%22+goat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QIlHwOOgGW&amp;sig=cx1XQux2TmMR7EK_lNPR-0o-r-0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=osRLVdvQFsWggwTirYHQCg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stargate%22%20%22Ronson%22%20goat&amp;f=false ''Debating Psychic Experience: Human Potential Or Human Illusion?''], Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger/Greenwood Publishing Group, pg 154: “The story of Stargate was recently featured in a film based on the book ''The Men Who Stare at Goats'', by British investigative journalist Jon Ronson (2004)”.&lt;/ref&gt; which the book never mentions by name.) Ronson is put on the historical trail of the "men who stare at goats"—[[U.S. Special Forces|Special Forces]] soldiers who supposedly experimented with psychic powers against [[de-bleated]] goats at [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]], at the now-decommissioned "Goat Lab" medical training facility. He examines, and dispenses with, several candidates for the legendary "master sergeant" (Chapter 2) who was reported to have killed a goat simply by staring at it, in the earliest days of the program. A martial arts instructor named Guy Savelli claims to be the one.

In the middle third of the book (Chapters 6-11), the author leaps to the present day—i.e., 2004, just after the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib abuse]] revelations—and attempts to make connections between the earlier (now terminated, and mostly discredited) military programs and the abuses resulting from the post-9/11 [[War on Terror]] (Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, psyops in Iraq, etc.). This includes the use of the children's song "[[Barney &amp; Friends]]" on Iraqi prisoners-of-war. A purported linking element is the alleged use of music and [[subliminal messaging]] at the 1993 [[Waco siege]] and other FBI operations. Another is the private business "franchises" and consultancies that retired members of the "psychic unit" later pursued as civilians. A connection is also proposed between these "privatized" psychics and the mass-suicide of members of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate cult]] in 1997.

The final section of the book (Chapters 13-16) leaps backward to the 1950s and attempts to connect the Army psychic program, and later interrogation techniques, with the CIA's [[MK-ULTRA]] "mind control" research program and the notorious death of Army researcher [[Frank Olson]] in 1953. Ronson spends time with Olson's son Eric as he attempts to uncover the mystery of his father's death. The reason his father was terminated, as we discover, was not simply because he knew too much but, rather, that he was having a crisis of conscience and seriously entertaining the notion of going public with all that he knew. The narrative ends with the suggestion that the "psychic warriors" are now back in business working for the U.S. military again, possibly in support of assassinations.

==Reception==
Ronson's book was met with mostly positive, often glowing, reviews: the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' opined that it is "a hilarious and unsettling book.... Ronson comes off as an unusual cross between [[Comedy Central]]'s [[Jon Stewart]] and ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s [[Seymour Hersh]]." ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} [[Janet Maslin]] stated that "Ronson sets up his book perfectly. It moves with wry, precise agility from crackpot to crackpot in its search for the essence of this early New Age creativity....".

Some critics, however, were skeptical of what they considered Ronson's shaky logic and some of his bolder assertions. [[Alex Heard]]'s review in ''[[U-T San Diego]]'' was subtitled "''Goats'' tries hard to link psychic-spy projects from the past to today's events, and mostly fails". In many instances, he wrote, "...there isn't a link. Instead there's a progression of occurrences that don't connect in a meaningful way. The result is a strange new blend: Conspiracy theory meets Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.... You're left feeling like you've been told a shaggy-goat story."&lt;ref&gt;Heard, ''[[Op. cit.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
{{Expand section|date=November 2015}}
The 2004 series ''Crazy Rulers of the World'' was aired in three parts:

*Part 1: "The Men Who Stare at Goats"
*Part 2: "Funny Torture"
*Part 3: "The Psychic Footsoldiers"

It was broadcast in Britain on [[Channel 4]].

==Feature film adaptation==
{{Main article|The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)}}
A fictionalized feature film version of the book was released in 2009 under the same name. [[Grant Heslov]] directed from a script by [[Peter Straughan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/01/entertainment/ca-bridges1 | title=Jeff Bridges, psychic warrior | work=LA Times | date=November 1, 2009 | author=Geoff Boucher}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is set in [[Iraq]], but was filmed in Comerío Street, [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico]] and at the [[New Mexico Military Institute]]. The story centers on "Bob Wilton" ([[Ewan McGregor]])—the Ronson stand-in—a desperate reporter who stumbles upon the story of a lifetime. He meets "Lyn Cassady" ([[George Clooney]])—a composite character—who claims to be a former secret U.S. military psychic soldier re-activated post-[[9/11]]. [[Jeff Bridges]] plays "Bill Django"—clearly a version of [[Jim Channon]]—the founder of the psychic soldier program and Lyn's mentor. [[Kevin Spacey]] plays "Larry Hooper"—a wholly fictional character—who is a former psychic soldier now running a rogue [[Psychological Operations (United States)|PsyOps]] unit in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/48782-these-are-the-men-who-stare-at-goats | title=These are The Men Who Stare at Goats | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=September 12, 2008 | accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is prefaced with a title card stating "More of this is true than you would believe". The DVD release of ''The Men Who Stare at Goats'' includes a bonus documentary featuring Ronson and many of the people who feature prominently in his book.

Coinciding with the release of the feature film in 2009, [[John Sergeant (journalist)|John Sergeant]], the producer of the TV series ''Crazy Rulers of the World'', accused Ronson of "airbrushing him out of the story". While Ronson dedicated his book to Sergeant and included an afterword commending his research and guidance, the feature film did not mention his contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-sergeant/how-i-was-airbrushed-out_b_362356.html |title=How My Involvement with The Men Who Stare at Goats Was Erased Entirely |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2009-12-01|accessdate=2010-03-29 |first=John |last=Sergeant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/clooney-caught-in-crossfire-as-war-breaks-out-over-latest-film-1813635.html |title=Clooney caught in crossfire as war breaks out over latest film – News, Films |publisher=The Independent |date= 2009-11-03|accessdate=2010-03-29 | location=London | first=Arifa | last=Akbar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tommaso Palamidessi''' ([[Pisa]], February 16, 1915 – [[Rome]], April 29, 1983) was an Italian [[esotericist]]. Precociously attracted by [[astrology]], [[parapsychology]], and [[yoga]]-[[neotantra|tantric]] doctrines, he was led by his manifold interests in the field of the [[occult]] and by his intense spiritual pursuit to build up an original form of [[Esoteric Christianity]], which he called Archeosophy. In 1968, he founded in Rome the [[Archeosophical Society]], which is still active and counts a few thousand members both in Italy and in the rest of Europe (mainly in [[Germany]], [[Portugal]], and [[France]]).&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Baroni, ''Tommaso Palamidessi e l'Archeosofia.

== Biography==

===Youth and studies===

Born in Pisa on 16 February 1915 to Carlo Palamidessi, Senior Officer of the Army and the poet Luigia Tagliata, in 1920 Tommaso Palamidessi moved to Sicily. Since he was a child he studied [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[botany]], [[medicine]] and [[religion]] and as an adolescent he traveled to [[Tripoli]] and [[Tunis]] to deepen his knowledge of Islamic [[Sufism]].

From 1933, when he moved to Turin, he applied himself to intensive research into [[astrology]], [[alchemy]] and [[Tantric yoga]], extrasensory experiences, favoured by his mediumistic predisposition, [[Egyptology]] and the study of hieroglyphs - the latter carried out in collaboration with the director of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, Ernesto Scamuzzi.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Baroni, ''Tommaso Palamidessi e l'Archeosofia. Vita ed opere di un esoterista cristiano'', Foggia: Bastogi, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He also has out-of-body experiences, bilocations and remembrances of his past lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Introvigne]], ''Il Cappello del mago.I nuovi movimenti magici, dallo spiritismo al satanismo'', Milan: Sugarco, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;330-332 (French translation: ''La magie: les nouveaux mouvements magiques'', Paris : Droguet et Ardant, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

His publications about Tantric yoga include: ''The Occult Powers of Man and the Indo-Tibetan Tantric Yoga'', ''Sexual Technique of Tantric Yoga''; ''The Erotic Power of Kundalini Yoga''; ''Yoga not to Die''. During these years, he also wrote an extensive unpublished commentary on Egyptian theurgy and the ''[[Book of the Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Baroni, ''Tommaso Palamidessi e l'Archeosofia. Vita ed opere di un esoterista cristiano'', Foggia: Bastogi, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The forties and astrological works===
Towards the end of the 1940s Palamidessi, as mentioned, began to teach astrology and yoga. He became one of the first Italian Astrological authors  of the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Baroni, " Tommaso Palamidessi et l'Archéosophie ", in ''La Tentation du secret, Groupes et sociétés initiatiques entre ésotérisme et politique du XVIIIème au XXème siècle'', Politica Hermetica n° 21 (2007), p. 120-135.&lt;/ref&gt; In the catalogue of the National Library Service only six treatise of astrology written by Italian authors appear from 1900 to 1939. For the most these are general introductions and often mixed with chiromancy, physiognomy and occultism. In these years Tommaso Palamidessi wrote six astrological treatise:  ''The Course of Stars and Man's Diseases; Medicine and Sidereal Influences''; ''Mundane Astrology'' (1941); ''Cosmic Influences and the Precocious Diagnosis of Cancer'' (1943) ''Earthquakes, Eruptions and Cosmic influences'' (1943) and not forgetting the ''Perpetual Effemerides'' (1941)

In Italy during the 1900s the first volumes dedicated to two once glorious disciplines : World astrology and medical Astrology are treated .  
At the time, Palamidessi established contacts with exponents of the Hamburg Astrologic School, to whom he dedicated an article in the journal ''Astral Language'' . Among the foreign contacts of Tommaso Palamidessi we can mention  the French,  such as,  [[Alexandre Volguine]] ( 1903-1976), [[Henry Joseph Gouchon]] (1898-1978) and [[Jacques Reverchon]] (1909-1985). Like Reverchon, Gouchon gravitates around the journal  Cahiers Astrologiques (1938-1983) founded  by Volguine. 
We can certainly add the English [[Francis Rolt-Wheeler]] (1876-1960), a curious and polyhedral figure, writer and Anglican priest with which Palamidessi held a collaborative relationship.

===The fifties===

In 1947 Tommaso Palamidessi married Rosa Francesca Bordino (1916–1999) who did stand by him for a lifetime and gave him a daughter, Silvestra (1948–1996). In 1949 a radical spiritual crisis drove him to a deep conversion to Christ and consequently he decided to suspend his yoga publications.

In 1953 he moved to Rome with his family and contributed to various newspapers, among which it is worth mentioning his collaboration with the ''Tribuna Illustrata'', the most ancient Italian weekly magazine where he wrote a section about [[esotericism]] and [[astrology]] until 1969 when the magazine disappeared. He visited the monasteries of [[Kalambaka]], [[Thessaly]] and Mt. [[Mount Athos|Athos]] in 1957 and Jerusalem in the Easter of 1966 where he had special revelations on the Mt. Golgotha and in [[Gethsemane]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Introvigne]], ''Il Cappello del mago.I nuovi movimenti magici, dallo spiritismo al satanismo'', Milan: Sugarco, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;330-332 (French translation: ''La magie: les nouveaux mouvements magiques'', Paris : Droguet et Ardant, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alexandria of Egypt he rediscovered archaeological sites that he had already seen during his paranormal experiences by which he had remembered to have been [[Origen]] (185-254), instructor at the Didaskaleyon, school of Christianity founded by the evangelist St. Mark in Alexandria. The study of Patristics did consolidate his faith in what he regarded the authentic [[Esoteric Christianity]]. By this time his formulation of a new doctrinal synthesis for the spiritual awakening of man and woman took shape in [[Archeosophical Society|Archeosofica]].&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Baroni, ''Tommaso Palamidessi e l'Archeosofia. Vita ed opere di un esoterista cristiano'', Foggia: Bastogi, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The foundation of Archeosofica===
[[Image:Archeosofica.png|thumb|150px|The emblem of the Archeosophical Association]]

On 29 September 1968 Tommaso Palamidessi founded [[Archeosophical Society|Archeosofica]], ''Esoteric School of High Initiation'' in Rome. The foundation of ''Archeosofica'' was rooted in Palamidessi's spirit of collaboration toward spiritual realizations.
Indeed, Tommaso Palamidessi founded Archeosofica as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''a free school for free scholars, who must not feel like pupils nor apprentices, but brothers who listen to the living voice of other brothers.''[...]

''It is a call addressed to all, and it does not matter if they belong to the different communities ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]], [[Anthroposophy|Anthroposophists]], [[Freemasonry|Martinists]], [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]], [[Christianity|Catholics]], [[Yoga|Yoghists]], etc.). The Brotherhood is only one, and it can have only one verb: Love one another; only one Master: Jesus the Christ.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Tommaso Palamidessi ''Archeosofia'', en 5 volumes, Rome: Archeosofica, 1985-1988&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following years, he journeyed to India, Kashmir, Nepal China, South America but from 1968 forth his efforts was consecrated above all to the nourishing of the archeosophical doctrine and to the organisation of the many groups of study and experimentation that have soon spread all over Italy. Then in 1973 he founded a  cultural association namely [[Archeosophical Society]] with the aim of developing and diffusing Archeosophy all over the world.

===Definition of Archeosophy===
{{quote|

Archeosophy is the integral knowledge, it is the archaic wisdom or, in other words, the ''Science of the Principles''. As already said, this word stems from the Greek terms ''archè'' (principle) and ''sophìa'' (wisdom). Archeosophy facilitates the knowledge of the superior worlds through the development in man of new senses defined as spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Tommaso Palamidessi, ''Tecniche di risveglio iniziatico: i centri di forza e la metafisica sperimentale'', Rome : Edizioni Mediterranee, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeosophy is not only a [[philosophy]] that explains the origin and the end of man and of the cosmos of which he is a part, but it is first of all a pure experimental method; it never loses sight of the fact that philosophy has been the surrogate, often  unreliable, for the moral and intellectual support of man, who watches impotently at his and others' caducity from birth to  death. It holds that philosophy was born when man lost his spiritual contact with the Absolute or Arkè, that is as soon as his  dialogue and life of union with God became increasingly obfuscated, fragmentary and doubtful. Philosophy became, in a sense,  the instrument for formulating the working hypothesis, the theoretical way to return to the Arkè, full of strident contradictions.

Therefore Archeosophy, before being a philosophy, is continuous experimentation, deep knowledge of ourselves (gnosis), of nature and of God; it is the reinstatement in the Primordial Tradition, as a true, real and living contact with the supersensible worlds.|Tommaso Palamidessi|''Archaic Tradition and Foundations of Archeosophical Initiation'', 1968}}

===The archeosophical ascesis===

The archeosophical ascesis aims at solving the religious problem of a correction of human life that does not rely on either one's whim or on chance but on a solid spiritual Science and on techniques of spiritual awakening and interior transmutation. The program includes special gymnastics, breathing techniques, psycho-dynamic actions on hormones and nerve plexus in order to ascend to what corresponds to body and, though not being body, makes up the whole of the energetic bodies permeating the organic one with the purpose of finally reaching the causal body where the immortal I resides. [[Out-of-body experience]]s (in order to have a direct, personal experience of spiritual worlds), methods of meditation on the [[chakra|centres of force]] directly linked with the three principles of the immortal Ego (such as the meditation on the heart defined by Palamidessi as [[cardiognosis]] or "inner knowledge of one's heart) and exercises of remembrance of some past lives are part of the itinerary of self-awareness and of the journey towards God. suggested by [[Archeosophical Society|Archeosofica]].

In his treatise ''Tecniche di Risveglio Iniziatico'' (Techniques of Initiatic Awakening) (Ed.Mediterranee 1975) Tommaso Palamidessi presents a program of integral ascesis where techniques of meditation on the centres of force and on the divine names on the one hand, an intense inner life devoted to transcendence, on the other and finally a cautious use of astral influences in order to determine the most convenient moments for the ascetic practices, converge on the unique purpose of granting a spiritual regeneration in a Christic sense.&lt;ref&gt;Tommaso Palamidessi, ''Tecniche di risveglio iniziatico: i centri di forza e la metafisica sperimentale'', Rome : Edizioni Mediterranee, 1975 (2nd ed. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The artistic ascesis===

A special form of ascesis is carried out through art.
Deeply interested in the mystical, theological and artistic tradition of the [[Orthodox Church]], Tommaso Palamidessi brings back to light the technique for preparing and painting a sacred [[icon]]. The work he dedicates to this subject, ''L'Icona, I colori e l'Ascesi Artistica'' (tr.: Icon, Colours and Artistic Ascesis) (published posthumously in 1986) is a real handbook which aims at starting the reader off on the personal preparation of a sacred icon and on meditating on it. By following the rules of the chromatic symbolism as well as the traditional geometry of sacred art, the artist can make of his own icon a "castle of meditation", by which he transcends the formal aspect of the image and becomes sensitive to the divine archetypes hidden behind it. In this sense the icon has a sanctifying effect on the conscience of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;Tommaso Palamidessi, ''L'icona, i colori e l'ascesi artistica: dottrina ed esperienze per una Via verso l'autosuperamento ed una coscienza divina nell'arte'', Rome : Edizioni Mediterranee, 1975 (2nd ed. 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important key for the mystic and initiatic self-realisation included in the ascetic program of [[Archeosophical Society|Archeosofica]] is linked with the discoveries made by Tommaso Palamidessi over [[sacred music]] and its importance for the catharsis and the awakening of the [[chakra|spiritual centres]] in the regenerated Man.

In [[Vaishnavism]], Vishnu is identical to the formless metaphysical concept called [[Brahman]], the supreme, the [[Svayam Bhagavan]], who takes various [[avatar]]s as "the preserver, protector" whenever the world is threatened with evil, chaos, and destructive forces.&lt;ref name="Zimmer 1972 p. 124"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zimmer|first1=Heinrich Robert|authorlink1=Heinrich Zimmer|title=Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01778-5|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Myths_and_Symbols_in_Indian_Art_and_Civi.html?id=PTfNMQP81nAC|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; His avatars most notably include [[Rama]] in the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. He is also known as [[Narayana]], [[Jagannath]], Vasudeva, [[Vithoba]], and [[Hari]]. He is one of the five equivalent deities worshipped in [[Panchayatana puja]] of the [[Smarta Tradition]] of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Flood 1996, p. 17"/&gt;

In Hindu iconography, Vishnu is usually depicted as having a pale or dark blue complexion and having four arms. He holds a [[Padma (attribute)|padma]] (lotus flower) in his lower left hand, [[Kaumodaki]] [[Gada (weapon)|gada]] (mace) in his lower right hand, [[Panchajanya]] [[shankha]] (conch) in his upper left hand and the [[Sudarshana Chakra]] (discus) in his upper right hand. A traditional depiction is Vishnu reclining on the coils of the serpent [[Shesha]], accompanied by his consort [[Lakshmi]], as he "dreams the universe into reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred S.

[[Yaska]], the mid 1st-millennium BCE [[Vedanga]] scholar, in his [[Nirukta]] (etymological interpretation), defines Vishnu as ''viṣṇur viṣvater vā vyaśnoter vā'', "one who enters everywhere". He also writes, ''atha yad viṣito bhavati tad viṣnurbhavati'', "that which is free from fetters and bondages is Vishnu".&lt;ref name=VishwaBagchee12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adluri|first=Vishwa|author2=Joydeep Bagchee |title=From Poetic Immortality to Salvation: Ruru and Orpheus in Indic and Greek Myth|doi=10.1086/662191 |journal=History of Religions|date=February 2012|volume=51|issue=3|pages=245–246|jstor=10.1086/662191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval Indian scholar [[Medhātithi]] suggested that the word ''Vishnu'' has etymological roots in ''{{IAST|viś}},'' meaning ''to pervade'', thereby connoting that Vishnu is "one who is everything and inside everything".&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p84"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K.

===Vedas===
Vishnu is a [[Vedas|Vedic]] deity, but not a prominent one when compared to [[Indra]], Agni and others.&lt;ref name="Gonda1969p1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|authorlink=Jan Gonda|title=Aspects of Early Viṣṇuism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8urRsuUJ9oC |year=1969|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1087-7|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just 5 out of 1028 hymns of the [[Rigveda]], a 2nd millennium BCE Hindu text, are dedicated to Vishnu, and he finds minor mention in the other hymns.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p84"/&gt; Vishnu is mentioned in the [[Brahmana]] layer of text in the Vedas, thereafter his profile rises and over the history of Indian mythology, states [[Jan Gonda]], Vishnu becomes a divinity of the highest rank, one equivalent to the Supreme Being.&lt;ref name="Gonda1969p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p167"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=Vedic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (1996 Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1113-3|pages=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a minor mention and with overlapping attributes in the Vedas, he has important characteristics in various hymns of Rig Veda, such as 1.154.5, 1.56.3 and 10.15.3.&lt;ref name="Gonda1969p1"/&gt; In these hymns, the Vedic mythology asserts that Vishnu resides in that highest home where departed [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (souls) reside, an assertion that may have been the reason for his increasing emphasis and popularity in Hindu [[soteriology]].&lt;ref name="Gonda1969p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p10"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=Vedic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (1996 Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1113-3|pages=9–11, 167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also described in the Vedic literature as the one who supports heaven and earth.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p84"/&gt;

In the Vedic hymns, Vishnu is invoked alongside other deities, especially Indra, whom he helps in killing the symbol of evil named [[Vritra]].&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p18"/&gt; His distinguishing characteristic in Vedas is his association with light. Two Rigvedic hymns in [[Mandala 7]] refer to Vishnu. In section 7.99 of the Rgveda, Vishnu is addressed as the god who separates heaven and earth, a characteristic he shares with Indra. In the Vedic texts, the deity or god referred to as Vishnu is [[Surya]] or Savitr (Sun god), who also bears the name ''Suryanarayana''. Again, this link to Surya is a characteristic Vishnu shares with fellow Vedic deities named Mitra and Agni, where in different hymns, they too "bring men together" and cause all living beings to rise up and impel them to go about their daily activities.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p29"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=Vedic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (1996 Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1113-3|pages=29–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hymn 7.99 of Rigveda, Indra-Vishnu are equivalent and produce the sun, with the verses asserting that this sun is the source of all energy and light for all.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p29"/&gt; In other hymns of the Rigveda, Vishnu is a close friend of Indra.&lt;ref name="Nilakanta Sastri 1980"&gt;Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1980). ''Advanced History of India'', Allied Publishers, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in Rigveda, Atharvaveda and Upanishadic texts, Vishnu is equivalent to Prajapati, both are described as the protector and preparer of the womb, and according to Klaus Klostermaier, this may be the root behind post-Vedic fusion of all the attributes of the Vedic Prajapati unto the avatars of Vishnu.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p84"/&gt;

In the [[Yajurveda]], Taittiriya Aranyaka (10.13.1), [[Narayana sukta]], Narayana is mentioned as the supreme being. The first verse of Narayana Suktam mentions the words ''paramam padam'', which literally mean ''highest post'' and may be understood as the ''supreme abode for all souls''. This is also known as Param Dhama, Paramapadam or Vaikuntha. Rig Veda 1.22.20 also mentions the same ''paramam padam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahmapurāṇa|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=J2c6-tAt4vwC|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=1989|page=106|author=Renate Söhnen-Thieme, Renate Söhnen, Peter Schreiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Atharvaveda]], the mythology of a boar who raises goddess earth from the depths of cosmic ocean appears, but without the word Vishnu or his alternate avatar names. In post-Vedic mythology, this legend becomes one of the basis of many cosmogonic myth called the [[Varaha]] legend, with Varaha as an avatar of Vishnu.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p18"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=Vedic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass (1996 Reprint)|isbn=978-81-208-1113-3|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hymns of the Rigveda repeat the mighty deed of Vishnu called the ''Trivikrama'', which is one of the lasting mythologies in Hinduism since the Vedic times.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K.

The Vishnu Sukta 1.154 of Rigveda says that the first and second of Vishnu's strides (those encompassing the earth and air) are visible to the mortals and the third is the realm of the immortals. The Trivikrama describing hymns integrate salvific themes, stating Vishnu to symbolize that which is freedom and life.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p85"/&gt; The [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] elaborates this theme of Vishnu, as his herculean effort and sacrifice to create and gain powers that help others, one who realizes and defeats the evil symbolized by the Asuras after they had usurped the three worlds, and thus Vishnu is the savior of the mortals and the immortals ([[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]).&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2000p85"/&gt;

The Shatapatha Brahmana contains ideas which Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism has long mapped to a pantheistic vision of Vishnu as supreme, he as the essence in every being and everything in the empirically perceived universe. In this Brahmana, states Klaus Klostermaier, Purusha Narayana (Vishnu) asserts, "all the worlds have I placed within mine own self, and mine own self have I placed within all the worlds".&lt;ref name=klostermaier86/&gt; The text equates Vishnu to all knowledge there is (Vedas), calling the essence of everything as imperishable, all Vedas and principles of universe as imperishable, and that this imperishable which is Vishnu is the all.&lt;ref name=klostermaier86&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=Hinduism: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3LXAAAAMAAJ| year=2000| publisher=Oneworld| isbn=978-1-85168-213-3| pages=85–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vishnu is described to be permeating all object and life forms, states S Giora Shoham, where he is "ever present within all things as the intrinsic principle of all", and the eternal, transcendental self in every being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Giora Shoham|title=To Test the Limits of Our Endurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_hOAQAAIAAJ |year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Scholars |isbn=978-1-4438-2068-4|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedic literature, including its Brahmanas layer, while praising Vishnu do not subjugate others gods and goddesses. They present an inclusive pluralistic [[henotheism]]. Max Muller states, "Although the gods are sometimes distinctly invoked as the great and the small, the young and the old (Rig veda 1:27:13), this is only an attempt to find the most comprehensive expression for the divine powers and nowhere is any of the gods represented as the subordinate to others. It would be easy to find, in the numerous hymns of the Veda, passages in which almost every single god is represented as supreme and absolute".&lt;ref&gt;History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature by Prof Max Muller. Printed by Spottiswoode and Co. New-Street Square London. page 533&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upanishads===
The [[Vaishnava Upanishads]] are minor [[Upanishad]]s of [[Hinduism]], related to Vishnu theology. There are 14 Vaishnava Upanishads in the [[Muktika]] anthology of 108 [[Upanishads]].{{Sfn|Deussen|1997|p=556}} It is unclear when these texts were composed, and estimates vary from the 1st-century BCE to 17th-century CE for the texts.{{Sfn|Mahony|1998|p=290}}{{Sfn|Lamb|2002|p=191}}

These Upanishads highlight Vishnu, [[Narayana]], [[Rama]] or one of his [[avatar]]s as the supreme metaphysical reality called [[Brahman]] in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Mahony1998p271"&gt;{{cite book|author=William K.

===Puranas===
[[File:Bhagavata Purana (Ancient Stories of the Lord) Manuscript LACMA M.88.134.4 (2 of 2).jpg|thumb|The [[Bhagavata Purana]] is centered around [[Krishna]], a Vishnu avatar.]]
[[File:011 Vishnu (32881394093).jpg|thumb|5th-century Vishnu at [[Udayagiri Caves]].]]
Vishnu is the primary focus of Vaishnavism-focused [[Puranas]] genre of [[Hindu texts]]. Of these, according to [[Ludo Rocher]], the most important texts are the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Vishnu Purana]], [[Nāradeya Purana]], [[Garuda Purana]] and [[Vayu Purana]].{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp= 59-61}} The Purana texts include many versions of cosmologies, mythologies, encyclopedic entries about various aspects of life, and chapters that were medieval era regional Vishnu temples-related tourist guides called ''mahatmyas''.{{Sfn|Ariel Glucklich|2008|p=146, '''Quote:''' The earliest promotional works aimed at tourists from that era were called ''mahatmyas''.}}

One version of the cosmology, for example, states that Vishnu's eye is at the Southern Celestial Pole from where he watches the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IsSpbyjw5DMC&amp;pg=PA273&amp;lpg=PA273 | title = Sinister Yogis | isbn = 978-0-226-89515-4 | author1 = White | first1 = David Gordon | page=273 with footnote 47| date = 2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another version found in section 4.80 of the Vayu Purana, he is the Hiranyagarbha, or the golden egg from which were simultaneously born all feminine and masculine beings of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.M Masson|title=The Oceanic Feeling: The Origins of Religious Sentiment in Ancient India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swsrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |year=2012|publisher=Springer Science|isbn=978-94-009-8969-6|pages=63 with footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vishnu Purana presents Vishnu as the central element of its cosmology, unlike some other Puranas where Shiva or Brahma or goddess Shakti are. The reverence and the worship of Vishnu is described in 22 chapters of the first part of Vishnu Purana, along with the profuse use of the synonymous names of Vishnu such as Hari, Janardana, Madhava, Achyuta, Hrishikesha and others.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=246-247}}

The Vishnu Purana discusses the Hindu concept of supreme reality called [[Brahman]] in the context of the [[Upanishad]]s, a discussion that the theistic Vedanta scholar [[Ramanuja]] interprets to be about the equivalence of the Brahman with Vishnu, a foundational theology in the [[Sri Vaishnavism]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Sucharita Adluri (2015), Textual authority in Classical Indian Thought: Ramanuja and the Visnu Purana, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415695756}}, pages 1-11, 18-26&lt;/ref&gt; Vishnu is equated with [[Brahman]] in [[Bhagavata Purana]], such as in verse 1.2.11, as "learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this non-dual substance as [[Brahman]], Paramatma and Bhagavan."&lt;ref&gt;Bhagavata Purana [http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/11/en 1.2.11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523204721/http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/11/en |date=23 May 2006 }}, ''vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam yaj jnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bhagavata Purana'' has been the most popular and widely read Purana texts relating to Vishnu avatar Krishna, it has been translated and available in almost all Indian languages.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pages=112}} Like other Puranas, it discusses a wide range of topics including cosmology, genealogy, geography, mythology, legend, music, dance, yoga and culture.{{Sfn|Kumar Das|2006| pages=172–173}}{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=138–151}} As it begins, the forces of evil have won a war between the benevolent ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'' (deities) and evil ''[[asura]]s'' (demons) and now rule the universe. Truth re-emerges as the Vishnu avatar first makes peace with the demons, understands them and then creatively defeats them, bringing back hope, justice, freedom and good – a cyclic theme that appears in many legends.&lt;ref&gt;Ravi Gupta and Kenneth Valpey (2013), The Bhagavata Purana, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149990}}, pages 3-19&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Bhagavata Purana'' is a revered text in [[Vaishnavism]].&lt;ref&gt;Constance Jones and James Ryan (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Infobase, {{ISBN|978-0816054589}}, page 474&lt;/ref&gt; The Puranic legends of Vishnu have inspired plays and dramatic arts that are acted out over festivals, particularly through performance arts such as the [[Sattriya]], [[Manipuri dance]], [[Odissi]], [[Kuchipudi]], [[Kathakali]], [[Kathak]], [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Bhagavata Mela]] and [[Mohiniyattam]].{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|pages=118}}{{Sfn|Varadpande|1987|pages=92–97}}&lt;ref&gt;Graham Schweig ( 2007), Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions (Editor: Yudit Kornberg Greenberg), Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-1851099801}}, pages 247-249&lt;/ref&gt;

Some versions of the Purana texts, unlike the Vedic and Upanishadic texts, emphasize Vishnu as supreme and on whom other gods depend. Vishnu, for example, is the source of creator deity [[Brahma]] in the Vaishnavism-focussed Purana texts. Vishnu's iconography typically shows Brahma being born in a lotus emerging from his navel, who then is described as creating all the forms in the universe, but not the primordial universe itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=ed. by Edwin F.|title=Krishna : a sourcebook|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-514891-6|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Shiva]]-focussed Puranas describe Brahma and Vishnu to have been created by [[Ardhanarishvara]], that is half Shiva and half Parvati; or alternatively, Brahma was born from [[Rudra]], or Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma creating each other cyclically in different aeons ([[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]).&lt;ref name="Stella Kramrisch 1994 pages 205-206"&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1994), The Presence of Siva, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691019307}}, pages 205-206&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Vaishnava Puranas, Vishnu takes the form of Rudra or commands Rudra to destroy the world, thereafter the entire universe dissolves and along with time, everything is reabsorbed back into Vishnu. The universe is then recreated from Vishnu all over again, starting a new ''Kalpa''.&lt;ref name=doniger71&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxoaUKmMG9gC&amp;pg=PA71|year=1988|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61847-0|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this the ''Bhagavata Purana'' employs the metaphor of Vishnu as a spider and the universe as his web. Other texts offer alternate cosmogenic theories, such as one where the universe and time are absorbed into Shiva.&lt;ref name=doniger71/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Presence of Siva|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5BanndcIgUC |year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-01930-4|pages=274–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sangam and post-Sangam literature===

The Sangam literature refers to an extensive regional collection in Tamil language, mostly from the early centuries of the common era. These Tamil texts revere Vishnu and his avatars such as Krishna and Rama, as well as other pan-Indian deities such as Shiva, [[Kartikeya|Muruga]], Durga, Indra and others.&lt;ref name=padmaja27&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

===Bhakti movement===
Ideas about Vishnu in the mid 1st millennium CE were important to the [[Bhakti movement]] theology that ultimately swept India after the 12th century. The [[Alvars]], which literally means "those immersed in God", were Tamil Vaishnava poet-saints who sang praises of Vishnu as they travelled from one place to another.&lt;ref name=olson231&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Carl|title=The many colors of Hinduism: a thematic-historical introduction|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|year=2007|page=231|isbn=978-0-8135-4068-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established temple sites such as [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam|Srirangam]], and spread ideas about [[Vaishnavism]]. Their poems, compiled as Alwar Arulicheyalgal or [[Divya Prabhandham]], developed into an influential scripture for the Vaishnavas. The [[Bhagavata Purana]]'s references to the South Indian Alvar saints, along with its emphasis on ''bhakti'', have led many scholars to give it South Indian origins, though some scholars question whether this evidence excludes the possibility that ''bhakti'' movement had parallel developments in other parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Sheridan| first=Daniel| title= The Advaitic Theism of the Bhagavata Purana |publisher=South Asia Books |location=Columbia, Mo |year=1986 |isbn=81-208-0179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=[[J.

==Vaishnava theology==
{{Vaishnavism}}

{{Main article|Vaishnavism| Pañcaratra}}

The Bhagavata Purana summarizes the Vaishnava theology, wherein it frequently discusses the merging of the individual soul with the Absolute [[Brahman]] (Ultimate Reality, Supreme Truth), or "the return of Brahman into His own true nature", a distinctly [[Advaitic]] or non-dualistic philosophy of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]].{{sfn|Kumar Das|2006| pages=172–173}}&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;{{Sfn|Sheridan|1986|pp=1–2, 17–25}} The concept of [[moksha]] is explained as ''Ekatva'' (Oneness) and ''Sayujya'' (Absorption, intimate union), wherein one is completely lost in Brahman (Self, Supreme Being, one's true nature).&lt;ref name="Rukmani_217-218" /&gt; This, states Rukmini, is proclamation of "return of the individual soul to the Absolute and its merging into the Absolute", which is unmistakably Advaitic in its trend.&lt;ref name="Rukmani_217-218" /&gt; In the same passages, the Bhagavata includes a mention of [[Bhagavan]] as the object of concentration, thereby presenting the [[Bhakti]] path from the three major paths of Hindu spirituality discussed in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name="Rukmani_217-218"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rukmani|1993|pp=217–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Murray Milner Jr.|title=Status and Sacredness: A General Theory of Status Relations and an Analysis of Indian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdqMMcYQ7r8C |year=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535912-1|pages=191–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theology in the Bhagavad Gita discusses both the sentient and the non-sentient, the soul and the matter of existence. It envisions the universe as the body of Vishnu (Krishna), state Harold Coward and Daniel Maguire. Vishnu in Gita's theology pervades all souls, all matter and time.&lt;ref name=coward113/&gt; In Sri Vaishnavism sub-tradition, Vishnu and Sri (goddess [[Lakshmi]]) are described as inseparable, that they pervade everything together. Both together are the creators, who also pervade and transcend their creation.&lt;ref name=coward113/&gt;

The Bhagavata Purana, in many passages, parallels the ideas of Nirguna Brahman and non-duality of Adi Shankara.{{Sfn|Sheridan|1986|pp=1–2, 17–25}} For example,

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
The aim of life is inquiry into the Truth, and not the desire for enjoyment in heaven by performing religious rites,
Those who possess the knowledge of the Truth, call the knowledge of non-duality as the Truth,
It is called [[Brahman]], the Highest [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]], and [[Bhagavan]].
&lt;/poem&gt;

Scholars describe the Vaishnava theology as built on the foundation of non-dualism speculations in Upanishads, and term it as "Advaitic Theism".{{Sfn|Sheridan|1986|pp=1–2, 17–25}}{{Sfn|Brown|1998|p=17}} The Bhagavata Purana suggests that God Vishnu and the soul (Atman) in all beings is one.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1983|pages=553–557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant states that the monism discussed in Bhagavata Purana is certainly built on the Vedanta foundations, but not exactly the same as the monism of Adi Shankara.&lt;ref name=bryant45/&gt; The Bhagavata asserts, according to Bryant, that the empirical and the spiritual universe are both metaphysical realities, and manifestations of the same Oneness, just like heat and light are "real but different" manifestations of sunlight.&lt;ref name=bryant45&gt;Edwin Bryant (2004), Krishna: The Beautiful Legend of God: Srimad Bhagavata Purana Book X, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0140447996}}, pages 43-48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trimurti: Shiva and Brahma===
[[Trimurti]] (three forms) is a concept in [[Hinduism]] "in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance and destruction are personified by the forms of [[Brahma]] the creator, Vishnu the maintainer, preserver or protector and [[Shiva]] the destroyer or transformer."&lt;ref&gt;For quotation defining the trimurti see Matchett, Freda. "The {{IAST|Purāṇas}}", in: Flood (2003), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Trimurti system having Brahma as the creator, Vishnu as the maintainer or preserver, and Shiva as the transformer or destroyer see: Zimmer (1972) p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; These three deities have also been called ''the Hindu triad''&lt;ref&gt;For definition of trimurti as ''the unified form'' of Brahmā, {{IAST|Viṣṇu}} and Śiva and use of the phrase the Hindu triad see: Apte, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; or the "Great Trinity",&lt;ref&gt;For the term "Great Trinity" in relation to the Trimurti see: Jansen, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; all having the same meaning of three in One. They are the different forms or manifestations of [[One]] person the [[Supreme Being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/23/en |title=Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 1 Chapter 2 Verse 23 |publisher=Vedabase.net |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123213949/http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/23/en |archivedate=23 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiva and Vishnu are both viewed as the ultimate form of god in different Hindu denominations. [[Harihara]] is a composite of half Vishnu and half Shiva, and artwork related to Harihara is found from mid 1st millennium CE, such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th-century [[Badami cave temples]].&lt;ref&gt;Alice Boner (1990), Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculpture: Cave Temple Period, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807051}}, pages 89-95, 115-124, 174-184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TA Gopinatha Rao (1993), Elements of Hindu iconography, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120808775}}, pages 334-335&lt;/ref&gt; Another half Vishnu half Shiva form, which is also called Harirudra, is mentioned in [[Mahabharata]].&lt;ref&gt;For Harirudra citation to Mahabharata 3:39:76f see: Hopkins (1969), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garuda===
Vishnu's mount ([[Vahana]]) is [[Garuda]], the eagle. Vishnu is commonly depicted as riding on his shoulders. Garuda is also considered as Vedas on which Lord Vishnu travels. Garuda is a sacred bird in Vaishnavism. In [[Garuda Purana]], Garuda carries Lord Vishnu to save the Elephant [[Gajendra Moksha|Gajendra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/HindiBook-gajendra-moksha#page/n0/mode/2up|title=Gajendra Moksha|website=archive.org|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Purana Perennis: Reciprocity and Transformation in Hindu and Jaina Texts|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=-kZFzHCuiFAC|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|author=Wendy Doniger|year=1993|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or [[Trimurti]] of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Vishnu's avatars descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring [[Dharma]].

The Vishnu avatars appear in Hindu mythology whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because the evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance.{{Sfn|James Lochtefeld|2002|p=228}} The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the ever-present forces of good and evil.{{Sfn|James Lochtefeld|2002|p=228}}

The ten best-known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the ''Dashavatara'' (a [[Sanskrit compound]] meaning "ten avatars"). Five different lists are included in the Bhagavata Purana, where the difference is in the sequence of the names. Freda Matchett states that this re-sequencing by the composers may be intentional, so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limitation to the abstract.{{Sfn|Matchett|2001|p=160}}

 | [[Matsya]]
 | Half fish-half man avatar. He saves the world from a cosmic flood, with the help of a boat made of the [[Vedas]] (knowledge), on which he also rescues Manu (progenitor of man) and all living beings. A demon steals and tries to destroy the Vedas, but Matsya finds the demon, kills him, and returns the Vedas.

 | Tortoise avatar. He supports the cosmos, while the gods and demons churn the cosmic ocean with the help of serpent Vasuki to produce the nectar of immortality (just like churning milk to produce butter). The churning produces both the good and the bad, including poison and immortality nectar. Nobody wants the poison, everyone wants the immortality nectar. The demons attempt to steal the nectar, wherein Vishnu appears as enchantress Mohini avatar, for whom they all fall, and give her the nectar.

 | [[Varaha]]

 | [[Narasimha]]
 | Half lion-half man avatar. Demon king Hiranyakashipu becomes enormously powerful, gains special powers by which no man or animal could kill him, then bullies and persecutes people who disagree with him, including his own son. The Man-Lion avatar creatively defeats those special powers, kills Hiranyakashipu, and rescues demon's son [[Prahlada]] who opposes his own father. The legend is a part of the Hindu festival [[Holi]] folklore.

 | [[Vamana]]
 | Dwarf avatar. Demon king Bali gains disproportionately enormous powers, ruling the entire universe and abusing it. The dwarf avatar approaches Bali in the form of a monk when Bali is trying to show off by giving alms at a sacrifice. Bali offers the dwarf any riches he wants, the monk refuses and asks for three steps of land. Bali grants it to him. The dwarf grows, in his first step takes the earth, the second all of the heavens, and for the third the netherworld where Bali returns to.

==Beyond Hinduism==

===Sikhism===

Vishnu is referred to as Gorakh in the scriptures of [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh|title=Sikhism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0ZmAXw7ok8C&amp;pg=PA65 |year=2011|publisher=I.B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-84885-321-8|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in verse 5 of [[Japji Sahib]], the [[guru]] is praised as who gives the word and shows the wisdom, and through whom the awareness of immanence is gained. Guru Nanak, state Christopher Shackle and Arvind Pal-Singh Mandair, teaches that the [[Guru]] (teachers) are "Shiva (isar), Vishnu (gorakh), Brahma (barma) and mother Parvati (parbati)", yet the one who is all and true cannot be described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Shackle|author2=Arvind Mandair|title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VvoJV8mw0LwC |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45101-0|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chaubis Avatar]] text of Sikhism lists the 24 avatars of Vishnu and this includes [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]] of Hinduism, and the [[Buddha]] of Buddhism as avatar of Vishnu. Similarly, the [[Dasam Granth]] includes Vishnu mythology mirror that found in the Vaishnav tradition.&lt;ref name=Oberoi97&gt;{{cite book|author=Harjot Oberoi|title=The Construction of Religious Boundaries: Culture, Identity, and Diversity in the Sikh Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKl84EYFkTsC |year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61593-6|pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is of particular importance to Sanatan Sikhs, including Udasis, Nirmalas, Nanak-panthis, Sahajdhari and Keshdhari sub-traditions within Sikhism; however, the Khalsa Sikhs disagree with the Sanatan Sikhs.&lt;ref name=Oberoi97/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sikhism/sanatan.html Sanatan Singh Sabha], Overview of World Religions, Division of Religion and Philosophy, University of Cumbria&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sanatan Sikh writers, the Gurus of Sikhs were avatars of Vishnu, because the Gurus brought light in the age of darkness and saved people in a time of evil Mughal era persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harjot Oberoi|title=The Construction of Religious Boundaries: Culture, Identity, and Diversity in the Sikh Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKl84EYFkTsC |year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-61593-6|pages=102–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83 |year=2013|publisher=Bloomsburg Academic|isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis E.

===Buddhism===
[[File:Devinuwara Sri Vishnu Maha Devalaya in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|180px|Uthpalawarna Vishnu Devalaya in Devinuwara, Matara, Sri Lanka]]

While some Hindus consider Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu, Buddhists in Sri Lanka venerate Vishnu as the custodian deity of [[Sri Lanka]] and protector of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Swarna Wickremeratne| title = Buddha in Sri Lanka: Remembered Yesterdays| publisher = State University of New York Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYrQnZT9JREC |year = 2012| isbn=978-0791468814 |page = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishnu is also known as [[Upulvan]] or uthpala varna, meaning ''Blue Lotus coloured''. Some postulate that Uthpala varna was a local deity who later merged with Vishnu while another belief is that Uthpala Varna was an early form of Vishnu before he became a supreme deity in Puranic Hinduism. According to Chronicles [[Mahawamsa]], ''Chulawamsa'' and folklore in Sri Lanka, Buddha himself handed over the custodianship to Vishnu. Others believe that Buddha entrusted this task to Sakra ([[Indra]]) and Sakra delegated this task of custodianship to god Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Wilhelm Geiger]]| title = [[Mahawamsa]]: English Translation (1908)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] shrines are dedicated to Vishnu in Sri Lanka. In addition to specific Vishnu ''Kovils'' or ''devalayas'', all Buddhist temples necessarily house shrine rooms (Devalayas) closer to the main Buddhist shrine dedicated to Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Swarna Wickremeratne| title = Buddha in Sri Lanka: Remembered Yesterdays| publisher = State University of New York Press | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYrQnZT9JREC| year = 2012| isbn=978-0791468814 |page = 226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Holt states that Vishnu was one of the several Hindu gods and goddesses who were integrated into the Sinhala Buddhist religious culture, such as the 14th and 15th-century Lankatilaka and Gadaladeniya Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = John C Holt|title = The Buddhist Vishnu: Religious transformation, politics and culture| publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 2004|isbn= 978-0231133234|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that the medieval Sinhala tradition encouraged Visnu worship (puja) as a part of Theravada Buddhism just like Hindu tradition incorporated the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu, but contemporary Theravada monks are attempting to purge the Vishnu worship practice from Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = John C Holt|title = The Buddhist Vishnu: Religious transformation, politics and culture| publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 2004|isbn= 978-0231133234|pages=5–7, 13–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holt, the veneration of Vishnu in Sri Lanka is evidence of a remarkable ability over many centuries, to reiterate and reinvent culture as other ethnicities have been absorbed into their own. Though the Vishnu cult in [[Ceylon]] was formally endorsed by Kandyan kings in the early 1700s, Holt states that Vishnu images and shrines are among conspicuous ruins in the medieval capital [[Polonnaruwa]].

Some of the earliest surviving grand Vishnu temples in India have been dated to the [[Gupta Empire]] period. The Sarvatobhadra temple in [[Jhansi]], Uttar Pradesh, for example, is dated to the early 6th century and features the ten avatars of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Lubotsky (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629500 The Iconography of the Viṣṇu Temple at Deogarh and the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa], Ars Orientalis, Vol. 26 (1996), page 65&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=7}} Its design based on a square layout and Vishnu iconography broadly follows the 1st millennium Hindu texts on architecture and construction such as the ''Brihat Samhita'' and ''Visnudharmottarapurana''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Lubotsky (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629500 The Iconography of the Viṣṇu Temple at Deogarh and the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa], Ars Orientalis, Vol. 26 (1996), pages 66-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence suggest that Vishnu temples and iconography probably were already in existence by the 1st century BCE.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=18 with footnote 19}} The most significant Vishnu-related epigraphy and archaeological remains are the two 1st century BCE inscriptions in [[Rajasthan]] which refer to temples of Sankarshana and Vasudeva, the Besnagar Garuda column of ~100 BCE which mentions a Bhagavata temple, another inscription in [[Naneghat]] cave in [[Maharashtra]] by a Queen Naganika that also mentions Sankarshana, Vasudeva along with other major Hindu deities, and several discoveries in [[Mathura]] relating to Vishnu, all dated to about the start of the common era.{{Sfn|Bryant|2007|p=18 with footnote 19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Doris Srinivasan|title=Many Heads, Arms, and Eyes: Origin, Meaning, and Form of Multiplicity in Indian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZheP9dIX9wC |year=1997|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-10758-4|pages=211–220, 240–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Doris Srinivasan|title=Mathurā: The Cultural Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82vtCre6vTcC|year=1989|publisher=Manohar|isbn=978-81-85054-37-7|pages=389–392}};&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Doris Srinivasan|editor=Joanna Gottfried Williams|title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ |year=1981|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-06498-2|pages=127–136|chapter=Early Krishan Icons: the case at Mathura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aztec mythology]], '''Xiuhtecuhtli''' {{IPA-nah|ʃiʍˈtekʷt͡ɬi|}} ("[[Turquoise]] Lord" or "Lord of Fire"),&lt;ref&gt;Fernández 1992, 1996, p.104. Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, p.476. Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; was the god of fire, day and heat.&lt;ref&gt;Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, p.433.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the lord of volcanoes,&lt;ref&gt;Coe &amp; Koontz 2002, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; the personification of life after death, warmth in cold ([[fire]]), light in darkness and food during famine. He was also named '''Cuezaltzin''' {{IPA-nah|kʷeˈsaɬt͡sin|}} ("flame") and '''Ixcozauhqui''' {{IPA-nah|iʃkoˈsaʍki|}},&lt;ref&gt;Sahagún 1577, 1989, p.47. (Book I, Chapter XIII).&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes considered to be the same as '''[[Huehueteotl]]''' ("Old God"),&lt;ref&gt;Fernández 1992, 1996, p.104.&lt;/ref&gt; although Xiuhtecuhtli is usually shown as a young deity.&lt;ref name="Matos Moctezuma 2002, p.476"&gt;Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, p.476.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife was [[Chalchiuhtlicue]]. Xiuhtecuhtli is sometimes considered to be a manifestation of [[Ometecuhtli]], the Lord of Duality, and according to the [[Florentine Codex]] Xiuhtecuhtli was considered to be the father of the Gods,&lt;ref&gt;Fernández 1992, 1996, p.104. León-Portilla 2002, pp.25, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; who dwelled in the turquoise enclosure in the center of earth.&lt;ref name="Matos Moctezuma 1988, p.94"&gt;Matos Moctezuma 1988, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; Xiuhtecuhtli-Huehueteotl was one of the oldest and most revered of the indigenous pantheon.&lt;ref name="Luján 2005, p.140"&gt;Luján 2005, p.140&lt;/ref&gt; The cult of the God of Fire, of the Year, and of Turquoise perhaps began as far back as the middle [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]] period.&lt;ref name="Luján 2005, p.141"&gt;Luján 2005, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; Turquoise was the symbolic equivalent of fire for Aztec priests.&lt;ref name="Roy 2005, p.211"&gt;Roy 2005, p.211&lt;/ref&gt; A small fire was permanently kept alive at the sacred center of every Aztec home in honor of Xiuhtecuhtli.&lt;ref name="Roy 2005, p.211" /&gt;

The [[Nahuatl]] word ''xihuitl'' means "year" as well as "turquoise" and "fire",&lt;ref name="Matos Moctezuma 1988, p.94"/&gt; and Xiuhtecuhtli was also the god of the year and of time.&lt;ref name="Miller 1993, p.190"&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.190. Smith 1996, 2003, pp.246-7. Díaz &amp; Rodgers 1993, p.xix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bezanilla 2000, p.25"&gt;Bezanilla 2000, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord of the Year concept came from the Aztec belief that Xiuhtecuhtli was the [[North Star]].&lt;ref name="Bingham &amp; Roberts 2010, p.143"&gt;Bingham &amp; Roberts 2010, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; In the 260-day ritual [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendar]], the deity was the patron of the day ''Atl'' ("Water") and with the [[trecena]] 1 Coatl ("1 Snake").&lt;ref name="Miller 1993, p.190"/&gt; Xiuhtecuhtli was also one of the nine [[Lords of the Night]] and ruled the first hour of the night, named ''Cipactli'' ("Alligator").&lt;ref&gt;Díaz &amp; Rodgers 1993, p.xix. Smith 1996, 2003, p.248&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have long emphasized that this fire deity also has aquatic qualities.&lt;ref name="Luján 2005, p.141" /&gt; Xiuhtecuhtli dwelt inside an enclosure of turquoise stones, fortifying himself with turquoise bird water.&lt;ref&gt;Luján 2005, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the god of fire in relation to the [[cardinal directions]], just as the brazier for lighting fire is the center of the house or temple.&lt;ref&gt;Luján 2005, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; Xiuhtecuhtli was the patron god of the Aztec emperors, who were regarded as his living embodiment at their enthronement.&lt;ref name="Matos Moctezuma 2002, p.447"&gt;Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, p.447.&lt;/ref&gt; The deity was also one of the patron gods of the ''[[pochteca]]'' merchant class.&lt;ref&gt;Coe &amp; Koontz 2002, p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone sculptures of Xiuhtecuhtli were ritually buried as offerings, and various statuettes have been recovered during excavations at the [[Templo Mayor|Great Temple]] of [[Tenochtitlan]] with which he was closely associated.&lt;ref&gt;Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, pp.172, 476.&lt;/ref&gt; Statuettes of the deity from the temple depict a seated male with his arms crossed.&lt;ref&gt;Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, p.172.&lt;/ref&gt; A sacred fire was always kept burning in the temples of Xiuhtecuhtli.&lt;ref&gt;Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, p.414.&lt;/ref&gt; In gratitude for the gift of fire, the first mouthful of food from each meal was flung into the hearth.&lt;ref name="Matos Moctezuma 2002, p.447"/&gt;

Barrera Rodríguez &amp; López Arenas 2008, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; and he often wears a descending turquoise ''xiuhtototl'' bird (''[[Cotinga amabilis]]'') on his forehead and the Xiuhcoatl fire serpent on his back.&lt;ref name="Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.189"&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; He owns fire serpent earplugs.&lt;ref name="Luján 2005, p.140" /&gt; On his head he has a paper crown painted with different colors and motifs. On top of the crown there are sprays of green feathers, like flames from a fire.&lt;ref name="Luján 2005, p.140" /&gt; He has feather tufts to each side, like pendants, toward his ears. On his back he has plumage resembling a dragon's head, made of yellow feathers with marine conch shells.&lt;ref name="Luján 2005, p.140" /&gt; He has copper bells tied to the insteps of his feet. In his left hand he holds a shield with five greenstones, called ''chalchihuites'', placed in the form of a [[cross]] on a thin gold plate that covered almost all the shield.&lt;ref name="Luján 2005, p.140" /&gt; In his right hand he has a kind of scepter that was a round gold plate with a hole in the middle, and topped by two globes, one larger than the other, the smaller one had a point.&lt;ref name="Luján 2005, p.140" /&gt; Xiuhtecuhtli is closely associated with youthful warriors and with rulership, and was considered a solar god.&lt;ref&gt;Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.189. Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, pp.419-20.&lt;/ref&gt; His principal symbols are the ''tecpatl'' (flint) and the ''mamalhuatzin'', the two sticks that were rubbed together to light ceremonial fires.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández 1992, 1996, pp.104-6.&lt;/ref&gt; A staff with a deer's head was also an attribute of Xiuhtecuhtli, although not exclusively so as it could also be associated with [[Xochiquetzal]] and other deities.&lt;ref&gt;Matos Moctezuma &amp; Solis Olguín 2002, p.468.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the attributes of Xiuhtecuhtli are found associated with [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Postclassic]] [[Toltec]] warriors but clear representations of the god are not common until the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Postclassic]].&lt;ref name="Miller &amp; Taube 1993, 2003, p.189" /&gt; The ''[[nahual]]'', or spirit form, of Xiuhtecuhtli is [[Xiuhcoatl]], the Fire Serpent.&lt;ref name="Fernández 1992, 1996, p.107"&gt;Fernández 1992, 1996, p.107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Xiuhtecuhtli was embodied in the ''teotecuilli'', the sacrificial brazier into which sacrificial victims were cast during the [[New Fire ceremony]].&lt;ref name="Fernández 1992, 1996, p.107" /&gt;  This took place at the end of each cycle of the Aztec calendar round (every 52 years),&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1996, 2003, p.249.&lt;/ref&gt; when the gods were thought to be able to end their covenant with humanity.  Feasts were held in honor of Xiuhtecuhtli to keep his favors, and human sacrifices were burned after removing their [[heart]].

==Annual festival==


The annual festival of Xiuhtecuhtli was celebrated in ''Izcalli'', the 18th [[veintena]] of the year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;López Austin 1998, p.10. Sahagún 1577, 1989, p.47 (Book I, Chapter XIII).&lt;/ref&gt; The Nahuatl word izcalli means "stone house" and refers to the building where maize used to be dried and roasted between mid-January and mid-February. The whole month was therefore devoted to fire.&lt;ref name="Roy 2005, p.211" /&gt; The Izcalli rituals grew in importance every four years.&lt;ref&gt;Luján 2005, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; A framework image of the deity was constructed from wood and was richly finished with clothing, feathers and an elaborate mask.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Quails were sacrificed to the idol and their blood spilt before it and [[copal]] was burnt in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagún 1577, 1989, p.47 (Book I, Chapter XIII).&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the festival, the priests of Xiuhtecuhtli spent the day dancing and singing before their god.&lt;ref&gt;Sahagún 1577, 1989, p.48 (Book I, Chapter XIII).&lt;/ref&gt; People caught animals, including mammals, birds, snakes, lizards and fish, for ten days before the festival in order to throw them into the hearth on the night of the festival.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;López Austin 1998, p.10. Sahagún 1577, 1989, p.48 (Book I, Chapter XIII).&lt;/ref&gt; On the tenth day of Izcalli, during a festival called ''huauhquiltamalcualiztli'' ("eating of the amaranth leaf tamales"), the New Fire was lighted, signifying the change of the annual cycle and the rebirth of the fire deity.&lt;ref&gt;Luján 2005, p.142.&lt;/ref&gt; During the night the image of the god was lit with using the ''mamalhuatzin''.&lt;ref&gt;López Austin 1998, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Food was consumed ritually, including shrimp [[tamale]]s, after first offering it to the god.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

[[Image:Xiuhtecuhtli, Codex Borgia, 14, w rubber balls offering.jpg|thumb|;eft|250px|Xiuhtecuhtli in his role as one of the lords of the night, from the [[Codex Borgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Díaz &amp; Rodgers 1993, pp.xix, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Every four years a more solemn version of the festival was held at the temple of Xiuhtecuhtli in [[Tenochtitlan]], attended by the emperor and his nobles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Sahagún 1577, 1989, pp.48-9 (Book I, Chapter XIII).&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves and captives were dressed as the deity and sacrificed in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;López Austin 1998, p.10. Sahagún 1577, 1989, p.98 (Book II, Chapter XVIII).&lt;/ref&gt; Godparents were assigned to children on this day and the children had their ears ritually pierced. After this, the children, their parents and godparents all shared a meal together.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

==New Fire Ceremony==

Xiuhtecuhtli was celebrated often but especially at the end of every 52-year period. This was the time the 365-day solar and the 260-day sacred calendars ended on the same day and the Aztec celebrated the Binding of the Years with the [[New Fire Ceremony]].&lt;ref name="Bingham &amp; Roberts 2010, p.143" /&gt; In order to perform the ritual, priests marched in solemn procession up the [[Cerro de la Estrella (archaeological site)|Hill of the Star]] on a peninsula near ''Culhuacán'' to wait for the star ''Yohualtecuhtli'' (either [[Aldebaran]] in the Taurus constellation or the [[Pleiades]] as a whole) to get past its zenith. Having ascertained this, they would tear out the heart of a sacrificial victim and kindle a flame in a small wooden hearth they placed inside the hole left in his chest. Priests used a drill method to generate this sacred flame. It was then carried on pine sticks to light the fires anew in every hearth, including the sacred braziers of perpetual fire, that numbered over 600 in the capital alone.&lt;ref&gt;Roy 2005, p.316.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A set of six postage stamps issued by the [[Royal Mail]] in 2003 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the British Museum featured a mask of Xiuhtecuhtli alongside other Museum objects such as the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]] and [[Hoa Hakananai'a]].{{sfn|CollectGBStamps}}{{sfn|Daily Mail|2003}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2192">The '''Zealots of Piety''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Кружок ревнителей благочестия'') was a circle of [[ecclesiastic]]al and [[secular]] individuals beginning in the late 1630s in [[Russia]] at the time of church schism, which gathered around [[Stefan Vonifatiyev]], the confessor of [[tsar]] [[Alexei Mikhailovich]].  The impetus to the group's formation was the [[Time of Troubles]].  The members believed the massacres and conflagrations of the time to be the manifestation of a wrathful God, angry with the Russian people's lack of religiosity.  In response, the group called for the rebirth of the Russian Orthodox faith, and a renewal of the religious piety of the masses.  

The Zealots of Piety included [[Fyodor Rtishchev]], [[Archmandrite]] [[Patriarch Nikon|Nikon (Minin)]] of the [[Novospassky Monastery]] (future [[Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia]]), [[Abbot]] [[Ivan Neronov]] of the [[Kazan Cathedral, Moscow|Kazan Cathedral]], [[archpriest]]s [[Avvakum Petrov]], Loggin, Lazar, and Daniil. The members of the Zealots of Piety wanted to enhance the authority of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and increase its influence upon the people. Among other goals of the circle were the struggle against the shortcomings and vices of the [[clergy]], revival of church [[sermon]]s and other means for influencing the masses. They also aimed to assist the needy and weak in Russian society, protecting them from social injustice, and to spread the Gospel to the Russian people, making faith more integral in daily life.  The Zealots of Piety soon became the actual rulers of the Russian Orthodox Church, thanks to the support from the tsar, who had paid much attention to the advice of his confessor. 

After Nikon had been elected patriarch in 1652, the groups turned against their former member, protesting several of his reforms.  Over time, the group began to dissolve, as many of its members became active figures in the [[Old Believers]] movement.

[[File:Abdulbaha2.jpg|thumb|`Abdu'l-Bahá, during his trip to the United States]]
'''`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West''' were a series of trips [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] undertook starting at the age of 67 from Palestine to the West from 1910 to 1913. `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], was imprisoned at the age of 8 and suffered various degrees of privation most of his life. He was appointed as the successor and head of the Bahá'í Faith upon the death of his father on 29 May 1892. Sixteen years later he was suddenly freed at the age of 64 as a ramification of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= 'Abdu'l-Bahá |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6 |pages= 16–18 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his release, the major centres of Bahá'í population and scholarly activity were mostly in Iran,&lt;ref name="Esslemont"&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|2004|pp=63–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other large communities in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]],&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web | title = Baha'i Faith History in Azerbaijan | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Azerbaijan | url =http://www.bahai.az/lib/articles/histofaz/history_en.shtml | accessdate = 22 December 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120219032306/http://www.bahai.az/lib/articles/histofaz/history_en.shtml | archivedate = 19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ashgabat]], [[Turkmenistan]],&lt;ref name="azer"&gt;{{Citation| last = Balci | first = Bayram| last2 = Jafarov | first2 = Azer| title = The Baha’is of the Caucasus: From Russian Tolerance to Soviet Repression {2/3} | newspaper = Caucaz.com | pages = | date = 21 February 2007| url =http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=300| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120911005432/http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=300| archivedate = 11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="JBS0503"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on the Babi and Baha'i Religions in Russia and its territories | journal = Journal of Bahá'í Studies | volume = 05 | issue = 3 | pages = 41–80, 86 | year = 1993 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_babi_bahai_russia | accessdate = 18 February 2010 | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019111359/http://bahai-library.com/hassall_babi_bahai_russia | archivedate = 19 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in the [[Western world|Occident]] the religion had been introduced in the late 1890s in several locales. However, by 1910 the religion's followers still numbered less than a few thousands across the entire West.&lt;ref name="Esslemont" /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá thus took steps to personally present the [[Bahá'í teachings]] to the West by travelling to [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. His first excursion outside of Palestine and Iran was to [[Egypt]] in 1910 where he stayed for around a year, followed by a near five-month trip to France and Great Britain in 1911. After returning to Egypt, he left on a trip to [[North America]] which lasted nearly 8 months. During that trip he visited many cities across the United States, from major metropolitan areas on the eastern coast of the country, to cities in the midwest, and [[California]] on the west coast; he also visited [[Montreal]] in [[Canada]]. Following his trip in North America he visited various countries in Europe, including France, Britain and Germany for six months, followed by a six-month stay again in Egypt, before returning to [[Haifa]].&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

With his visits to the West, the small Western Bahá'í community was given a chance to consolidate and embrace a wider vision of the religion; the religion also attracted the attention of sympathetic attention from both religious, academic, and social leaders as well as in newspapers which provided significant coverage of `Abdu'l-Bahá's visits.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Egea | first = Amin | title = The Travels of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and their Impact on the Press| journal = Lights of Irfan |volume = 12 | pages = 1–25 | publisher = Haj Mehdi Armand Colloquium, | location = Wilmette, IL: | year = 2011 | language = | url =http://bahai-library.com/?id=4900 | jstor = | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = 9 December 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels `Abdu'l-Bahá would give talks at the homes of Bahá'ís, at hotels, and at other public and religious sites, such as the [[Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration]], the [[Bethel Literary and Historical Society]], at the [[NAACP]], at [[Howard University|Howard]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]] universities, and at various [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical Societies]], among others. `Abdu'l-Bahá talks across the West also became an important addition to the body of [[Bahá'í literature]].&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; In succeeding decades after his visit the American community substantially grew&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Smith| first = Peter| editor-last = Smith| editor-first = Peter| title = Baha'is in the West| url = https://books.google.com/?id=x7wyJdyE60oC&amp;pg=PA5| volume = 14| year = 2004| publisher = Kalimat Press| isbn = 978-1-890688-11-0| page = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then spread across South America, Australasia, Subsaharan Africa and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hands of the Cause living in the Holy Land | first = | authorlink = Hands of the Cause | title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, | publisher = Bahá'í World Center | year = 1964 | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#9 | isbn = | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055741/http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1| archivedate = 23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trip to Egypt==
`Abdu'l-Bahá left [[Haifa]] for [[Port Said]], Egypt on 29 August 1910. Earlier on that day he had accompanied two pilgrims to the [[Shrine of the Báb]], and then he headed down to the port in the city where at around 4pm he set sail on the steamer "Kosseur London" and then telegrammed the Bahá'ís in Haifa that he was in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Balyuzi"&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=133–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Among"&gt;{{harvnb|Hartzler|Shoemaker|1912|pp=247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in the city for around one month where Bahá'ís from Cairo came to visit him.

On 1 October, `Abdu'l-Bahá again set sail; his intention was to go to Europe, but because of his poor health, he instead landed in [[Alexandria]] where he stayed for nearly eight months. While in Egypt there was increasingly positive coverage of him and the Bahá'ís from various Egyptian news outlets.&lt;ref name="Balyuzi" /&gt; While in Alexandria he met with a larger number of people. In November he met with Briton [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]] who later became a Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="abdul1910"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_notes_egypt | title = Egypt: Baha'i history | last = Hassal | first = Graham | accessdate=1 October 2006 | date=1 October 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406174627/http://bahai-library.com/hassall_notes_egypt | archivedate=6 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was visited by Russian/Polish [[Isabella Grinevskaya]] who also became a Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="notes-ii"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Notes on the Babi and Baha'i Religions in Russia and its territories | journal = Journal of Bahá'í Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 41–80, 86 | publisher = | year = 1993 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_babi_bahai_russia | accessdate = 20 March 2009 | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019111359/http://bahai-library.com/hassall_babi_bahai_russia | archivedate = 19 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late April [[Louis Gregory]], an Africa-American who had gone on [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]], met with `Abdu'l-Bahá while he was in the suburb of Ramleh.&lt;ref name="hassal-egypt"&gt;{{cite web| last = Hassall | first = Graham | title = Egypt: Baha'i history | work = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies: Bahá'í Communities by country | publisher = Bahá'í Online Library | date = c. 2000| url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_notes_egypt | doi = | accessdate = 24 May 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140406174627/http://bahai-library.com/hassall_notes_egypt| archivedate = 6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in May `Abdu'l-Bahá moved to Cairo and got more favourable press coverage, including from [[Al-Ahram]].

==First trip to Europe==
`Abdu'l-Bahá's first European trip spanned from August to December 1911, at which time he returned to Egypt. During his first European trip he visited [[Lake Geneva]] on the border of France and Switzerland, Great Britain and [[Paris]], France. The purpose of these trips was to support the Bahá'í communities in the West and to further spread his father's teachings,&lt;ref name="b_end"&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=159–397}}&lt;/ref&gt; after sending representatives and a letter to the [[First Universal Races Congress]] in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = various| title = various | journal = Star of the West | volume = 02 | issue = 9 | page = all| publisher = Bahá'í News Service | location = Chicago, USA | date = 20 August 1911 | url = http://www.bahai-education.org/star/ | editor-last = Windust | editor-first = Albert R | editor2-last = Buikema | editor2-first = Gertrude | accessdate =15 April 2010 | ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111107020747/http://bahai-education.org:80/star/ | archivedate = 7 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author1 = `Abdu'l-Bahá | authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá | author2 = Wellesley Tudor Pole | editor-last = Spiller | editor-first = G. | editor-link=Gustav Spiller | title = The Bahai Movement | conference = Papers on Inter-racial Problems Communicated to the [[First Universal Races Congress]] | pages = 154–157 | publisher = in London, P.S.

===Lake Geneva===
When `Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in Marseille, he was greeted by {{Interlanguage link multi|Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney|fr}}, a prominent early French Bahá'í.&lt;ref name="hd"&gt;{{cite web | title = Hippolyte Dreyfus, apôtre d`Abdu'l-Bahá; Premier bahá'í français | work = Qui est Abdu'l-Baha ? | publisher = Assemblée Spirituelle Nationale des Baha'is de France | date = 9 July 2000 | url =http://www.bahai-biblio.org/centre-doc/ouvrage/dreyfus/dreyfus_12.htm | accessdate = 14 March 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120303071758/http://www.bahai-biblio.org/centre-doc/ouvrage/dreyfus/dreyfus_12.htm | archivedate = 3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreyfus-Barney accompanied `Abdu'l-Bahá to [[Thonon-les-Bains]], a French town, on [[Lake Geneva]] that straddles France and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="hd" /&gt;

`Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in [[Thonon-les-Bains]] in France for a few days before going to Vevey in Switzerland. In [[Vevey]] `Abdu'l-Bahá offered a talk on the Bahá'í point of view on the immortality of soul and relationship of worlds and on the subject of divorce. He also met [[Horace Holley (Bahá'í)|Horace Holley]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Kazemzadeh |first= Firuz| authorlink= Firuz Kazemzadeh |encyclopedia= Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project |title= 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás (1844–1921) |year= 2009 |publisher= National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States |location= Evanston, IL |url= http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81:abdul-baha-abbas-1844-1921&amp;catid=36:administrationinstitutions#personal | accessdate = 14 March 2010 | ref = harv |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131017150626/http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81:abdul-baha-abbas-1844-1921&amp;catid=36:administrationinstitutions |archivedate= 17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Thonon, `Abdu'l-Bahá met [[Mass'oud Mirza Zell-e Soltan]], who had asked to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá. Soltan, who had ordered the execution of [[Núrayn-i-Nayyirayn|King and Beloved of martyrs]], was the eldest grandson of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] who had ordered the [[Execution of the Báb]] himself. Thompson, an American Bahá'í who had also come to visit `Abdu'l-Bahá, shared comments of Hippolyte who heard Soltan's stammering apology for past wrongs. `Abdu'l-Bahá embraced him and invited his sons to lunch.&lt;ref name="JT"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|Gail|1983|pp=147–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Bahram Mirza Sardar Mass'oud and [[Akbar Mass’oud]], another grandson of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, met with the Bahá'ís, and apparently Akbar was greatly affected by meeting `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honnold|2010|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September `Abdu'l-Bahá left the shores of Lake Geneva travelling towards [[London]] where he arrived on 4 September; he would stay in London until 23 September.

==Trip to North America==
[[File:Railroads of the United States in 1918 - Project Gutenberg eText 16960.png|thumb|Railroads of the United States in 1918 - Project Gutenberg eText 16960]]
In the following year, `Abdu'l-Bahá undertook a much more extensive journey to the United States and [[Canada]], ultimately visiting some 40 cities, to once again spread his father's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|2002|pg=57-59}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in New York City on 11 April 1912. While he spent most of his time in New York, he visited many cities on the east coast. Then in August he started a more extensive journey across to the West coast before starting to return east at the end of October. On 5 December 1912 he set sail back to Europe.&lt;ref name="b_end" /&gt; Several people, including `Abdu'l-Bahá himself, Dr. Allan L. Ward, author of ''239 Days''', and critic Samuel Graham Wilson have taken note of the uniqueness of this trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|1979|p=ix, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|1915|pp=263–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward wrote: "... never before during the formative years of a religion has a figure of like stature made a journey of such magnitude in a setting so different from that of His native land." Wilson stated: "But Abdul Baha, except for Hindu Swamis, was the first Asiatic revelator America has received. Its hospitality showed up well. The public and press neither stoned the "prophet" nor caricatured him but looked with kindly eye upon the grave old man, in flowing oriental robes and white turban, with waving hoary hair and long white beard."

During his nine months on the continent, he met with [[David Starr Jordan]], president of Stanford University; Rabbi [[Stephen Samuel Wise]] of New York City; the inventor [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; [[Jane Addams]], the noted social worker; the Indian poet [[Bahá'í Faith and Rabindranath Tagore|Rabindranath Tagore]], who was touring America at the time;&lt;ref name = "terry"&gt;Terry, Peter (1992, 2015) ''[https://bahai-library.com/terry_tagore_encounters_bahais Rabindranath Tagore: Some Encounters with Bahá'ís]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Putnam]], Librarian of Congress; the industrialist and humanitarian [[Andrew Carnegie]]; [[Samuel Gompers]], president of the American Federation of Labor; the Arctic explorer Admiral [[Robert Peary]]; as well as hundreds of American and Canadian Bahá’ís, recent converts to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Kazemzadeh |first= Firuz |encyclopedia= Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project |title= 'Abdu'l-Bahá 'Abbás (1844–1921) |year= 2009 |publisher= National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States |location= Evanston, IL |url= http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=36%3Aadministrationinstitutions&amp;id=81%3Aabdul-baha-abbas-1844-1921&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=74 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the RMS Cedric===
`Abdu'l-Bahá boarded the [[RMS Cedric]] in [[Alexandria, Egypt]] bound for [[Naples]] on 25 March 1912.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; Others with him included [[Shoghi Effendi]], Asadu'lláh-i-Qumí, Dr Amínu'lláh Faríd, Mírzá Munír-i-Zayn, Áqá Khusraw, and Mahmúd-i-Zarqání.&lt;ref name="Mahmud"&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the voyage a member of the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] onboard requested if `Abdu'l-Bahá would send a message to them. He replied with a message announcing "… Glad tidings, glad tidings, the Herald of the Kingdom has raised His voice."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through several conversations it was arranged by several passengers that he address a larger audience on the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship arrived in Naples harbour on 28 March 1912,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the next day several Bahá'ís from America and Britain boarded the ship. `Abdu'l-Bahá and his group did not disembark for fear of being confused with Turks during the ongoing [[Italo-Turkish War]]. Shoghi Effendi and two others were refused further passage by reason of a minor illness and were taken ashore. Though all were not convinced of the sincerity of the diagnosis and some presumed it was ill will against the voyagers as if they were Turkish.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

The American Bahá'í community had sent thousands of dollars urging `Abdu'l-Bahá to leave the Cedric in Italy and travel to England to sail on the maiden voyage of the [[RMS Titanic]]. Instead he returned the money for charity and continued the voyage on the Cedric.&lt;ref name="Lacroix "&gt;{{harvnb|Lacroix-Hopson|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Naples, the group sailed on to New York — the group included `Abdu'l-Bahá, Asadu'lláh-i-Qumí, Dr Amínu'lláh Faríd, Mahmúd-i-Zarqání, Mr and Mrs Percy Woodcock and their daughter from Canada, Mr and Mrs Austin from Denver, Colorado, and Miss Louisa Mathew.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notables aboard included at least two Italian embassy officials; note `Abdu'l-Bahá was listed as an "author" on immigration paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Poirier | first = Brent | title = `Abdu'l-Bahá's Immigration Record | work = | publisher = | year = 2002 | url = http://arrivals.netfirms.com/cedric.htm | accessdate = 27 March 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110714164837/http://arrivals.netfirms.com/cedric.htm| archivedate = 14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They passed [[Gibraltar]] on 3 April onward to New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many letters and telegrams were sent and received during the voyage as well as various tablets written.

===New England===
The SS Cedric arrived in [[New York City|New York]] harbour on the morning of 11 April and telegrams were sent and received from Bahá'í local spiritual assemblies to announce his safe arrival while the passengers were processed for quarantine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís who had gathered at the port were generally sent to gather at a home where `Abdu'l-Bahá was to visit later. Reporters interviewed him while he was on board and he elaborated on the trip and his goals. However a few Bahá'ís, including Marjorie Morten, Rhoda Nichols and [[Juliet Thompson]], hid themselves to catch a glimpse of `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|Gail|1983|pp=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arrival in New York was covered by various different newspapers including the [[New York Tribune]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Persian Prophet Here; Abdul Baha Abbas Comes to Preach Universal Peace | newspaper = New York Tribune |page=13 (3rd column) | publisher = | date = 12 April 1912| url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1912-04-12/ed-1/seq-13/| accessdate = 29 March 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121006091040/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1912-04-12/ed-1/seq-13/| archivedate = 6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Washington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = In Exile for 50 Years' Bahai Leader Comes to New York to Urge World Peace; He favors woman suffrage | newspaper = Washington Post | page = 4 (4th column) (requires registration) | date = 11 April 1912 | url = http://www.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=5507179&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=4&amp;currentPage=0&amp;fpo=False | accessdate = 30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in New York he stayed at [[The Ansonia]] hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several blocks to the north west of the hotel was the residence of Edward B. Kinney, where `Abdu'l-Bahá held his first meeting with the American Bahá'ís;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; his next talk was at given at [[Howard MacNutt]]'s residence. From 11 April until 25 April he gave at least one talk a day and most mornings and afternoons were spent meeting often one by one with visitors coming to his residence.&lt;ref name="Mahmud" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 1983"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|Gail|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; During `Abdu'l-Bahá's time in New York, [[Lua Getsinger]] helped correspond with various Bahá'ís about `Abdu'l-Bahá's plans as they evolved.&lt;ref name="Lua"&gt;{{harvnb|Metelmann|1997|pp=150–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. [[Percy Stickney Grant]], through association with [[Juliet Thompson]], invited `Abdu'l-Bahá to speak at [[Church of the Ascension, Episcopal (Manhattan)|Church of the Ascension]] on the evening of 14 April.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1983" /&gt; The event was covered by the New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = `Abdu'l-Baha prays in Ascension Church | newspaper = New York Times | publisher = | date = 15 April 1912 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/04/15/104895581.pdf | accessdate = 29 March 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131216001139/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/04/15/104895581.pdf| archivedate = 16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[New York Tribune]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Abbul Baha Preaches; Head of Bahai Movement Says All shall be Brothers Some Day | newspaper = New York Tribune |page=3 (3rd column) | publisher = | date = 15 April 1912| url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1912-04-15/ed-1/seq-3/ | accessdate = 15 December 2013| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131216000536/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1912-04-15/ed-1/seq-3/| archivedate = 16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Washington Post''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bahai Leader in Pulpit; Abdul Baha Abbas Preaches to Fashionable Congregation; Message of World Peace Voiced by Persian Philosopher in Fifth Avenue Church | newspaper = Washington Post | page = 4 (4th column) (registration required) | date = 15 April 1912 | url = http://www.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=5507997&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=2&amp;currentPage=0&amp;fpo=False | accessdate = 30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event caused a stir because, while there were rules in the Episcopal Church Canon forbidding someone of another ordination from preaching from the pulpit without the consent of the bishop, there was no provision against a non-ordained person offering prayer in the [[chancel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|1979|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

`Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in Washington DC from 8 to 11 May, when he then returned to the New York City area. On 12 May he visited [[Montclair, NJ]], and then on 14 May he went to northern [[New York (state)|New York state]] to [[Lake Mohonk]] where he addressed the [[Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration]] and stayed at the [[Mohonk Mountain House]].&lt;ref name="Mahmud pp. 100–103"&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|pp=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ives p. 196"&gt;{{harvnb|Ives|1983|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parsons|1996|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Head of New Religion of Peace | newspaper = Atlanta Constitution| page = 7 | publisher = American Press Association | date = 30 May 1912 | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=53&amp;did=546265512&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1272903667 | accessdate = 3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvard University"&gt;{{cite book| title = Report of the annual Lake Mohonk Conference on International Arbitration| url = https://books.google.com/?id=g2kNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA42| year = 1912| publisher = Harvard University| location = Lake Mohonk| pages = 42–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Head of New religion Prominent at Lake Mohonk Conference | newspaper = The Lowerll Sun | page = 6 | date = 18 May 1912 | url = http://www.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=56076252&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=2&amp;currentPage=0&amp;fpo=False| accessdate = 30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rest of his talk he outlined a brief history of religious conflict, spoke about some of the [[Bahá'í teachings]] including the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|oneness of humanity]], the [[Bahá'í Faith and science|complimentary role of religion and science]], the [[Bahá'í Faith and gender equality|equality of women and men]], the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty, and that humanity needs more than philosophy — that it needs the breadth of the [[Holy Spirit]].

After the conference, `Abdu'l-Bahá returned to New York City, where he stayed until the 22nd, leaving to the [[Boston]] area for four days including a trip to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] on the 23rd. On 26 May he returned to New York City, where he would remain for most of his time until 20 June. He took short trips to [[Fanwood, New Jersey]], from 31 May to 1 June, to [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], on 3 June, and to [[Philadelphia]] from 8 to 10 June, always returning to New York City.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

On 18 June `Abdu'l-Bahá hosted a meeting at the MacNutt's home for the purpose of being filmed and recorded. This film was the second time that `Abdu'l-Bahá was filmed,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The first film was by a production company that asked if they could film him for few minutes to appear in a [[newsreel]] the first week he arrived He agreed over the objection of the Bahá'ís who felt the process was not socially proper. This first film was incorporated into a 1985 documentary by the BBC TV unit in 1985 called "The Quiet Revolution" as part of the "Everyman" TV series.&lt;/ref&gt; and was done by Bahá'ís at the home of Howard MacNutt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/ives_stories_grace_ober Stories of Muriel Ives Newhall Barrow, Grace Robarts Ober] by Muriel Ives Barrow Newhall, 1998 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404155629/http://bahai-library.com/ives_stories_grace_ober |date=4 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film recorded at the MacNutt residence was released as a short movie called "Servant of Glory".&lt;ref name="Lacroix " /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mahmud p. 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the month, `Abdu'l-Bahá visited [[Montclair, New Jersey]] from 20 to 25 June,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Jersey's New Resident; Abdul Pasha, Persian Religious Leadder, to Live in Montclair | newspaper = The New Brunswick Times | page = 7 (registration required) | date = 3 June 1912 | url = http://www.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=155063089&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=0&amp;currentPage=0&amp;fpo=False | accessdate = 30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; coming back to New York until 29 June. On 29 and 30 June he visited West Englewood, NJ which is now [[Teaneck, New Jersey|Teaneck]] and attended a ''Unity Feast'' similar to a [[Nineteen Day Feast]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|pp=213–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|Gail|1983|pp=322–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|pp=149–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Bahá'ís, Jews, Muslims, Christians, Caucasians, African-Americans, and Persians attended.&lt;ref name="Mahmud p. 42" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnston|1975|p=10,317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those that attended the event was [[Martha Root]].&lt;ref name="root" /&gt; For her it was a high point in her life and has since been commemorized as `Abdu'l-Bahá's "Souvenir Picnic".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garis|1983|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this event that [[Lua Getsinger]] intentionally walked through poison ivy hoping to make her incapable of leaving the presence of `Abdu'l-Bahá when he asked her to travel ahead of him to California.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metelmann|1997|pp=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the property is known as the Wilhelm Bahá'í Properties.&lt;ref name="Lacroix " /&gt;

His further travels took him to [[Morristown, New Jersey]] on 30 June and he then went back to New York for a nearly a month from 30 June to 23 July, with a sojourn in West Englewood, NJ on 14 July. Starting on 23 June `Abdu'l-Bahá went to New England on his way to Canada in late August. He stayed in Boston for 23 and 24 July, and then went to the summer home of Mr. and Mrs. Parsons in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]] from 24 July to 16 Aug.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parsons|1996|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to [[Eliot, Maine]] from 16 to 23 Aug, where he stayed in [[Green Acre]] which was then a conference facility, and which since has become a Bahá'í school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parsons|1996|pp=113–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;harvnb|Zarqáni|1998|p=209-220&lt;/ref&gt; His final destination in New England was [[Malden, Massachusetts]] where he stayed from 23 to 29 August.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

===Trip to Canada===
`Abdu'l-Bahá had mentioned an intention of visiting [[Montreal]] as early as February 1912 and in August a phone number was listed for inquirers to arrange appointments for his visit there. He left to Boston and then rode to Montreal where he arrived near midnight on 30 August 1912 at the [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor train station]] on [[Peel Street, Montreal|Peel Street]] and was greeted by [[William Sutherland Maxwell]]. He would stay in Montreal until 9 September. On his first day in the city he was visited by Frederick Robertson Griffin who would later lead the [[First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia]]. Later that morning he visited a friend of the Maxwell's who had a sick baby. In the afternoon he took a car ride around Montreal. That evening a reception was held including a local socialist leader. The next day he spoke at a Unitarian church on [[Sherbrooke Street]]. [[Anne Savage (artist)|Anne Savage]] recorded that she had sought him out but uncharacteristically was shy upon seeing him. He took up residence in the [[Windsor Hotel (Montreal)|Windsor Hotel]]. The next day [[William Peterson (academic)|William Peterson]], then Principal of [[McGill University]] visited him. After a day of meeting individuals he took an afternoon excursion on his own possibly to the francophone part of the city and back. That evening he spoke to a socialist meeting addressing "The Economic Happiness of the Human Race" — that we are as one family and should care for each other, not to have absolute equality but to have a firm minimum even for the poorest, to note foremost the position of the farmer, and a [[progressive tax]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Apostle of Peace meets Socialists | newspaper = The Montreal Gazette | page = 2 | date = 4 September 1912 | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oBYqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9oQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5135,250164&amp;hl=en | accessdate = 4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he rode the [[Mountain Elevator of Montreal]] The next day [[Paul Bruchési]] Archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal]] visited him and later he spoke at the [[Saint James United Church (Montreal)|Saint James United Church]]; his talk outlined a comprehensive review of the [[Bahá'í teachings]]. Afterwards he said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I find these two great American nations highly capable and advanced in all that appertains to progress and civilization. These governments are fair and equitable. The motives and purposes of these people are lofty and inspiring. Therefore, it is my hope that these revered nations may become prominent factors in the establishment of international peace and the oneness of the world of humanity; that they may lay the foundations of equality and spiritual brotherhood among mankind; that they may manifest the highest virtues of the human world, revere the divine lights of the Prophets of God and establish the reality of unity so necessary today in the affairs of nations. I pray that the nations of the East and West shall become one flock under the care and guidance of the divine Shepherd. Verily, this is the bestowal of God and the greatest honor {{sic}} of man.

`Abdu'l-Bahá's visit to Montreal provided notable newspaper coverage; on the night of his arrival the editor of the ''[[Montreal Daily Star]]'' met with him and that newspaper along with [[The Montreal Gazette]], ''Montreal Standard'', [[Le Devoir]] and [[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]] among others reported on `Abdu'l-Bahá's activities.&lt;ref name="vanderHoonaard56"&gt;{{harvnb|Van den Hoonaard|1996|pp=56–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b_p256"&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headlines in those papers included "Persian Teacher to Preach Peace", "Racialism Wrong, Says Eastern Sage, Strife and War Caused by Religious and National Prejudices", and "Apostle of Peace Meets Socialists, Abdul Baha's Novel Scheme for Distribution of Surplus Wealth."&lt;ref name="b_p256" /&gt; The ''Montreal Standard'', which was distributed across Canada, took so much interest that it republished the articles a week later; the Gazette published six articles and Montreal's largest French language newspaper published two articles about him.&lt;ref name="vanderHoonaard56" /&gt; The ''Harbor Grace Standard'' newspaper, of [[Harbour Grace]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], printed a story summarizing several of his talks and trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Persian Peace Prophet gives Message to Canada through the Standard | newspaper = The Harbor Grace Standard | date = 7 September 1912 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hYkcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xGIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4009,6137749&amp;hl=en| page = 17| accessdate = 4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he left the country, the ''Winnipeg Free Press'' highlighted his position on the equality of women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Message of the Great Persian Reformer | newspaper = Winnipeg Free Press | location = Winnipeg, Manitoba | page = 9, column 3 (registration required) | date = 19 September 1912 | url = http://www.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=41607619&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=28&amp;currentPage=30&amp;fpo=False | accessdate = 24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All together some accounts of his talks and trips would reach 440,000 in French and English coverage.&lt;ref name="Vanden"&gt;{{harvnb|Van den Hoonaard|1996|pp=43–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled through several villages on the way back to the States.&lt;ref&gt;A portion of Van den Hoonaard's book is posted online along with rare pictures at {{cite web | title = The Bahá’í Faith comes to Hamilton | work = | publisher = The Baha'i Community of [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada | date = | url = http://www.bahaihamilton.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=9| accessdate = 31 August 2016| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131215233009/http://www.bahaihamilton.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=9| archivedate = 15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel to the West coast===
`Abdu'l-Bahá left Canada and started his travel to the American West coast stopping in multiple places in the country during his travels. From 9 September through 12th he stayed in [[Buffalo, New York]], where he made a fleeting visit to [[Niagara Falls]] on 12 September.&lt;ref name="MacEoin"&gt;{{cite web | last = MacEoin | first = Denis | author2 = Collins, William | title = Memorials (Listings)| work = The Babi and Baha'i Religions: An Annotated Bibliography | publisher = Greenwood Press's ongoing series of Bibliographies and Indexes in Religious Studies | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/biblio/memorials.html | accessdate = 2 May 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130407182102/http://bahai-library.com/books/biblio/memorials.html | archivedate = 7 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then travelled to [[Chicago]] (12–15 September), [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] (15–16 September), back to Chicago on 16 September, and then to [[Minneapolis]] where he stayed from 16 to 21 September.&lt;!-- local newspapers were online once [https://web.archive.org/web/20071210175528/http://www.mndaily.com/archive/index.php?year=1912] but pulled for OCR scanning but they've not yet posted 1912 - [http://www.mndaily.com/archives/pdfs/1912 PDF Archives: 1912 | mndaily.com - The Minnesota Daily] --&gt;

His further travels took him to [[Omaha, Nebraska]] (21 September), [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] (23 September), [[Denver]], Colorado ( 24–27 September), [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado]] (28 September), and [[Salt Lake City]] (29–30 September).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Come to Lecture on Bahai Religion | newspaper = Salt Lake Tribune| location = Salt Lake City |pages=5, 4th column (registration required)| date = 30 September 1912 | url = http://www.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=95000518&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=0&amp;currentPage=60&amp;fpo=False | accessdate = 24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Come to Lecture on Bahai Religion | newspaper = The Evening Standard | location = Ogden Utah |pages=14, 4th column (registration required)| publisher = | date = 30 September 1912 | url = http://www.newspaperarchive.com/PdfViewerTags.aspx?img=54190952&amp;firstvisit=true&amp;src=search&amp;currentResult=9&amp;currentPage=50&amp;fpo=False |accessdate = 24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Salt Lake City, `Abdu'l-Bahá, accompanied by his translators, [[Saichiro Fujita]] and others attended the Utah State Fair and visited the [[Mormon Tabernacle]]. During the Mormon's annual convention, at the steps of the Temple, he was reported to have said: "They built me a temple but they will not let me in!" He left the next day and travelled by railcar to San Francisco, on what was then the Central Pacific Railroad, through Reno. Traveling all day through Nevada on its way to California, the train made regular stops but there's no record of `Abdu'l-Bahá disembarking until his arrival in San Francisco. While traversing the Sierra Nevada, he made a reference to observing the snow sheds at [[Donner Pass]] and the struggle of the pioneering members of the [[Donner Party]].

===California===
`Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in [[San Francisco]] on 4 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Frances Orr | last = Allen | title = 'Abdu'l-Bahá in San Francisco, California | journal = Star of the West | volume = 3 | issue = 12 | date = 16 October 1912 | page = 9| ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1980|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his visit to California he mostly stayed in [[Bay Area]] including from 4–13 October, 16–18 October, 21–25 October with shorter trips to [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]] from 13 to 16 October, to [[Los Angeles]] from 18–21 October and to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] from 25–26 October While in San Francisco, `Abdu'l-Bahá spoke at [[Stanford University]] on 8 October, and at Temple Emmanuel-El on 12 October.

When `Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in Los Angeles he went to the [[Hotel Lankershim]], where he would reside during he stay, and where he would later give a talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Foreign Tongue Soothes; Bahaistic Leader Gives Advice and Comfort through Interpreter' Followers Quekk Threatened Revolt | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | page = 110 | date = 21 October 1912 | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=61&amp;did=348420242&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1272904244 | accessdate = 3 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The hotel was located at Broadway and 7th.

Thornton Chase was the first American Bahá'í, and he had only recently moved to Los Angeles and helped form the first [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dobbs | first = Randolph | title = Los Angeles Baha'i community turns 100 | work = Commemorations | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States | date = 8 January 2010 | url = http://www.bahai.us/LA_100_anniversary | accessdate = 4 November 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101228143843/http://www.bahai.us/LA_100_anniversary | archivedate = 28 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá was eager to meet Thornton Chase, but Chase died on the evening of 30 September shortly before `Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in California on 4 October. `Abdu'l-Bahá designated Chase's grave a place of pilgrimage, and revealed a tablet of visitation, which is a prayer to say in remembrance of a person, and decreed that his death be commemorated annually.&lt;ref name="StockmanChase"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Stockman|first= Robert H. |encyclopedia= Bahá’í Encyclopedia Project |title= Chase, Thornton (1847-1912) |year= 2009 |publisher= National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States |location= Evanston, IL |url= http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=37%3Abiography&amp;id=46%3Achase-thornton-18471912&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=74 | ref = harv |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140222175306/http://www.bahai-encyclopedia-project.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=37%3Abiography&amp;id=46%3Achase-thornton-18471912&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=74 |archivedate= 22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back across America===
After his visit to California, `Abdu'l-Bahá started his trip back to the East coast. On his way back he stopped in [[Denver]] (28–29 October), [[Chicago]] (31 October – 3 November) and [[Cincinnati]] (5–6 November) before arriving in [[Washington, D.C.]] on 6 November. In Washington he was invited to speak to the [[Washington Hebrew Congregation]] at their temple on 9 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Appeals to Jewish Hearers; Abdul Baha Addresses Washington Hebrew Congregation | newspaper = The Washington Post | page = 3 (registration required) | date = 9 November 1912 | url = http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=62&amp;did=242972252&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=10&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP&amp;TS=1272904244 | accessdate = 3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his arrival in Liverpool `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in the city for three days before going to [[London]] by train on 16 December.

`Abdu'l-Bahá and his associates leave Edinburgh mid-morning on the 10th, and went back to London until the 15th. Then he was in [[Bristol]] on 15 and 16 January, coming back to London where he stayed until the 21st, except for a trip to [[Woking]] on the 18th.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

===Continental Europe===
[[File:Abdul-baha in Paris.jpg|thumb|`Abdu'l-Bahá, near the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, 1913.]]
`Abdu'l-Bahá's arrived in Paris on 22 January; the visit which was his second to the city last for a couple months. During his stay in the city he continued his public talks, as well as with meeting Bahá'ís, including locals, those from Germany, and those who had come from the East specifically to meet with him. During his stay in Paris, `Abdu'l-Bahá's stayed at an apartment at 30 Rue St Didier which was rented for him by [[Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney]].&lt;ref name="balyuzi373"&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=373–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the notables that `Abdu'l-Bahá met while in Paris include the Persian minister in Paris, several prominent Ottomans from the previous regime, professor 'Inayatu'llah Khan, and [[E.G. Browne]].&lt;ref name="balyuzi373" /&gt; He also gave a talk on the evening of the 12th to the [[Esperanto|Esperantists]], and on the next evening gave a talk to the Theosophists at the Hotel Moderne. He had met with a group of Pairs professors and theological students at Pasteur Henri Monneir's Theological Seminary; Pasteur Monnier was a distinguished Protestant theologian, vice-president of the [[Protestant Federation of France]] and professor of Protestant theology in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Fazel | first = Seena | title = 'Abdu'l-Bahá on Christ and Christianity | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 03 | issue = 1 | publisher = | year = 1993 | url = http://bahai-library.com/fazel_abdulbaha_christ_christianity | accessdate = 3 July 2010| ref = harv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140404124851/http://bahai-library.com/fazel_abdulbaha_christ_christianity | archivedate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around a week later, on the 21st, `Abdu'l-Bahá spoke at the [[Salle de Troyes]] which was organized by L'Alliance Spiritualiste.&lt;ref name="balyuzi373" /&gt; On 30 March, `Abdu'l-Bahá left Paris toward [[Stuttgart]].

He visited Germany for 8 days in 1913, including visiting Stuttgart, [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]] and [[Bad Mergentheim]].&lt;ref name="b_end" /&gt; During this visit he spoke to a youth group as well as a gathering of [[Esperantists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1979|pp=286–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá left Stuttgart to go to [[Budapest]], and on his way he changed trains in [[Vienna]], where a number of Iranian Bahá'ís were waiting for him.&lt;ref name="balyuzi383"&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=383–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke to them while he was waiting for the train to Budapest. In Budapest `Abdu'l-Bahá met with a number of well known social leaders including academics and leaders of peace movements including Turks, Arabs, Jews and Catholics. See the [[Bahá'í Faith in Hungary#Before WWI|Bahá'í Faith in Hungary]]. He also met with the [[Theosophical Society]], and the Turkish Association. On 11 April he spoke at the hall of the old building of parliament, and on the next day he spoke to some visitors who included the president of the [[Turanian Society]].&lt;ref name="balyuzi383" /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá was supposed to leave to Vienna on the 15th, but because of a cold he did not travel to Vienna until 18 April.&lt;ref name="balyuzi383" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Draft Summary of the History and International Character of the Hungarian Bahá’í Community|url=http://www.bahai.hu/english/draft-summary-history-international-character-hungarian-bahai-community/|publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Hungary. 2011.|accessdate=26 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105101659/http://www.bahai.hu/english/draft-summary-history-international-character-hungarian-bahai-community/|archivedate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Vienna `Abdu'l-Bahá met with the Persian minister, the Turkish Ambassador in multiple occasions, and spoke with Theosophists on three separate days. He also met with [[Bertha von Suttner]], who was the first woman to win the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="balyuzi383" /&gt; He left Vienna on the 24th, and went back to Stuttgart where he arrived early on 25 April 1913. During his week in Stuttgart, he mostly stayed at his hotel due to a lingering cold, but he did give a talk at a museum, as well as receiving guests at his room.&lt;ref name="balyuzi388"&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=388–401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

`Abdu'l-Bahá left Stuttgart on 1 May, arriving in Paris on the 2nd for his third stay in the French capital; he stayed in Paris until 12 June.&lt;ref name="balyuzi388" /&gt; Because his travels had led to reduced physical strength, `Abdu'l-Bahá was largely unable to go to meetings held in Bahá'í homes during his final stay in Paris, but he did hold meetings and talks at his hotel. He also met again with Turkish and Persian ministers. On June 6h, [[Ahmed Izzet Pasha]], the former grand vizier of the [[Ottoman Empire]], gave a dinner party for `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref name="balyuzi388" /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá gave his final farewell at the Paris train station, when he boarded a train for [[Marseilles]] on 12 June. He stayed in Marseilles for one night before boarding the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P &amp; O]] steamer Himalaya early the next morning on 13 June. The steamer landed in [[Port Said]] in Egypt on 17 June 1913.&lt;ref name="balyuzi388" /&gt;

===Return to Egypt===
When `Abdu'l-Bahá returned to Egypt, he decided not to immediately go back to [[Haifa]]. He stayed in Port Said until 11 July, and during his time there he met with many Bahá'ís, who had come to visit him from Haifa, and local Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref name="balyuzi388" /&gt; Because of bad weather conditions, `Abdu'l-Bahá moved to [[Ismailia]], but there he contracted a fever and only attended his mail during his week there. Thinking that the humid conditions in [[Alexandria]] would be better for his health, `Abdu'l-Bahá travelled on 17 July to a Ramleh, a suburb of Alexandria. On 1 August, his grandson [[Shoghi Effendi]], his sister [[Bahiyyih Khánum]] and his eldest daughter came to visit him from Haifa.&lt;ref name="balyuzi388" /&gt; Later during his stay he again met with [[Abbas II of Egypt]], the [[Khedive]] of Egypt. Finally on 2 December he boarded a [[Lloyd Triestino]] boat, and headed for Haifa with stops in Port Said and [[Jaffa]]. He landed in Haifa in the early afternoon of 5 December 1913.&lt;ref name="balyuzi388" /&gt;
