The '''AHRC/ESRC Religion and Society Programme''' is a five-year strategic research initiative funded by two UK research councils: the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]. running 2007-2012. It has funded 75 projects across UK universities investigating various aspects of the complex relationships between religion and society, both historical and contemporary.

Research supported includes the website "British Religion in Numbers",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brin.ac.uk/ British Religion in Numbers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029143012/http://www.brin.ac.uk/ |date=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing a one-stop shop for statistics on religion in Britain led by Professor [[David Voas]] at [[Manchester University]], Professor Kim Knott at [[Leeds University]]'s restudy of British media coverage of religion and spirituality, and an investigation of Hindu, Muslim and Sikh shrine practices across the Punjab led by Dr Tej Purewal, also at Manchester. Phase 2 of the Programme has focused on Youth and Religion specifically, supporting projects like Dr Basia Spalek at [[Birmingham University]]'s research into police partnerships with young Muslims.

The Religion and Society Programme is hosted at [[Lancaster University]], and directed by Professor [[Linda Woodhead]] helped by Dr Rebecca Catto (Research Associate) and Peta Ainsworth (Administrator). The Programme also helps to organize various relevant and topical events such as a day at the British Library asking ‘where next for religion in the public sphere’ in July 2010 and a closed seminar asking ‘Child abuse in the Catholic Church – what can be learned?’ at [[Heythrop College]] London in November 2010.

== Sociology of Religion ==
Sociologist have studied religion right from the beginning of the discipline, in the 19th century. It was a central concern of the first generation of sociological thinkers and those who influence them. Major influences in the history of the disciplines, such as [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Durkheim]], [[Max Weber|Weber]], and Simmel all contributed in various ways to the sociology of religion. The French philosopher August Comte, coined the term sociology. Even so, religion as a replacement for existing religions as a new religion of positivism. Positivism was the view that only the methods of the natural sciences could provide knowledge of human nature and society (Kaelber, 2004). He thought positivism was valuable for its potential to solve social problems and to reorganize society. He developed a blueprint for a new social order which had a religion of humanity at its ethical basis. He did so to recognize the importance of religion in creating social bonds between people. However, his work has been largely overshadowed by the work of other scholars in sociology of religion, such as Max Weber and Durkheim's. Later work in the sociology of religion has often been developed with the work of these early scholars. Just to pick one example, one of the most famous works in the sociology of religion; Max Weber's ''[[the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. This was concerned with the question of the role played by religion. It's all to understand why a system of rational capitalism developing the west from about the 17th century onwards (Kaelber, 2004). Sociologist are interested in studying religion for three main reason. The first, is that religion is simply very important in the lives of many people around the world. Eighty five percent of the world's population affirmed some kind of religious belief with Christians, Muslims, and Hindus making up the three largest religious groups. Religious ideas help people to interpret their experiences. Religious values influence many people's actions and the organizations provide many people with fellowship, aid, and support. Sociologists just seeking to understand people's culture, can’t avoid than to understand the role that religion plays in their lives. Also, they must understand the consequences of religious beliefs and practices for the wider society, which might contain non-religious elements or a diversity. Second, revolves around the idea of how religion takes different forms. The difference in religious beliefs and practices between societies is something that is noticeable and needs explanation. Finally, the third reason for religious study in sociology is the fact that religion changes over time in response to different social conditions. The prime objective for this effect, is to understand why (Kaelber, 2002).

== Religion in America ==
Religion in America has had a relationship since the very beginning of the nation. This relationship has changed over time and has shaped the culture. It started with the Native Americans and their worship of the Great Spirits. They believed that their ancestors watched over them and that the spirits in nature blessed them. When colonist came to America, they brought Christianity along with them. They tried to integrate the religion into the lives of the Native people. Christianity branched out and separated into Protestant and Catholic (Trundle, 2012). There were many forms of Protestant like [[Methodist]], Lutheran, and Quakers. There are other forms of Catholic as well, including the [[Roman Catholic]] and eastern Orthodox. Later other religions were introduced to America through immigration. Religions like [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]], and many others. These began to influence the culture. America was known as the melting pot of different cultures and religions. It was seen as a safe haven for those seeking religious freedom. Religion has effected America in many ways over the years. It was the reason the colonist came to America, and was used as an excuse for dominating over the Native Americans (Trundle, 2012). It was also used as a foundation for the civil rights movement as Martin Luther King Jr. presented his speech through his own personal belief system. More recent was September 11 when the twin towers were destroyed through religious beliefs. The bombers claimed that it was for religious purposes on why they did what they did. In effect, all religions joined together in America to rebuild and grow stronger. Religion has brought people together in times of need, throughout history. It has also caused negative effects in society as explained with 9/11.

== What happens after Religion ==
Fewer and fewer people believe nowadays. It's possible that in a generation, there simply won’t be religion across [[Europe]] and large sections of [[North America]], [[Australia]], and [[Asia]]. That's not necessarily a problem. However, it is worth thinking about why people made up religion in the first place, and what we’re doing with the needs and longings that led them to do so. At one level, religions are about asking us to believe in something. When people say, they can’t believe, they tend to stop right there with the whole religion business. They often then point out all the horrid things that religions have undoubtly done and continue to do. In this sense, belief is almost the least important and defiantly the least interesting side of religion. What's fascinating is all the other stuff religions get up to. For example, the way they regularly gather people around, and tell them to be nice to one another. Also, the way they create a sense of community, teaching others to see everyone else as human beings (Gruber, 2008). Religions use rituals to point stuff out to us and lodge it in our fickle minds. For example, that the seasons are changing or that it's the time to remember our ancestors. Religions know were not just intellectual creatures, so they carefully appeal to us via art and beauty. We think of beauty in one category, a frivolous and superficial thing, and truth and depth in another. Religions join them together. They build temples, cathedrals, and mosques that use beauty to lend depth to important ideas. They use the resources of art to remind us of what matters. Its directed at making us feel things, calm, pity, awe.

We may no longer believe, but the needs and longings that make up these stories go on. We long for beauty, wisdom, and purpose. We want to live for something more than just ourselves. Society tells us to direct our hopes in two areas. These are romantic love, and professional success, and it distracts us with news, movies, and consumption. It's not enough, as we know. We need reminders to be good, places to reawaken awe, and something to awaken our kinder, less selfish impulses. Universal things which need tending like delicate flowers and rituals that bring us together. The choice isn’t between religion and a secular world as it is now. The challenge is to learn from religions, so we can fill the secular world with replacements for the things we long ago made up religion to provide (Giovanni, 2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2843">In [[anthropology]], an '''acephalous society''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀκέφαλος "headless") is a society which lacks political leaders or hierarchies. Such groups are also known [[Social stratification#Non-stratified societies|non-stratified]] societies. Typically these societies are small-scale,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51115271|title=Dictionary of the social sciences|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Calhoun, Craig J., 1952-, Oxford University Press.|isbn=9780199891184|location=New York|oclc=51115271}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized into bands or tribes that make decisions through [[consensus decision making]] rather than appointing permanent chiefs or kings. Most foraging or [[hunter-gatherer]] societies are acephalous {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Some exceptions to this trend are the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River Valley Civilization]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]] and the [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture|Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Worshipping Power: An Anarchist History of State Formation|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When these societies do not possess distinctions of rank, they are described as [[egalitarian]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In scientific literature covering native African societies and the effect of [[European colonialism]] on them the term is often used to describe groups of people living in a settlement with "no government in the sense of a group able to exercise effective control over both the people and their territory".&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Daannaa: "The Acephalous Society And The Indirect Rule System in Africa, Journal of Legal Pluralism And Unofficial Law, Nr. 34, p. 62, http://www.jlp.bham.ac.uk/volumes/34/daannaa-art.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect the term is also often used as synonymous to "stateless society".&lt;ref name="Ayittey"&gt;Daannaa, p61; G.N. Ayittey: "STATELESS SOCIETIES: The Igbo, the Fulani, the Somali", A New Nigeria, http://seunfakze.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/stateless-societies-the-igbo-the-fulani-the-somali-by-prof-g-n-ayittey/&lt;/ref&gt; Such societies are described as consensus-democratic in opposition to the majority-democratic systems of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Ayittey, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Igbo people|Igbo Nation]] in West Africa is alleged to be an acephalous or egalitarian society.&lt;ref name="Ayittey"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35139">'''Agricultural pollution''' refers to [[biotic material|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] byproducts of [[agriculture|farming]] practices that result in [[pollution|contamination or degradation]] of the environment and surrounding ecosystems, and/or cause injury to humans and their economic interests. The pollution may come from a variety of sources, ranging from [[point source pollution|point source water pollution]] (from a single discharge point) to more diffuse, landscape-level causes, also known as [[non-point source pollution]]. Management practices play a crucial role in the amount and impact of these pollutants. Management techniques range from animal management and housing to the spread of [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s in global agricultural practices.

==Abiotic sources==
===Pesticides===
[[File:Cropduster spraying pesticides.jpg|thumb|alt=Cropduster spraying pesticides.|[[Aerial application]] of [[pesticide]].]]
[[Pesticides]] and [[herbicides]] are applied to agricultural land to control pests that disrupt crop production. [[Soil contamination]] can occur when pesticides persist and accumulate in soils, which can alter [[Microbial metabolism|microbial processes]], increase plant uptake of the chemical, and also cause [[toxicity]] to soil organisms. The extent to which the pesticides and herbicides persist depends on the compound’s unique chemistry, which affects [[sorption]] dynamics and resulting fate and transport in the soil environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/science/efed_databasesdescription.htm |title=Environmental Databases: Ecotoxicity Database |website=Pesticides: Science and Policy |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |date=2006-06-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704074226/http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/science/efed_databasesdescription.htm |archive-date=2014-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides can also accumulate in animals that eat contaminated pests and soil organisms. In addition, pesticides can be more harmful to beneficial insects, such as pollinators, and to natural enemies of pests (i.e. insects that prey on or parasitize pests) than they are to the target pests themselves.&lt;ref name="Gullan"&gt;Gullan, P.J. and Cranston, P.S. (2010) The Insects: An Outline of Entomology, 4th Edition. Blackwell Publishing UK: 584 pp.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pesticide leaching====
Pesticide leaching occurs when pesticides mix with water and move through the soil, ultimately [[Groundwater pollution|contaminating groundwater]]. The amount of leaching is correlated with particular soil and pesticide characteristics and the degree of rainfall and irrigation. Leaching is most likely to happen if using a water-soluble pesticide, when the soil tends to be sandy in texture; if excessive watering occurs just after pesticide application; if the adsorption ability of the pesticide to the soil is low. Leaching may not only originate from treated fields, but also from pesticide mixing areas, pesticide application machinery washing sites, or disposal areas.&lt;ref name="agf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/pesticides/c_2.htm |title=Environmental Fate of Pesticides |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Pesticide Wise |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture |location=Victoria, BC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225091304/http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/pesticides/c_2.htm |archive-date=2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertilizers===
Only a fraction of the [[nitrogen]]-based fertilizers is converted to produce and other plant matter. The remainder accumulates in the soil or lost as [[surface runoff|runoff]]. High application rates of nitrogen-containing fertilizers combined with the high water-solubility of [[nitrate]] leads to increased runoff into surface water as well as leaching into groundwater, thereby causing [[groundwater pollution]]. The excessive use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers (be they synthetic or natural) is particularly damaging, as much of the nitrogen that is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached. Nitrate levels above 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L (10 ppm) in groundwater can cause "[[blue baby syndrome]]" (acquired methemoglobinemia). The nutrients, especially nitrates, in fertilizers can cause problems for natural habitats and for human health if they are washed off soil into watercourses or leached through soil into groundwater.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Moreover, the abuse of fertilizers caused air pollution in the form of ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tsigaridis|first1=Kostas|last2=Miller|first2=Ron|title=A Major Source of Air Pollution: Farms|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/3281|website=Earth Institute Columbia University|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cadmium
The concentration of [[cadmium]] in [[phosphorus]]-containing fertilizers varies considerably and can be problematic. For example, mono-ammonium phosphate fertilizer may have a cadmium content of as low as 0.14&amp;nbsp;mg/kg or as high as 50.9&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. This is because the [[phosphate rock]] used in their manufacture can contain as much as 188&amp;nbsp;mg/kg cadmium (examples are deposits on Nauru and the Christmas islands). Continuous use of high-cadmium fertilizer can contaminate soil and plants. Limits to the cadmium content of phosphate fertilizers has been considered by the [[European Commission]]. Producers of phosphorus-containing fertilizers now select phosphate rock based on the cadmium content.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

;Fluoride
Phosphate rocks contain high levels of [[fluoride]]. Consequently, the widespread use of phosphate fertilizers has increased soil fluoride concentrations. It has been found that food contamination from fertilizer is of little concern as plants accumulate little fluoride from the soil; of greater concern is the possibility of fluoride toxicity to livestock that ingest contaminated soils. Also of possible concern are the effects of fluoride on soil microorganisms.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

;Radioactive elements
The radioactive content of the fertilizers varies considerably and depends both on their concentrations in the parent mineral and on the fertilizer production process. [[Uranium-238]] concentrations range can range from 7 to 100 pCi/g in phosphate rock and from 1 to 67 pCi/g in phosphate fertilizers. Where high annual rates of phosphorus fertilizer are used, this can result in uranium-238 concentrations in soils and drainage waters that are several times greater than are normally present. However, the impact of these increases on the risk to human health from radinuclide contamination of foods is very small (less than 0.05 mSv/y).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

;Other metals
[[Steel industry]] wastes, which are recycled into fertilizers for their high levels of [[zinc]] (essential to plant growth), can include the following toxic metals: [[lead]], [[arsenic]], cadmium, [[chromium]], and [[nickel]]. The most common toxic elements in this type of fertilizer are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, and arsenic. These potentially harmful impurities can be removed; however, this significantly increases cost. Highly pure fertilizers are widely available and perhaps best known as the highly water-soluble fertilizers containing blue dyes used around households, such as [[Miracle-Gro]]. These highly water-soluble fertilizers are used in the plant nursery business and are available in larger packages at significantly less cost than retail quantities. There are also some inexpensive retail granular garden fertilizers made with high purity ingredients.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Leaching, runoff, and eutrophication====
[[File:Potomac river eutro.jpg|thumb|alt=The bright green water in the Potomac River estuary is result of a dense bloom of cyanobacteria.|[[Eutrophication]] of the [[Potomac River]].]]
The [[nitrogen]] (N) and [[phosphorus]] (P) applied to agricultural land (via synthetic fertilizers, composts, manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative environmental consequences. Excess N supplied by both synthetic fertilizers (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic sources such as [[manure]]s (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by soil microorganisms) can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate. Nitrate-contaminated drinking water can cause [[blue baby syndrome]]. Together with excess P from these same fertilizer sources, [[eutrophication]] can occur downstream due to excess nutrient supply, leading to [[anoxic waters|anoxic]] areas called dead zones.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Organic contaminants====
[[Manures]] and [[biosolids]] contain many nutrients consumed by animals and humans in the form of food. The practice of returning such waste products to agricultural land presents an opportunity to recycle soil nutrients. The challenge is that manures and biosolids contain not only nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, but they may also contain contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). There is a wide variety and vast quantity of PPCPs consumed by both humans and animals, and each has unique chemistry in terrestrial and aquatic environments. As such, not all have been assessed for their effects on soil, water, and air quality. The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has surveyed sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants across the US to assess levels of various PPCPs present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/sewage-sludge-surveys |title=Sewage Sludge Surveys |publisher=EPA |website=Biosolids |date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavy metals===
The major inputs of [[heavy metals]] (e.g. lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury) into agricultural systems are fertilizers, organic wastes such as manures, and industrial byproduct wastes. Some farming techniques, such as irrigation, can lead to accumulation of [[selenium]] (Se) that occurs naturally in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ganje |first1=T. J. |chapter=Selenium |year=1966 |editor1-last=Chapman |editor1-first=H. D. |title=Diagnostic Criteria for Plants and Soils |pages=394–404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in downstream water reservoirs containing concentrations of selenium that are toxic to wildlife, livestock, and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0147-6513(03)00064-2 |pmid=15041249 |title=Review of 15 years of research on ecotoxicology and remediation of land contaminated by agricultural drainage sediment rich in selenium |journal=Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=257–69 |year=2004 |last1=Wu |first1=Lin }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process is known as the “Kesterson Effect,” eponymously named after the [[Kesterson Reservoir]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] (California, USA), which was declared a toxic waste dump in 1987.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Land management===
====Tillage and nitrous oxide emissions====
Natural soil biogeochemical processes result in the emission of various greenhouse gases, including nitrous oxide. Agricultural management practices can affect emission levels. For example, tillage levels have also been shown to affect [[nitrous oxide]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700030029x |title=Nitrous Oxide Emission in Three Years as Affected by Tillage, Corn-Soybean-Alfalfa Rotations, and Nitrogen Fertilization |journal=Journal of Environment Quality |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=698–703 |year=1998 |last1=MacKenzie |first1=A.

====Soil erosion and sedimentation====
Agriculture contributes greatly to [[soil erosion]] and [[sediment]] deposition through intensive management or inefficient land cover.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Long-Range Soil and Water Conservation, National Research Council. 1993. Soil and Water Quality: An Agenda for Agriculture. National Academy Press: Washington, D.C.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that agricultural land degradation is leading to an irreversible decline in fertility on about 6 million ha of fertile land each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dudal |first1=R. |year=1981 |chapter=An evaluation of conservation needs |pages=3–12 |title=Soil Conservation, Problems and Prospects |editor1-first=R. P. C. |editor1-last=Morgan |location=Chichester, U.K. |publisher=Wiley }}&lt;/ref&gt; The accumulation of [[sediment]]s (i.e. sedimentation) in [[Surface runoff|runoff]] water affects water quality in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Matt |last1=Hangsleben |first2=David |last2=Suh |date=November 30, 2006 |title=Sediment Pollution |url=http://www3.abe.iastate.edu/tsm424/TSM424TermProj2006/HangslebenSuhFinalPaper.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915085504/http://www3.abe.iastate.edu/tsm424/TSM424TermProj2006/HangslebenSuhFinalPaper.pdf |archivedate=September 15, 2012 }}{{self-published inline|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedimentation can decrease the transport capacity of ditches, streams, rivers, and navigation channels. It can also limit the amount of light penetrating the water, which affects aquatic biota. The resulting turbidity from sedimentation can interfere with feeding habits of fishes, affecting population dynamics. Sedimentation also affects the transport and accumulation of pollutants, including phosphorus and various pesticides.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Biotic sources==
===Greenhouse gases from fecal waste===
The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) predicted that 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gases come directly or indirectly from the world’s livestock. This report also suggested that the emissions from livestock were greater than that of the transportation sector. While livestock do currently play a role in producing greenhouse gas emissions, the estimates have been argued to be a misrepresentation. While the FAO used a life cycle assessment of animal agriculture (i.e. all aspects including emissions from growing crops for feed, transportation to slaughter, etc.), they did not apply the same assessment for the transportation sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2113(09)03001-6 |chapter=Clearing the Air: Livestock's Contribution to Climate Change |volume=103 |pages=1–40 |title=Advances in Agronomy |year=2009 |last1=Pitesky |first1=Maurice E |last2=Stackhouse |first2=Kimberly R |last3=Mitloehner |first3=Frank M |isbn=978-0-12-374819-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A PNAS model showed that even if animals were completely removed from U.S. agriculture and diets, U.S. GHG emissions would be decreased by 2.6% only (or 28% of agricultural GHG emissions). This is because of the need replace animal manures by fertilizers and to replace also other animal coproducts, and because livestock now use human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts. Moreover, people would suffer from a greater number of deficiencies in essential nutrients although they would get a greater excess of energy, possibly leading to greater obesity.&lt;ref name=pnas&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/E10301.full|title=Nutritional and greenhouse gas impacts of removing animals from US agriculture|date=Nov 13, 2017|volume=114|issue=48|doi=10.1073/pnas.1707322114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopesticides===
[[Biopesticides]] are pesticides derived from natural materials (animals, plants, microorganisms, certain minerals).&lt;ref name="Pedigoand"&gt;L. P. Pedigo, and M. Rice. 2009. Entomology and Pest Management, 6th Edition. Prentice Hall: 816 pp.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to traditional pesticides, biopesticides can reduce overall agricultural pollution because they are safe to handle, usually do not strongly affect beneficial invertebrates or vertebrates, and have a short residual time.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt; Some concerns exist that biopesticides may have negative impacts on populations of nontarget species, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10123-003-0144-x |pmid=12955583 |title=Development, registration and commercialization of microbial pesticides for plant protection |journal=International Microbiology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=245–52 |year=2003 |last1=Montesinos |first1=Emilio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, biopesticides are regulated by EPA. Because biopesticides are less harmful and have fewer environmental effects than other pesticides, the agency does not require as much data to register their use. Many biopesticides are permitted under the [[National Organic Program]], [[United States Department of Agriculture]], standards for organic crop production.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt;

===Introduced species===
====Invasive species====
{{main|Invasive species}}
[[File:Yellow star thistle.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Yellow Star Thistle.|''[[Centaurea solstitialis]]'', an aggressively invasive weed, was probably introduced to North America in contaminated fodder seed. Agricultural practices such as tilling and livestock grazing aided in its rapid spread. It is toxic to horses, prevents native plants from growing (decreasing biodiversity and degrading natural ecosystems), and is a physical barrier to the migration of indigenous animals.]]
The increasing [[globalization]] of agriculture has resulted in the accidental transport of pests, weeds, and diseases to novel ranges. If they establish, they become an invasive species that can impact populations of native species&lt;ref name="Mooney"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398 |pmid=11344292 |pmc=33232 |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=5446–51 |year=2001 |last1=Mooney |first1=H. A |last2=Cleland |first2=E. E |bibcode=2001PNAS...98.5446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and threaten agricultural production.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt; For example, the transport of [[bumble bee]]s reared in Europe and shipped to the United States and/or Canada for use as commercial [[pollinator]]s has led to the introduction of an Old World parasite to the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/135295/0 |title=Bombus franklini (Franklin's Bumble Bee) |publisher=Iucnredlist.org |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This introduction may play a role in recent native bumble bee declines in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thorp |first1=R.W. |first2=M.D. |last2=Shepherd |year=2005 |chapter=Profile: Subgenus Bombus Lateille 1802 (Apidae: Apinae: Bombini) |editor1-first=M.D. |editor1-last=Shepherd |editor2-first=D.M. |editor2-last=Vaughan |editor3-first=S.H. |editor3-last=Black |title=Red list of pollinator insects of North America |publisher=Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation |location=Portland, OR }}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculturally introduced species can also [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ize with native species resulting in a decline in genetic [[biodiversity]] &lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt; and threaten agricultural production.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

Habitat [[disturbance (ecology)]] associated with farming practices themselves can also facilitate the establishment of these introduced organisms. Contaminated machinery, livestock and fodder, and contaminated crop or pasture seed can also lead to the spread of weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeds.gov.au/management/prevention.htm |title=Weeds in Australia home page |publisher=Weeds.gov.au |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quarantines (see [[biosecurity]] )are one way in which prevention of the spread of invasive species can be regulated at the policy level. A quarantine is a legal instrument that restricts the movement of infested material from areas where an invasive species is present to areas in which it is absent.
The [[World Trade Organization]] has international regulations concerning the quarantine of pests and diseases under the [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]]. Individual countries often have their own quarantine regulations. In the United States, for example, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]/[[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (USDA/APHIS) administers domestic (within the United States) and foreign (importations from outside the United States) quarantines. These quarantines are enforced by inspectors at state borders and ports of entry.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt;

====Biological control====
The use of [[biological pest control]] agents, or using predators, [[parasitoid]]s, parasites, and pathogens to control agricultural pests, has the potential to reduce agricultural pollution associated with other pest control techniques, such as pesticide use. The merits of introducing non-native biocontrol agents have been widely debated, however. Once released, the introduction of a biocontrol agent can be irreversible. Potential ecological issues could include the dispersal from agricultural habitats into natural environments, and host-switching or adapting to utilize a native species. In addition, predicting the interaction outcomes in complex ecosystems and potential ecological impacts prior to release can be difficult. One example of a biocontrol program that resulted in ecological damage occurred in North America, where a parasitoid of butterflies was introduced to control [[gypsy moth]] and browntail moth.  This parasitoid is capable of utilizing many butterfly host species, and likely resulted in the decline and extirpation of several native silk moth species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.48.060402.102800 |pmid=12208812 |title=Nontarget effects—the Achilles' heel of biological control? Retrospective analyses to reduce risk associated with biocontrol introductions |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=48 |pages=365–96 |year=2003 |last1=Louda |first1=S.M |last2=Pemberton |first2=R.W |last3=Johnson |first3=M.T |last4=Follett |first4=P.A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International exploration for potential biocontrol agents is aided by agencies such as the European Biological Control Laboratory, the United States Department of Agriculture/[[Agricultural Research Service]] (USDA/ARS), the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control, and the [[International Organization for Biological Control]] of Noxious Plants and Animals.  In order to prevent agricultural pollution, quarantine and extensive research on the organism’s potential efficacy and ecological impacts are required prior to introduction. If approved, attempts are made to colonize and disperse the biocontrol agent in appropriate agricultural settings. Continual evaluations on their efficacy are conducted.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt;

===Genetically modified organisms (GMO)===
[[File:Bt plants.png|thumb|left|alt= Top: Lesser cornstalk borer larvae extensively damaged the leaves of this unprotected peanut plant. (Image Number K8664-2)-Photo by Herb Pilcher. Bottom: After only a few bites of peanut leaves of this genetically engineered plant (containing the genes of the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacteria), this lesser cornstalk borer larva crawled off the leaf and died. (Image Number K8664-1)-Photo by Herb Pilcher.|(Top) Non transgenic peanut leaves showing extensive damage from [[European corn borer]] larvae. (Bottom) Peanut leaves genetically engineered to produce Bt toxins are protected from herbivory damage.]]

====Genetic contamination and ecological effects====
GMO crops can, however, result in genetic contamination of native plant species through hybridization. This could lead to increased weediness of the plant or the extinction of the native species. In addition, the [[transgenic]] plant itself may become a weed if the modification improves its fitness in a given environment.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

There are also concerns that non-target organisms, such as [[pollinator]]s and natural enemies, could be poisoned by accidental ingestion of Bt-producing plants. A recent study testing the effects of Bt corn pollen dusting nearby milkweed plants on larval feeding of the [[monarch butterfly]] found that the threat to populations of the monarch was low.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

The use of GMO crop plants engineered for [[herbicide resistance]] can also indirectly increase the amount of agricultural pollution associated with [[herbicide]] use. For example, the increased use of herbicide in herbicide-resistant corn fields in the mid-western United States is decreasing the amount of milkweeds available for [[monarch butterfly]] larvae.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

[[Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]] vary based on the type of organism and the country concerned.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====GMO as a tool of pollution reduction====
While there may be some concerns regarding the use of GM products, it may also be the solution to some of the existing animal agriculture pollution issues.  One of the main sources of pollution, particularly vitamin and mineral drift in soils, comes from a lack of digestive efficiency in animals.  By improving digestive efficiency, it is possible to minimize both the cost of animal production and the environmental damage.  One successful example of this technology and its potential application is the [[Enviropig]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The [[Enviropig]] is a genetically modified Yorkshire pig that expresses [[phytase]] in its saliva. Grains, such as corn and wheat, have phosphorus that is bound in a naturally indigestible form known as phytic acid. [[Phosphorus]], an essential nutrient for pigs, is then added to the diet, since it can not be broken down in the pigs digestive tract.  As a result, nearly all of the phosphorus naturally found in the grain is wasted in the feces, and can contribute to elevated levels in the soil. Phytase is an enzyme that is able to break down the otherwise indigestible phytic acid, making it available to the pig. The ability of the Enviropig to digest the phosphorus from the grains eliminates the waste of that natural phosphorus (20-60% reduction), while also eliminating the need to supplement the nutrient in feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/90788 |pmid=11479566 |year=2001 |last1=Golovan |first1=Serguei P |title=Pigs expressing salivary phytase produce low-phosphorus manure |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=741–5 |last2=Meidinger |first2=Roy G |last3=Ajakaiye |first3=Ayodele |last4=Cottrill |first4=Michael |last5=Wiederkehr |first5=Miles Z |last6=Barney |first6=David J |last7=Plante |first7=Claire |last8=Pollard |first8=John W |last9=Fan |first9=Ming Z |last10=Hayes |first10=M.

===Animal management===
====Manure management====
{{main|Manure management}}
One of the main contributors to air, soil and [[water pollution]] is animal waste. According to a 2005 report by the USDA, more than 335 million tons of "dry matter" waste (the waste after water is removed) is produced annually on farms in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;USDA Agricultural Research Service. "FY-2005 Annual Report Manure and Byproduct Utilization", 31 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Animal feeding operation]]s produce about 100 times more manure than the amount of human sewage sludge processed in US municipal waste water plants each year. Diffuse source pollution from agricultural fertilizers is more difficult to trace, monitor and control. High nitrate concentrations are found in groundwater and may reach 50&amp;nbsp;mg/litre (the EU Directive limit). In ditches and river courses, [[nutrient pollution]] from fertilizers causes eutrophication. This is worse in winter, after autumn ploughing has released a surge of nitrates; winter rainfall is heavier increasing runoff and leaching, and there is lower plant uptake. EPA suggests that one dairy farm with 2,500 cows produces as much waste as a city with around 411,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=May 2004 |title=Risk Management Evaluation for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=901V0100.txt |publisher=EPA |location=Cincinnati, OH |page=7 |id=EPA 600/R-04/042}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]] has identified odors as the most significant animal emission problem at the local level. Different animal systems have adopted several waste management procedures to deal with the large amount of waste produced annually.

The advantages of manure treatment are a reduction in the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, ''[[Cryptosporidium]],'' which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. [[Silage]] liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Manure treatment====
=====Composting=====
[[Compost#Animal manure and bedding|Composting]] is a solid manure management system that relies on solid manure from bedded pack pens, or the solids from a liquid manure separator. There are two methods of composting, active and passive. Manure is churned periodically during active composting, whereas in passive composting it is not. Passive composting has been found to have lower green house gas emissions due to incomplete decomposition and lower gas diffusion rates.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=====Solid-liquid separation=====
Manure can be mechanically separated into a solid and liquid portion for easier management. Liquids (4-8% dry matter) can be used easily in pump systems for convenient spread over crops and the solid fraction (15-30% dry matter) can be used as stall bedding, spread on crops, composted or exported.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=====Anaerobic digestion and lagoons=====
[[File:Anaerobic Lagoon at Cal Poly.jpg|thumb|Anaerobic lagoon at a dairy]]
[[Anaerobic digestion]] is the biological treatment of liquid animal waste using bacteria in an area absent of air, which promotes the decomposition of organic solids.  Hot water is used to heat the waste in order to increase the rate of biogas production.&lt;ref name="manuremanagement.cornell"/&gt; The remaining liquid is nutrient rich and can be used on fields as a fertilizer and methane gas that can be burned directly on the biogas stove&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2017.08.068 |title=Current approach to manure management for small-scale Southeast Asian farmers - Using Vietnamese biogas and non-biogas farms as an example |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=115 |pages=362–70 |year=2018 |last1=Roubík |first1=Hynek |last2=Mazancová |first2=Jana |last3=Phung |first3=Le Dinh |last4=Banout |first4=Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in an engine generator to produce electricity and heat.&lt;ref name="manuremanagement.cornell"&gt;{{cite report |date=2005-04-12 |title=Evaluating the Need for a Manure Treatment System |series=Fact Sheet |url=http://www.manuremanagement.cornell.edu/Pages/General_Docs/Fact_Sheets/Evaluating_Need_for_Manure_Treatment_System_factsheet.pdf |publisher=Cornell University Manure Management Program |location=Ithaca, NY |id=MT-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 1999 |title=Animal Agriculture: Waste Management Practices |url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/rc99205.pdf |publisher=U.S. General Accounting Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=9–11 |id=GAO/RCED-99-205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methane is about 20 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, which has significant negative environmental effects if not controlled properly.  Anaerobic treatment of waste is the best method for controlling the odor associated with manure management.&lt;ref name="manuremanagement.cornell" /&gt;

[[Anaerobic lagoon|Biological treatment lagoons]] also use anaerobic digestion to break down solids, but at a much slower rate.  Lagoons are kept at ambient temperatures as opposed to the heated digestion tanks.  Lagoons require large land areas and high dilution volumes to work properly, so they do not work well in many climates in the northern United States. Lagoons also offer the benefit of reduced odor and biogas is made available for heat and electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2002 |title=Anaerobic Lagoons |series=Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/alagoons.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 832-F-02-009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have demonstrated that GHG emissions are reduced using aerobic digestion systems. GHG emission reductions and credits can help compensate for the higher installation cost of cleaner aerobic technologies and facilitate producer adoption of environmentally superior technologies to replace current anaerobic lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2007.09.034 |pmid=18060761 |title=Greenhouse gas emission reduction and environmental quality improvement from implementation of aerobic waste treatment systems in swine farms |journal=Waste Management |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=759–66 |year=2008 |last1=Vanotti |first1=M.B |last2=Szogi |first2=A.A |last3=Vives |first3=C.A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research''' (German: ''Alfred-Wegener-Institut, Helmholtz-Zentrum für Polar- und Meeresforschung'') is located in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany, and a member of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]]. It conducts research in the [[Arctic]], in the [[Antarctic]] and in the high and mid latitude oceans. Additional research topics are: [[North Sea]] research, marine biological monitoring and technical marine developments. The institute was founded in 1980 and is named after [[meteorologist]], [[climatologist]] and geologist [[Alfred Wegener]].

==  Research ==
The institute has three major departments: 
*Climate System Department, which studies oceans, [[ice]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] as physical and chemical systems.
*Biosciences Department, which studies the biological processes in marine and coastal ecosystems.
*Geoscientific Department, which studies climate development, especially as revealed by sediments.

== Facilities ==
The institute is distributed over several sites within [[North Germany]] and the '''Otto Schmidt Laboratory for Polar and Marine Research''' (OSL) at the [[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]] (AARI) in [[Saint Petersburg]] as Russian-German cooperation in the field of Arctic research, named after the polar explorer [[Otto Schmidt]].

===Bremerhaven===
[[Image:Alfred-Wegener-Institut.jpg|thumb|Building '''D''' resembles the [[stern]] of a ship.]]
The headquarters was founded by [[Gotthilf Hempel]]. Nowadays, the AWI has several buildings within the city of [[Bremerhaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Address and route planner|url=http://www.awi.de/en/institute/sites/bremerhaven/address_and_route_planner_bremerhaven/|publisher=Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar- and Marine Research, Bremerhaven|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steidle awi hg.jpg|thumb|Building '''E'''. The ''Harbour Tower'' on the right is directly in front of the ''Weser Tower''.]]
* '''Building D''' is located next to the old port (German: ''[[:de:Alter Hafen (Bremerhaven)|Alter Hafen]]''). The dark [[Clinker brick|clink-brick building]] was designed by [[Oswald Mathias Ungers]] in 1985 who won the [[List of architecture prizes|architecture-award]] ''[[:de:Großer BDA-Preis|BDA-prize]]'' for the building. It hosts the AWI library, the main lecture hall and various laboratories and offices.
* The '''main building E''' is next to the [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] ''[[:de:Doppelschleuse (Bremerhaven)|Doppelschleuse]]''. Main characteristics are the chequered tiles and the fact that there are three office towers. The building was designed by [[:de:Otto Steidle|Otto Steidle]] and constructed in 2004 as an extension of the '''complex A,B,C'''.
* '''House F''' is close to the [[Weser]] ferry at the [[Geeste (river)|Geeste]] [[estuary]]. The housing association StäWoG (German: ''Städtische Wohnungsgesellschaft'') renovated the building of the former nautical college (German: ''Hochschule für Seefahrt'') in 1999. For this reason, there is a  [[planetarium]] which is nowadays used by the Bremerhaven's friends of the stars.
* The small '''Bathymetry Building''' is located close to the [[Bremerhaven Radar Tower|radar tower]].
* The '''Nordsee Villa''' formerly belonged to the [[fast-food]] restaurant chain [[Nordsee]] and hosts a few offices of AWI. Nowadays it is a [[:de:Haus der Technik (Essen)|Haus der Technik]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kikker|first=Ursel|title=szmtag Haus der Technik eröffnet Zweigstelle|url=http://www.nordsee-zeitung.de/region/bremerhaven_artikel,-Haus-der-Technik-eroeffnet-Zweigstelle-_arid,758998.html|publisher=Nordsee Zeitung|accessdate=18 September 2012|language=German|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and part of the oldest German institute for technical further education with close cooperation to [[RWTH Aachen]] and other universities.
* The '''Harbour Warehouse''' (German: ''Hafenlager'') is located within the [[Lloyd Werft]], see Lloyd Werft Map.

===Potsdam===
The '''Forschungstelle Potsdam''' is situated on the [[Telegrafenberg]] next to [[Potsdam]]. It belongs to AWI since 1992. The research focuses on the [[atmospheric physics]] and [[atmospheric chemistry]] of the atmosphere on the one hand and [[periglacial]] research on the other hand.

===Sylt===
The '''Wadden Sea Station Sylt''' is located on the North German island [[Sylt]].
It was founded in 1924 as an [[oyster]] laboratory to study the decline of oyster stocks and in order to study how they could be cultivated. In 1937, the name changed from ''oyster laboratory'' to ''Wadden Sea station''. The station grew, and in 1949 the station was shifted from the northernmost edge of the island to the current location, next to the harbor of [[List, Schleswig-Holstein|List]]. In 1998 the station became part of '''AWI'''. Nowadays, there are about 30 scientists and technicians. Two guest houses allow to perform workshops and [[video conference]]s are possible with the AWI headquarters.

The research focuses on coast ecology and coast geology. In the 1930 there have been oyster reefs below the [[mussel]] banks at the water level. Below these, there have been [[sabellaria]] reefs which have been destroyed by fishery. Nowadays there are only the mussel banks left.

===Helgoland===
The '''Biologische Anstalt Helgoland''' is situated at {{coord|54.177821|7.891402|type:edu_region:DE|name=Alfred Wegener Institute, Biologische Anstalt Helgoland}} on the island [[Heligoland]] (German: ''Helgoland''). The station exists since 1892. Scientists study the ecology of the [[North Sea]] in this research station.

Since 1962, at [[Heligoland]] [[roadstead]] {{coord|54|11|2|N|7|54|0|E|type:landmark_region:DE|name=Helgoland Reede Phytoplankton Probe}}, [[phytoplankton]] and water samples are taken every weekday morning, 
the [[turbidity]] is measured (e.g. using a [[Secchi disk]]) and other parameters are recorded. The [[North Sea]] warmed by 1.65&amp;nbsp;°C since the start of the time series.

==Stations==
The institute maintains several research stations around the Arctic Ocean and on the [[Antarctic]] continent.&lt;ref name=RefAwiStations&gt;{{cite web|title=Stations in the Arctic and in the Antarctic|url=http://www.awi.de/en/infrastructure/stations/|publisher=Alfred Wegener Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ships==
Altogether there are six ships that belong to AWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ships and boats |url=http://www.awi.de/en/infrastructure/ships/ |work=Official Website |publisher=Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar- and Marine Research |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011084615/http://www.awi.de/en/infrastructure/ships/ |archivedate=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RV ''Polarstern''===
{{main article|RV Polarstern}}
The AWI flagship is Germany's research icebreaker [[RV Polarstern|RV ''Polarstern'']]. The ship was commissioned in 1982. The double-hulled icebreaker is operational up to temperatures as low as −50&amp;nbsp;°C (−58&amp;nbsp;°F). Polarstern can break through [[sea ice]] of 1.5 m thickness at a speed of 5 knots, thicker ice must be broken by ramming. A possible but not probable follow-up flagship might be the [[Aurora Borealis (icebreaker)|research icebreaker ''Aurora Borealis'']].

===RV ''Heincke''===
The vessel RV ''Heincke'' is a multifunctional and low-noise ship for research in ice-free waters, named after German [[zoology|zoologist]] and [[Ichthyology|ichthyologist]] [[Friedrich Heincke]] .

The research [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] RV ''Uthörn'' is named after the small island [[Uthörn]] next to [[Sylt]] in the [[North Sea]]. The vessel is regularly on research tours in [[German Bight]], but is also used to supply the AWI branch ''[[Alfred Wegener Institute|Biologische Anstalt Helgoland]]'' mentioned above. Two scientists and 4 crew members can live and work on board for up to 180 days, but the vessel mainly used for day trips.&lt;ref name=AwiUthoernPlan&gt;{{cite web|title=Schiffseinsatzplan RV ''Uthörn''|url=http://www.bsh.de/de/Meeresnutzung/Wissenschaft/Forschungsschiffe/Schiffseinsatzplaene2012/uthoern.jsp|publisher=[[Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie]]|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another operation purpose are short term cruises of a few hours for up to 25 students to demonstrate [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] and biological sampling methods.

Being commissioned in 1982 RV ''Uthörn'' replaced a vessel with the same name which was built in 1947 and had a length of 24 [[m]]. The current vessel is powered by two [[V12 engine|V12]]
[[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] [[Diesel engine]]s manufactured by the company [[MWM GmbH]] from [[Mannheim]]. Each engine delivers up to 231 [[kW]] to a [[controllable-pitch propeller]]; the maximal speed is around 10 [[Knot (unit)|kn]].
On the working [[deck (ship)|deck]], there is a [[dry lab]] and a laboratory for wet work like sorting fish. The ship is equipped with standard sampling devices: You may find on board a [[demersal]] [[trawl]], a [[Van Veen Grab Sampler]], [[Niskin bottle]]s, and even deprecated [[reversing thermometer]]s for teaching purposes.

===''Mya'', ''Aade'' and ''Diker''===
The research [[catamaran]] ''Mya'' is specially designed for research in the intertidal zone, it can fall dry at low tide. The main research area is the [[Wadden Sea]]. Last but not least, there are two small motor boats, ''Aade'' and ''Diker'' for sampling and diving operations around [[Heligoland]].

==Aircraft==

===Past aircraft===
[[File:Polar 5.jpg|thumb|''Polar 5'' in June 2008]]
The Alfred Wegener Institute operated five airplanes under the name of ''Polar'', those being:&lt;ref name=former&gt;[http://www.awi.de/de/infrastruktur/fluggeraete/forschungsflugzeuge/ehemalige_flugzeuge/ Ehemalige Flugzeuge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411211551/http://www.awi.de/de/infrastruktur/fluggeraete/forschungsflugzeuge/ehemalige_flugzeuge/ |date=11 April 2013 }} {{de icon}} Alfred Wegener Institute –  Former airplanes, accessed: 18 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Polar 2'', a Dornier 228 commissioned in 1983, still in service with the AWI
* ''Polar 3'', like ''Polar 2'' commissioned in 1983, shot down possibly by [[SA-2 Guideline]] missile on 24 February 1985 over [[Western Sahara]]
* ''Polar 4'', a Dorniers 228 commissioned in 1985, severely damaged at a landing at the British [[Rothera Research Station]] in 2005, now on display at the Institute

===Current fleet===
AWI currently uses two [[Basler BT-67]]. These planes are 20 m long, 5.2 m high and have a wingspan of 29 m. The empty weight is 7680&amp;nbsp;kg, with ski landing gear it weighs 8340&amp;nbsp;kg.
The minimal cruising speed is 156&amp;nbsp;km/h, the maximum is SFA{{what|date=October 2018}}. Without payload, the flying range is around 3900&amp;nbsp;km. The planes are maintained by the company [[Kenn Borek Air]] located in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada.

====Polar 5====
The plane hull was built in 1942 but completely refurbished after the AWI acquired the plane in 2007. Since then it "has supplied a large volume of valuable data" said Prof. [[:de:Heinrich Miller|Heinrich Miller]], the former director of the AWI.

====Polar 6====
This plane with the call sign C-FHGF was acquired by AWI in 2011. The [[BMBF]], the German Federal Minister of Education and Research funded the purchase and equipping of the plane with a total of 9.78 million euros.&lt;ref name=AwiPolar6PressRelease&gt;{{cite web|last=Mehrtens|first=Folke|title=New aircraft for research – Polar 6 ready for first assignment in Antarctica|url=http://www.awi.de/en/news/press_releases/detail/item/new_aircraft_for_research_polar_6_ready_for_first_assignment_in_antarctica/?tx_list_pi1%5Bmode%5B=6&amp;cHash=cb193189f239122eebf7fe69ed998c59|publisher=Alfred-Wegener-Institut für Polar- und Meeresforschung|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:D-CICE.jpg|thumb|Ski-equipped Polar 4]]
* In January 2005, Polar 4 was severely damaged during a rough landing at the British over-wintering station Rothera on the Antarctic Peninsula. As it was impossible to repair the plane, the aircraft had to be decommissioned. Since then, scientific and logistical tasks of polar flights have been performed by ''Polar 2''.

===Polar 3 incident===
On 24 February 1985, the ''[[Polar 3]]'', a research airplane of the institute of the type [[Dornier 228]], was shot down by guerrillas of the [[Polisario Front]] over [[West Sahara]]. All three crew members died. ''Polar 3'', together with unharmed ''Polar 2'', was on its way back from [[Antarctica]] and had taken off in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], to reach [[Arrecife]], Canary Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19850224-0 Aviation safety network – Report on Polar 3] accessed: 18 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Architectural Association of [[Universiti Teknologi Malaysia]] ({{lang-ms| Persatuan Senibina Universiti Teknologi Malaysia}} or PSUTM), more commonly known as '''Architech''', is the official association for students of architecture in UTM. It was formed in the 70s during the Kuala Lumpur days, and one of the earliest students association to be registered under Office of Students' Affair (HEMA, previously HEP), and is acknowledged as one of the most active students association in UTM. It resides within the [[Department of Architecture, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia]], under the Faculty of Built Environment.

==Role==
The main role of Architech is to manage the welfare of the UTM architecture students, organize events of various forms for the benefits of its members, to become the voice of the students in the school, and ultimately to ensure the advancement of non-academic qualities amongst its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mat Yasir|first=Azari|title=Workbase Booklet 2011/12|year=2011|publisher=Department of Architecture, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia|location=Johor, Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
The Architech logo was a result of a design competition held by the association in 1992, initiated by the president at the time, Zulhisham and Che Wan Ahmad Faizal. At the time, the name Architech have not come into being, and the logo competition was actually for PSUTM. The prize advertised was RM200, however the participations were poor and uninspiring (less than 20 entries), hence no winner was picked. Instead, Che Wan Ahmad Faizal then approached Fauzee Nasir to design a logo worthy for the association.

Using Aldus Freehand 2.0. on a classic Mac, Fauzee designed the logo, incorporating the name Architech for the first time. This was the first instance of the name in use. The logo and the name Architech was accepted by the general population, and remains in use until now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nasir|first=Fauzee|title=Asal Usul Logo Architech|url=http://www.tanggam.com/v4/forum/index.php?topic=566.0|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description===
The logo utilizes simple and straightforward [[typography]], using [[Times New Roman]], beginning with a capital A and with italic type applied to the last four letters. The letters "Archi" will normally be black on white/light background, or white on black/dark background. The letters "tech" will normally be red, or gray in monochrome print.

===Rights and Ownership===
The Architech logo was designed and still owned by [[Fauzee Nasir]] until today. In a deal struck with the association, the association agreed not to pay the RM200 prize money to Fauzee Nasir as the design was not part of the competition. Hence, the designer retains ownership and rights to the logo. However, in a mutual agreement the designer gave right to use and reproduce the logo as long as it is not for commercial use. Any commercial use must have written permission from the designer.

==Student Composition==
Architech members consist of the entire population of architecture students in UTM, as students enrolled in the programme are automatically registered under it unless otherwise requested. Previously it also included students of landscape architecture until they formed their own students society in the late 1990s. When the diploma programme was shifted to UTM KL campus under the [[Razak School]], the diploma students formed their own society called ARCO, which was intended as a sister society to Architech. However, due to logistics problem, especially since both are now under two different schools, ARCO became an independent body, but maintained close relations with Architech.

===Sub-communities===
Below is the list of students batches and name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tanggam.com/v4/forum/index.php?board=40.0 List of Subcommunities in Tanggam&lt;/ref&gt; (Due to the various intake positions in the programme, it made more sense to list the batches according to their respective graduation year, instead of intake year).
* 1993 - UTM87/88
* 1994 - Batch88/89
* 1995 - Archi890
* 1996 - HUHA901

==Publications==
===Architext===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Architext frontpage August1997.jpg|thumb|right|The front page of 'Architext' dated August 1997.]]  --&gt;Architext was initiated as a periodical newsletter for Architech. It started around 1997, led by Roshida Majid and advised by Dr. Mohd Tajuddin Mohd Rasdi. Copies of the first two issues were lost; #3 was the earliest remaining copy today. It was distributed free bilingually in Bahasa Malaysia and English, featured several articles relating to architectural studies, listed events and activities, as well as a cartoon sketch.

Architext was never resumed and was presumably forgotten, until recently some of its original members began discussing of bringing it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ng|first=Johnson|title=Architext|url=http://www.tanggam.com/v4/forum/index.php?topic=4168.0|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design Folio===
The Design Folio is a publication collecting selected students' thesis works from a particular year. It is published with the notion of showcasing works based on specific theme for each publication. Students works are then selected based on the theme, ideally spanning between three and five years of thesis works. However, in its two innumeration, the selection is limited within a group of students in a particular year.

The publication is intended for commercial publications. The editorial consists of entirely students from the thesis group, advised and consulted by the Thesis Coordinators. To date, there have been two successful publications: the first in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamaruddin]|first=[editor, Syahril Nizam|title=Alternative : a design folio 2005|year=2005|publisher=Skywriting studio|location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia|isbn=983-42507-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the second in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ariffin|first=consultant editor, Syed Ahmad Iskandar Syed|title="A" for architecture an alternative book : design thesis folio 2007|year=2008|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Press|location=Skudai, Johor Darul Ta'zim|isbn=978-983-52-0480-7|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was another manuscript managed to be completed in 2008, however due to funding limitations, it did not get published.

==Anthem==
The association have adopted a song written by one of the students in the late 80s, Zuhairi Harun. The song was titled 'Warisan', touching on the struggle of heritage and identity of architecture in Malaysia. The song have gone through a number of renditions, including quickening of tempo and change of melody, however the spirit of the song remains.

==Activities==
===Architectural Workshop===
The architectural workshop is an annual national gatherings of architectural students in Malaysia. It began in 1987 in UTM, using the format of a jamboree, organised by Persatuan Arkitek (Architech) in Kuala Lumpur. Concurrently during the workshop, the PAM-Education Liaison Meeting would also take place to take advantage of the gatherings of students from various schools in one location.

Architech was the pioneer of the architectural workshop, which exists until today. The last architectural workshop hosted by Architech was in June 2011 using the theme "Terang". It was the biggest architectural workshop ever hosted by Architech, involving over 24 schools of architecture from all over Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=400 penuntut 'terangi' Johor Bahru|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=0622&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Johor&amp;pg=wj_01.htm|accessdate=13 August 2012|newspaper=Utusan Malaysia|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officiated by PAM Vice President Ar.

At the moment, it is undecided on when the next hosting by Architech will be, but it is estimated around 2016.

The '''Benito Juárez Autonomous University of Oaxaca'''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.idiomas.uabjo.mx/linkInglesExtranjeros/uabjo.html THE “BENITO JUAREZ” AUTONOMOUS UNIVERSITY OF OAXACA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722230258/http://www.idiomas.uabjo.mx/linkInglesExtranjeros/uabjo.html |date=July 22, 2011 }}." Benito Juárez Autonomous University of Oaxaca. Retrieved on March 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-es|'''Universidad Autónoma Benito Juárez de Oaxaca'''}}, '''UABJO''') is a [[public university]] located in the city of [[Oaxaca de Juárez]] in state of [[Oaxaca]], Mexico.

The University was founded on January 8, 1827 as the Oaxacan Institute for Arts and Sciences. Initially courses were offered in [[Medicine]], Surgery, Civil and [[Natural Law]], [[Public law|Public Law]], [[Canon Law]] and [[Ecclesiastical]] [[History]], Political Economy, Statistics, [[Geography]] and [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]], [[Logic]], [[Ethics]], English, and French.&lt;ref name="Facultadde"&gt;[http://espanol-idiomas.uabjo.mx Facultad de Idiomas de la Universidad Autónoma "Benito Juárez" de Oaxaca]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In December 1943, governor Major General [[Vicente Gonzalez Fernandez]] decreed that the Institute of Arts and Sciences would be granted [[autonomy]]. Then on January 18, 1955 General [[Manuel Cabrera Carrasquedo]] enacted a law elevating the Institute to University status. The school then became known as Universidad Autónoma "Benito Juárez" de Oaxaca.  The university was named in honor of the full-blooded [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous national]] to become [[president of Mexico]], Oaxacan native [[Benito Juárez]] (March 21, 1806 – July 18, 1872).&lt;ref name="Facultadde" /&gt;

{{main article|2006 Oaxaca protests}}

In May 2006, a teachers' strike began in the [[Zócalo]] in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca]].  2006 was the 25th consecutive year that Oaxaca's teachers have struck. Previously, the protests had generally lasted for one to two weeks and had resulted in small raises for teachers.  The 2006 strike began in protest of the low funding for teachers and rural schools in the state, but was prompted to additionally call for the resignation of the state governor [[Ulises Ruiz Ortiz]] after 3000 police were sent to break up the occupation in the early morning of June 14, 2006.  A street battle lasted for several hours that day, resulting in more than one hundred hospitalizations but no fatalities.  Ortiz declared that he would not resign.

On November 2, 2006, [[Federal Preventative Police]] advanced on the University, occupied by students and displaced protesters from the [[Zocalo]].  Since the University is autonomous, the police are forbidden from entering the grounds, unless invited by the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6112142.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|title=More violence in Oaxaca protest|date=2006-11-03|accessdate=2011-03-02|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of protesters arrived in the following hours, surrounding the police and eventually forcing them to withdraw from the area surrounding the university. The [[Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca]] had received permission by the university rector to broadcast their messages through the university radio, which they used to criticise political parties, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] specifically. Opinions against the APPO were quickly taken off the air &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/145225.html|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)]]|title=Radio Universidad, voz estratégica de APPO|author=Morales, Alberto|date=2006-11-09|accessdate=2011-03-02|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After criticism by the private sector, political organizations and the press (specifically [[Grupo Formula]]'s news anchor [[Denise Maerker]]) for his remarks towards the APPO the rector declared that he had requested respect for the rights of students and faculty &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=1&amp;id_art=48536&amp;id_ejemplar=1276 |work=Noticias de Oaxaca |title=Exige rector de la UABJO a Segob se respeten garantías individuales |date=2006-11-08 |author=LUIS IGNACIO VELÁSQUEZ |accessdate=2011-03-02 |language=es |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021656/http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=1&amp;id_art=48536&amp;id_ejemplar=1276 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that an operational attempt by the Federal Police would not provide a solution to the issue &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oloramitierra.com.mx/?mod=read&amp;sec=general&amp;id=9420&amp;titulo=Busca_el_rector_de_la_UABJO_reestablecer_actividades_en_Ciudad_Universitaria |title=Busca el rector de la UABJO reestablecer actividades en Ciudad Universitaria |work=Olor a Mi Tierra |date=2006-11-08 |accessdate=2011-03-02 |author=Staff |language=es |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930075218/http://www.oloramitierra.com.mx/?mod=read&amp;sec=general&amp;id=9420&amp;titulo=Busca_el_rector_de_la_UABJO_reestablecer_actividades_en_Ciudad_Universitaria |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status ==
Through an agreement with the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (UNAM) the CEC (Center for Continuing Education) was established, that allows the university to offer additional baccalaureate degrees in conjunction with UNAM.

In 2001, the UABJO's School of Languages initiated a study abroad exchange program with the [[College of the Mainland]], in [[Texas City]], [[Texas]], United States.  This has led to increased exposure for the university as well as helped to further the mission of university's School of Languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story/62165/|work=[[Texas City Sun]]|title=COM to enter exchange agreement|author=Bernard, Lori|date=2004-03-18|accessdate=2011-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711071111/http://galvestondailynews.com/story/62165/|archivedate=2011-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story/117939/|work=[[Galveston County Daily News]]|title=COM extends international agreement|author=Collette, Mark|date=2008-04-18|accessdate=2011-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711071118/http://galvestondailynews.com/story/117939/|archivedate=2011-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Besselian elements''' are a set of values used to calculate and predict the local circumstances of [[occultation]]s for an observer on Earth. This method is particularly used for [[solar eclipses]], but is also applied for occultations of [[star]]s or [[planet]]s by the [[Moon]] and [[Astronomical transit|transit]]s of [[Transit of Venus|Venus]] or [[Transit of Mercury|Mercury]]. In addition, for [[lunar eclipse]]s a similar method is used, in which the shadow is cast on the Moon instead of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Seidelmann8.1"&gt;P. Kenneth Seidelmann: ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac.'' page 421f, see further reading&lt;/ref&gt;

For solar eclipses, the Besselian elements are used to calculate the path of the [[umbra, penumbra and antumbra|umbra and penumbra]] on the Earth's surface, and hence the circumstances of the eclipse at a specific location. This method was developed in the 1820s by the German mathematician and astronomer, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]], and later improved by [[William Chauvenet]].

The basic concept is that Besselian elements describe the movement of the shadow cast by the occulting body –&amp;nbsp;for solar eclipses this is the shadow of the Moon&amp;nbsp;– on a specifically chosen plane, called the ''fundamental plane''. This is the geocentric, normal plane of the shadow axis. In other words, it is the plane through the Earth's center that is perpendicular to the line through the centers of the occulting and  the occulted bodies.&lt;ref name="MuckeMeeus1992"&gt;[[Hermann Mucke (astronomer)|Hermann Mucke]], [[Jean Meeus]]: ''Canon of solar eclipses: -2003 to +2526.'' Astronomisches Büro, Wien 1992, Seite XXXIII–LI&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage, among others, of choosing this plane is that the outline of the shadow on it is always a circle, and there is no [[perspective projection distortion|perspective distortion]].

Comparatively few values are needed to accurately describe the movement of the shadow on the fundamental plane. Based on this, the next step is to [[Graphical projection|project]] the shadow cone on to the Earth's surface, taking into account the [[figure of the Earth]], its [[Earth's rotation|rotation]], and the observer's [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[elevation]].&lt;ref name="Seidelmann8.32"&gt;P.

Cam followers come in a vast array of different configurations, however the most defining characteristic is how the cam follower mounts to its mating part; ''stud'' style cam followers use a [[Threaded rod|stud]] while the ''yoke'' style has a hole through the middle.&lt;ref name="mcgill"&gt;{{Citation | title = McGill CAMROL Bearings | url = http://www.alliedbearings.com/mfg_prod/bearings/ept_brgs/camrolrevised2.pdf | accessdate = 2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Cam follower-stud style.png|thumb|right|A cross-sectional view of a stud type cam follower]]

The modern stud type follower was invented and patented in 1937 by Thomas L. Robinson of the McGill Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | inventor-last = Robinson | inventor-first = Thomas L. | publication-date = 1937-11-16 | title = Bearing | country-code = US | patent-number = 2099660}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced using a standard bearing and bolt. The new cam followers were easier to use because the stud was already included and they could also handle higher loads.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

While roller cam followers are similar to roller bearings, there are quite a few differences. Standard ball and roller bearings are designed to be pressed into a rigid housing, which provides circumferential support. This keeps the outer race from deforming, so the race cross-section is relatively thin. In the case of cam followers the outer race is loaded at a single point, so the outer race needs a thicker cross-section to reduce [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]]. However, in order to facilitate this the roller diameter must be decreased, which also decreases the [[dynamic bearing capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Difference from standard bearings | url = http://www.rbcbearings.com/camfollowers/difference.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''End plates'' are used to contain the needles or bearing axially. On stud style followers one of the end plates is integrated into the inner race/stud; the other is [[press fit|pressed]] onto the stud up to a shoulder on the inner race. The inner race is [[induction hardening|induction hardened]] so that the stud remains soft if modifications need to be made. On yoke style followers the end plates are [[peening|peened]] or pressed onto the inner race or [[liquid metal injection|liquid metal injected]] onto the inner race. The inner race is either induction hardened or [[through hardening|through hardened]].&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

Another difference is that a [[lubrication]] hole is provided to relubricate the follower periodically. A hole is provided at both ends of the stud for lubrication. They also usually have a [[black oxide]] finish to help reduce corrosion.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

==Types==
There are many different types of cam followers available.

===Anti-friction element===
The most common anti-[[friction]] element employed is a ''full complement'' of [[needle roller]]s. This design can withstand high radial loads but no [[wikt:thrust load|thrust loads]]. A similar design is the ''caged needle roller'' design, which also uses needle rollers, but uses a [[cage (enclosure)|cage]] to keep them separated. This design allows for higher speeds but decreases the load capacity. The cage also increases internal space so it can hold more lubrication, which increases the time between relubrications. Depending on the exact design sometimes two rollers are put in each pocket of the cage, using a cage design originated by RBC Bearings in 1971.

For heavy-duty applications a ''roller'' design can be used. This employs two rows of rollers of larger diameter than used in needle roller cam followers to increase the dynamic load capacity and provide some thrust capabilities. This design can support higher speeds than the full complement design.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

For light-duty applications a ''bushing'' type follower can be used. Instead of using a type of a roller a plastic [[Bushing (bearing)|bushing]] is used to reduce friction, which provides a maintenance free follower. The disadvantage is that it can only support light loads, slow speeds, no thrust loads, and the temperature limit is {{convert|200|F|C}}. A bushing type stud follower can only support approximately 25% of the load of a roller type stud follower, while the heavy and yoke followers can handle 50%.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt; Also all-metallic heavy-duty bushing type followers exist.&lt;ref name="hotrod2010"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hotrod.com/how-to/engine/hrdp-1004-cam-lifter-technology/ | title = Cam and Lifter Technology - What's New In Cams | last = Davis | first = Marlan | date = 2010-04-01 | website = Hot Rod | publisher = | access-date = 2016-01-17 | quote = After years of experimentation with different materials and manufacturing processes, it's developed the EZ Roll Red Zone needleless, single roller bushing design that replaces the roller needles. Isky claims "they last four times longer, and love high heat and low oil, making them perfect even for a street car idling in traffic."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hotrod2012"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hotrod.com/events/coverage/ctrp-1205-performance-racing-industry-better-stronger-faster/ | title = Performance Racing Industry - Better, Stronger, Faster… | last = Huneycutt | first = Jeff | date = 2012-02-03 | website = Hot Rod | publisher = | access-date = 2016-01-17 | quote = Crower's new Endura Max roller lifters eliminate any chance of a needle bearing failure ruining your night and slapping you with an expensive engine rebuild. And Crower can guarantee it because it has done away with the needle bearings completely. The Endura Max lifters feature a bushed roller that utilizes high pressure pin oiling to reduce friction between the roller and the bushing. Crower says the bushed lifter allows greater load handling for aggressive camshaft profiles and are fully rebuildable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shape===
The outer diameter (OD) of the cam follower (stud or yoke) can be the standard cylindrical shape or be [[wikt:crown|crowned]]. Crowned cam followers are used to keep the load evenly distributed if it deflects or if there is any misalignment between the follower and the followed surface. They are also used in [[Turntablism|turntable]] type applications to reduce skidding. Crowned followers can compensate for up to 0.5° of misalignment, while a cylindrical OD can only tolerate 0.06°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Misalignment | url = http://www.rbcbearings.com/camfollowers/misalignment.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only disadvantage is that they cannot bear as much load because of higher [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]es.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

===Stud===
Stud style cam followers usually have a ''standard'' sized stud, but a ''heavy'' stud is available for increased [[static load capacity]].&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

====Drives====
The standard driving system for a stud type cam follower is a slot, for use with a flat head screwdriver. However, hex sockets are available for higher torquing ability, which is especially useful for eccentric cam followers and those used in [[blind hole]]s. Hex socket cam followers from most manufacturers eliminate the relubrication capability on that end of the cam follower. RBC Bearings' Hexlube cam followers feature a relubrication fitting at the bottom of the hex socket.

====Eccentricity====
Stud type cam followers are available with an [[eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] stud. The stud has a bushing pushed onto it that has an eccentric outer diameter. This allows for adjustability during installation to eliminate any [[backlash (engineering)|backlash]]. The adjustable range for an eccentric bearing is twice that of the eccentricity.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

===Yoke===
Yoke type cam followers are usually used in applications where minimal deflection is required, as they can be supported on both sides. They can support the same static load as a heavy stud follower.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

==Track followers==
All cam followers can be track followers, but not all track followers are cam followers. Some track followers have specially shaped outer diameters (OD) to follow tracks. For example, track followers are available with a V-groove for following a V-track, or the OD can have a flange to follow the lip of the track.&lt;ref name="mcgill2"&gt;{{Citation | title = Cam followers | url = http://www.emerson-ept.com/eptroot/public/prod/dynamic_frame.asp?strMain=http%3A//www.emerson-ept.com/EPTroot/public/prod/McGCamFl/McGCamF.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized track followers are also designed to withstand thrust loads so the anti-friction elements are usually [[bearing ball]]s or of a [[tapered roller bearing]] construction.&lt;ref name="mcgill2"/&gt;

'''Charles H. Holbrow''' (born September 23, 1935) is an American [[physicist]].

==Early life and education==
Charles Howard Holbrow was born in [[Melrose, Massachusetts]] to parents Frederick Holbrow and Florence Louisa (Gile) Holbrow.&lt;ref name=ww /&gt; His earliest memory of interest in physics dates from about age 13, when he saved the money he earned delivering newspapers to buy a book by [[Robert Andrews Millikan]], ''Electrons (+And -) Protons Photons Neutrons Mesotrons and Cosmic Rays''. "I read about two pages, and it made no sense to me whatsoever," he said. "But I still have the book, and now it makes lots of sense."&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

In 1951, at age 15, he enrolled at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] as a [[Ford Foundation]] Pre-Induction Fellow.&lt;ref name=waa /&gt; Despite his early interest and intention to major in physics, he found physics coursework so challenging that he changed his major and, in 1955, earned a BA in history instead, then pursued graduate study in history at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=pc /&gt; In 1956, he married Mary Louise Ross, with whom he has five daughters: [[Gwendolyn Holbrow]], Elizabeth, Alice, Katherine and Martha.&lt;ref name=ww /&gt; In 1957, he earned a master's degree in history and Russian studies from Columbia with a master's essay titled ''Lenin's views of the United States''.&lt;ref name=master /&gt; Inspired by the [[Sputnik]] launch,&lt;ref name=dean /&gt; Holbrow then returned to study physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where his doctoral advisor was [[Henry H. Barschall]] ("Heinz" Barschall). Holbrow earned his MS in physics in 1960 and PhD in physics in 1963,&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt; with the dissertation ''Neutrons from protons on nickel, rhodium, tantalum, and gold''.&lt;ref name=dissert /&gt;

==Career==
After earning his doctorate, Holbrow taught for three years at [[Haverford College]] and two years at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], then served as assistant editor at [[Physics Today]].&lt;ref name=pc /&gt; In 1967, he became an associate professor of physics at [[Colgate University]], where he remained for 36 years until his retirement in 2003.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt; In addition to teaching and research, Holbrow was instrumental in establishing first the Colgate Computer Center and later the Department of Computer Science.&lt;ref name=perspect /&gt; He became associate director of the Colgate Computer Center and then, in 1968, its director.&lt;ref name=perspect /&gt; He was promoted to full professor in 1975 and named [[Charles A. Dana (philanthropist)|Charles A. Dana]] Professor of Physics in 1986.&lt;ref name=okeefe /&gt; Holbrow also served as chairman of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, director of Institutional Research, and director of the Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences.&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt;

During his years at Colgate, Holbrow frequently joined other academic institutions temporarily as a visiting professor and researcher, including [[SUNY Stony Brook]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Cornell University]], [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], [[SRI International]], [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], [[University of Vienna]], and the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]].&lt;ref name=ww /&gt;&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt; He spent a sabbatical year in 1969-70 at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator]], and another at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1975-76, working in the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt; During the summer of 1975, Holbrow was a [[NASA]]-ASEE Summer Faculty Fellow at Stanford University and [[Ames Research Center]], where he participated in a NASA project to develop colonies in space, culminating in the report Space Settlements: A Design Study,&lt;ref name=space /&gt; and featured in an article by [[Isaac Asimov]] in the July, 1976, issue of [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]].&lt;ref name=ia /&gt;

Throughout his physics career, Holbrow maintained his interest in reading and writing about history. His fascination and feeling of kinship with Danish-born Caltech physicist [[Charles Christian Lauritsen]] led to a biographical article, "Charles C. Lauritsen: A Reasonable Man in an Unreasonable World," in [[Physics in Perspective]].&lt;ref name=pc /&gt;&lt;ref name=ccl /&gt; During a second stay at Caltech, he wrote a short history of [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] and the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory titled "The giant cancer tube and the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory," published in [[Physics Today]].&lt;ref name=pc /&gt;&lt;ref name=kellogg /&gt;

In addition to physics and history, Holbrow is interested in physics pedagogy.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt; In 1998, he and colleagues at Colgate published a new introductory physics textbook, ''Modern Introductory Physics'', which reversed the usual introductory physics sequence by presenting [[Special relativity|relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] before mechanics and electromagnetism.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; A second edition appeared in 2010. He has also served as president of the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]], and was awarded the 2012 [[Oersted Medal]] for his major contributions to physics education and research.&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt;

Since Holbrow's retirement from Colgate University in 2003, he has been a visiting professor of physics at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he works on developing physics [[MOOC]]s,&lt;ref name=mooc /&gt; and a visiting scholar at [[Harvard University]], where he won an award for excellence in teaching.&lt;ref name=okeefe/&gt;

==Research==
Holbrow's research has included studying the properties of unstable ytterbium atoms produced in a particle accelerator, and using lead ions with only one electron, which share traits with hydrogen, to study relativistic effects.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2287">'''Chromosome jumping''' is a tool of molecular biology that is used in the physical [[genome project|mapping]] of [[genome]]s.  It is related to several other tools used for the same purpose, including [[chromosome walking]]. 

Chromosome jumping is used to bypass regions difficult to [[cloning|clone]], such as those containing [[repetitive DNA]], that cannot be easily mapped by chromosome walking, and is useful in moving along a chromosome rapidly in search of a particular [[gene]].

Chromosome jumping allows more rapid movement through the [[genome]] compared to other techniques, such as [[chromosome walking]], and can be used to generate genomic markers with known chromosomal locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Drumm|first=Micheal|date=May 2001|title=Unit 5.4 Construction of Chromosome Jumping and Linking Libraries in E.coli|journal=Current Protocols in Human Genetics|volume=Chapter 5|pages=Unit 5.4|doi=10.1002/0471142905.hg0504s01|pmid=18428292|isbn=978-0471142904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromosome jumping enables two ends of a DNA sequence to be cloned without the middle section. Genomic DNA may be partially digested using restriction endonucleases and with the aid of DNA ligase, the fragments are circularized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics and Informatics|last=|first=|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-6753-2|location=|pages=354|date=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a known [[DNA sequence|sequence]], a [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] is designed to [[DNA sequencing|sequence]] across the circularised junction. This primer is used to jump 100 [[base pair|kb]]-300 kb intervals: a sequence 100 kb away would have come near the known sequence on circularisation. Thus, sequences not reachable by chromosome walking can be sequenced. Chromosome walking can be used from the new jump position (in either direction) to look for [[gene]]-like sequences, or additional jumps can be used to progress further along the chromosome.

==Solution techniques==
Majority of existing codes for calculation of electromagnetic scattering by a single sphere is based on [[Mie theory]] which is an analytical solution of Maxwell's equations in terms of infinite series. Other approximations to scattering by a single sphere include: [[Debye series]], [[ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]] ([[geometrical optics]]), ray tracing including the effects of interference between rays, [[Airy theory]], [[Rayleigh scattering]], diffraction approximation. There are many phenomena related to light scattering by spherical particles such as resonances, surface waves, plasmons, near-field scattering. Even though Mie theory offers convenient and fast way of solving light scattering problem by homogeneous spherical particles, there are other techniques, such as [[discrete dipole approximation]], FDTD, T-matrix, which can also be used for such tasks.

| MiePlot offers the following mathematical models for the scattering of light by a sphere: Mie solutions, Debye series, ray tracing (based on geometrical optics), ray tracing including the effects of interference between rays, Airy theory, Rayleigh scattering, diffraction, surface waves.  In addition to single-wavelength calculations, MiePlot can also perform calculations for a number of wavelengths, thus approximating a continuous spectrum (such as sunlight) to produce simulations of atmospheric optical effects such as rainbows, coronas and glories.

| The Sub-Department of Atmospheric Oceanic and Planetary Physics in the University of Oxford maintains an archive of Mie scattering routines for both single spheres and populations of particles in which sizes follow a [[log-normal]] distribution. Code is also available for calculating the analytical derivatives of Mie scattering (i.e. the derivative of the extinction and scattering coefficients, and the intensity functions with respect to size parameter and complex refractive index). The routines are written in [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], but a Fortran-based DLM version (which substantially reduces runtime) of the single-sphere code is also available.

A '''cognitive computer''' combines [[artificial intelligence]] and machine-learning algorithms, in an approach which attempts to reproduce the behaviour of the human brain.&lt;ref name="modha-ns1"&gt;Dharmendra Modha (interview), "A computer that thinks", ''New Scientist'' 8 November 2014, Pages 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of [[neural network]] implementations of cognitive convolution and [[deep learning]] is provided by the [[IBM]] company's [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] machine. A subsequent development by IBM is the [[TrueNorth]] microchip architecture, which is designed to be closer in structure to the human brain than the [[von Neumann architecture]] used in conventional computers.&lt;ref name="modha-ns1" /&gt; In 2017 [[Intel]] announced its own version of a cognitive chip in "Loihi", which will be available to university and research labs in 2018.

==Intel Loihi chip==
Intel's self-learning neuromorphic chip, named Loihi, perhaps named after the Hawaiian seamount [[Loihi]], offers substantial power efficiency designed after the human brain. Intel claims Loihi is about 1000 times more energy efficient than the general-purpose computing power needed to train the neural networks that rival Loihi’s performance. 
In theory, this would support both machine learning training and inference on the same silicon independently of a cloud connection, and more efficient than using [[convolutional neural network]]s (CNNs) or [[deep learning]] [[neural network]]s. Intel points to a system for monitoring a person’s heartbeat, taking readings after events such as exercise or eating, and uses the cognitive computing chip to normalize the data and work out the ‘normal’ heartbeat. It can then spot abnormalities, but also deal with any new events or conditions.
{{pov-section|date=March 2018}}
The first iteration of the Loihi chip was made using Intel’s 14&amp;nbsp;nm fabrication process, and houses 128 clusters of 1,024 artificial neurons each for a total of 131,072 simulated neurons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-intel-built-a-neuromorphic-chip/ "Why Intel built a neuromorphic chip". September 29, 2017. www.ZDNet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This offers around 130 million synapses, which is still a rather long way from the human brain's 800 trillion synapses, and behind IBM’s [[TrueNorth]], which has around 16 billion by using  64 by 4,096 cores.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aitrends.com/future-of-ai/intel-unveils-loihi-neuromorphic/ "Intel unveils Loihi neuromorphic chip, chases IBM in artificial brains". October 17, 2017. AITrends.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==IBM TrueNorth Chip==
{{main|TrueNorth}}
The IBM cognitive computers implement learning using [[Hebbian theory]].  Instead of being programmable in a traditional sense within [[machine language]] or a higher level [[programming language]] such a device learns by inputting instances through an [[input device]] that are aggregated within a computational [[convolution]] or [[neural network]] architecture consisting of weights within a parallel memory system.  An early instantiation of such a device has been developed in 2012 under the [[Darpa]] [[SyNAPSE]] program at IBM directed by [[Dharmendra Modha]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014|reason=not detailed in the cited source}}

In 2017 this IBM 64-chip [[array data structure|array]] will contain the processing equivalent of 64 million neurons and 16 billion synapses, yet  each processor consumes just 10 watts of electricity.
Like other neural networks, this system will be put to use in pattern recognition and sensory processing roles. The Air Force wants to combine the [[TrueNorth]] ability to convert multiple data feeds &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;whether it's audio, video or text&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; into machine readable symbols with a conventional supercomputer's ability to crunch data.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
This isn't the first time that IBM's neural chip system has been integrated into cutting-edge technology. August, 2017 [[Samsung]] installed the chips in its Dynamic Vision Sensors enabling cameras to capture images at up to 2,000 fps while using just 300 milliwatts of power.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Criticism==
There are many approaches and definitions for a '''cognitive computer''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schank|first1=Roger C.|last2=Childers|first2=Peter G.|title=The cognitive computer: on language, learning, and artificial intelligence|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|date=1984|isbn=9780201064438|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oFQAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=cognitive+computer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other approaches may be more fruitful than the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Stephen|title=The Cognitive Computer: On Language, Learning, and Artificial Intelligence by Roger C. Schank, Peter Childers (review)|journal=Leonardo|date=1988|volume=21|issue=2|page=210|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/600644/summary|accessdate=13 January 2017|issn=1530-9282}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Specifically, there are critics who argue that a room-sized computer - like the case of Watson - is not a viable alternative to a three-pound human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metaskills: Five Talents for the Robotic Age|last=Neumeier|first=Marty|publisher=New Riders|year=2012|isbn=9780133359329|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also cite the difficulty for a single system to bring so many elements together such as the disparate sources of information as well as computing resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cognitive Computing and Big Data Analytics|last=Hurwitz|first=Judith|last2=Kaufman|first2=Marcia|last3=Bowles|first3=Adrian|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781118896624|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2018 [[World Economic Forum]], there are experts who claim that cognitive systems could adopt the biases of their developers and this was demonstrated in the case of the [[Google]] [[Computer vision|image-recognition]] or computer vision algorithm, which identified [[African Americans]] unfavorably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/18/world-economic-forum-ai-has-a-bias-problem-that-needs-to-be-fixed.html|title=A.I. has a bias problem that needs to be fixed: World Economic Forum|last=Choudhury|first=Saheli Roy|date=2018-09-18|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dec SYSTEM BUILDING BLOCKS 1103.jpg|thumb|[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s original products were individual modules, like these System Building Blocks 1103 hex-inverter cards (both sides).]]
A '''computer module''' is a selection of independent electronic circuits packaged onto a [[circuit board]] to provide a basic function within a [[computer]]. An example might be an [[Inverter (logic gate)|inverter]] or [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], which would require two or more [[transistor]]s and a small number of additional supporting devices. Modules would be inserted into a chassis and then wired together to produce a larger logic unit, like an adder.

== History ==
Modules were the basic building block of most early computer designs, until they started being replaced by [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s, which were essentially an entire module packaged onto a single [[computer chip]]. Modules with discrete components continued to be used in specialist roles into the 1970s, notably high-speed designs like the [[CDC 8600]], but advances in chip design led to the disappearance of the discrete-component module in the 1970s.

'''Corymb''' is a [[botany|botanical]] term for an [[inflorescence]] with the [[flower]]s growing in such a fashion that the outermost are born on longer [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]] than the inner, bringing all flowers up to a common level. A cyme has a flattish top superficially resembling an [[umbel]], and may have a branching structure similar to a [[panicle]]. Flowers in a corymb structure can either be parallel, or alternate, and form in either a convex, or flat form.

Many species in the Maloideae, such as hawthorns and rowans, produce their flowers in corymbs. The [[Norway maple]] and [[yerba maté]] are also examples of corymbs.

'''Degreasing''', often called '''defatting''' or '''fat trimming''', is the removal of fatty acids from an object. In [[culinary]] science, degreasing is done with the intention of reducing the [[fat]] content of a [[meal]].

==Degreasing food==
Degreasing is often used by [[dieting|diet]]ers, particularly those following low-fat diets to reduce their fat consumption to induce weight loss.  The energy content of 1 g of fat is 9 [[calories]], while that of [[carbohydrates]] and [[proteins]] are 4 calories.  Hence, dieters often view decreasing fat consumption as an efficient way of losing weight without greatly sacrificing total volume of food.  Degreasing during meal preparation is used to reduce the energy content of the food being prepared, and degreasing of a prepared food is also often used in social situations where one may have to consume restaurant food which is rich in fat.

Those people who wish to reduce their cholesterol level or fat intake, in particular people with [[hypercholesterolemia]] often use degreasing to reduce their fat consumption.

=== Degreasing of a meal during preparation ===
Fat trimming of a meal can be done during preparation by a variety of methods.  The most common methods involving substituting food items or removal of naturally occurring fat and conservative addition of fat.

Substituting fats is a method in which a certain ingredient is substituted by another ingredient.  A common way of doing this is substituting saturated [[fatty acids]] with unsaturated fatty acids while cooking.  For instance, olive oil can be used instead of butter for seasoning vegetables.

Food items are also substituted to reduce fat content.  For instance, instead of using eggs by using a whole egg, where the egg yolks are high in fat levels, egg whites can instead be used.  Alternatively, [[skimmed milk]] or similar low-fat products can be used as ingredients for [[cooking]].

===Degreasing liquids===
[[File:Degreasing soup.jpg|thumb|right|260px|(''Frozen soup with a layer of fat shown above'') Cooling provides an easy way to degrease food as the fat rises to the surface and solidifies fully.]]

Many different foods can be degreased after preparation. Liquid foods that are high in fat, such as [[braising]] liquids, [[roasting]] juices and [[broth]]s may have floating oil on top throughout and after the cooking process. Fat can be skimmed off the liquid with a small [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]], spoon, or cup as the liquid [[simmer]]s and then discarded. This is done by placing the saucepan with only half of it on the heat source so that the liquid simmers only on one side. This pushes the fat to the opposite side and makes it easier to lift off with the ladle. The fat can then be skimmed off by holding the ladle so that the top of its bowl is almost level with the liquid and then tilting it slightly and in a circular motion toward the edge of the saucepan where the fat accumulates.&lt;ref name='wiley'&gt;{{Cite book | year=2002 | title = Glorious French Food: A Fresh Approach to the Classics | author1=James Peterson | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | isbn=978-0-471-44276-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWSVpBheCnYC&amp;pg=PT46&amp;dq=degreasing+food | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As braising liquids and broths simmer, they typically throw off more fat and protein and sometimes froth, so it is easier to wait at least a few minutes until the liquid has cooled before degreasing. In making slowly reduced liquids it may be ideal to wait for it to cool even longer.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt; 

As an alternative to a ladle, a [[degreasing cup]] can be used to skim the fat off hot liquids. This is a clear plastic or glass cup that looks similar to a [[teapot]], with a spout that comes out of the bottom. The liquid and juices are poured into the cup then poured out leaving the fat behind; the liquid comes from the bottom of the cup instead of the top. Degreasing cups come in various sizes.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newitalianrecipes.com/cooking-terms.html | title = Cooking Terms | accessdate = 2010-08-04 | publisher = New Italian Recipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Refrigerating or freezing liquids until the fat congeals and solidifies can make the fat easier to remove with a spoon. If, after removing the congealed fat, the liquid still appears cloudy, it can be made clearer by skimming it again with a ladle after bringing it to a gentle simmer to allow for the release of more fat and insoluble proteins.&lt;ref name='wiley' /&gt;

===Degreasing solid food items===
Some items, such as roasted foods, and other cooked food items, such as pizza, can sometimes be oily and greasy. Degreasing them after preparation may provide a solution to this problem. Fried foods, such as [[French fries]], can often be degreased without decreasing the crispiness of the food item by simply blotting out the oil in the food item with a [[tissue paper]].

==Commercial degreasing==
Many food manufacturing companies such as [[Weight Watchers]] have been developed for people who wish to reduce their fat intake.  The customer need of defatting has also led to the production of low fat products, e.g., low fat cheese.

==Solvent degreasing==
{{Main| Solvent degreasing}}

Solvent degreasing is a process used to prepare a part for further operations such as [[electroplating]] or [[paint]]ing.  Typically it uses [[petroleum]], [[chlorine]], or [[alcohol]] based [[solvent]]s to dissolve the [[machining]] fluids and other contaminants that might be on the part.&lt;ref&gt;Kalpakjian, Serope, Schmid, Steven R. (2006). Manufacturing Engineering and Technology. 5th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall. 1079.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital photograph restoration''' is the practice of restoring the appearance of a digital copy of a physical photograph which has been damaged by natural, man made, or environmental causes or simply affected by age or neglect.

Digital photograph restoration uses a variety of [[image editing]] techniques to remove visible damage and aging effects from digital copies of physical photographs. [[Raster graphics editor]]s (see list below) are typically used to repair the appearance of the digital images and add to the digital copy of the photo where pieces of the physical photograph are torn or missing. Evidence of dirt, scratches, and other signs of photographic age are removed from the digital image manually, by painting over them meticulously.  Unwanted color casts are removed and the image's contrast or sharpening may be altered in an attempt to restore some of the contrast range or detail that is believed to be in the original physical image. In addition [[image processing]] techniques such as [[image enhancement]] and [[image restoration]] are also applicable for the purpose of digital photograph restoration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23222">In the recent years, utilization of [[electrical energy]] increased exponentially and customer requirement and quality definitions of power were changed enormously. As the electric energy became an essential part of the daily life, its optimal usage and reliability became important. [[Real-time network]] view and [[Dynamic decision-making|dynamic decisions]] have become instrumental for optimizing resources and managing demands, thus making a distribution management system which could handle proper work flows, very critical.

==Overview==

A '''Distribution Management System (DMS)''' is a collection of applications designed to monitor &amp; control the entire distribution network efficiently and reliably. It acts as a decision support system to assist the control room and field operating personnel with the monitoring and control of the electric distribution system. Improving the reliability and quality of service in terms of reducing [[Power outage|outage]]s, minimizing outage time, maintaining acceptable frequency and [[voltage]] levels are the key deliverables of a DMS.

Most distribution utilities have been comprehensively using [[Information technology|IT]] solutions through their [[Outage_management_system|Outage Management System]] (OMS) that makes use of other systems like [[Customer information system|Customer Information System]] (CIS), [[Geographical information system|Geographical Information System]] (GIS) and [[Interactive voice response|Interactive Voice Response System]] (IVRS). An outage management system has a network component/connectivity model of the distribution system.  By combining the locations of outage calls from customers with knowledge of the locations of the protection devices (such as circuit breakers) on the network, a [[rule engine]] is used to predict the locations of outages. Based on this, restoration activities are charted out and the crew is dispatched for the same.

In parallel with this, distribution utilities began to roll out [[Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition]] (SCADA) systems, initially only at their higher voltage substations.  Over time, use of [[SCADA]] has progressively extended downwards to sites at lower voltage levels.

DMSs access real-time data and provide all information on a single console at the control centre in an integrated manner. 
Their development varied across different geographic territories.  In the USA, for example, DMSs typically grew by taking
Outage Management Systems to the next level, automating the complete sequences and providing an end to end, integrated view of the entire distribution spectrum.  In the UK, by contrast, the much denser and more meshed network topologies, combined with stronger Health &amp; Safety regulation, had led to early centralisation of high-voltage switching operations, initially using paper records and schematic diagrams printed onto large wallboards which were 'dressed' with magnetic symbols to show the current running states.  There, DMSs grew initially from SCADA systems as these were expanded to allow these centralised control and safety management procedures to be managed electronically.  These DMSs required even more detailed component/connectivity models and schematics than those needed by early OMSs as every possible isolation and earthing point on the networks had to be included.  In territories such as the UK, therefore, the network component/connectivity models were usually developed in the DMS first, whereas in the USA these were generally built in the GIS.

The typical data flow in a DMS has the [[SCADA]] system, the [[Information storage and retrieval systems|Information Storage &amp; Retrieval]] (ISR) system, Communication (COM) Servers, [[Front end processor|Front-End Processors]] (FEPs) &amp; Field Remote Terminal Units (FRTUs).

==Why DMS?==

* Reduce the duration of outages
* Improve the speed and accuracy of outage predictions.
* Reduce crew patrol and drive times through improved outage locating.
* Improve the [[Operational effectiveness|operational efficiency]]
* Determine the crew resources necessary to achieve restoration objectives.
* Effectively utilize resources between operating regions.
* Determine when best to schedule mutual aid crews.
* Increased customer satisfaction
* A DMS incorporates IVR and other mobile technologies, through which there is an improved outage communications for customer calls.
* Provide customers with more accurate estimated restoration times.
* Improve service reliability by tracking all customers affected by an outage, determining electrical configurations of every device on every feeder, and compiling details about each restoration process.

==DMS Functions==

In order to support proper decision making and O&amp;M activities, DMS solutions should support the following functions:
* [[Network visualization]] &amp; support tools
* Applications for Analytical &amp; Remedial Action
* Utility Planning Tools
* System Protection Schemes

The various sub functions of the same, carried out by the DMS are listed below:-

===Network Connectivity Analysis (NCA)===

Distribution network usually covers over a large area and catering power to different customers at different voltage levels. So locating required sources and loads on a larger GIS/Operator interface is often very difficult. Panning &amp; zooming provided with normal SCADA system GUI does not cover the exact operational requirement. Network connectivity analysis is an operator specific functionality which helps the operator to identify or locate the preferred network or component very easily. NCA does the required analyses and provides display of the feed point of various network loads. Based on the status of all the switching devices such as [[circuit breaker]] (CB), [[Ring main|Ring Main Unit]] (RMU) and/or [[Isolator switch|isolator]]s that affect the topology of the network modeled, the prevailing network topology is determined. The NCA further assists the operator to know operating state of the distribution network indicating radial mode, loops and parallels in the network.

===Switching Schedule &amp; Safety Management===

In territories such as the UK a core function of a DMS has always been to support safe switching and work on the networks.  Control engineers prepare switching schedules to isolate and make safe a section of network before work is carried out, and the DMS validates these schedules using its network model.  Switching schedules can combine telecontrolled and manual (on-site) switching operations.  When the required section has been made safe, the DMS allows a Pemit To Work (PTW) document to be issued.  After its cancellation when the work has been finished, the switching schedule then facilitates restoration of the normal running arrangements.  Switching components can also be tagged to reflect any Operational Restrictions that are in force.

The network component/connectivity model, and associated diagrams, must always be kept absolutely up to date.  The switching schedule facility therefore also allows 'patches' to the network model to be applied to the live version at the appropriate stage(s) of the jobs.  The term 'patch' is derived from the method previously used to maintain the wallboard diagrams.

===State Estimation (SE)===

The [[State estimation|state estimator]] is an integral part of the overall monitoring and control systems for transmission networks.  It is mainly aimed at providing a reliable estimate of the system voltages. This information from the state estimator flows to control centers and database servers across the network.&lt;ref&gt;Yih-Fang Huang; Werner, S.; Jing Huang; Kashyap, N.; Gupta, V., "State Estimation in Electric Power Grids: Meeting New Challenges Presented by the Requirements of the Future Grid," Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE , vol.29, no.5, pp.33,43, Sept. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The variables of interest are indicative of parameters like margins to operating limits, health of equipment and required operator action.  State estimators allow the calculation of these variables of interest with high confidence despite the facts that the measurements may be corrupted by noise, or could be missing or inaccurate.

Even though we may not be able to directly observe the state, it can be inferred from a scan of measurements which are assumed to be synchronized. The algorithms need to allow for the fact that presence of noise might skew the measurements. In a typical power system, the State is quasi-static. The time constants are sufficiently fast so that system dynamics decay away quickly (with respect to measurement frequency). The system appears to be progressing through a sequence of static states that are driven by various parameters like changes in load profile. The inputs of the state estimator can be given to various applications like [[Load flow analysis|Load Flow Analysis]], Contingency Analysis, and other applications.

===Load Flow Applications (LFA)===

Load flow study is an important tool involving [[numerical analysis]] applied to a power system. The load flow study usually uses simplified notations like a single-line diagram and focuses on various forms of [[AC power]] rather than voltage and current. It analyzes the power systems in normal steady-state operation.  The goal of a power flow study is to obtain complete voltage angle and magnitude information for each bus in a power system for specified load and generator [[real power]] and voltage conditions. Once this information is known, real and [[reactive power]] flow on each branch as well as generator reactive power output can be analytically determined.

Due to the nonlinear nature of this problem, numerical methods are employed to obtain a solution that is within an acceptable tolerance. The load model needs to automatically calculate loads to match [[telemeter]] or forecasted feeder currents. It utilises customer type, load profiles and other information to properly distribute the load to each individual distribution transformer. Load-flow or [[Power flow study|Power flow studies]] are important for planning future expansion of power systems as well as in determining the best operation of existing systems.

===Volt-VAR Control (VVC)===

Volt-VAR Control or VVC refers to the process of managing voltage levels and reactive power (VAR) throughout the [[power distribution]] systems. These two quantities are related, because as reactive power flows over an inductive line (and all lines have some inductance) that line sees a voltage drop.  VVC encompasses devices that purposely inject reactive power into the grid to alter the size of that voltage drop, in addition to equipment that more directly controls voltage.

In the legacy grid, there are three primary tools for carrying out voltage management: Load Tap Changers (LTCs), voltage regulators, and capacitor banks. LTCs and voltage regulators refer to transformers with variable turns ratios that are placed at strategic points in a network and adjusted to raise or lower voltage as is necessary. Capacitor banks manage voltage by “generating” reactive power, and have thus far been the primary tools through which true Volt/VAR control is carried out. These large capacitors are connected to the grid in shunt configuration through switches which, when closed, allow the capacitors to generate VARs and boost voltage at the point of connection. In the future, further VVC might be carried out by smart inverters and other distributed generation resources, which can also inject reactive power into a distribution network. A VVC application helps the operator mitigate dangerously low or high voltage conditions by suggesting required action plans for all VVC equipment. The plan will give a required tap position and capacitor switching state to ensure the voltage stays close to its nominal value and thus optimize Volt-VAR control function for the utility.

Beyond maintaining a stable voltage profile, VVC has potential benefits for the ampacity (current-carrying capacity) of power lines. There could be loads that contain reactive components like [[capacitor]]s and [[inductor]]s (such as [[electric motors]]) that strain the grid. This is because the reactive portion of these loads causes them to draw more current than an otherwise comparable, purely resistive load would draw. The extra current can result in heating up of equipment like transformers, conductors, etc. which might then need resizing to carry the total current. An ideal power system needs to control current flow by carefully planning the production, absorption and flow of reactive power at all levels in the system.

===Load Shedding Application (LSA)===

Electric Distribution Systems have long stretches of [[transmission line]], multiple injection points and fluctuating consumer demand. These features are inherently vulnerable to instabilities or unpredicted system conditions that may lead to critical failure. Instability usually arises from power system oscillations due to faults, peak deficit or protection failures. Distribution [[load shedding]] and restoration schemes play a vital role in emergency operation and control in any utility.

An automated Load Shedding Application detects predetermined trigger conditions in the distribution network and performs predefined sets of control actions, such as opening or closing non-critical feeders, reconfiguring downstream distribution or sources of injections, or performing a tap control at a transformer. When a distribution network is complex and covers a larger area, emergency actions taken downstream may reduce burden on upstream portions of the network. In a non-automated system, awareness and manual operator intervention play a key role in trouble mitigation. If the troubles are not addressed quickly enough, they can cascade exponentially and cause major catastrophic failure.

DMS needs to provide a modular automated load shedding &amp; restoration application which automates emergency operation &amp; control requirements for any utility. The application should cover various activities like Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS), limit violation and time of day based load shedding schemes which are usually performed by the operator.

===Fault Management &amp; System Restoration (FMSR)===

Reliability and quality of [[power supply]] are key parameters which need to be ensured by any utility. Reduced outage time duration to customer, shall improve over all utility reliability indices hence FMSR or automated switching applications plays an important role. The two main features required by a FMSR are: Switching management &amp; Suggested switching plan

The DMS application receives faults information from the SCADA system and processes the same for identification of faults and on running switching management application; the results are converted to [[action plan]]s by the applications. The action plan includes switching ON/OFF the automatic load break switches / RMUs/Sectionalizer .The action plan can be verified in study mode provided by the functionality .The switching management can be manual/automatic based on the configuration.

===Load Balancing via Feeder Reconfiguration (LBFR)===

[[Load balancing (electrical power)|Load balancing]] via feeder reconfiguration is an essential application for utilities where they have multiple feeders feeding a load congested area. To balance the loads on a network, the operator re-routes the loads to other parts of the network. A Feeder Load Management (FLM) is necessary to allow you to manage energy delivery in the electric distribution system and identify problem areas. A Feeder Load Management monitors the vital signs of the distribution system and identifies areas of concern so that the distribution operator is forewarned and can efficiently focus attention where it is most needed. It allows for more rapid correction of existing problems and enables possibilities for problem avoidance, leading to both improved reliability and [[energy delivery]] performance.

On a similar note, Feeder Reconfiguration is also used for [[Loss mitigation|loss minimization]]. Due to several network and operational constraints utility network may be operated to its maximum capability without knowing its consequences of losses occurring. The overall energy losses and revenue losses due to these operations shall be minimized for effective operation. The DMS application utilizes switching management application for this, the losses minimization problem is solved by the optimal power flow algorithm and switching plans are created similar to above function

===Distribution Load Forecasting (DLF)===

Distribution Load Forecasting (DLF) provides a structured interface for creating, managing and analyzing load forecasts. Accurate models for electric power load forecasting are essential to the operation and planning of a [[utility company]]. DLF helps an electric utility to make important decisions including decisions on purchasing electric power, load switching, as well as infrastructure development.

Load forecasting is classified in terms of different planning durations: short-term load forecasting or STLF (up to 1 day, medium-term load forecasting or MTLF (1 day to 1 year), and long-term load forecasting or LTLF (1–10 years). To forecast load precisely throughout a year, various external factors including weathers, [[solar radiation]], population, per capita [[gross domestic product]] seasons and holidays need to be considered. For example, in the winter season, average [[wind chill]] factor could be added as an explanatory variable in addition to those used in the summer model. In transitional seasons such as spring and fall, the transformation technique can be used. For holidays, a holiday effect load can be deducted from the normal load to estimate the actual holiday load better.

Various [[Predictive modelling|predictive models]] have been developed for load forecasting based on various techniques like [[multiple regression]], [[exponential smoothing]], iterative reweighted least-squares, adaptive load forecasting, stochastic time series, [[fuzzy logic]], [[neural network]]s and [[Knowledge-based systems|knowledge based expert systems]]. Amongst these, the most popular STLF were stochastic time series models like [[Autoregressive model|Autoregressive (AR) model]], [[Autoregressive moving average model]] (ARMA), [[Autoregressive integrated moving average]] (ARIMA) model and other models using fuzzy logic and Neural Networks.

DLF provides [[Data aggregator|data aggregation]] and forecasting capabilities that is configured to address today’s requirements and adapt to address future requirements and should have the capability to produce repeatable and accurate forecasts.

==Standards Based Integration==

In any integrated energy delivery utility operation model, there are different functional modules like GIS, Billing &amp; metering solution, ERP, Asset management system that are operating in parallel and supports routine operations. Quite often, each of these functional modules need to exchange periodic or real time data with each other for assessing present operation condition of the network, workflows and resources (like crew, assets, etc.). Unlike other power system segments, distribution system changes or grows every day, and this could be due to the addition of a new consumer, a new transmission line or replacement of equipment. If the different functional modules are operating in a non-standard environment and uses custom APIs and database interfaces, the engineering effort for managing shall become too large. Soon it will become difficult to manage the growing changes and additions which would result in making system integrations non- functional. Hence utilities cannot make use of the complete benefit of functional modules and in some cases; the systems may even need to be migrated to suitable environments with very high costs.

As these problems came to light, various standardization processes for inter application data exchanges were initiated. It was understood that a standard based integration shall ease the integration with other functional modules and that it also improves the operational performance. It ensures that the utility can be in a vendor neutral environment for future expansions, which in turn means that the utility can easily add new functional modules on top of existing functionality and easily push or pull the data effectively without having new interface adapters.

===IEC 61968 Standards Based Integration===

IEC 61968 is a standard being developed by the Working Group 14 of Technical Committee 57 of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] and defines standards for information exchanges between electrical distribution system applications. It is intended to support the inter-application integration of a utility enterprise that needs to collect data from different applications which could be new or legacy.

As per IEC 61968, a DMS encapsulates various capabilities like monitoring and control of equipment for power delivery, management processes to ensure system reliability, voltage management, demand-side management, outage management, work management, automated mapping and facilities management. The crux of IEC 61968 standards is the Interface Reference Model (IRM) that defines various standard interfaces for each class of applications. Abstract (Logical) components are listed to represent concrete (physical) applications. For example, a business function like Network Operation (NO) could be represented by various business sub-functions like Network Operation Monitoring (NMON), which in turn will be represented by abstract components like Substation state supervision, Network state supervision, and Alarm supervision.

IEC 61968 recommends that system interfaces of a compliant utility inter-application infrastructure be defined using [[Unified Modelling Language]] (UML). UML includes a set of graphic notation techniques that can be used to create visual models of object-oriented software-intensive systems. The IEC 61968 series of standards extend the [[Common Information Model (computing)|Common Information Model]] (CIM), which is currently maintained as a UML model, to meet the needs of electrical distribution.  For structured document interchange particularly on the Internet, the data format used can be the [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML). One of its primary uses is information exchange between different and potentially incompatible computer systems. XML is thus well-suited to the domain of system interfaces for distribution management. It formats the message payloads so as to load the same to various messaging transports like SOAP ([[Simple Object Access Protocol]]), etc.

'''''Don't Make Me Think''''' is a book by [[Steve Krug]] about [[human–computer interaction]] and [[web usability]]. The book's premise is that a good [[software]] program or web site should let users accomplish their intended tasks as easily and directly as possible. Krug points out that people are good at [[satisficing#Decision making|satisficing]], or taking the first available solution to their problem, so design should take advantage of this. He frequently cites [[Amazon.com]] as an example of a well-designed web site that manages to allow high-quality interaction, even though the web site gets bigger and more complex every day.

The book itself is intended to be an example of [[concision]] (brevity) and well-focused writing. The goal, according to the book's introduction, was to make a text that could be read by an executive on a two-hour airplane flight.

Originally published in 2000, the book was revised in 2005 and 2013 and has sold more than 300,000 copies.

In 2010, the author published a sequel, ''Rocket Surgery Made Easy'', which explains how anyone working on a web site, mobile app, or desktop software can do their own usability testing to ensure that what they're building will be usable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">In [[engineering]], '''double-subscript notation''' is notation used to indicate some variable ''between'' two points (each point being represented by one of the subscripts). In [[electronics]], the notation is usually used to indicate the direction of current or voltage, while in [[mechanical engineering]] it is sometimes used to describe the [[force]] or [[Stress (physics)|stress]] between two points, and sometimes even a component that spans between two points (like a beam on a bridge or [[truss]]). Note that, although there are many cases where multiple subscripts are used, they are not necessarily called ''double subscript notation'' specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Circuit Analysis for Power Engineering Handbook |author=Moses E. Zarudi, Shenkman, Arieh L. Shenkman|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-412-83180-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic usage ==
IEEE standard 255-1963, "Letter Symbols for Semiconductor Devices", defined eleven original quantity symbols expressed as abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 255-1963 - IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Semiconductor Devices|last =|first =|publisher = IEEE|year = 1963|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the basis for a [[Convention (norm)|convention]] to standardize the directions of double-subscript labels. The following uses [[transistors]] as an example, but shows how the direction is read generally. The convention works like this:

&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{CB} \ &lt;/math&gt; represents the [[voltage]] from C to B. In this case, C would denote the collector end of a transistor, and B would denote the base end of the same transistor. This is the same as saying "the voltage drop from C to B". Though this applies the standard definitions of the letters C and B,&lt;ref name="graf"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Dictionary of Electronics|last=Graf|first=Rudolf F.|publisher=Howard W. Sams &amp; Co., Inc.|year=1973|isbn=|edition=4th|location=|pages=683-684|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{CE} \ &lt;/math&gt; would in turn represent the current from C to E. In this case, C would again denote the collector end of a transistor, and E would denote the emitter end of the transistor. This is the same as saying "the current in the direction going from C to E".&lt;ref name="graf"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IC power supply pin|Power supply pins on integrated circuits]] utilize the same letters for denoting what kind of voltage the pin would receive. For example, a power input labeled V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; would be a positive input that would presumably connect to the collector pin of a BJT transistor in the circuit, and likewise respectively with other subscripted letters. The format used is the same as for notations described above, though without the connotation of V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; meaning the voltage from a collector pin to collector pin; the repetition avoids confusion as such an expression would not exist.

The table above shows only the originally denoted letters; others have found their way into use over time, such as S and D for the Source and Drain of a [[Field-effect transistor|FET]], respectively.

'''Ecomechatronics''' is an engineering approach to developing and applying mechatronical technology in order to reduce the ecological impact and [[total cost of ownership]] of machines. It builds upon the integrative approach of [[mechatronics]], but not with the aim of only improving the functionality of a machine. Mechatronics is the multidisciplinary field of science and engineering that merges mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science to improve and optimize product design and manufacturing. In ecomechatronics, additionally, functionality should go hand in hand with an efficient use and limited impact on resources. Machine improvements are targeted in 3 key areas: [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], performance and user comfort ([[noise]] &amp; [[vibration]]s).
[[File:Machine as a system.png|thumb|right|Machine as a system requiring energy and consumables to transform an input into an output, thereby generating emissions (heat, noise, ...)]]
[[File:Mechatronical system.png|thumb|right|Schematic of a mechatronical system consisting of a controller, amplifier, drive, mechanical structure and sensors]]

== Description ==

Among policy makers and manufacturing industries there is a growing awareness of the scarcity of resources and the need for [[sustainable development]]. This results in new regulations with respect to the design of machines (e.g. [[European Ecodesign Directive]] 2009/125/EC) and to a paradigm shift in the global machines market: "instead of maximum profit from minimum capital, maximum added value must be generated from minimal resources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resource efficient production|url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/research-topics/production-and-environment/production-saves-energy_2.html|publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing industries increasingly require high performance machines that use resources (energy, consumables) economically in a human-centered production. Machine building companies and [[original equipment manufacturer]]s are thus urged to respond to this market demand with a new generation of high performance machines with higher energy efficiency and user comfort.
[[File:Evolution of crude oil price.png|thumb|right|Evolution of crude oil price. Data source: Statistical Review of World Energy 2013, BP]]

A reduction of the energy consumption lowers energy costs and reduces environmental impact. Typically more than 80% of the total-life-cycle impact of a machine is attributed to its energy consumption during the use phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Amended Ecodesign Working Plan - Task 1 &amp; 2 Main report|date=2011-02-18|publisher=European Commission|location=Brussels|url=http://www.ecodesign-wp2.eu/downloads/2011-02-18_Task1-2_Main-report.pdf|editor=VHK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, improving a machine's energy efficiency is the most effective way of reducing its environmental impact. 
Performance quantifies how well a machine executes its function and is typically related to productivity, precision and availability. User comfort is related to the exposure of operators and the environment to noise &amp; vibrations due to machine operation.

Since energy efficiency, performance and noise &amp; vibrations are coupled in a machine they need to be addressed in an integrated way in the design phase. Example of the interrelation between the 3 key areas: with increasing machine speed typically the machine’s productivity increases, but energy consumption will increase as well and machine vibrations may grow such that machine accuracy (e.g. positioning accuracy) and availability (due to downtime and maintenance) decrease. Ecomechatronical design deals with the trade-off between these key areas.

== Approach ==

Ecomechatronics impacts the way mechatronical systems and machines are being designed and implemented. Therefore, the transformation to a new generation of machines concerns knowledge institutes, [[original equipment manufacturer]]s, CAE software suppliers, machine builders and industrial machine owners. The fact that about 80% of the environmental impact of a machine is determined by its design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco-design of Energy-Related Products|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/efficiency/ecodesign/eco_design_en.htm|publisher=European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; puts emphasis on making the right technological design choices. A model-based, multidisciplinary design approach is required in order to address the energy efficiency, performance and user comfort of a machine in an integrated way.

The key enabling technologies can be categorized in machine components, machine design methods &amp; tools, and machine control. A few examples are listed below per category.

'''Machine components'''
* Energy efficient electrical motors: cf. energy efficiency classes of electric motors, [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/european-standards/harmonised-standards/ecodesign/electric_motors_en.htm ecodesign requirements for electric motors]
* [[Variable frequency drive]]s: variable motor speed enables energy reduction with respect to fixed speed applications
* Variable hydraulic pumps: energy reduction by adapting to required pressure and flow (e.g. variable displacement pump, load sensing pump)
* Energy storage technologies: electrical (battery, capacitor, [[supercapacitor]]), hydraulical (accumulator), kinetic energy ([[flywheel]]), pneumatic, magnetic ([[superconducting magnetic energy storage]])

'''Design methods &amp; tools'''
* Energetic simulations: using energetic machine models and empirical data (e.g. energy efficiency maps) to estimate the machine's energy consumption in the design phase
* Energy demand optimization: e.g. load leveling in order to avoid peaks in power demand
* Hybridization: applying at least one other, intermediate energy form in order to reduce primary power source consumption e.g. in vehicles with internal combustion engines (see [[hybrid vehicle drivetrain]])
* Vibro-acoustic analysis: study of the noise &amp; vibrations signature of a machine in order to localize and differentiate between their root causes
* Multibody modeling: simulation of the interaction forces and displacements of coupled rigid bodies, e.g. to assess the effect of vibration dampers on a mechanical structure
* Active vibration damping: e.g. use of piezoelectric bearings for active control of machine vibrations
* [[Rapid control prototyping]]: provides a fast and inexpensive way for control and signal processing engineers to verify designs early and evaluate design tradeoffs

'''Machine control'''
* Energy consumption minimization: control signals are optimized for minimum energy consumption
* Energy management of energy storage systems: controlling the power flows and state-of-charge of an energy storage system with the aim of achieving maximum energy benefit and maximum system lifespan
* Model-based control: taking advantage of system models to improve the outcome (accuracy, reaction time, ...) of the controlled system
* (Self-)learning control: control self-adapting to the system and its changing environment, reducing the need for control parameter tuning and adaptation by the control engineer
* Optimal machine control: the control of the system is regarded as an optimization problem to which the control rules are considered the optimal solution (see [[Optimal control]])

== Applications ==

Some examples of ecomechatronical system applications are:
* [[Komatsu PC200-8 Hybrid]]: the world's first hybrid excavator has an energy storage system based on [[supercapacitor]]s. The energy recuperation in the hydraulic drive line during braking results in a significant improvement of fuel economy.
* Hybrid bus: different hybrid bus types have been commercialized (e.g. ExquiCity bus by [[Van Hool]]), using [[fuel cell]]s or a diesel engine as a primary energy source and batteries and/or [[supercapacitor]]s as energy storage systems.
* Hybrid tram vehicle: hybridization in tram vehicles enables energy recuperation as well as mobility without overhead lines, as applied in e.g. some of the [[Combino Supra]] tram vehicles by Siemens Transportation Systems. The system uses a combination of traction batteries and [[supercapacitor]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">An '''enterprise appliance transaction module''' (EATM) is a device, typically used in the manufacturing automation marketplace, for the transfer of plant floor equipment and product status to [[manufacturing execution system]]s (MES), [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems and the like.

Solutions that deliver manufacturing floor integration have evolved over time.  Initially they took the form of custom integrated systems, designed and delivered by System Integrators.  These solutions were largely based on separate [[Commercial off-the-shelf|Commercial off the Shelf]] (COTS) products that a System Integrator acquired and integrated into the custom solution.  

These solutions have evolved into vendor supplied product solutions that no longer require the integration of separate components.  EATM products, as they are known today, are available as COTS Appliance products, fully configurable, and not needing any software development or custom integration.

== Components required for EATM functionality ==

'''Hardware platform –''' [[Embedded system|embedded computer]], [[computer appliance]]

'''Device communications software –''' Support for the [[Automation protocols|device protocols]] from which data will be extracted.   Device communications software typically operates through polled or change based protocols that are vendor specific.  Data to be extracted is typically organized into related items, and transferred based on a machine status such as Cycle Complete, Job Start, System Downtime Event, Operator Change, etc.

Typical protocols;  Rockwell Automation [[Common Industrial Protocol|CIP]], ControlLogix backplane, [[EtherNet/IP]], Siemens [[Industrial Ethernet]], [[Modbus|Modbus TCP]].  There are hundreds of automation device protocols and EATM solutions are typically targeting certain market segments and will be based on automation vendor relationships.

'''Enterprise communications software –''' Software that will enable communications to [[Enterprise systems]].  Communications at this level are typically transaction oriented and require data transactions to be sent and acknowledged to ensure the data integrity.  Examples include; Relational Database Adapters, Java Message Services (JMS), Oracle Database Interfaces and proprietary interfaces to specific products.

'''Transaction application –''' Software that is configured to watch and collect device variables, formats them into required transactions, and transfer the results securely and reliably to the Enterprise Solutions.  The Transaction Application resides between the Device Communications and the Enterprise communications.

== Enterprise solutions ==

Manufacturing solutions fall into many categories.  Overall, the manufacturing environment is portrayed as a three layer Manufacturing Pyramid.  At the base, Device Control Systems – [[Programmable logic controller|Programmable Logic Controller]] (PLC) and [[SCADA|Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition]] systems (SCADA) perform the process automation functions.  A layer above that encompasses Plant Execution Systems that deliver the functions of; Asset Management, Genealogy, [[Statistical process control|SPC]], [[Manufacturing Execution System|MES]], Order Tracking, Quality Assurance and Scheduling.  At the top most level, [[Enterprise resource planning|Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) systems offer final control over the enterprise and track overall enterprise performance.  

It is the job of EATM solutions to act as a bi-directional bridge between field devices and the supervisory control systems.  These field devices could be located in a work cell or an assembly or process line.  They could be very simple devices, or programmable controllers, machine controls, or PLCs.  The upstream business systems could be ANDON and [[Kanban]] systems for that line, [[manufacturing execution system]]s (MES), and Archival Quality databases.

'''Factor Ten''' is a social and economic policy program developed by the Factor Ten institute with the stated goal of reducing human resource turnover by 90% on a global scale within the next 30 to 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factor10-institute.org/ |title=Factor 10 Institute |publisher=Factor 10 Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, from the [[Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]], first proposed the Factor 10 and [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] concepts in the early 1990s. He concluded in his studies that 80% of the world’s resources are distributed among [[First World]] nations, which contribute 20% of the global population, so those nations are promoting an unsustainable system of development. The goal of Factor 10 is to assure that nations do not exceed the planet’s [[carrying capacity]] but leave sufficient resources for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/factor-10 |title=Factor 10 : Dictionary of Sustainable Management |publisher=Sustainabilitydictionary.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factor 4 ==
Factor 10 evolved from the less dramatic '''Factor 4''' was originally proposed by [[L. Hunter Lovins]] and [[Amory Lovins]] of the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] and [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker|Ernst von Weizsäcker]], the founder of the [[Wuppertal Institute]] for Climate, Environment &amp; Energy. Their book ''Factor 4'' explains how simple it is for nations to achieve Factor 4 results with existing technologies. The concept attempts to reduce resource and energy use by 75 % by doubling output and halving input of production.

== Goals ==
Factor 10 requires the creation of new technologies, policies, and manufacturing processes along with sociocultural change to create a [[global economy]] that is sustainable for a long period of time. The long-term goal of Factor 10, many governments and firms aspiring toward shortIterm relief have difficulty achieving the massive reductions proposed by factor 10. [[Eco-efficiency]], environmental purchasing design for environment, policies and [[environmental taxes]] have already been used by business and governments implementing the Factor 10 theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdrc.org/sustdev/concepts/11-f10.html |title=Sustainability Concepts: Factor 10 |publisher=Gdrc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factor 10 goes farther as a response to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] call for a tenfold reduction in resource consumption in industrialised countries as a necessary long-term target if adequate resources are to be released for the needs of the [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[UNEP]], Global Environmental Outlook 2000, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; With the predicted rise in population and economic growth to maintain the level of [[pollution]] we have today, we need to be able to produce the same output for 10% of the impact.

Factor X concept is the direct way of using metric and various activities that can reduce the throughput of resources and energy in the given process. The essential question is by what factor can or should certain flows be reduced. It is a useful tool to monitor the performance of business in terms of [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert, K.H., Schmidt-Bleek, B., et al. (2002).

[[Feminist theory]] as it relates to [[architecture]] has forged the way for the rediscovery of such [[women in architecture|female architects]] as [[Eileen Gray]]. These women imagined an architecture that challenged the way the traditional family would live. They practiced architecture with what they considered feminist theories or approaches. The rediscovery of architecture through feminist theory is not limited to female architects. Architects like [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Adolf Loos]] have also had their architecture reexamined through feminist theory.

==The architecture==
In [[Dolores Hayden]]'s book ''The Grand Domestic Revolution'' she explains the ways in which "a lost feminine tradition" led to a "redefining of house work and the housing needs of women and their families, push[ing] architects and urban planners to reconsider the effects of design on family life".&lt;ref&gt;Dolores Hayden, ''The Grand Domestic Revolution: A History of Feminist Designs for American Homes, Neighborhoods, and Cities,'' MIT Press, 1981. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the changing needs of the family can be seen in the houses of Truus Schröder, Eileen Gray and LeCorbusier's [[Villa Stein]] de-Monzie. The [[Rietveld Schröder House]] is an excellent example of the way that the "modern" lives of the family demanded a new architecture.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Schröder House was not only a creative work of artistic design but offered its users a new environment in which to redefine family life, women's rights and the responsibilities of individuals and to each other"&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., "Family Matters: The Schroder House, by Gerrit Rietveld and Truus Schröder," [[Yale University Press]], 2006. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movable walls and partitions give a sense of consciousness and an overall feeling that the architecture was built with a greater purpose. The fact that Truus Schröder's beliefs in the family and as the house playing a part in the family; the house almost as a member.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} Truus Schröder is closely related to Dutch and European [[feminism]] of the twentieth century, based on her goals for her house.

Eileen Gray's [[E-1027]] is another example of feminist theory being applied to architecture.

Much like Schröder, Gray designed an architecture that would address the needs of the occupants and the new family unit. Gray worked within the model of modern architecture, LeCorbusier's "5 points of new architecture" for example as well as addressing the issues of the building or home as an experience.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, Caroline. "E1027: The Nonheroic Modernism of Eileen Gray," ''Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians,'' vol.53, September 1994. p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Like E1027 and The Schroder House, Villa Stein de Monzie was rediscovered through feminist theory. More well known is the way in which this house called gender relations and the way in which the relationship between men and women was negotiated in a new way.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Alice T., ''Women and the Making of the Modern House: A Social and Architectural History.'' Yale University Press, 2006, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

This house is of particular importance in feminist theory because it called into question the typical domestic group and gender relations. This domestic group that included a married couple and a woman with her child called domestic space into question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5155">In [[structural biology]], the three-dimensional '''Fourier shell correlation (FSC)''' measures the normalised [[cross-correlation]] coefficient between two 3-dimensional volumes over corresponding shells in [[Fourier Transform|Fourier]] space (i.e., as a function of spatial frequency&lt;ref name=Harauz1986&gt;Harauz &amp; van Heel, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;). The FSC is the three-dimensional extension of the two-dimensional Fourier ring correlation (FRC);&lt;ref name=vanHeel1982&gt;van Heel, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; also known as: spatial frequency correlation function.&lt;ref name=Saxton1982&gt;Saxton &amp; Baumeister, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation ==
:&lt;math&gt;
FSC(r) = 
\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_i \in r}{ F_1(r_i) \cdot F_2(r_i)^{\ast} }}
{\displaystyle\sqrt[2]{\sum_{r_i \in r}{ \left|F_1(r_i)\right|^2} \cdot \sum_{r_i \in r}{\left|F_2(r_i)\right|^2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; is the complex structure Factor for volume 1, &lt;math&gt;F_2^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugate of the structure Factor for volume 2, and &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the individual voxel element at radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Image Science's FSC: Program to calculate the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) of two 3D volumes | url=http://www.imagescience.de/fsc/ | work=fsc | publisher=Image Science | accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RF 3 - Phase Residual &amp; Fourier shell correlation | url=http://www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/docs/man/rf3.html | work=SPIDER | publisher=Wadsworth Center | accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanHeel2005&gt;van Heel &amp; Schatz, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, the FSC takes two three-dimensional data sets and converts them into a one-dimensional array.

The FSC originated in [[cryo-electron microscopy]] and gradually proliferated to other fields. To measure the FSC, two independently determined 3D volumes are required. In [[cryo-electron microscopy]], the two volumes are the result of two three-dimensional reconstructions, each based on half of the available data set. Typically, the even particle images form one half and the odd particles the other half of the data set. Most publications quote the FSC 0.5 resolution cutoff, which ''ad hoc'' criterion refers to when the correlation coefficient of the Fourier shells is equal to 0.5.&lt;ref name=Bottcher1997&gt;Böttcher et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frank2006&gt;Frank, 2006, p250-251&lt;/ref&gt; However, determining the resolution threshold remains a controversial issue: fixed-value thresholds were argued to be based on incorrect statistical assumptions.&lt;ref name=vanHeel2005/&gt; Many other criteria using the FSC curve exist, including 3-σ criterion, 5-σ criterion, and the 0.143 cutoff. The half-bit criterion indicates at which resolution we have collected enough information to reliably interpret the 3-dimensional volume, and the (modified) 3-[[sigma]] criterion indicates where the FSC systematically emerges above the expected random correlations of the background noise.&lt;ref name=vanHeel2005/&gt;

[[File:Drosophila Gene Linkage Map.svg|right|thumb|300px| [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' [[genetic linkage]] [[map]]. This was the first successful gene mapping work and provides important evidence for the [[Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory]] of [[inheritance]]. The map shows the relative positions of [[allele|allelic]] characteristics on the second Drosophila chromosome. The distance between the genes (map units) are equal to the percentage of [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing-over]] events that occurs between different alleles. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mader |first=Sylvia |date=2007 |title=Biology Ninth Edition |location= New York |publisher= McGraw-Hill |page= 209 |isbn= 978-0-07-325839-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Gene mapping''' describes the methods used to identify the [[locus (genetics)|locus]] of a gene and the distances between genes.&lt;ref name="Lister Hill"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gene mapping - Glossary Entry |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=genemapping|date=2013-09-03|work=[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/ Genetics Home Reference]|publisher=Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications,  an Intramural Research Division of the [[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]]|accessdate=2013-09-06|location=Bethesda, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of all [[genome]] mapping is to place a collection of molecular markers onto their respective positions on the genome. [[Molecular marker]]s come in all forms. Genes can be viewed as one special type of genetic markers in the construction of genome maps, and mapped the same way as any other markers.

==Genetic mapping vs physical mapping==
There are two distinctive types of "Maps" used in the field of genome mapping: genetic maps and physical maps. While both maps are a collection of [[genetic markers]] and gene loci, genetic maps' distances are based on the genetic linkage information, while physical maps use actual physical distances usually measured in number of base pairs. While the physical map could be a more "accurate" representation of the genome, genetic maps often offer insights into the nature of different regions of the chromosome, e.g. the genetic distance to physical distance ratio varies greatly at different genomic regions which reflects different recombination rates, and such rate is often indicative of euchromatic (usually gene-rich) vs heterochromatic (usually gene poor) regions of the genome.

===Gene mapping===
Researchers begin a genetic map by collecting samples of blood or tissue from family members that carry a prominent disease or trait and family members that don't. Scientists then isolate DNA from the samples and closely examine it, looking for unique patterns in the DNA of the family members who do carry the disease that the DNA of those who don't carry the disease don't have. These unique molecular patterns in the DNA are referred to as polymorphisms, or markers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genome.gov/10000715&lt;/ref&gt;

The first steps of building a genetic map are the development of [[genetic marker]]s and a mapping population. The closer two markers are on the chromosome, the more likely they are to be passed on to the next generation together. Therefore, the "co-segregation" patterns of all markers can be used to reconstruct their order. With this in mind, the genotypes of each genetic marker are recorded for both parents and each individual in the following generations. The quality of the genetic maps is largely dependent upon these factors: the number of genetic markers on the map and the size of the mapping population. The two factors are interlinked, as a larger mapping population could increase the "resolution" of the map and prevent the map being "saturated".

In gene mapping, any sequence feature that can be faithfully distinguished from the two parents can be used as a genetic marker. Genes, in this regard, are represented by "traits" that can be faithfully distinguished between two parents. Their linkage with other genetic markers are calculated in the same way as if they are common markers and the actual gene loci are then bracketed in a region between the two nearest neighbouring markers. The entire process is then repeated by looking at more markers which target that region to map the gene neighbourhood to a higher resolution until a specific causative locus can be identified. This process is often referred to as "[[positional cloning]]", and it is used extensively in the study of plant species
The great advantage of genetic mapping is that it can identify the relative position of genes based solely on their phenotypic effect.

===Physical mapping===
Since actual base-pair distances are generally hard or impossible to directly measure, physical maps are actually constructed by first shattering the genome into hierarchically smaller pieces. By characterizing each single piece and assembling back together, the overlapping path or "tiling path" of these small fragments would allow researchers to infer physical distances between genomic features. The fragmentation of the genome can be achieved by [[restriction enzyme]] cutting or by physically shattering the genome by processes like sonication. Once cut, the DNA fragments are separated by [[electrophoresis]]. The resulting pattern of DNA migration (i.e. its [[genetic fingerprint]]) is used to identify what stretch of DNA is in the [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]. By analyzing the fingerprints, [[contig]]s are assembled by automated (FPC) or manual means (pathfinders) into overlapping DNA stretches. Now a good choice of clones can be made to efficiently sequence the clones to determine the DNA sequence of the organism under study.

In physical mapping, there are no direct ways of marking up a specific gene since the mapping does not include any information that concerns traits and functions. Genetic markers can be linked to a physical map by processes like [[in situ hybridization]]. By this approach, physical map contigs can be "anchored" onto a genetic map. The clones used in the physical map contigs can then be sequenced on a local scale to help new genetic marker design and identification of the causative loci.

Macrorestriction is a type of physical mapping wherein the high molecular weight DNA is digested with a restriction enzyme having a low number of restriction sites.

There are alternative ways to determine how [[DNA]] in a group of clones overlaps without completely sequencing the clones. Once the map is determined, the clones can be used as a resource to efficiently contain large stretches of the genome. This type of mapping is more accurate than genetic maps.

===Genome sequencing===
Genome sequencing is sometimes mistakenly referred to as "genome mapping" by non-biologists. The process of "shotgun sequencing" resembles the process of physical mapping: it shatters the genome into small fragments, characterizes each fragment, then puts them back together (more recent sequencing technologies are drastically different). While the scope, purpose and process are totally different, a genome assembly can be viewed as the "ultimate" form of physical map, in that it provides in a much better way all the information that a traditional physical map can offer.

==Use==
Identification of genes is usually the first step in understanding a genome of a species; mapping of the gene is usually the first step of identification of the gene. Gene mapping is usually the starting point of many important downstream studies.

===Disease association===
The process to identify a genetic element that is responsible for a [[disease]] is also referred to as "mapping". If the locus in which the search is performed is already considerably constrained, the search is called the ''fine mapping'' of a gene. This information is derived from the investigation of disease manifestations in large families ([[genetic linkage]]) or from populations-based [[genetic association]] studies.

Greenhouse gas monitoring is the direct [[measurement]] of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and levels.  There are several different methods of measuring carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, including [[Infrared gas analyzer|infrared analyzing]] and [[manometry]]. [[Methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are measured by other instruments. Greenhouse gases are measured by [[satellite monitoring]] such as the [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory]] and networks of [[ground station]]s such as the [[Integrated Carbon Observation System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.economist.com/science-technology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15603891 |title=Highs and lows |publisher=The Economist |date=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

=== Carbon dioxide monitoring ===

==== Manometry ====
Manometry is a key measurement tool for atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] by first measuring the volume, temperature, and pressure of a particular amount of dry air. The air sample is dried by passing it through multiple dry ice traps and then collecting it in a five liter vessel. The temperature is taken via a thermometer and pressure is calculated using [[manometry]]. Then, [[liquid nitrogen]] is added, causing the [[carbon dioxide]] to condense and become measurable by volume.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Daniel C.|date=2010|title=Charles David Keeling and the Story of Atmospheric CO2 Measurements|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/ipdf/10.1021/ac1001492|journal=Analytical Chemistry|language=en|volume=82|issue=19|pages=7865–7870|doi=10.1021/ac1001492|issn=0003-2700|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ideal gas law]] is accurate to 0.3% in these pressure conditions.

==== Infrared gas analyzer ====
Infrared analyzers were used at [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] and at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] between 1958 and 2006. IR analyzers operate by pumping an unknown sample of dry air through a 40 cm long cell. A reference cell contains dry [[carbon dioxide]]-free air.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A glowing [[nichrome]] filament radiates broadband [[IR radiation]] which splits into two beams and passes through the gas cells. [[Carbon dioxide]] absorbs some of the radiation, allowing more radiation that passes through the reference cell to reach the detector than radiation passing through the sample cell. Data is collected on a strip chart recorder. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the sample is quantified by calibrating with a standard gas of known [[carbon dioxide]] content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Titrimetry ====
[[Titrimetry]] is another method of measuring atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] that was first used by a Scandinavian group at 15 different [[Ground station|ground stations.]] They began passing a 100.0 mL air sample through a solution of [[barium hydroxide]] containing [[cresolphthalein]] indicator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methane gas monitoring ===

==== Differential absorption lidar ====
Range-resolved infrared [[differential absorption lidar]] (DIAL) is a means of measuring [[methane emissions]] from various sources, including active and closed landfill sites.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innocenti|first=Fabrizio|last2=Robinson|first2=Rod|last3=Gardiner|first3=Tom|last4=Finlayson|first4=Andrew|last5=Connor|first5=Andy|date=2017|title=Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) Measurements of Landfill Methane Emissions|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/9/953|journal=Remote Sensing|language=en|volume=9|issue=9|pages=953|doi=10.3390/rs9090953|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Differential absorption lidar|DIAL]] takes vertical scans above [[methane]] sources and then spatially separates the scans to accurately measure the [[methane emissions]] from individual sources. Measuring [[methane emissions]] is a crucial aspect of [[climate change research]], as methane is among the most impactful gaseous [[hydrocarbon]] species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== Nitrous oxide monitoring ===

====Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment‐Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS)====
[[Nitrous oxide]] is one of the most prominent [[Anthropogenic climate change|anthropogenic]] [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depleting]] gases in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheese|first=Patrick E.|last2=Walker|first2=Kaley A.|last3=Boone|first3=Chris D.|last4=Bernath|first4=Peter F.|last5=Funke|first5=Bernd|date=2016|title=Nitrous oxide in the atmosphere: First measurements of a lower thermospheric source|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL067353|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=43|issue=6|pages=2866–2872|doi=10.1002/2015gl067353|issn=0094-8276|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is released into the atmosphere primarily through natural sources such as soil and rock, as well as [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] process like farming. Atmospheric [[nitrous oxide]] is also created in the atmosphere as a product of a reaction between nitrogen and electronically excited [[ozone]] in the lower [[thermosphere]].

The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment‐Fourier Transform Spectrometer ([[ACE-FTS]]) is a tool used for measuring [[nitrous oxide]] concentrations in the upper to lower [[troposphere]]. This instrument, which is attached to the Canadian satellite [[SCISAT-1|SCISAT]], has shown that [[nitrous oxide]] is present throughout the entire atmosphere during all seasons, primarily due to energetic particle precipitation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Measurements taken by the instrument show that different reactions create [[nitrous oxide]] in the lower thermosphere than in the mid to upper [[mesosphere]].  The [[ACE-FTS]] is a crucial resource in predicting future [[ozone depletion]] in the upper stratosphere by comparing the different ways in which [[nitrous oxide]] is released into the atmosphere. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11444">[[Marine archeology]] in the [[Gulf of Khambhat]], [[India]], - earlier known as Gulf of Cambay - centers on findings made in December 2000 by the [[National Institute of Ocean Technology]] (NIOT). NIOT came across palaeo river channels in the sea. These were seen by the scientists involved to be the extension of the present day major rivers of the area. In a similar marine survey, in a Coastal Research Ship during 1999-2000 when Dr S Badrinaryan was the Chief Scientist, several unusual frames of Side Scan Sonar images were encountered. These had square and rectangular features in an arranged geometric fashion which are not expected by the scientist in the marine domain. As per the scientist involved such features are unlikely to be due to natural marine geological processes. This made the scientists suspect that human workmanship must have been involved here. The surveys were followed up in the following years and two palaeo channels of old rivers were discovered in the middle of the Khambhat area under 20-40m water depths, at a distance of about 20&amp;nbsp;km from the present day coast.&lt;ref name="BadrinaryanB1"&gt;Gulf of Cambay Cradle of Ancient Civilization {{cite web|url=http://www.grahamhancock.com/forum/BadrinaryanB1.php?p%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226235141/http://www.grahamhancock.com/forum/BadrinaryanB1.php?p=1 |archivedate=2006-02-26 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial discovery==
On 19 May 2001, India's Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Science and Technology division, [[Murli Manohar Joshi]], announced that the ruins of an ancient civilization had been discovered off the coast of Gujarat, in the Gulf of Khambhat. The site was discovered by NIOT while they performed routine pollution studies using sonar, and was described as an area of regularly spaced geometric structures. It is located 20&amp;nbsp;km from the Gujarat coast, spans 9&amp;nbsp;km, and can be found at a depth of 30–40 meters. In his announcement, Joshi represented the site as an urban settlement that pre-dates the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].&lt;ref name="Bavadam 2002a"&gt;Bavadam, Lyla. Questionable claims: Archaeologists debunk the claim that underwater structures in the Gulf of Khambat point to the existence of a pre-Harappan civilisation. ''Frontline'' 2–15 March 2002.{{cite web |url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&amp;page=flonnet&amp;rdurl=fl1905/19050670.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130706211425/http://www.frontline.in:80/navigation/?type=static&amp;page=flonnet&amp;rdurl=fl1905/19050670.htm |archivedate=2013-07-06 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further descriptions of the site by Joshi describe it as containing regularly spaced dwellings, a granary, a bath, a citadel, and a drainage system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1095963-ancient-lost-metropolis-on-seabed/#comment-5309732 Mudur, G.S.

Furthermore, the Indus civilization  port [[Lothal]] is located at the head, Gulf of Khambhat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1345150.stm Rao, R.

==Follow-up excavations==
A follow-up investigation was conducted by NIOT in November 2001, which included dredging to recover artifacts and sonar scans to detect structures. Among the artifacts recovered were a piece of wood, pottery shards, weathered stones initially described as hand tools, fossilized bones, and a tooth. Artifacts were sent to the [[National Geophysical Research Institute]] (NGRI) in Hyderabad, India, the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleobotany (BSIP) in Lucknow, India, and the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, India.&lt;ref name="Kathiroli2004a"&gt;Kathiroli, S. "Recent Marine Archaeological Finds in Khambhat, Gujarat." ''Journal of Indian Ocean Archaeology'' 2004: 141-149. Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece of wood was [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]] to an age of 9,500 years old.&lt;ref name="Bavadam 2002a"/&gt;

NIOT returned for further investigation in the Gulf from October 2002 to January 2003. During these excavations, NIOT reported finding two [[paleochannel]]s flanked by rectangular and square basement-like features. Artifacts were recovered by means of dredging, including pottery sherds, [[microlith]]s, [[wattle and daub]] remains, and [[hearth]] materials. These artifacts were sent for dating at the laboratories of Manipur University and Oxford University. The wattle and daub remains are composed of locally available clay, reed, husk, pottery pieces, and pieces of fresh water shell. The wattle and daub also shows evidence of partial burning.&lt;ref name=" Kathiroli2004a"/&gt;

The most recent work in the Gulf of Khambhat took place from October 2003 to January 2004 and was primarily a geologic study. Techniques used during this investigation include [[bathymetry|bathymetry survey]], sub-bottom survey, [[side-scan sonar|side-scan survey]], and [[magnetic survey (archaeology)|magnetic survey]]. One of the major findings from this investigation concerns the orientation of sand ripples at the site. NIOT researchers claim that there are two sets of ripples visible at the site; One set is a natural feature formed by tidal currents, whilst they say the other set has formed in relation to underlying structural features.&lt;ref name=" Kathiroli2004a"/&gt;

==Controversies==

===Carbon dates===
One of the main controversies surrounding the GKCC is the dated piece of wood. [[D. P. Agrawal|Dr. D.P. Agrawal]], chairman of the Paleoclimate Group and founder of Carbon-14 testing facilities in India stated in an article in Frontline Magazine that the piece was dated twice, at separate laboratories.&lt;ref name="Bavadam 2002a"/&gt; The NGRI in Hyderabad returned a date of 7190 BC and the BSIP in Hannover returned a date of 7545-7490 BC.&lt;ref name=" Kathiroli2004a"/&gt; Some archeologists, Agrawal in particular, contest that the discovery of an ancient piece of wood does not imply the discovery of an ancient civilization. Agrawal argues that the wood piece is a common find, given that 20,000 years ago the Arabian Sea was 100 meters lower than its current level, and that the gradual sea level rise submerged entire forests.&lt;ref name="Bavadam 2002a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Witzel2006a"&gt;Witzel, Michael, 2006, Rama’s realm: Indocentric rewritings of early South Asian archaeology and history in Fagan, G. G., ed., Archaeological Fantasies. Routledge Taylor, and Francis Group, New York {{ISBN|0-415-30593-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artifacts ===
Another controversial issue are the artifacts retrieved from the site during the various excavations. It is disputed that many of the items that have been identified as artifacts by the NIOT investigators are actually man-made. Instead their artificial nature is contested and they are argued to be stones of natural origin.&lt;ref name="Witzel2006a"/&gt;

Researchers report finding shards of pottery as indicative of hand-made and wheel-turned pottery traditions. The reported shards have simple rims with small incised lines. All of the pottery fragments found so far are small or miniature shards.&lt;ref name=" Kathiroli2004a"/&gt; Part of the controversy is that some of the "shards" are natural geofacts and others lack any proof of any connections, as with the dated pieces of wood, with the purported "ruins" found by NIOT researchers. In addition, their small size also raises the possibility that the real shards have been transported from elsewhere by local, strong tidal currents. But if the pottery is genuine, researchers say it should show some similarities to Harappan pottery, which is typically red and black and stamped with seals. Based on the current pottery collection, a stylistic continuity of Harappan civilization isn't evident. The small size of the artifact collection makes it difficult to  analyse the pottery conclusively.&lt;ref name="Bavadam 2002a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Witzel2006a"/&gt;

===Geography===
The Gulf of Khambhat was formed by a major rift that resulted in a down sliding of the Khambhat region. The area is very tectonically active today, and several [[Fault (geology)|faults]] can be found in the gulf. Periodic earthquakes also occur here.&lt;ref name="Kathiroli2004a"/&gt; This knowledge has led several archeologists to state that the site is not in a secure enough context to be reliably dated. Because of the tectonic activity and strong currents, these archeologists claim that there is not sufficient [[stratification (archeology)|stratification]] to be sure the recovered artifacts can be associated with the site.&lt;ref name="Bavadam 2002a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Witzel2006a"/&gt;

===Collection methods===
Complaints have arisen because NIOT recovered artefacts by dredging the sea floor of the site. This method might allow errant artefacts to be collected along with those that actually correlate with the site. Analysing stratification is virtually impossible with this method as well.&lt;ref name="Bavadam 2002a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Witzel2006a"/&gt;

The '''Museum Of Bad Art''' ('''MOBA''') is a privately owned museum whose stated aim is "to celebrate the labor of artists whose work would be displayed and appreciated in no other forum".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] with current branches in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], and [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|South Weymouth]] in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Lowbrow&gt;{{cite news |author=Piepenburg, Erik |title=Loving the Lowbrow (It Has Its Own Hall of Fame) |agency= |work=[[The New York Times]] |pages= |page= |date=September 22, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/arts/design/03badart.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its permanent collection includes over 700&amp;nbsp;pieces of "art too bad to be ignored", 25 to 35 of which are on public display at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walkup, Nancy |title=ArtEd Online&amp;nbsp;— [[National Art Education Association|NAEA]] in Boston&amp;nbsp;— Reproducible Handout |journal=School Arts |volume=104 |issue=7 |pages=36 |date=March 2005 |issn=0036-6463 |oclc=1765119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOBA was founded in 1994, after antique dealer Scott Wilson showed a painting he had recovered from the trash to some friends, who suggested starting a collection. Within a year, receptions held in Wilson's friends' home were so well-attended that the collection needed its own viewing space. The museum then moved to the basement of a theater in Dedham. Explaining the reasoning behind the museum's establishment, co-founder Jerry Reilly said in 1995: "While every city in the world has at least one museum dedicated to the best of art, MOBA is the only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the worst."&lt;ref name=Mutch&gt;{{cite news |author=Mutch, David |title=Art from the Bottom of the Heap: A 'Museum' Devoted to Bad Painting |agency= |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |pages= |page=13 |date=November 2, 1995 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1995/1102/02131.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be included in MOBA's collection, works must be original and have serious intent, but they must also have significant flaws without being boring; curators are not interested in displaying deliberate [[kitsch]].

MOBA has been mentioned in dozens of off-the-beaten-path guides to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], featured in international newspapers and magazines, and has inspired several other collections throughout the world that set out to rival its own visual atrocities. [[Deborah Solomon]] of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' noted that the attention the Museum Of Bad Art receives is part of a wider trend of museums displaying "the best bad art".&lt;ref name="solomon"&gt;Solomon, Deborah. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/24/magazine/in-praise-of-bad-art.html In Praise of Bad Art]". ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 1999 &lt;!--Retrieved on March 2, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has been criticized for being anti-art, but the founders deny this, responding that its collection is a tribute to the sincerity of the artists who persevered with their art despite something going horribly wrong in the process. According to co-founder Marie Jackson, "We are here to celebrate an artist's right to fail, gloriously."&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;"[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/1999/0918/99091800051.html The Gallery of the Garish Masterpieces of Bad Art]".

==History==

The Museum Of Bad Art was established in 1994 by antique dealer Scott Wilson, who discovered what has become the museum's signature piece—''Lucy in the Field with Flowers''—protruding from between two trash cans on a [[Roslindale, Massachusetts|Roslindale]]-area curb in Boston, among some garbage waiting to be collected. Wilson was initially interested only in the frame, but when he showed the picture to his friend Jerry Reilly, Reilly wanted both the frame and the painting. He exhibited ''Lucy'' in his home, and encouraged friends to look for other bad art and notify Wilson of what they found.&lt;ref name="gaines"&gt;Gaines, Judith. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7775472.html "Exhibiting Works of Trial and Error: Museum Finds Landscapes Gone Awry"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', May 4, 2003. 9&lt;/ref&gt; When Wilson acquired another "equally lovely" piece and shared it with Reilly, they decided to start a collection. Reilly and his wife, Marie Jackson, held a party in their basement to exhibit the collection to date, and hosted a reception they facetiously titled "The Opening of the Museum Of Bad Art".&lt;ref name="english07"&gt;English, Bella. [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/04/29/high_standards_for_low_art/?rss_id=Boston%20Globe%20--%20Globe%20South "High Standards for Low Art"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 29, 2007. Reg7&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular showings of the pieces collected by Wilson, Reilly, and Jackson (and those donated by others), became too much for Reilly and Jackson's small home in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]], as hundreds of people attended the receptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Frauenfelder, Mark |title=Canvas Catastrophes |date=July 1995 |work= |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]] |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.07/scans.html?pg=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders' initial attempt at dealing with their constrained exhibition space was to create the Virtual Museum Of Bad Art, a CD-ROM with a cast of 95 people that presented the MOBA art collection in a fictional imaginary museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn18/wn18-1/wn18-113.html MOBS CD-ROM]&lt;/ref&gt;  This fictional MOBA allowed the visitors not only to view the paintings but to go behind the scenes in the fictional museum.

Word of the museum's collection continued to spread until, according to "Permanent Interim Acting Director" Louise Reilly Sacco, "it got completely out of hand" when a group of senior citizens on a tour bus stopped to see it.&lt;ref name="gaines"/&gt; In 1995 the display space was moved to the basement of the Dedham Community Theatre, a building with an aesthetic described in 2004 as "ramshackle".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Citro|Foulds|2004|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum in Dedham had no fixed operating hours, instead being open while the theater upstairs was open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodandwine.com/thingtodo/museum/museum-of-bad-art Museum of Bad Art] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130102163708/http://www.foodandwine.com/thingtodo/museum/museum-of-bad-art |date=2013-01-02 }}".

''[[South China Morning Post]]'', May 17, 2004. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In MOBA's early days, the museum hosted traveling shows; on one occasion the works were hung from trees in the woods on [[Cape Cod]] for the "Art Goes Out the Window—The Gallery in the Woods". [[Aesthetics of music#Bad music|Bad music]] was played during the public viewings to complete the ambiance. In an exhibition titled "Awash in Bad Art", 18 pieces of art were covered in shrink wrap for "the world's first drive-thru museum and car wash". Marie Jackson, formerly the Director of Aesthetic Interpretation noted, "We didn't put any watercolors in there."&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt; A 2001 exhibition, "Buck Naked—Nothing But Nudes" featured all of the MOBA nudes hung in a local spa.

MOBA features its works in rotating collections. In 2003, "Freaks of Nature" focused on landscape artwork "gone awry". A 2006 exhibit titled "Hackneyed Portraits" was designed to "pick up some of the slack" when the [[David Hockney]] show at Boston's [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] closed.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;Johnson, Carolyn.

In February 2009, MOBA announced a fundraiser to assist the [[Rose Art Museum]] at [[Brandeis University]], which was seriously considering whether to sell masterpieces because of the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]], made worse for the university by some of its donors losing money in [[Madoff investment scandal|Bernard Madoff's investment scheme]]. Current MOBA curator and [[Balloon modelling|balloon artist]]/musician Michael Frank placed ''Studies in Digestion''—a four-panel piece showing four renditions of the human digestive tract in various media by artist Deborah Grumet—on [[eBay]] for a buy-it-now price of $10,000; the first bid was $24.99.&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; It eventually sold for $152.53 and the meager proceeds went to the Rose Art Museum, while both museums gained publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, Morgan  Michele.

===Thefts===

The loss of two MOBA works to theft has drawn media attention and enhanced the museum's stature.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wulff, Julie "All Things Bad and Beautiful". ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', December 13, 2006. SID2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt; In 1996, the painting ''Eileen'', by R. Angelo Le, vanished from MOBA.  ''Eileen'' was acquired from the trash by Wilson, and features a rip in the canvas where someone slashed it with a knife even before the museum acquired it, "adding an additional element of drama to an already powerful work", according to MOBA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-9.html Portraiture #9 Eileen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224234034/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-9.html |date=2015-02-24 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum offered a reward of $6.50 for the return of ''Eileen'', and although MOBA donors later increased that reward to $36.73, the work remained unrecovered for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belanger|Moran|Sceurman|2008|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Police Department|Boston Police]] listed the crime as "larceny, other",&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt; and Sacco was reported saying she was unable to establish a link between the disappearance of ''Eileen'' and a notorious heist at Boston's famed [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] that occurred in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Chris.

[http://www.boston.com/news/specials/gardner_heist/heist/ "The Gardner Heist"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', March 13, 2005 &lt;!-- Retrieved on March 9, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006–10 years after ''Eileen'' was stolen—MOBA was contacted by the purported thief demanding a $5,000 ransom for the painting; no ransom was paid, but it was returned anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prompted by the theft of ''Eileen'', MOBA staff installed a fake video camera over a sign at their Dedham branch reading (in Comic Sans): "Warning. This gallery is protected by a fake security camera".&lt;ref name="swoger"&gt;Swoger, Kate. "Art Only a Mother Could Love: No Picture is Too Imperfect for Massachusetts Museum".

==Collection standards==
[[File:MOBAcamera.JPG|thumb|alt=Camera on a concrete block wall, over a sign reading "WARNING: These premises are protected by a fake security camera"|[[Fake security camera]] at the former Dedham branch of MOBA, photographed in 2009]]

Although the museum's motto is "Art too bad to be ignored", MOBA holds rigorous standards as to what they will accept. According to Marie Jackson, "Nine out of ten pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards."&lt;ref&gt;Swoger, Kate. "Bad Art Finds a Good Home at This Anti-Museum". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 26, 2000. K6&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the introduction to ''The Museum Of Bad Art: Masterworks'', the primary attribute of an ''[[Work of art|objet d'art]]'' to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should "[result] in a compelling image",&lt;ref name="saccox"&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an "Oh my God" quality.&lt;ref name="english" /&gt;

An important criterion for inclusion is that a painting or sculpture must not be boring. Michael Frank says they are not interested in commercial works like ''[[Dogs Playing Poker]]'': "We collect things made in earnest, where people attempted to make art and something went wrong, either in the execution or in the original premise."&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; Montserrat College of Art used MOBA's exhibition as a demonstration to its students that "sincerity is still important, and pureness of intent is valid".&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt;

MOBA accepts unsolicited works if they meet its standards. Frequently, curators consider works by artists who display an intensity or emotion in the art that they are unable to reconcile with their level of skill. The museum dedicated a show to "relentless creativity" in an exhibition titled "I Just Can't Stop" that was covered by local news and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/36.html The MOBA news: The Museum of Bad Art (MOBA) Newsletter, Issue #36 Excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123224026/http://museumofbadart.org/about/36.html |date=2009-01-23 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists are clearly technically proficient, but attempted an experiment that did not end well.&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; Michael Frank has compared  some of the works at MOBA with [[outsider art]] or art brut; some MOBA artists' works are also included in other galleries' outsider collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.walkerart.org/offcenter/2009/01/25/the-museum-of-bad-arts-michael-frank/ The Museum of Bad Art's Michael Frank] ''Off Center'' (2009). Accessed, March 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dean Nimmer, a professor at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]] (also holding the title of MOBA's Executive Director of Good Taste), noted the parallels between the Museum Of Bad Art's standards and those of other institutions: "They take the model of a museum of fine arts and apply the same kind of criteria to acceptance for bad work&amp;nbsp;... [Their rules] are very similar to a gallery or museum that says 'Well, our area is really installation art or realist paintings or neo-post-modern abstractions.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="goldberg"/&gt;

MOBA does not collect art created by children, or art traditionally perceived as lesser in quality, such as [[black velvet painting]]s, [[Paint by number|paint-by-numbers]], [[kitsch]], or factory-produced art—including works specifically created for tourists. Curators are also not interested in crafts such as [[Rug making#Hooking|latch hook rug]] kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|pp=x–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA curators suggest that more appropriate venues for such works would be the "Museum of Questionable Taste, The International Schlock Collection, or the National Treasury of Dubious Home Decoration".&lt;ref name="saccox"/&gt;

The Museum Of Bad Art has been accused of being anti-art, or taking works that were sincerely rendered and mocking them. However, Scott Wilson insists that a work of art accepted into MOBA is a celebration of the artist's enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="goldberg"/&gt; Marie Jackson reiterated this thought, saying "I think it's a great encouragement to people... who want to create [and] are held back by fear, and when they see these pieces, they realize there's nothing to be afraid of—just go for it."&lt;ref name="caro"&gt;Caro, Mark, "Not a Pretty Picture—Boston-Area Museum a Monument to the Absolute Worst in Art". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', May 20, 1997. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Louise Reilly Sacco agreed, stating, "If we're making fun of something, it's the art community, not the artists. But this is a real museum. It's 10 years. It's 6,000 people on a mailing list. It's recognition all over the world."&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;Cobb, Nathan. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/02/28/in_dedham_this_museum_is_exhibiting_bad_taste/ "In Dedham, This Museum is Exhibiting 'Bad" Taste"]. ''The Boston Globe'', February 28, 2004. C1&lt;/ref&gt; Curators insist that artists whose works are selected by MOBA enjoy the attention and that it is a [[Win-win game|win-win]]; the museum gains another work of art, and the artist receives exposure in a museum. A 1997 article in ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' stated that none of the 10 to 15 artists who had stepped forward to acknowledge their work in MOBA had been upset.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

Many of the works in MOBA are donated, often by the artists themselves. Others come from yard sales or [[thrift stores]]; the Trash Collectors Union in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] has donated works rescued from imminent demise. Occasionally a painting may be purchased; at one time MOBA's policy was not to spend more than $6.50 on any piece.&lt;ref name="irishtimes" /&gt; More recently, twice and even three times that amount has been paid for an exceptional work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belanger|Moran|Sceurman|2008|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those pieces not retained by the museum are included in a "Rejection Collection" that may be sold at auction. In the past, some proceeds went to the [[Salvation Army]] for providing so many of MOBA's pieces; the museum itself usually benefits from most auctions.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

==Collection highlights==
Each painting or sculpture MOBA exhibits is accompanied by a brief description of the medium, size, name of the artist, as well as how the piece was acquired, and an analysis of the work's possible intention or symbolism. ''[[Museums Journal]]'' noted that the discussion accompanying each work would most likely have most visitors reduced "to hysterics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lewis, Jamie |title=Museum of Bad Art, Boston |journal=[[Museums Journal]] |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=62 |date=May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The captions—described as "distinctly tongue-in-cheek commentaries" by David Mutch of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''&lt;ref name=Mutch/&gt;—were primarily written by Marie Jackson, until the "dissolution of the MOBA interpretative staff"; the task was then taken over by Michael Frank and Louise Reilly Sacco.&lt;ref name="saccoxiv"&gt;Frank and Sacco, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lucy in the Field with Flowers''===
Many of MOBA's works generate extensive discourse from visitors. ''Lucy in the Field with Flowers'' (oil on canvas by Unknown; acquired from trash in Boston) remains a favorite with the news media and patrons.  As the first work acquired by the museum, ''Lucy'' is "a painting so powerful it commands its own preservation for posterity", setting a standard by which all future acquisitions would be compared, and causing MOBA's founders to question if Scott Wilson found ''Lucy'' or she found him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Swoger of ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Montreal Gazette]]'' called ''Lucy'' a "gorgeous mistake", describing her thus: "an elderly woman dancing in a lush spring field, sagging breasts flopping willy-nilly, as she inexplicably seems to hold a red chair to her behind with one hand and a clutch of daisies in the other".&lt;ref name="swoger"/&gt; Author [[Cash Peters]], using less florid language, summarized it as "the old woman with an armchair glued to her ass".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOBA's statement about ''Lucy'' reads: "The motion, the chair, the sway of her breast, the subtle hues of the sky, the expression on her face—every detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait, every detail cries out 'masterpiece'."&lt;ref name="lucy"&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-1.php Portraiture #1 Lucy In the Field With Flowers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226052249/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-1.php |date=2009-02-26 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' recounted comments left by a museum visitor regarding the "endless layers of mysteries" the image offers: "What is [[Norman Mailer]]'s head doing on an innocent grandma's body, and are those crows or [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] skimming the hills?"&lt;ref name="Mailer"&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/whats_on/listings/article743688.ece "So Bad It's Good: The Arts Online".] ''[[The Times]]'', March 25, 2006. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lucy''{{'s}} granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, became a fan of MOBA after seeing the portrait in a newspaper.&lt;ref name="lucy" /&gt; She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted [[Coca-Cola]] from her nose in astonishment.&lt;ref name="stank2"&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure what happened to her arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from."&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

===''Sunday on the Pot with George''===

''Sunday on the Pot With George'' (acrylic on canvas by John Gedraitis; donated by Jim Schulman) has been deemed "iconic" by Bella English of ''The Boston Globe'', who assures the work is "100 percent guaranteed to make you burst out laughing".&lt;ref name="english07"/&gt; Wilson has pointed to ''George'' as an example of a technically well-executed piece of art using a subject not usually seen rendered in paint.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

Many admirers of the first work donated to MOBA are hypnotized by the image of a portly man wearing "Y-front" underwear while sitting on a chamber pot, in [[pointillist]] [[impressionism]] similar to the style of [[Georges Seurat]].  One critic speculates the pointillist style in ''George'' may have been acquired "from watching too much TV".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Citro|Foulds|2004|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to the [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', which contains a dramatic recreation of Seurat's painting ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]''. Author Amy Levin suggests that ''George'' is a pastiche of Seurat's painting.&lt;ref name="levin198"&gt;Levin, 198&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of this painting has been "tentatively identified" by the ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]''—the creators of the [[Ig Nobel]] award—as  [[John Ashcroft]], former [[United States Attorney General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The George / John Controversy| work = [[Annals of Improbable Research]]| url = http://improbable.com/projects/george/george-pot.html| accessdate = March 3, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091008202247/http://www.improbable.com/projects/george/george-pot.html| archivedate = October 8, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A visitor was so moved by ''George'' he felt compelled to express his gratitude for its display in the Dedham Community Theatre basement, writing "Someone had slipped into the bathroom as I took in this painting and began peeing loudly into a toilet. The reverberating sound of urine splashing while viewing ''George'' brought the painting to life, and when the denouement of the flush sounded, I wept."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA's accompanying caption introduces questions and observations: "Can the swirling steam melt away the huge weight of George's corporate responsibilities? This pointillist piece is curious for meticulous attention to fine detail, such as the stitching around the edge of the towel, in contrast to the almost careless disregard for the subject's feet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-2.html Portraiture #2 Sunday on the Pot With George] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226050142/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-2.html |date=2009-02-26 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt''===
In contrast to the pointillist impressionism of ''George'', the museum also features a "fine example of labor-intensive pointlessism",&lt;ref name="newman"/&gt; according to MOBA staff. Mari Newman's ''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt'' (tempera and acrylic paint on canvas; donated by the artist), inspired this description by MOBA: "We can only wonder what possesses an artist to portray a dog juggling bones while wearing a hula skirt."&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;"[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/recent06.php Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502115700/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/recent06.php |date=2009-05-02 }}". Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA enjoys the mystery as much as any other aspect of art, however.&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt;

Newman, a professional artist from Minneapolis, responded to the curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure how to use a canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a [[dachshund]], she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a [[grass skirt|hula skirt]] she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying "I almost threw it out until I heard of MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now I wish I had saved them all for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motifs and interpretations===
Travel writer Cash Peters identifies six characteristics common to many of the museum's artworks. The first is that MOBA artists are unable to render hands or feet, and mask them by extending figures' arms off the canvas, hiding them with long sleeves, or placing shoes on feet in inappropriate scenarios. Second, Peters compared artists [[Rembrandt]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]], masters of landscapes, who "could probably paint with their eyes shut" to MOBA artists who apparently did paint with their eyes shut, as skies are often painted in any color but blue, [[flora]] are created without reference to any existing plant organisms, and [[fauna]] appear so small in the background it is impossible to discern what kind of animals they are. Third, MOBA artists apply [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] inconsistently, either from one painting to the next, or within a single work.  Peters's fourth observation concerns the difficulty MOBA artists seem to have in successfully rendering noses: he writes that a nose will be attempted so many times that the work takes on a third dimension as paint is reapplied over and over. Fifth, bad artists favor "mixed media": if in doubt, they glue feathers, glitter, or hair to their work. Lastly, Peters suggests that artists know their work is bad, but apparently feel the piece may be saved by including a monkey or a poodle in the composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 2008, MOBA has been experimenting with allowing the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be "interpretated".&lt;ref name="saccoxiv"/&gt; The "Guest Interpretator's Collection" is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and these interpretations are added as each contest ends.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.museumofbadart.org/interpretations/ The Guest Interpretator's Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208065825/http://museumofbadart.org/interpretations/ |date=2009-02-08 }}". Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A professor at [[Boston University]] offered his thoughts: "The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests a commitment to the abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. I was also reminded that I need to pick up some toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!"&lt;ref name="english07"/&gt;

==Influence==
The Museum Of Bad Art has been mentioned in hundreds of international publications, as well as in Boston-area travel guides highlighting offbeat attractions.

[[Commedia Beauregard]], a theatre company whose mission focuses on translation, was inspired by MOBA's mission to create their Master Works series of short play festivals.  The company commissioned six playwrights to write short plays based on MOBA artworks. ''Master Works: The MOBA Plays'' was originally performed in January and February 2009 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. The plays were based on the MOBA pieces ''Mana Lisa'', ''Invasion of the Office Zombies'', ''My Left Foot'', ''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt'', ''Gina's Demons'', and ''Lulli, Fowl and Gravestone''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/article/2009/01/30/theater-master-works-blb-bad-art-good-plays.html&lt;/ref&gt;  After moving to [[Chicago]], the company again produced ''The MOBA Plays'' in March and April 2011, using three of the original plays and translating three new paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerstage.net/theatre/shows/10735.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314090442/http://centerstage.net/theatre/shows/10735.html |archivedate=2014-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to bad art===
[[File:MOBAfacade1.JPG|thumb|alt=Three buildings in a small New England square; in the center is a two-story theater with a marquee|The [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] Community Theater housed the first MOBA gallery in its basement.&lt;ref&gt;English, Bella.

Museum visitors can sign a guest book, and leave comments.  One Canadian visitor wrote:  "This collection is disturbing, yet I can't seem to look away...Just like a hideous car accident."  Another visitor warns: "Her nipples follow you around the room. Creepy!"&lt;ref name=Lowbrow /&gt;

Response to MOBA's opening and continued success is, for some, evocative of the way art is treated in society. MOBA works have been described as "unintentionally hilarious", similar to the atrocious films of [[Ed Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/1998/0917/art3.html "Exhibit Preview: The Museum of Bad Art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110249/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/1998/0917/art3.html |date=2008-07-20 }}. ''[[Fast Forward Weekly]]'', September 17, 1998 &lt;!--Retrieved on March 6, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often laugh out loud at displays. In ''Gullible's Travels'', Cash Peters  contrasted this behavior with what is expected of patrons at galleries such as [[Southern California]]'s [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty Museum]]; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco participated in a panel discussion with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in ''Architecture Boston''. She remarked that teachers bring high school art students to MOBA, then to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Sacco observes, "Somehow MOBA frees kids to laugh and point, to have their own opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly&amp;nbsp;... frees us."&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.architects.org/emplibrary/AB_May_June_2006_RoundTableB.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109002239/http://www.architects.org/emplibrary/AB_May_June_2006_RoundTableB.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2011|title=Pretty Ugly |author=Architecture Boston |date=May 2006 |pages=18–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and it forces people to think more deeply about what is wrong or misplaced. She connects this rigid judgment of what does not conform to beauty with intolerance for physical imperfections in people, noting that such rigidity sometimes causes parents to "fix" the perceived flaws in their children's faces to keep them from suffering later.&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt;

Jason Kaufman, a [[Harvard]] professor who teaches the sociology of culture, wrote that MOBA is part of a social trend he calls "annoyism", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum Of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, "The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. | title = So bad it's good | doi = 10.1525/ctx.2007.6.4.81 | journal = Contexts | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 81–84| year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art.&lt;ref name="levin198"/&gt; The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, "If I didn't have a sign on the door, people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?"&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;Lewis, Nicole. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-694807.html "For Badness' Sake"]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 8, 1998. D5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Solomon]], in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', asserted that MOBA's success reflects a trend in modern art among artists and audiences. The arrival of [[abstraction]] and [[modern art]] in the early 20th century made art appreciation more esoteric and less accessible for the general community, showing that "the American public ... think[s] of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre of experts whose taste and rituals [seem] as mysterious as those of Byzantine priests."&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; Bad art is in vogue, as a movement that rejects the anti-sentimentalism that marked earlier disdain for artists such as [[Norman Rockwell]] or [[Gustave Moreau]], according to Solomon.  Garen Daly, a MOBA fan on several Boston-area [[Arts council|art councils]], stated in 1995, "I go to a lot of openings, and sometimes they're pretty damn stuffy."&lt;ref name="hirsch"&gt;Hirsch, James "Gosh, That's Awful! It Would Look Great Hanging in a Museum—Painting Failures Are Displayed on Some Walls in Boston Dedication to 'Bad Art'." ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', July 12, 1995. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the Museum Of Bad Art offer different fare for the eyes, but instead of the wine and cheese that is provided for most museum and art gallery visitors, a MOBA show provides its patrons with [[Kool-Aid]], [[Fluffernutter]]s and [[cheese puffs]].&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt;

===Use in academic research===
The Museum Of Bad Art has been used in academic studies as a standard of reference for the spectacularly awful. In one such study, published in ''[[Perspectives on Psychological Science#Journals|Perspectives on Psychological Science]]'', researchers tested the consistency of responses between people asked to make "gut" judgments versus those who gave conscious well-reasoned responses regarding the quality of various pieces of art.  The researchers showed respondents images from MOBA and New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA), and asked them to rate each painting on a scale with two ends representing "Very Attractive" and "Very Unattractive". The study found that those who reasoned in conscious thought were neither more accurate nor as consistent in their ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = A. | last2 = Nordgren | first2 = L. F. | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2006.00007.x | title = A Theory of Unconscious Thought | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 95 | year = 2006 | pmid =  26151465| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Study participants identified and rated MoMA art higher quality, but those who used conscious reasoning did not find MoMA art more attractive than those who rated with "gut" judgments. Furthermore, the deliberators did not find MOBA art as unattractive as those with quicker response times. The study concluded that people who make quick judgments do so more consistently, with no significant change to accuracy.&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nordgren | first1 = L. F. | last2 = Dijksterhuis | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1086/596306 | title = The Devil is in the Deliberation: Thinking Too Much Reduces Preference Consistency | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 36 | pages = 39 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study that appeared in the ''[[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Psychology]]'', researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from [[ArtCyclopedia]] by artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]], and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''New Chronology''' is a [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical theory]] which argues that the conventional [[chronology]] of Middle Eastern and European history is fundamentally flawed, and that events attributed to the civilizations of the [[Roman Empire]], [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Egypt]] actually occurred during the [[Middle Ages]], more than a thousand years later. The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Nikolai Morozov]] (1854–1946),&lt;ref name="billington83"&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |pages=83 |quote=The radical revisionism of Nosovsky and Fomenko's ''New Chronology of Rus'' has its origins in the attempt by Nicholai Morozov to synthesize science and history during twenty-five years in prison}}&lt;/ref&gt; although work by French scholar [[Jean Hardouin]] (1646–1729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colavito|2004}} "Today an intellectual successor to Hardouin claims that it is not classical antiquity that was forged, but instead the history of the Middle Ages. Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko has devised a system he calls the 'New Chronology'..."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician [[Anatoly Fomenko]] (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians. The concept is most fully explained in ''History: Fiction or Science?'', originally published in [[Russian language|Russian]].

The New Chronology also contains ''a reconstruction'', an alternative chronology, radically shorter than the standard historical timeline, because all ancient history is "folded" onto the Middle Ages. According to Fomenko's claims, the [[recorded history|written history]] of humankind goes only as far back as [[Anno Domini|AD]] 800, there is almost no information about events between AD 800–1000, and most known historical events took place in AD 1000–1500.

The New Chronology is rejected by mainstream [[historian]]s and is inconsistent with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating]] techniques used in the wider [[academia|scholarly community]]. The majority of scientific commentators consider The New Chronology to be [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="prezRAS1999"&gt;[http://rc.nsu.ru/text/news/Physics/057.html Проблемы борьбы с лженаукой (обсуждение в Президиуме РАН)] — {{Interlanguage link multi|Вестник Российской академии наук|ru}} 1999, том&amp;nbsp;69, №&amp;nbsp;10, с.&amp;nbsp;879—904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prezRAS2003"&gt;[http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/JOURNAL/VRAN/2004/FALSCI.HTM Чем угрожает обществу лженаука?

Nosovskiy and Bulgarian mathematician Iordan Tabov who expanded the theory in regards to the Balkans, the theory is mostly discussed in reference to Fomenko's writings.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt;

==History of New Chronology==
The idea of chronologies that differ from the conventional chronology can be traced back to at least the early 17th century. [[Jean Hardouin]] then suggested that many ancient historical documents were much younger than commonly believed to be. In 1685 he published a version of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' in which he claimed that most Greek and Roman texts had been forged by [[Benedictine]] monks. When later questioned on these results, Hardouin stated that he would reveal the monks' reasons in a letter to be revealed only after his death. The executors of his estate were unable to find such a document among his posthumous papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diacu | first = Florin

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], examining the current chronology of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Ancient Near East]], expressed discontent with prevailing theories and in ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' proposed one of his own, which, basing its study on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]'s ''[[Argonautica]]'', changed the traditional dating of the Argonautic Expedition, the [[Trojan War]], and the [[Founding of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1887, [[Edwin Johnson (historian)|Edwin Johnson]] expressed the opinion that [[early Christianity|early Christian history]] was largely invented or corrupted in the 2nd and 3rd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | last = Johnson | first = Edwin | authorlink = Edwin Johnson (historian) | title = Antiqua Mater | chapter = Preface | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911155951/http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf | archivedate = 2006-09-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 [[Otto Rank]] made note of duplications in literary history of a variety of cultures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;almost all important civilized peoples have early woven myths around and glorified in poetry their heroes, mythical kings and princes, founders of religions, of dynasties, empires and cities—in short, their national heroes. Especially the history of their birth and of their early years is furnished with phantastic traits; the amazing similarity, nay literal identity, of those tales, even if they refer to different, completely independent peoples, sometimes geographically far removed from one another, is well known and has struck many an investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rank | first = Otto | authorlink = Otto Rank
 | title = Der Mythos von der Geburt des Helden | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fomenko became interested in Morozov's theories in 1973. In 1980, together with a few colleagues from the mathematics department of [[Moscow State University]], he published several articles on "new mathematical methods in history" in peer-reviewed journals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The articles stirred a lot of controversy, but ultimately Fomenko failed to win any respected historians to his side. By the early 1990s, Fomenko shifted his focus from trying to convince the scientific community via peer-reviewed publications to publishing books. Beam writes that Fomenko and his colleagues were discovered by the Soviet scientific press in the early 1980s, leading to "a brief period of renown"; a contemporary review from the Soviet journal ''Questions of History'' complained, "Their constructions have nothing in common with Marxist historical science."&lt;ref name="beam"&gt;{{cite news|title=A shorter history of civilization|last=Beam|first=Alex|date=1991-09-16|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996 his theory had grown to cover Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Nosovsky G. V., Fomenko A. T., "Empire. Russia, Turkey, China, Europe, Egypt. New mathematical chronology of ancient times / Носовский Г. В., Фоменко А. Т. Империя. Русь, Турция, Китай, Европа, Египет. Новая математическая хронология древности." (in Russian), 1996, with at least 6 later editions — М.: Факториал, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fomenko's claims==
{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}
Central to Fomenko's New Chronology is his claim of the existence of a vast Slav-Turk empire, which he called the "Russian Horde", which he says played the dominant role in Eurasian history before the 17th century. The various peoples identified in ancient and medieval history, from the [[Scythians]], [[Huns]], [[Goths]] and [[Bulgars]], through the [[Polans (eastern)|Polyane]], [[Dulebes|Duleby]], [[Drevlyans|Drevliane]], [[Pechenegs]], to in more recent times, the [[Cossacks]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Belarusians]], are nothing but elements of the single Russian Horde. For the New Chronologists, peoples such as the Ukrainians, Belarusians, [[Mongols#Russia|Mongols]], and others who assert their national independence from Russia, are suffering from a historical delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) pp. 5, 8, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko claims that the most probable prototype of the historical Jesus was [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] (allegedly AD 1152 to 1185), the emperor of Byzantium, known for his failed reforms; his traits and deeds reflected in 'biographies' of many real and imaginary persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.
 | script-title=ru:Царь Славян | language = Russian
 | publisher = СПб.: Нева | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical [[Jesus]] is a composite figure and reflection of the Old-Testament prophet [[Elisha]] (850–800 BC?), [[Pope Gregory VII]] (1020?–1085), Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]] (330–379), and even [[Li Yuanhao]] (also known as Emperor Jingzong or "Son of Heaven" - emperor of [[Western Xia]], who reigned in 1032–48), Euclides, Bacchus and Dionysius. Fomenko explains the seemingly vast differences in the biographies of these figures as resulting from difference in languages, points of view and time-frame of the authors of said accounts and biographies. He claims that the historical Jesus may have been born in 1152 and was crucified around AD 1185 on the [[Joshua's Hill]], overlooking the [[Bosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = А.Т.Фоменко | author2 = Г.В.Носовский | title = Датировка Рождества Христова серединой XII века | language = Russian | url = http://chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | format = download | accessdate = 2008-04-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080413014454/http://www.chronologia.org/car/04cs1.html | archivedate = 2008-04-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also merges the cities and histories of Jerusalem, Rome and Troy into "New Rome" = Gospel [[Jerusalem]] (in the 12th and 13th centuries) = [[Troy]] = [[Yoros Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Фоменко А.Т. |author2=Носовский Г.В.

 | publisher = М.: Астрель, АСТ | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of [[Yoros Castle]] is [[Joshua's Hill]] which Fomenko alleges is the hill [[Calvary]] depicted in the Bible.

Fomenko claims the [[Hagia Sophia]] is actually the biblical [[Temple of Solomon]]. He identifies Solomon as sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1494–1566).

On the other hand, according to Fomenko the word "Rome" is a placeholder and can signify any one of several different cities and kingdoms. He claims the "First Rome" or "Ancient Rome" or "Mizraim" is an ancient Egyptian kingdom in the delta of the [[Nile]] with its capital in [[Alexandria]]. The second and most famous "New Rome" is Constantinople. The third "Rome" is constituted by three different cities: Constantinople (again), Rome in Italy, and Moscow. According to his claims, Rome in Italy was founded around AD 1380 by [[Aeneas]] and Moscow as the third Rome was the capital of the great "Russian Horde".&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7 .&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Specific claims===
{{cleanup list|date=May 2015}}
In volumes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of ''History: Fiction or Science?'', Fomenko and his colleagues make numerous claims:
* Historians and translators often "assign" different dates and locations to different accounts of the same historical events, creating multiple "phantom copies" of these events. These "phantom copies" are often misdated by centuries or even millennia and end up incorporated into conventional chronology.
* This chronology was largely manufactured by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] in ''Opus Novum de emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurum temporum'' (1606), and represents a vast array of dates produced without any justification whatsoever, containing the repeating sequences of dates with shifts equal to multiples of the major cabbalistic numbers 333 and 360. The [[Jesuit]] [[Denis Pétau|Dionysius Petavius]] completed this chronology in ''De Doctrina Temporum'', 1627 (v.1) and 1632 (v.2).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One might wonder why we should want to revise the chronology of ancient history today and base our revision on new empirical-statistical methods. It would be worthwhile to remind the reader that in the XVI-XVII century chronology was considered to be a subdivision of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chronology | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* 37 complete Egyptian [[horoscope]]s found in Denderah, Esna, and other temples have unique valid astronomical solutions with dates ranging from AD 1000 and up to as late as AD 1700. &lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Egyptian astronomical symbols once applied to horoscopes from temples allows for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is sufficient for unique dating. There are symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation and the symbols do not change from one temple horoscope to another. The horoscopes from temples contain data about eclipses visible in Egypt allowing their exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = Astronomy Vs History | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The [[Book of Revelation]], as we know it, contains a horoscope, dated to 25 September - 10 October 1486, compiled by cabbalist [[Johannes Reuchlin]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As we have already noted, the inability of the latter day commentators to comprehend the astronomical symbolism of the Apocalypse is directly resulting from the loss of knowledge about the correct chronology and the distortions introduced by historians of the XVI-XVIII century. Another possibility is that there was an unspoken general taboo on what concerned a subject quite as dangerous, which resulted in the misdating of the Apocalypse. One way or another, the understanding of the astronomical descriptions that the Apocalypse contains got lost at some point. The Apocalypse had lost its distinctive astronomical hue in the eyes of the readers. However, its “astronomical component” is not simply exceptionally important – it alone suffices for the dating of the book itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Apocalypse as seen by Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The horoscopes found in Sumerian/Babylonian tablets do not contain sufficient astronomical data; consequently, they have solutions every 30–50 years on the time axis and are therefore useless for purposes of dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The vocabulary of Babylonian astronomical symbols once applied to clay tablets don't allow for extraction of unique dates of eclipses. Astronomical data therein contained is not sufficient for unique dating. Either there not enough symbols allowing for astronomical interpretation or  the symbols change from one clay tablet to another. The clay tablets contain data about eclipses visible in Babylon  that could have taken place  every 30-40 years, therefore don’t allow there exact pinpointing on the time axis.&lt;ref name="Fomenko"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
* The Chinese tables of eclipses are useless for dating, as they contain too many eclipses that did not take place astronomically. Chinese tables of comets, even if true, cannot be used for dating.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chinese eclipse observations can neither confirm nor refute any chronology of China at all, be it veracious or erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = Anatoly| authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko | title = The Issue with Chinese Astronomy | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical correlation of texts===
One of Fomenko's simplest methods is statistical [[correlation]] of texts. His basic assumption is that a text which describes a sequence of events will devote more space to more important events (for example, a period of [[war]] or an [[unrest]] will have much more space devoted to than a period of [[peace]]ful, non-eventful years), and that this irregularity will remain visible in other descriptions of the period. For each analysed text, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is devised which maps each year mentioned in the text with the number of pages (lines, letters) devoted in the text to its description (which could be zero). The function of the two texts are then compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = History: Fiction or Science? Chronology 1

For example, Fomenko compares the contemporary history of Rome written by [[Titus Livius]] with a modern history of Rome written by [[Russia]]n [[historian]] [[Vladimir Sergeevich Sergeev|V. S. Sergeev]], calculating that the two have high [[correlation]], and thus that they describe the same period of history, which is undisputed.&lt;ref name=F2&gt;{{cite book

===Statistical correlation of dynasties===
[[Image:Fomenko - Roman Empire parallelism.jpg|thumb|Sample Fomenko parallelism]]
In a somewhat similar manner, Fomenko compares two [[dynasty|dynasties]] of rulers using statistical methods. First, he creates a [[database]] of rulers, containing relevant information on each of them. Then, he creates "survey codes" for each pair of the rulers, which contain a number which describes degree of the match of each considered property of two rulers. For example, one of the properties is the way of death: if two rulers were both poisoned, they get value of +1 in their property of the way of death; if one ruler was poisoned and another killed in combat, they get -1; and if one was poisoned, and another died of illness, they get 0 (Fomenko claims there is possibility that chroniclers were not impartial and that different descriptions nonetheless describe the same person). An important property is the length of the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | accessdate = 2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko lists a number of pairs of unrelated dynasties &amp;ndash; for example, dynasties of kings of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and emperors of late [[Western Roman Empire]] (AD 300-476) &amp;ndash; and claims that this method demonstrates correlations between their reigns. (Graphs which show just the length of the rule in the two dynasties are the most widely known; however, Fomenko's conclusions are also based on other parameters, as described above.) He also claims that the regnal history from the 17th to 20th centuries never shows correlation of "dynastic flows" with each other, therefore Fomenko insists history was multiplied and outstretched into imaginary antiquity to justify this or other "royal" pretensions.

Fomenko uses for the demonstration of correlation between the reigns exclusively the data from the ''Chronological Tables'' of J. Blair (Moscow 1808–09). Fomenko says that Blair’s tables are all the more valuable to us since they were compiled in an epoch adjacent to the time of Scaligerian chronology. According to Fomenko these tables contain clearer signs of “Scaligerite activity” which were subsequently buried under layers of paint and plaster by historians of the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Astronomical evidence===
Fomenko examines astronomical events described in ancient texts and claims that the chronology is actually [[medieval]]. For example:

* He says the mysterious drop in the value of the lunar acceleration parameter D" ("a linear combination of the [angular] accelerations of the Earth and Moon"&lt;ref name="Newton72"&gt;[[Robert Russell Newton|R.R. Newton]], [http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/atext/newton1.htm "Astronomical Evidence Concerning Non-Gravitational Forces in the Earth–Moon System"]. ''[[Astrophysics and Space Science]]'' vol. 16 (1972), pp. 179–200.&lt;/ref&gt;) between the years AD 700–1300, which the American astronomer [[Robert Russell Newton|Robert Newton]] had explained in terms of "non-gravitational" (i.e., tidal) forces.&lt;ref name="Newton72"/&gt; By eliminating those anomalous early eclipses the New Chronology produces a constant value of D" beginning around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Anatoly T. Fomenko, ''History: Fiction or Science'' vol.I, Chronology, 2nd. ed. (Paris, London, New York: Delamere Publishing, 2006), pp.93-94, 105-6. Newton's analysis has since been criticized as suffering "from two fundamental defects. The two parameters he sought to determine were highly correlated; and he also adopted a somewhat arbitrary weighting scheme in analysing suspected observations of total solar eclipses. Many of the observations he investigated were of doubtful reliability. Hence, despite the low weight he assigned them, they had a disproportionate effect on his solutions." F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.23-2.24.&lt;/ref&gt;
* He associates initially the [[Star of Bethlehem]] with the AD 1140 (±20) [[supernova]] (now [[Crab Nebula]]) and the [[Chronology of Jesus|Crucifixion Eclipse]] with the total [[solar eclipse]] of AD 1170 (±20). He also believes that [[Crab Nebula]] [[supernova]] could not have been seen in AD 1054, but probably in AD 1153. He connects it with total eclipse of AD 1186. Moreover he holds in strong doubt the veracity of ancient Chinese astronomical data.
* He argues that the [[star catalog]] in the ''Almagest'', ascribed to the Hellenistic astronomer [[Claudius Ptolemy]], was compiled in the 15th to 16th centuries AD. With this objective in sight he develops new methods of dating old stellar catalogues and claims that the ''Almagest'' is based on data collected between AD 600 and 1300, whereby the telluric obliquity{{clarify|date=June 2013}} is well taken into account.
* He refines and completes [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov|Morozov's]] analysis of some ancient [[horoscopes]], most notably, the so-called [[Dendera Temple complex|Dendera Zodiacs]]—two horoscopes drawn on the ceiling of the [[Hathor temple|temple of Hathor]]—and comes to the conclusion that they correspond to either the 11th or the 13th century AD. Moreover, in his ''History: Fiction or Science'' series finale, he makes computer-aided dating of all 37 Egyptian horoscopes that contain sufficient astronomical data, and claims they all fit into 11th to 19th century timeframe.{{clarify|date=June 2013}} Traditional history usually either interprets these horoscopes as belonging to the 1st century BC or suggests that they weren't meant to match any date at all.
* In his final analysis of an eclipse triad described by the ancient Greek [[Thucydides]] in ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', Fomenko dates the eclipses to AD 1039, 1046 and 1057. Because of the layered structure of the manuscript, he claims that Thucydides actually lived in medieval times and in describing the [[Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Athens|Athenians]] he was actually describing the conflict between the medieval [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrans]] and [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]] in Spain from AD 1374 to 1387.
* Fomenko claims that the abundance of dated astronomical records in cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia is of little use for dating of events, as the astronomical phenomena they describe recur cyclically every 30–40 years.

=== Rejection of common dating methods ===

On archaeological dating methods, Fomenko claims:

{{quote|Archaeological, dendrochronological, paleographical and carbon methods of dating of ancient sources and artifacts are both non-exact and contradictory, therefore there is not a single piece of firm written evidence or artifact that could be reliably and independently dated earlier than the XI century|Anatoly Fomenko|''History: Fiction or Science? (Chronology 1) [Second edition]''}}

[[Dendrochronology]] is rejected with a claim that, for dating of objects much older than the oldest still living trees, it isn't an absolute, but a [[relative dating]] method, and thus dependent on traditional chronology. Fomenko specifically points to a break of dendrochronological scales around AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 | accessdate = 2006-09-09| language = Russian
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko also cites a number of cases where [[carbon dating]] of a series of objects of known age gave significantly different dates. He also alleges undue cooperation between physicists and archaeologists in obtaining the dates, since most radiocarbon dating labs only accept samples with an age estimate suggested by historians or archaeologists. Fomenko also claims that carbon dating over the range of AD 1 to 2000 is inaccurate because it has too many sources of error that are either guessed at or completely ignored, and that calibration is done with a statistically meaningless number of samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Fomenko | first = A.T. | authorlink = Anatoly Fomenko

 | accessdate = 2006-09-09 | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, Fomenko concludes that carbon dating is not accurate enough to be used on historical scale.

Fomenko rejects [[numismatics|numismatic]] dating as circular, being based on the traditional chronology, and points to cases of similar coins being minted in distant periods, unexplained long periods with no coins minted and cases of mismatch of numismatic dating with historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reception==
Fomenko's historical ideas have been universally rejected by mainstream scholars, who brand them as [[pseudoscience]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitaly L. Ginzburg]], [http://humanism.al.ru/en/articles.phtml?num=000051 ''Pseudoscience and the Need to Combat It'']. Ginzburg is a [[Nobel laureate]] and a member of the Commission to Combat Pseudoscience and the Falsification of Scientific Research of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;/ref&gt; but were popularized by former world chess champion [[Garry Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new-tradition.org/view-garry-kasparov.htm Mathematics of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newc.narod.ru/article/nx/ksprv.htm Некоторые выступления Г. Каспарова по проблеме «Новой Хронологии»]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Edward [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/newchronology.html "Garry Kasparov and New Chronology"] ''Chess Notes''&lt;/ref&gt; Billington writes that the theory "might have quietly blown away in the wind tunnels of academia" if not for Kasparov's writing in support of it in the magazine ''[[Ogoniok]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Billington |first=James H. |title=Russia in Search of Itself |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2004 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasparov met Fomenko during the 1990s, and found that Fomenko's conclusions concerning certain subjects were identical to his own regarding the popular view (which is not the view of academics) that [[Dark Ages (historiography)#Modern popular use|art and culture died during the Dark Ages]] and were not revived until the Renaissance. Kasparov also felt it illogical that the Romans and the Greeks living under the banner of [[Byzantium]] could fail to use the mounds of scientific knowledge left them by Ancient Greece and Rome, especially when it was of urgent military use. However, Kasparov does not support the reconstruction part of the New Chronology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=44FE98F9E4576 "Answers of Kasparov"] (in Russian). Kasparov.ru ([[gazeta.ru]]). September 6, 2006. Retrieved 2009-12-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian critics tended to see Fomenko's New Chronology as "an embarrassment and a potent symbol of the depths to which the Russian academy and society have generally sunk ... since the fall of Communism".&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Western critics see his views as part of a renewed Russian imperial ideology, "keeping alive an imperial consciousness and secular messianism in Russia".&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dmitrii Sidorov, "Post-Imperial Third Romes: Resurrections of a Russian Orthodox Geopolitical Metaphor", ''Geopolitics'', 11 (2006):317–347, at pp. 336-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 at the Moscow International Book Fair, Anatoly Fomenko with his coauthor [[Gleb Vladimirovich Nosovsky|Gleb Nosovsky]] were awarded for their books on "New Chronology" the anti-prize called [[:ru:Антипремия «Абзац»|"Abzatz"]] (literally 'paragraph', a Russian slang word meaning 'disaster' or 'fiasco') in the category "Pochotnaya bezgramota" (the term is a pun upon "Pochotnaya gramota" ([[Russian Federation Presidential Certificate of Honour|Certificate of Honor]]) and may be translated either "Certificate of Dishonor" or literally, "Respectable Illiteracy" ) for the worst book published in Russia.

Critics have accused Fomenko of altering the data to improve the fit with his ideas and have noted that he [[Confirmation bias|violates a key rule of statistics]] by selecting matches from the historical record which support his chronology, while ignoring those which do not, creating artificial, better-than-chance correlations, and that these practices undermine Fomenko's statistical arguments.&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt; The new chronology was given a comprehensive critical analysis in a round table on "The 'Myths' of New Chronology" chaired by the dean of the department of history of [[Moscow State University]] in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;V.L.

Fomenko).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the participants in that round table, the distinguished Russian archaeologist, [[Valentin Yanin]], compared Fomenko's work to "the sleight of hand trickery of a [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]], [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/janin.htm "Зияющие высоты" академика Фоменко] (The "Gaping Heights" of Academician Fomenko); passage translated in James H. Billington, ''Russia in Search of Itself'', (Washington: Woodrow Wilson Center Press / Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 2004, pp. 83-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist [[Andrey Zaliznyak]] argued that by using the Fomenko's approaches one can "prove" any historical correspondence, for example, between Ancient Egyptian pharaohs and French kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2011/12/02_a_3855010.shtml|script-title=ru:«Фоменко — жертва фанатизма»|last=Малянов|first=Дмитрий|date=2 December 2011|publisher=[[Gazeta.ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/fomenko/zaliznk.htm|script-title=ru:Лингвистика по А.

[[James H. Billington|James Billington]], formerly professor of Russian history at [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Librarian of Congress]] from 1987-2015 placed Fomenko's work within the context of the political movement of [[Eurasianism]], which sought to tie Russian history closely to that of its Asian neighbors. Billington describes Fomenko as ascribing the belief in past hostility between Russia and the Mongols to the influence of Western historians. Thus, by Fomenko's chronology, "Russia and Turkey are parts of a previously single empire."&lt;ref name="James H. Billington 2004, pp. 82-4"/&gt; A French reviewer of Billington's book noted approvingly his concern with the phantasmagorical conceptions of Fomenko about the global "new chronology".&lt;ref name="monderusse.revues.org" /&gt;

H.G. van Bueren, professor emeritus of astronomy at the [[University of Utrecht]], concluded his scathing review of Fomenko's work on the application of mathematics and astronomy to historical data as follows:
{{quote|text=It is surprising, to say the least, that a well-known (Dutch) publisher could produce an expensive book of such doubtful intellectual value, of which the only good word that can be said is that it contains an enormous amount of factual historical material, untidily ordered, true; badly written, yes; mixed-up with conjectural nonsense, sure; but still, much useful stuff. For the rest of the book is absolutely worthless. It reminds one of the early Soviet attempts to produce [[Pathological science|tendentious science]] ([[Lysenkoism|Lysenko]]!), of [[polywater]], of [[cold fusion]], and of modern [[creationism]]. In brief: a useless and misleading book.|sign=H.G. van Bueren|source="Mathematics and Logic"&lt;ref name="Bueren 1994"/&gt;}}

===Convergence of methods in archaeological dating===

While Fomenko rejects commonly accepted dating methods, archaeologists, conservators and other scientists make extensive use of such techniques which have been rigorously examined and refined during decades of use.&lt;ref&gt;See the international journal [http://www.radiocarbon.org/ ''Radiocarbon''] for examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific case of [[dendrochronology]], Fomenko claims that this fails as an absolute dating method because of gaps in the record. However, independent dendrochronological sequences beginning with living trees from various parts of [[North America]]&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Ferguson and D. A. Graybill, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume25/Number2/azu_radiocarbon_v25_n2_287_288_v.pdf "Dendrochronology of Bristlecone Pine: A Progress Report"], ''Radiocarbon'', 25 (1983): 287-288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minze Stuiver, [http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/index.php/objectviewer?o=http://radiocarbon.library.arizona.edu/Volume24/Number1/azu_radiocarbon_v24_n1_1_26_v.pdf "A High-Precision Calibration of the AD Radiocarbon Time Scale"], ''Radiocarbon'', 24 (1982): 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe&lt;ref&gt;M.

In fact, archaeologists have developed a ''fully anchored'' dendrochronology series going back past 10,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich M, Remmele S, Kromer B, Hofmann J, Spurk M, Kaiser KF, Orcel C, Küppers M (2004).

===Misuse of historical sources and forced pattern matching===

Critics of Fomenko's theory claim that his use of historical sources is highly selective and ignores the basic principles of sound historical scholarship.&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fomenko ... provides no fair-minded review of the historical literature about a topic with which he deals, quotes only those sources that serve his purposes, uses evidence in ways that seem strange to professionally-trained historians and asserts the wildest speculation as if it has the same status as the information common to the conventional historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sheiko (2004) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also note that his method of statistically correlating of texts is very rough, because it does not take into account the many possible sources of variation in length outside of "importance". They maintain that differences in language, style, and scope, as well as the frequently differing views and focuses of historians, which are manifested in a different notion of "important events", make quantifying historical writings a dubious proposition at best. What's more, Fomenko's critics allege that the parallelisms he reports are often derived by alleged forcing by Fomenko of the data &amp;ndash; rearranging, merging, and removing monarchs as needed to fit the pattern.

For example, on the one hand Fomenko asserts that the vast majority of ancient sources are either irreparably distorted duplicate accounts of the same events or later forgeries. In his identification of [[Jesus]] with [[Pope Gregory VII]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSvlaZYbcwUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;sig=2_vZeaAnuN5U6iITpdkuUK-eIlI#PPA51,M1 Book 2, Chapter 2, pg 51]&lt;/ref&gt; he ignores the otherwise vast dissimilarities between their reported lives and focuses on the similarity of their appointment to religious office by baptism. (The evangelical Jesus is traditionally believed to have lived for 33 years, and he was an adult at the time of his encounter with [[John the Baptist]]. In contrast, according to the available primary sources, Pope Gregory VII lived for at least 60 years and was born 8 years after the death of Fomenko's John-the-Baptist equivalent [[John Crescentius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06791c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope St. Gregory VII]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Critics allege that many of the supposed correlations of regnal durations are the product of the selective parsing and blending of the dates, events, and individuals mentioned in the original text.{{sfn|Colavito|2004}} Another point raised by critics is that Fomenko does not explain his altering the data (changing the order of rulers, dropping rulers, combining rulers, treating interregna as rulers, switching between theologians and emperors, etc.) preventing a duplication of the effort and effectively making this whole theory an [[ad hoc hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="pedersen2002"/&gt;

===Selectivity in reference to astronomical phenomena===

Critics point out that Fomenko's discussion of astronomical phenomena tends to be selective, choosing isolated examples that support the New Chronology and ignoring the large bodies of data that provide statistically supported evidence for the conventional dating. For his dating of the Almagest star catalog, Fomenko arbitrarily selected eight stars from the more than 1000 stars in the catalog, one of which (Arcturus) has a large systematic error. This star has a dominant effect on Fomenko's dating.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. N. Efremov, [http://www.hist.msu.ru/Science/DISKUS/FOMENKO/efremov.htm Астрономия и синдром “новой хронологии”] (Astronomy and the Syndrome of "New Chronology").&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical analysis using the same method for all "fast" stars points to the antiquity of the Almagest star catalog.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Dambis and Yu. N. Efremov, "Dating Ptolemy's Star Catalogue through Proper Motions: The Hipparchan Epoch", [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000JHA....31..115D ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 31 (2000): 115-134;] see especially note 17 (p. 134).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Gorodetsky, [http://www.newchrono.net/fomenko/starwars.htm Звездные войны с историей (верификация датировки Альмагеста)] (Starry wars with history (Verification of the dating of the Almagest)).&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlins points out further that Fomenko's statistical analysis got the wrong date for the ''Almagest'' because he took as constant Earth's [[axial tilt|obliquity]] when it is a variable that changes at a very slow, but known, rate.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Rawlins, "Recovering Hipparchos’ Last Lost Lustrous Star", [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w43.pdf ''DIO'' 4.3 (1994): 119]. Like Dambis and Efremov, Rawlins provides evidence that the Almagest star catalog was based on observations made in the 2nd century BCE by [[Hipparchus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fomenko's studies ignore the abundance of dated astronomical records in [[cuneiform]] texts from [[Mesopotamia]]. Among these texts is a series of [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]], which records precise astronomical observations of the Moon and planets, often dated in terms of the reigns of known historical figures extending back to the 6th century BCE. Astronomical retrocalculations for all these moving objects allow us to date these observations, and consequently the rulers' reigns, to within a single day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe]], ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy,'' (New York: Springer, 2001) pp. 39-40 {{ISBN|0-387-95136-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The observations are sufficiently redundant that only a small portion of them are sufficient to date a text to a unique year in the period 750 BCE to 100 CE. The dates obtained agree with the accepted chronology.&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Stephenson and J. M. Steele, "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69. This study showed that either the description of the phenomena observed at the solar eclipse or of a set of conjunctions of the slow planets [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Mars]] were sufficient to equate [[Seleucid era|S.E.]] 175 with 137/6 BCE. Additional details in these texts provided further confirmation of this dating.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, F. R. Stephenson has demonstrated through a systematic study of a large number of [[Babylonia]]n, Ancient and Medieval European, and [[China|Chinese]] records of eclipse observations that they can be dated consistently with conventional chronology at least as far back as 600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;F. Richard Stephenson, "Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation", [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/action/showPdf?submitPDF=Full+Text+PDF+%28243+KB%29&amp;doi=10.1046%2Fj.1468-4004.2003.44222.x ''Astronomy &amp; Geophysics''], 44 (2003): 2.22-2.27.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Fomenko's missing centuries, Stephenson's studies of eclipse observations find an accumulated uncertainty in the timing of the rotation of the earth of 420 seconds at 400 BCE, and only 80 seconds at 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html Eclipse Predictions and Earth's Rotation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716020131/sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEhelp/rotation.html |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnitude and consistency of conspiracy theory===
Fomenko states that world history prior to 1600 was deliberately falsified for political reasons. The consequences of this conspiracy theory are twofold. Documents that conflict with New Chronology are said to have been edited or fabricated by conspirators; the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire and pro-German [[House of Romanov|Romanov dynasty]].&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; New Chronology taps traditionally Russian anti-Western thoughts and ideas of Germany as a chief enemy. Further, the theory is Russocentric diminishing achievements of other cultures and claiming major civilization accomplishments as Russian and by proposing a giant "Russian Horde" empire and eliminating historical time before its existence.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; The theory also claimed to undermine nationalism in countries neighboring Russia by positioning divisions and conflicts as fabricated.&lt;ref name=Laruelle/&gt; Unlike other popular conspiracy theories New Chronology is not [[anti-semitic]] ''per se'', but it contains claims that may be unwelcome by Jewish communities like that the [[Old Testament]] is newer than the [[New Testament]], placing Jerusalem in [[Constantinople]] and projecting stereotypes of [[Jew]]s by proposing that Jews originate from bankers in the Russian Horde that adopted the religion of Judaism, itself a derivative of Christianity and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|not the other way round]].&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; 

The theory provides an alternate history account of the "true" history centered around a world empire called the "Russian Horde".&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt; The scope of the New Chronology has been compared to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011&gt;{{cite journal |last= Halperin |first= Charles J. |year= 2011 |title= False Identity and Multiple Identities in Russian History: The Mongol Empire and Ivan the Terrible |url= http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/160 |journal= The Carl Beck Papers |publisher= The Center for Russian and East European Studies|volume= |number= 2103 |pages= 1–71|doi= 10.5195/cbp.2011.160|access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of pages has been written about it and authors address a wide range of objections.&lt;ref name=Halperin2011/&gt;

===Popularity in forums and amongst Russian imperialists===

Fomenko has published and sold over one million copies of his books in his native [[Russia]]. Many [[Internet forum]]s have appeared which aim to supplement his work with additional amateur research.&lt;ref&gt;Melleuish et al. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His critics have suggested that Fomenko's version of history appealed to the Russian reading public by keeping alive an imperial consciousness to replace their disillusionment with the failures of Communism and [[Russian oligarchs|post-Communist corporate oligarchies]].&lt;ref name="Sheiko 2004 p. 13"/&gt;

The '''North Atlantic or liberal model of media and politics''', as defined in Daniel C. Hallin and Paolo Mancini's ''[[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics]]'', is characterized by an early development of commercial press, information-oriented journalism, strong professionalization, and a market dominated [[Mass media|media]] system.

==Newspaper industry==
The newspaper industry within the liberal model is characterized by [[newspaper]] circulation and the early development of mass-circulation commercial press. The first instances of newspapers appearing in the west is during the 17th century in Europe with the first instance of what we would call a newspaper appearing in Germany. This paper was called the ''Strasbourg Relation''.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Johannes (2006), "Strassburg, 1605: The Origins of the Newspaper in Europe",&lt;/ref&gt; Although western civilization was not the first to invent the [[printing press]], it had a very early development of the media format that came from it known a "press". With the expansion of technology, commercial media quickly expanded to encompass many forms. It evolved from standard newspapers and became a part of radio, music, television, movies, and the Internet, as well as many other forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;"Mass Media". Retrieved November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parallelism===
[[Jonathan Hardy]] believes that [[political parallelism]], “refers to the character of links between political actors and the media and more generally the extent to which media reflects [[political divisions]].”{{sfn|Hardy|2008|p=18}} In their book, ''Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics'', Daniel C. Hallin and Paola Mancini use this term to evaluate the link between [[political parties]] and media organizations.  In the North Atlantic or liberal model, Hallin and Mancini, give a description of political parallelism in the United States, British, Irish, and Canadian media systems.  According to Hallin and Mancini the United States contains the most unbiased political parallelism compared to the previous four countries.  Hallin and Mancini express how press political partisan is virtually absent in the North Atlantic or liberal model, with the exception of Britain which poses strong press parallelism.  Hallin and Mancini insist that in the North Atlantic or liberal model there is a balance within the contents of the media in order to create neutrality within the media system.   However, Hetty van Kempen believes it is still likely that press-party parallelism will still vary within the countries of the same model.  Kempen reflects on the idea of Seymour-Ure.  Ure states, “The same social forces that find expression in a party or parties of a [[political system]] tend to find expression also through the press.”  Ure’s view illustrates that this is the reason why there is a weak political parallelism in the US and Canada.  Hallin and Mancini consider that typically in a [[multiparty system]] the press seems to coincide with strong partisanship of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Kempen, Hetty van. "Media-Party Parallelism And Its Effects: A Cross-National Comparative Study." Political Communication 24.3 (2007): 303-320. Social Sciences Full Text (H.W. Wilson).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professionalization===
According to Hallin and Mancini, the [[professionalization]] of journalism was strongly developed in the liberal countries.  The authors refer to the development of journalistic practices, which is projected in the quality of political coverage. However, later the authors continue to illustrate how many contradictions emerge in the nature and the importance of context in professionalization of journalism within the liberal systems.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, D. C.; Mancini, P (2004), Comparing media systems: Three models of media and politics, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas E. Patterson believes Hallin and Mancini’s discussion of the impact of journalism, and the influence the craft has on political influence is correct and unchallenged in the scholarly literature.  Patterson explains that a tight clutch by the media to the state, as well as political institutions, creates professionalism.  Patterson elaborates how a liberal culture will create an environment of journalistic [[autonomy]], which in turn creates professionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Patterson (2007) Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, by Daniel C. Hallin and Paolo Mancini, Political Communication, 24:3, 329-331, DOI: 10.1080/10584600701471708&lt;/ref&gt;  Katrin Voltmer agrees that professionalization prevents dependency from outside perspective and influence to impose certain rules or norms on journalists.  However, Voltmer also explains the difficulties within the classifications of professional journalistic performance. Voltmer enlightens the challenge of trying to bridge the gap between theory and practice of professionalization.  Which Voltmer later elaborates how new and old norms, as well as new standards, of journalistic quality are finding it difficult to co-exist in finding their roles in the new democratic order.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer, Katrin. "Comparing media systems in new democracies: East meets South meets West." Central European Journal of Communication 01 (2008): 23-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the state in media system===
Media in western countries is highly market driven, this is due to the rise of [[consumerism]] thought to be mainly caused by the rise of the middle class during the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, Thorstein (1899): The Theory of the Leisure Class: an economic study of institutions, Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 1994,&lt;/ref&gt; The exception to this is strong [[public broadcasting]] in Britain and Ireland, which was, in most cases, the most common, or only, form of broadcasting. Since then, however, [[commercial broadcasting]] dominates most European countries. Government still plays a role in commercial broadcasting however. For instance newspaper subsidies go back to the 1970s and now exist in Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Public broadcasters, even in Europe, often face pressure from commercial broadcasting to compete by trying to appeal to larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Usher, Nikki. "Funding public media: How the US compares to the rest of the world" (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-''co''-3-hydroxyvalerate)''', commonly known as '''PHBV''', is a [[polyhydroxyalkanoate]]-type polymer. It is [[biodegradable]], [[nontoxic]], [[biocompatible]] plastic produced naturally by [[bacteria]] and a good alternative for many non-biodegradable [[synthetic polymers]]. It is a [[thermoplastic]] linear aliphatic [[polyester]].  It is obtained by the [[copolymerization]] of [[3-hydroxybutanoic acid]] and [[3-hydroxypentanoic acid]]. PHBV is used in speciality packaging, orthopedic devices and in controlled release of drugs. PHBV undergoes bacterial degradation in the environment.

== History ==
PHBV was first manufactured in 1983 by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI). It is commercialized under the trade name '''Biopol'''. ICI ([[Zeneca]]) sold it to [[Monsanto]] in 1996. This was then obtained by [[Metabolix]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="VasileZaikov2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cornelia Vasile|author2=Gennady Zaikov|title=Environmentally Degradable Materials Based on Multicomponent Polymeric Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LPkghmXr47YC&amp;pg=PA228|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=31 December 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16410-9|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rudnik2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewa Rudnik|title=Compostable Polymer Materials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrQwn8XzKlEC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=3 January 2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045371-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Biomer L''' is the trade name of PHBV from Biomer.

== Synthesis ==
PHBV is synthesized by bacteria as storage compounds under growth limiting conditions.&lt;ref name="Chiellini2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emo Chiellini|title=Biorelated Polymers: Sustainable Polymer Science and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=375oq7kjGOQC&amp;pg=PA147|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=31 October 2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46652-6|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be produced from glucose and [[propionate]] by the recombinant ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains.&lt;ref name="VasileZaikov2009" /&gt; Many other bacteria like ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' and ''[[Ralstonia eutropha]]'' are also capable of producing it.

It can also be synthesized from [[genetically engineered]] plants.&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Srikanth Pilla|title=Handbook of Bioplastics and Biocomposites Engineering Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMh827DUbGgC&amp;pg=PA373|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=20 July 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-62607-8|pages=373–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PHBV is a [[copolymer]] of [[3-hydroxybutanoic acid]] and [[3-hydroxypentanoic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Chemistry XII Part II | publisher=NCERT | pages=435 | url=http://ncert.nic.in/NCERTS/textbook/textbook.htm?lech2=6-7 | chapter=Polymers}}&lt;/ref&gt; PHBV may also be synthesized from [[butyrolactone]] and [[valerolactone]] in the presence of oligomeric [[aluminoxane]] as [[catalyst]].&lt;ref name="biodeg"/&gt;

== Structure ==
The monomers, 3-hydroxybutanoic acid and 3-hydroxypentanoic acid, are joined by [[ester bond]]s; the back bone of the polymer is made up of carbon and oxygen atoms.
The property of the PHBV depends upon the ratio of these two [[monomer]]s in it. 
3-hydroxybutanoic acid provides stiffness while 3-hydroxypentanoic acid promotes flexibility. Thus PHBV can be made to resemble either [[polypropylene]] or [[polyethylene]] by changing the ratio of monomers.&lt;ref name="Barbucci2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rolando Barbucci|title=Integrated Biomaterials Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfQKjggEMyUC&amp;pg=PA144|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=31 October 2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-46678-6|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increase in the ratio of 3-hydroxybutanoic acid to 3-hydroxypentanoic acid results in an increase in melting point, water [[permeation|permeability]], [[glass transition temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) and tensile strength. However impact resistance is reduced.&lt;ref name="Rudnik2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biodeg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.biodeg.net/bioplastic.html | title=Bioplastics - Biodegradable polyesters (PLA, PHA, PCL ...) | work=biodeg.net | accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
PHBV is a thermoplastic polymer. It is brittle, has low elongation at break and low impact resistance.&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"/&gt;

== Uses ==
PHBV find its applications in controlled release of drugs, medical implants and repairs, [[Luxury and specialty packaging|specialty packaging]], orthopedic devices and manufacturing bottles for consumer goods. It is also biodegradable which can be used as an alternative to non biodegradable plastics&lt;ref name="Kaplan1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kaplan|title=Biopolymers from Renewable Resources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mM73CrwADx0C&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=7 July 1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-63567-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degradation ==
When disposed, PHBV degrades into carbon dioxide and water. PHBV undergo bacterial degradation. PHBV, just like fats to human, is an energy source to microorganisms. Enzymes produced by them degrade it and are consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/89/3/839.full.pdf | title=Materials derived from biomass/biodegradable materials | accessdate=July 11, 2012 | author=William D. Luzier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PHBV has a low [[thermal stability]] and the [[bond cleavage|cleavage]] occurs at the ester bond by [[&amp;beta; elimination]] reaction.&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"/&gt;

[[Hydrolytic]] degradation occurs only slowly making it usable in medical applications.

== Drawbacks ==
PHBV, being biodegradable, biocompatible and renewable, is a good alternative for synthetic nonbiodegradable polymers made from petroleum. But it has the following drawbacks,&lt;ref name="Pilla2011"/&gt;
* Expensive
* Low thermal stability
* Brittle
* Primitive mechanical properties
* Processing difficulty

'''Pareto efficiency''' or '''Pareto optimality''' is a state of allocation of resources from which it is impossible to reallocate so as to make any one individual or preference criterion better off without making at least one  individual or preference criterion worse off. The concept is named after [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1848–1923), Italian engineer and economist, who used the concept in his studies of [[economic efficiency]] and [[income distribution]]. The concept has been applied in academic fields such as [[economics]], [[engineering]], and the [[life sciences]].

The '''Pareto frontier''' is the set of all Pareto efficient allocations, conventionally shown [[Chart|graphically]]. It also is variously known as the '''Pareto front''' or '''Pareto set'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cenaero.be/Page.asp?docid=27103&amp;|title=Pareto Front|last=proximedia|first=|date=|website=www.cenaero.be|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Pareto improvement''' is a change to a different allocation that makes at least one individual or preference criterion [[utility|better off]] without making any other individual or preference criterion worse off, given a certain initial allocation of [[good (economics)|good]]s among a set of [[agent (economics)|individuals]]. An allocation is defined as "Pareto efficient" or "Pareto optimal" when no further Pareto improvements can be made, in which case we are assumed to have reached '''Pareto optimality'''.

"Pareto efficiency" is considered as a minimal notion of efficiency that does not necessarily result in a socially desirable distribution of resources: it makes no statement about [[Social equality|equality]], or the overall well-being of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=N. |last=Barr ||author-link=Nicholas Barr|chapter=3.2.2 The relevance of efficiency to different theories of society |title=Economics of the Welfare State |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=DOg0BM1XiqQC&amp;pg=PA46 |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929781-8 |pages=46 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Amartya Sen |first=A. |last=Sen |title=Markets and freedom: Achievements and limitations of the market mechanism in promoting individual freedoms |journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=519–541 |date=October 1993 |jstor=2663703 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos444/papers/sen.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is simply a statement of impossibility of improving one variable without harming other variables in the subject of [[multi-objective optimization]] (also termed '''Pareto optimization'''). 

The notion of Pareto efficiency has been applied to the selection of alternatives in engineering and similar fields. Each option is first assessed, under multiple criteria, and then a subset of options is ostensibly identified with the property that no other option can [[Categorical distribution|categorically]] outperform any of its members.

== Overview ==

[[File:Pareto Efficient Frontier 1024x1024.png|thumb|256px|A [[production-possibility frontier]], the red line in the figure above, is an example of a Pareto-efficient frontier, where the frontier and the area left and below it is a continuous room of choices. The red points on the frontier are examples of Pareto-optimal choices of production. Points off the frontier, such as N and K, are not Pareto-efficient, since there exist points on the frontier which Pareto-dominate them.]]

"Pareto optimality" is a formally defined concept used to determine when an [[resource allocation|allocation]] is optimal. An allocation is ''not'' Pareto optimal if there is an alternative allocation where improvements can be made to at least one participant's well-being without reducing any other participant's well-being. If there is a transfer that satisfies this condition, the reallocation is called a "Pareto improvement." When no further Pareto improvements are possible, the allocation is a "Pareto optimum."

The formal presentation of the concept in an economy is as follows: Consider an economy with &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; agents and &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; goods. Then an allocation &lt;math&gt; \{x_1, ..., x_i\} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x_n \in \mathbb{R}^j &lt;/math&gt;, is ''Pareto optimal'' if there is no other feasible allocation &lt;math&gt; \{x_1', ..., x_i'\} &lt;/math&gt; such that, for utility function &lt;math&gt; u_i &lt;/math&gt; for each agent &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; u_n(x_n') \geq u_n(x_n) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; n \in \{1, ..., i\} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; u_n(x_n') &gt; u_n(x_n) &lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95"&gt;{{citation|author-link=Andreu Mas-Colell|last1=Mas-Colell|first1=A.| first2=Michael D.|last2=Whinston|first3=Jerry R.|last3=Green|year=1995|title=Microeconomic Theory|chapter=Chapter 16: Equilibrium and its Basic Welfare Properties|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-510268-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, in this simple economy, "feasibility" refers to an allocation where the total amount of each good that is allocated sums to no more than the total amount of the good in the economy. In a more complex economy with production, an allocation would consist both of consumption [[Vector space|vector]]s and production vectors, and feasibility would require that the total amount of each consumed good is no greater than the initial endowment plus the amount produced.

In principle, a change from a generally inefficient economic allocation to an efficient one is not necessarily considered to be a Pareto improvement. Even when there are overall gains in the economy, if a single agent is disadvantaged by the reallocation, the allocation is not Pareto optimal. For instance, if a change in economic policy eliminates a monopoly and that market subsequently becomes competitive, the gain to others may be large. However, since the monopolist is disadvantaged, this is not a Pareto improvement. In theory, if the gains to the economy are larger than the loss to the monopolist, the monopolist could be compensated for its loss while still leaving a net gain for others in the economy, allowing for a Pareto improvement. Thus, in practice, to ensure that nobody is disadvantaged by a change aimed at achieving Pareto efficiency, [[compensation principle|compensation]] of one or more parties may be required. It is acknowledged, in the real world, that such compensations may have [[unintended consequences]] leading to incentive distortions over time, as agents supposedly anticipate such compensations and change their actions accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Ricardian equivalence]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the idealized conditions of the [[first welfare theorem]], a system of [[free market]]s, also called a "[[competitive equilibrium]]," leads to a Pareto-efficient outcome. It was first demonstrated mathematically by economists [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Gérard Debreu]]. 

However, the result only holds under the restrictive assumptions necessary for the proof: markets exist for all possible goods, so there are no [[externality|externalities]]; all markets are in full equilibrium; markets are perfectly competitive; transaction costs are negligible; and market participants have [[perfect information]]. 

In the absence of perfect information or complete markets, outcomes will generally be Pareto inefficient, per the [[Joseph Stiglitz#Information asymmetry|Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/1891114 |last1=Greenwald |first1=B. |last2=Stiglitz |first2=J.

The [[second welfare theorem]] is essentially the reverse of the first welfare-theorem. It states that under similar, ideal assumptions, any Pareto optimum can be obtained by some [[competitive equilibrium]], or [[free market]] system, although it may also require a [[lump-sum]] transfer of wealth.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95"&gt;{{citation|author-link=Andreu Mas-Colell|last1=Mas-Colell|first1=A.| first2=Michael D.|last2=Whinston|first3=Jerry R.|last3=Green|year=1995|title=Microeconomic Theory|chapter=Chapter 16: Equilibrium and its Basic Welfare Properties|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-510268-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weak Pareto efficiency ==

A "weak Pareto optimum" (WPO) is an allocation for which there are no possible alternative allocations whose realization would cause every individual to gain.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Thus, an alternative allocation is considered to be a Pareto improvement ''if and only if'' the alternative allocation is strictly preferred by ''all'' individuals. When contrasted with weak Pareto efficiency, a standard Pareto optimum as described above may be referred to as a "strong Pareto optimum" (SPO).

Weak Pareto-optimality is "weaker" than strong Pareto-optimality in the sense that any SPO also qualifies as a WPO, but a WPO allocation is not necessarily an SPO.

A market doesn't require [[Local nonsatiation|local nonsatiation]] to get to a weak Pareto-optimum.&lt;ref&gt;Markey‐Towler, Brendan and John Foster. "Why economic theory has little to say about the causes and effects of inequality", School of Economics, [[University of Queensland]], Australia, 21 Feb 2013, RePEc:qld:uq2004:476&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constrained Pareto efficiency {{anchor|Constrained Pareto efficiency}}==
The condition of '''constrained Pareto optimality''' is a weaker version of the standard condition of Pareto optimality employed in [[economics]], which ostensibly accounts for the fact that a potential planner (e.g., the government) may not be able to improve upon a decentralized market outcome, even if that outcome is inefficient. This will occur if it is limited by the same informational or institutional constraints as are individual agents.&lt;ref&gt;Magill, M., &amp; Quinzii, M., ''Theory of Incomplete Markets'', MIT Press, 2002, p. 104 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d66GXq2F2M0C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=constrained+pareto+optimality&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IQFRM9b00n&amp;sig=LHWki_HOLB77G8xw3RiT0-0DSeY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly proffered example is of a setting where individuals have private information (for example, a labor market where the worker's own productivity is known to the worker but not to a potential employer, or a used-car market where the quality of a car is known to the seller but not to the buyer) which results in [[moral hazard]] or an [[adverse selection]] and a sub-optimal outcome. In such a case, a planner who wishes to improve the situation is deemed unlikely to have access to any information that the participants in the markets do not have. Hence, the planner cannot implement allocation rules which are based on the idiosyncratic characteristics of individuals; for example, "if a person is of type A, they pay price p1, but if of type B, they pay price p2" (see [[Lindahl prices]]). Essentially, only anonymous rules are allowed (of the sort "Everyone pays price p") or rules based on observable behavior; "if any person chooses x at price px, then they get a subsidy of ten dollars, and nothing otherwise". If there exists no allowed rule that can successfully improve upon the market outcome, then that outcome is said to be "constrained Pareto-optimal."

Note that the concept of constrained Pareto optimality assumes benevolence on the part of the planner and hence it is distinct from the concept of [[government failure]], which occurs when the policy making politicians fail to achieve an optimal outcome simply because they are not necessarily acting in the public's best interest.

== Use in engineering and economics==

[[File:Front pareto.svg|thumb|300px|Example of a Pareto frontier. The boxed points represent feasible choices, and smaller values are preferred to larger ones. Point ''C'' is not on the Pareto frontier because it is dominated by both point ''A'' and point ''B''. Points ''A'' and ''B'' are not strictly dominated by any other, and hence do lie on the frontier.]] The notion of Pareto efficiency has been used in engineering. Given a set of choices and a way of valuing them, the '''Pareto frontier''' or '''Pareto set''' or '''Pareto front''' is the set of choices that are Pareto efficient. By restricting attention to the set of choices that are Pareto-efficient, a designer can make [[Trade-off|tradeoffs]] within this set, rather than considering the full range of every parameter.

===Formal representation===

====Pareto frontier====

For a given system, the '''Pareto frontier''' or '''Pareto set''' is the set of parameterizations (allocations) that are all Pareto efficient. Finding Pareto frontiers is particularly useful in engineering. By yielding all of the potentially optimal solutions, a designer can make focused [[Trade-off|tradeoffs]] within this constrained set of parameters, rather than needing to consider the full ranges of parameters.

The Pareto frontier, ''P''(''Y''), may be more formally described as follows. Consider a system with function &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, where ''X'' is a [[compact space|compact set]] of feasible decisions in the [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and ''Y'' is the feasible set of criterion vectors in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;Y = \{ y \in \mathbb{R}^m:\; y = f(x), x \in X\;\}&lt;/math&gt;.

We assume that the preferred directions of criteria values are known. A point &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime\prime} \in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is preferred to (strictly dominates) another point &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime} \in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, written as &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime\prime} \succ y^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;. The Pareto frontier is thus written as:

: &lt;math&gt;P(Y) = \{ y^\prime \in Y: \; \{y^{\prime\prime} \in Y:\; y^{\prime\prime} \succ y^\prime, y^{\prime\prime} \neq y^\prime \; \} = \empty \}. &lt;/math&gt;

==== Relationship to the marginal rate of substitution ====
A significant aspect about the Pareto frontier in economics is that, at a Pareto-efficient allocation, the marginal rate of substitution is the same for all consumers. A formal statement can be derived by considering a system with ''m'' consumers and ''n'' goods, and a utility function of each consumer as &lt;math&gt;z_i=f^i(x^i)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x^i=(x_1^i, x_2^i, \ldots, x_n^i)&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of goods, both for all ''i''. The feasibility constraint is &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^m x_j^i = b_j&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;. To find the Pareto optimal allocation, we maximize the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]:

: &lt;math&gt;L_i((x_j^k)_{k,j}, (\lambda_k)_k, (\mu_j)_j)=f^i(x^i)+\sum_{k=2}^m \lambda_k(z_k- f^k(x^k))+\sum_{j=1}^n \mu_j \left( b_j-\sum_{k=1}^m x_j^k \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(\lambda_k)_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\mu_j)_j&lt;/math&gt; are the vectors of multipliers. Taking the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to each good &lt;math&gt;x_j^k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=1,\ldots, m&lt;/math&gt; and gives the following system of first-order conditions:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L_i}{\partial x_j^i} = f_{x^i_j}^1-\mu_j=0\text{ for }j=1,\ldots,n,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L_i}{\partial x_j^k} = -\lambda_k f_{x^k_j}^i-\mu_j=0 \text{ for }k= 2,\ldots,m \text{ and }j=1,\ldots,n,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f_{x^i_j}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x_j^i&lt;/math&gt;. Now, fix any &lt;math&gt;k\neq i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j,s\in \{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;. The above first-order condition imply that

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{f_{x_j^i}^i}{f_{x_s^i}^i}=\frac{\mu_j}{\mu_s}=\frac{f_{x_j^k}^k}{f_{x_s^k}^k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, in a Pareto-optimal allocation, the marginal rate of substitution must be the same for all consumers.

==== Computation ====
[[Algorithm]]s for computing the Pareto frontier of a finite set of alternatives have been studied in [[computer science]] and power engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/6/3/1439/pdf Tomoiagă, B.; Chindriş, M.; Sumper, A.; Sudria-Andreu, A.; Villafafila-Robles, R.

==== Use in biology ====
Pareto optimisation has also been studied in biological processes. In bacteria, genes were shown to be either inexpensive to make (resource efficient) or easier to read (translation efficient). Natural selection acts to push highly expressed genes towards the Pareto frontier for resource use and translational efficiency. Genes near the Pareto frontier were also shown to evolve more slowly (indicating that they are providing a selective advantage).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1186/s13059-018-1480-7|last1=Seward|first1=Emily A. |last2=Kelly|first2=Steven|title=Selection-driven cost-efficiency optimization of transcripts modulates gene evolutionary rate in bacteria.|journal=Genome Biology|volume=19|pages=102|year=2018|url=https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-018-1480-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

It would be incorrect to treat Pareto efficiency as equivalent to societal optimization, as the latter is a [[normative]] concept that is a matter of interpretation that typically would account for the consequence of degrees of inequality of distribution. An example would be a school district with low property tax revenue versus one with much higher revenue. Generally, more equal distribution occurs with the help of government redistribution.{{Citation needed|reason=A statement is made here that has strong political implications. Furthermore, the definition of equality is not well defined here|date=May 2018}}

Pareto efficiency does not require a totally equitable distribution of wealth. An economy in which a wealthy few hold the [[Wealth condensation|vast majority of resources]] can be Pareto efficient. This possibility is inherent in the definition of Pareto efficiency; often the [[status quo]] is Pareto efficient regardless of the degree to which wealth is equitably distributed. A simple example is the distribution of a pie among three people. The most equitable distribution would assign one third to each person. However the assignment of, say, a half section to each of two individuals and none to the third is also Pareto optimal despite not being equitable, because none of the recipients could be made better off without decreasing someone else's share; and there are many other such distribution examples. An example of a Pareto inefficient distribution of the pie would be allocation of a quarter of the pie to each of the three, with the remainder discarded. The origin (and utility value) of the pie is conceived as immaterial in these examples. In such cases, whereby a "windfall" is gained that none of the potential distributees actually produced (e.g., land, inherited wealth, a portion of the broadcast spectrum, or some other resource), the criterion of Pareto efficiency does not determine a unique optimal allocation. Wealth consolidation may exclude others from wealth accumulation because of bars to market entry, etc.

The [[liberal paradox]] elaborated by [[Amartya Sen]] shows that when people have preferences about what other people do, the goal of Pareto efficiency can come into conflict with the goal of individual liberty.

[[Image:Pac-schema.png|400px|thumb|right|The structure of an application with PAC.]]
'''Presentation–abstraction–control''' ('''PAC''') is a software [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|architectural pattern]]. It is an interaction-oriented software architecture, and is somewhat similar to [[model–view–controller]] (MVC) in that it separates an interactive system into three types of components responsible for specific aspects of the application's functionality. The '''abstraction''' component retrieves and processes the data, the '''presentation''' component formats the visual and audio presentation of data, and the '''control''' component handles things such as the flow of control and communication between the other two components.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to MVC, PAC is used as a hierarchical structure of agents, each consisting of a triad of presentation, abstraction and control parts. The agents (or triads) communicate with each other only through the control part of each triad. It also differs from MVC in that within each triad, it completely insulates the presentation (view in MVC) and the abstraction (model in MVC). This provides the option to separately multithread the model and view which can give the user experience of very short program start times, as the user interface (presentation) can be shown before the abstraction has fully initialized.

'''Scientific opinion on climate change''' is a judgment of scientists regarding the degree to which [[global warming]] is occurring, its likely causes, and its probable consequences. 

A related&amp;mdash;but not identical&amp;mdash;term, "scientific '''consensus''' on climate change," is the ''prevailing'' view on climate change within the scientific community. The consensus is that:
* Earth's climate has warmed significantly since the late 1800s, 
* Human activities (primarily [[greenhouse gas]] emissions) are the [[attribution of climate change|primary cause]], 
* Continuing emissions will increase the likelihood and severity of [[Effects of global warming|global effects]], and that
* People could manage future climate change impacts through intense efforts at [[Climate change mitigation|reducing further warming]] while [[Climate change adaptation|preparing for any unavoidable]] climate changes.

National and international [[Academy of Sciences|science academies]] and [[Learned society|scientific societies]] have assessed current [[scientific opinion]] on [[global warming]]. These assessments are generally consistent with the conclusions of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

Some scientific bodies have recommended specific policies to governments, and science can play a role in informing an effective response to climate change. Policy decisions, however, may require [[value judgement]]s and so are not included in the scientific opinion.&lt;ref name="tar value judgements"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC on policy"/&gt;

No scientific body of national or international standing maintains a formal opinion dissenting from any of these main points. The last national or international scientific body to drop dissent was the [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]],&lt;ref name=AQAonAAPG/&gt; which in 2007&lt;ref name="aapg19"/&gt; updated its statement to its current non-committal position.&lt;ref name="Oreskes07p68"/&gt; Some other organizations, primarily those focusing on geology, also hold [[#Non-committal|non-committal positions]].

Synthesis reports are assessments of scientific literature that compile the results of a range of stand-alone studies in order to achieve a broad level of understanding, or to describe the state of knowledge of a given subject.&lt;ref name="Integration and Synthesis: Assessing Climate Change Impacts in Northern Canada"/&gt;

=== Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2014 ===
{{main article|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC Fifth Assessment Report}}

The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report followed the same general format as the Fourth Assessment Report, with three Working Group reports and a Synthesis report.&lt;ref name="IPCC_AR5_Synth"/&gt; The Working Group I report (WG1) was published in September 2013.&lt;ref name="IPCC_AR5_Synth"/&gt; The report's ''Summary for Policymakers'' stated that warming of the climate system is 'unequivocal' with changes unprecedented over decades to millennia, including warming of the atmosphere and oceans, [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|loss of snow and ice]], and [[sea level rise]]. [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions, driven largely by economic and population growth, have led to greenhouse gas concentrations that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. These, together with other anthropogenic drivers, are "extremely likely" to have been the dominant cause of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=IPCC-AR5-SYN&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It said that
{{quote|Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.&lt;ref name=IPCC-AR5-SYN/&gt;}}

Reporting on the publication of the report, ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that
{{quote|In the end it all boils down to risk management. The stronger our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the lower the risk of extreme climate impacts. The higher our emissions, the larger climate changes we'll face, which also means more expensive adaptation, more species extinctions, more food and water insecurities, more income losses, more conflicts, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nuccitelli|first1=Dana|title=IPCC report warns of future climate change risks, but is spun by contrarians|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/mar/31/ipcc-warns-climate-change-risks|accessdate=1 August 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that
{{quote|In Washington, President Obama's science adviser, [[John Holdren|John P.

It went on to say that [[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[United Nations]] secretary general, had declared his intention to call a meeting of heads of state in 2014 to develop such a treaty. The last such meeting, in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen in 2009]], the NY Times reported, had ended in disarray.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-AR5/&gt;

=== Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 ===
In February 2007, the IPCC released a summary of the forthcoming [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report]]. According to this summary, the Fourth Assessment Report found that human actions are "very likely" the cause of global warming, meaning a 90% or greater probability. Global warming in this case was indicated by an increase of 0.75 degrees in average global temperatures over the last 100 years.&lt;ref name="Warming 'very likely' human-made"/&gt;

The [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] stated that:
* Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as evidenced by increases in global average air and ocean [[instrumental temperature record|temperatures]], the widespread melting of [[snow]] and [[ice]], and rising global average [[current sea level rise|sea level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=1.

''The New York Times'' reported that "the leading international network of climate scientists has concluded for the first time that global warming is 'unequivocal' and that human activity is the main driver, 'very likely' causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950".&lt;ref name="rosenthal"/&gt;

A retired journalist for ''The New York Times'', William K. Stevens wrote: "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the likelihood was 90 percent to 99 percent that emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, spewed from tailpipes and smokestacks, were the dominant cause of the observed warming of the last 50 years. In the panel's parlance, this level of certainty is labeled 'very likely'. Only rarely does scientific odds-making provide a more definite answer than that, at least in this branch of science, and it describes the endpoint, so far, of a progression.".&lt;ref name="On the Climate Change Beat, Doubt Gives Way to Certainty"/&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] summarized the position on sea level rise:

{{main|United States Global Change Research Program}} (USGCRP)

The [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration|Trump administration]] released its first major climate report, the [[Fourth National Climate Assessment]] (NCA4) on November 23, 2018. The two-part report by the [[United States Global Change Research Program]] (USGCRP) was the result of two years of work by a team from 13 federal agencies with [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) as the lead administrator. The first volume released in October 2017, &lt;ref name="CRS_Leggett_2018"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45086.pdf |format=PDF |title=Evolving Assessments of Human and Natural Contributions to Climate Change |first=Jane A. |last=Leggett |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS) |date= February 1, 2018 |access-date=November 23, 2018 |pages=22 |quote="This CRS report provides context for the Administration’s Climate Science Special Report (October 2017) by tracing the evolution of scientific understanding and confidence regarding the drivers of recent global climate change."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 [[Congressional Research Service|CRS]] cited 

The first volume, entitled "Climate Science Special Report" (CSSR) released on October 2017 said that, "Detection and attribution studies, climate models, observations, paleoclimate data, and physical understanding lead to high confidence (extremely likely) that more than half of the observed global mean warming since 1951 was caused by humans, and high confidence that internal climate variability played only a minor role (and possibly even a negative contribution) in the observed warming since 1951.

====Background==== 



:''Formerly: [[Climate Change Science Program]]''

The [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]] reported in June 2009&lt;ref name="globalchange"/&gt; that:

{{quote|Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.}}

The 2009 report, which is about the effects that climate change is having in the United States, also said:

{{quote|Climate-related changes have already been observed globally and in the United States. These include increases in air and water temperatures, reduced frost days, increased frequency and intensity of heavy downpours, a rise in sea level, and reduced snow cover, glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. A longer ice-free period on lakes and rivers, lengthening of the growing season, and increased [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere have also been observed. Over the past 30 years, temperatures have risen faster in winter than in any other season, with average winter temperatures in the Midwest and northern Great Plains increasing more than {{convert|7|F-change|C-change}}. Some of the changes have been faster than previous assessments had suggested.}}

=== Arctic Climate Impact Assessment ===
In 2004, the intergovernmental [[Arctic Council]] and the non-governmental [[International Arctic Science Committee]] released the synthesis report of the [[Arctic Climate Impact Assessment]]:&lt;ref name="Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment New Scientific Consensus: Arctic Is Warming Rapidly"/&gt;

{{quote|Climate conditions in the past provide evidence that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are associated with rising global temperatures. Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), and secondarily the clearing of land, have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide, methane, and other heat-trapping ("greenhouse") gases in the atmosphere...There is international scientific consensus that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.&lt;ref name="amap"/&gt;}}

== Policy ==
{{See also|Avoiding dangerous climate change}}

There is an extensive discussion in the [[scientific literature]] on what policies might be effective in responding to climate change.&lt;ref name="ar4 policy assessment"&gt;The literature has been assessed by the IPCC, e.g., see:

&lt;/ref&gt; However, policy decisions may require [[value judgement]]s.&lt;ref name="tar value judgements"/&gt; For example, the [[US National Research Council]] has commented:&lt;ref name="NRC on policy"&gt;
[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10139&amp;page=4 Summary], in {{harvnb|US NRC|2001|p=4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The question of whether there exists a "safe" level of concentration of greenhouse gases cannot be answered directly because it would require a value judgment of what constitutes an acceptable risk to human welfare and ecosystems in various parts of the world, as well as a more quantitative assessment of the risks and costs associated with the various impacts of global warming. In general, however, risk increases with increases in both the rate and the magnitude of climate change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Concurring ===

==== Academies of science (general science) ====
Since 2001, 34 [[national academies|national science academies]], three regional academies, and both the international [[InterAcademy Council]] and [[International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences]] have made formal declarations confirming human induced global warming and urging nations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The 34 national science academy statements include 33 who have signed joint science academy statements and one individual declaration by the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] in 2007.

===== Joint national science academy statements =====
* 2001 Following the publication of the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]], seventeen national science academies issued a joint statement, entitled "The Science of Climate Change", explicitly acknowledging the IPCC position as representing the scientific consensus on climate change science. The statement, printed in an editorial in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on May 18, 2001,&lt;ref name="Editorial: The Science of Climate Change"/&gt; was signed by the science academies of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Caribbean, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, New Zealand, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="The Science of Climate Change"/&gt;
* 2005 The national science academies of the [[G8]] nations, plus Brazil, China and India, three of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the developing world, signed a statement on the global response to climate change. The statement stresses that the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action, and explicitly endorsed the IPCC consensus. The eleven signatories were the science academies of Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name="nationalacademies"/&gt;
* 2007 In preparation for the [[33rd G8 summit]], the national science academies of the [[G8+5]] nations issued a declaration referencing the position of the 2005 joint science academies' statement, and acknowledging the confirmation of their previous conclusion by recent research. Following the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]], the declaration states, "It is unequivocal that the climate is changing, and it is very likely that this is predominantly caused by the increasing human interference with the atmosphere. These changes will transform the environmental conditions on [[Earth]] unless counter-measures are taken." The thirteen signatories were the national science academies of Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name="pik-potsdam"/&gt;
* 2007 In preparation for the [[33rd G8 summit]], the [[Network of African Science Academies]] submitted a joint "statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change" : {{quote|A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change. The IPCC should be congratulated for the contribution it has made to public understanding of the nexus that exists between energy, climate and sustainability. | The thirteen signatories were the science academies of [[Cameroon]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], as well as the [[African Academy of Sciences]] | &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;}}
* 2008 In preparation for the [[34th G8 summit]], the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a declaration reiterating the position of the 2005 joint science academies’ statement, and reaffirming "that climate change is happening and that anthropogenic warming is influencing many physical and biological systems." Among other actions, the declaration urges all nations to "(t)ake appropriate economic and policy measures to accelerate transition to a [[low carbon society]] and to encourage and effect changes in individual and national behaviour." The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 joint statement.&lt;ref name="nationalacademies5"/&gt;
* 2009 In advance of the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009|UNFCCC]] negotiations to be held in [[Copenhagen]] in December 2009, the national science academies of the G8+5 nations issued a joint statement declaring, "Climate change and sustainable energy supply are crucial challenges for the future of humanity. It is essential that world leaders agree on the emission reductions needed to combat negative consequences of anthropogenic climate change". The statement references the IPCC's Fourth Assessment of 2007, and asserts that "climate change is happening even faster than previously estimated; global {{CO2}} emissions since 2000 have been higher than even the highest predictions, Arctic sea ice has been melting at rates much faster than predicted, and the rise in the sea level has become more rapid." The thirteen signatories were the same national science academies that issued the 2007 and 2008 joint statements.&lt;ref name="nationalacademies6"/&gt;

===== Polish Academy of Sciences =====
In December 2007, the General Assembly of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (Polska Akademia Nauk), which has not been a signatory to [[#Joint National Science Academy Statements|joint national science academy statements]] issued a declaration endorsing the IPCC conclusions, and stating:
{{quote|it is the duty of Polish science and the national government to, in a thoughtful, organized and active manner, become involved in realisation of these ideas.

Problems of global warming, climate change, and their various negative impacts on human life and on the functioning of entire societies are one of the most dramatic challenges of modern times.

PAS General Assembly calls on the national scientific communities and the national government to actively support Polish participation in this important endeavor.&lt;ref name="Stanowisko Zgromadzenia Ogólnego PAN z dnia 13 grudnia 2007 r"/&gt;}}

===== Additional national science academy and society statements =====
* [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] as the world's largest general scientific society, adopted an official statement on climate change in 2006: {{quote|The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society....The pace of change and the evidence of harm have increased markedly over the last five years. The time to control greenhouse gas emissions is now.&lt;ref name="aaas board"/&gt;}}

===== International science academies =====
* [[African Academy of Sciences]] in 2007 was a signatory to the "statement on sustainability, energy efficiency, and climate change". This joint statement of African science academies, was organized through the [[Network of African Science Academies]]. Its stated goal was "to convey information and spur action on the occasion of the G8 Summit in Heiligendamm, Germany, in June 2007". {{quote|A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint statement by the Network of African Science Academies (NASAC) to the G8 on sustainability,  energy efficiency and climate change|url=http://www.interacademies.net/file.aspx?id=4825|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=2007|quote=A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change...

* [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in 2007 issued a formal declaration on climate change titled ''Let's Be Honest'': {{quote|Human activity is most ''likely'' responsible for climate warming. Most of the climatic warming over the last 50 years is ''likely'' to have been caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Documented long-term climate changes include changes in Arctic temperatures and ice, widespread changes in precipitation amounts, ocean salinity, wind patterns and [[extreme weather]] including droughts, heavy precipitation, heat waves and the intensity of tropical cyclones.

===== American Geophysical Union =====
The [[American Geophysical Union]] (AGU) adopted a statement on ''Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Tamara S. |last=Ledley |first2=Eric T. |last2=Sundquist |first3=Stephen E. |last3=Schwartz |first4=Dorothy K. |last4=Hall |first5=Jack D. |last5=Fellows |first6=Timothy L. |last6=Killeen |title=Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases |journal=EOS |date=September 28, 1999 |volume=80 |issue=39 |pages=453–454, 457–458 |doi=10.1029/99EO00325 |quote=There is no known geologic precedent for large increases of atmospheric C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without simultaneous changes in other components of the carbon cycle and climate system.[...] Changes in the climate system that are confidently predicted in response to increases in greenhouse gases include increases in mean surface air temperature, increases in global mean rates of precipitation and evaporation, rising sea level, and changes in the biosphere. |url=http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/pubs/BNL66903.pdf |accessdate=16 August 2016 |bibcode=1999EOSTr..80Q.453L |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009000325/http://www.ecd.bnl.gov/pubs/BNL66903.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new statement, adopted by the society in 2003, revised in 2007,&lt;ref name="agu"/&gt; and revised and expanded in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human-induced Climate Change Requires Urgent Action|url=http://www.agu.org/news/press/pr_archives/2013/2013-38.shtml|work=Position Statement|publisher=American Geophysical Union|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; affirms that rising levels of greenhouse gases have caused and will continue to cause the global surface temperature to be warmer:

{{quote|Human activities are changing Earth's climate. At the global level, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases have increased sharply since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel burning dominates this increase. Human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global average surface warming of roughly 0.8{{nnbsp}}°C (1.5{{nnbsp}}°F) over the past 140 years. Because natural processes cannot quickly remove some of these gases (notably carbon dioxide) from the atmosphere, our past, present, and future emissions will influence the climate system for millennia.

While important scientific uncertainties remain as to which particular impacts will be experienced where, no uncertainties are known that could make the impacts of climate change inconsequential. Furthermore, surprise outcomes, such as the unexpectedly rapid loss of Arctic summer sea ice, may entail even more dramatic changes than anticipated.}}

===== American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America =====
In May, 2011, the [[American Society of Agronomy]] (ASA), Crop Science Society of America (CSSA), and [[Soil Science Society of America]] (SSSA) issued a joint position statement on climate change as it relates to agriculture:

{{quote|A comprehensive body of scientific evidence indicates beyond reasonable doubt that global climate change is now occurring and that its manifestations threaten the stability of societies as well as natural and managed ecosystems. Increases in ambient temperatures and changes in related processes are directly linked to rising anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere.

Unless the emissions of GHGs are curbed significantly, their concentrations will continue to rise, leading to changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables that will undoubtedly affect agriculture around the world.

Climate change has the potential to increase weather variability as well as gradually increase global temperatures. Both of these impacts have the potential to negatively impact the adaptability and resilience of the world's food production capacity; current research indicates climate change is already reducing the productivity of vulnerable cropping systems.&lt;ref name="soils"/&gt;}}

===== European Federation of Geologists =====
In 2008, the European Federation of Geologists&lt;ref name="eurogeologists"/&gt; (EFG) issued the position paper ''Carbon Capture and geological Storage '':

{{quote|The EFG recognizes the work of the IPCC and other organizations, and subscribes to the major findings that climate change is happening, is predominantly caused by anthropogenic emissions of {{CO2}}, and poses a significant threat to human civilization.

It is clear that major efforts are necessary to quickly and strongly reduce {{CO2}} emissions. The EFG strongly advocates renewable and sustainable energy production, including geothermal energy, as well as the need for increasing energy efficiency.

CCS [Carbon Capture and geological Storage] should also be regarded as a bridging technology, facilitating the move towards a carbon free economy.&lt;ref name="eurogeologists9"/&gt;}}

===== European Geosciences Union =====
In 2005, the Divisions of Atmospheric and Climate Sciences of the [[European Geosciences Union]] (EGU) issued a position statement in support of the [[scientific opinion on climate change#Joint science academies’ statement 2005|joint science academies’ statement]] on global response to climate change. The statement refers to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), as "the main representative of the global [[scientific community]]", and asserts that the IPCC

{{quote|represents the state-of-the-art of climate science supported by the major science academies around the world and by the vast majority of science researchers and investigators as documented by the [[peer-reviewed]] scientific literature.&lt;ref name="www"/&gt;}}

Additionally, in 2008, the EGU issued a position statement on [[ocean acidification]] which states, "Ocean acidification is already occurring today and will continue to intensify, closely tracking [[Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric {{CO2}}]] increase. Given the potential threat to [[marine ecosystems]] and its ensuing impact on human society and economy, especially as it acts in conjunction with [[anthropogenic global warming]], there is an urgent need for immediate action." The statement then advocates for strategies "to limit future release of {{CO2}} to the atmosphere and/or enhance removal of excess {{CO2}} from the atmosphere."&lt;ref name="www10"/&gt;

===== Geological Society of America =====
In 2006, the [[Geological Society of America]] adopted a position statement on global [[climate change]]. It amended this position on April 20, 2010 with more explicit comments on need for {{CO2}} reduction.
{{quote|Decades of scientific research have shown that climate can change from both natural and anthropogenic causes. The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse‐gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s. If current trends continue, the projected increase in global temperature by the end of the twenty first century will result in large impacts on humans and other species. Addressing the challenges posed by climate change will require a combination of adaptation to the changes that are likely to occur and global reductions of {{CO2}} emissions from anthropogenic sources.&lt;ref name="geosociety"/&gt;}}

===== Geological Society of London =====
In November 2010, the [[Geological Society of London]] issued the position statement ''Climate change: evidence from the geological record'':

{{quote|The last century has seen a rapidly growing global population and much more intensive use of resources, leading to greatly increased emissions of gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, from the burning of fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal), and from agriculture, cement production and deforestation. Evidence from the geological record is consistent with the physics that shows that adding large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere warms the world and may lead to: higher sea levels and flooding of low-lying coasts; greatly changed patterns of rainfall; increased acidity of the oceans; and decreased oxygen levels in seawater.

There is now widespread concern that the Earth's climate will warm further, not only because of the lingering effects of the added carbon already in the system, but also because of further additions as human population continues to grow. Life on Earth has survived large climate changes in the past, but extinctions and major redistribution of species have been associated with many of them. When the human population was small and nomadic, a rise in sea level of a few metres would have had very little effect on Homo sapiens. With the current and growing global population, much of which is concentrated in coastal cities, such a rise in sea level would have a drastic effect on our complex society, especially if the climate were to change as suddenly as it has at times in the past. Equally, it seems likely that as warming continues some areas may experience less precipitation leading to drought. With both rising seas and increasing drought, pressure for human migration could result on a large scale.&lt;ref name="geolsoc"/&gt;}}

===== International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics =====
In July 2007, the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG) adopted a resolution titled "The Urgency of Addressing Climate Change". In it, the IUGG concurs with the "comprehensive and widely accepted and endorsed scientific assessments carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and regional and national bodies, which have firmly established, on the basis of scientific evidence, that human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change." They state further that the "continuing reliance on combustion of fossil fuels as the world's primary source of energy will lead to much higher atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, which will, in turn, cause significant increases in surface temperature, sea level, ocean acidification, and their related consequences to the environment and society."&lt;ref name="iugg"/&gt;

===== National Association of Geoscience Teachers =====
In July 2009, the National Association of Geoscience Teachers&lt;ref name="nagt"/&gt; (NAGT) adopted a position statement on climate change in which they assert that "Earth's climate is changing [and] "that present warming trends are largely the result of human activities":

{{quote|NAGT strongly supports and will work to promote education in the science of climate change, the causes and effects of current global warming, and the immediate need for policies and actions that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="nagt11"/&gt;}}

==== Meteorology and oceanography ====

===== American Meteorological Society =====
The [[American Meteorological Society]] (AMS) statement adopted by their council in 2012 concluded:

{{quote|There is unequivocal evidence that Earth's lower atmosphere, ocean, and land surface are warming; sea level is rising; and snow cover, mountain glaciers, and Arctic sea ice are shrinking. The dominant cause of the warming since the 1950s is human activities. This scientific finding is based on a large and persuasive body of research. The observed warming will be irreversible for many years into the future, and even larger temperature increases will occur as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. Avoiding this future warming will require a large and rapid reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. The ongoing warming will increase risks and stresses to human societies, economies, ecosystems, and wildlife through the 21st century and beyond, making it imperative that society respond to a changing climate. To inform decisions on adaptation and mitigation, it is critical that we improve our understanding of the global climate system and our ability to project future climate through continued and improved monitoring and research. This is especially true for smaller (seasonal and regional) scales and weather and climate extremes, and for important hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation and water availability.

Technological, economic, and policy choices in the near future will determine the extent of future impacts of climate change. Science-based decisions are seldom made in a context of absolute certainty. National and international policy discussions should include consideration of the best ways to both adapt to and mitigate climate change. Mitigation will reduce the amount of future climate change and the risk of impacts that are potentially large and dangerous. At the same time, some continued climate change is inevitable, and policy responses should include adaptation to climate change. Prudence dictates extreme care in accounting for our relationship with the only planet known to be capable of sustaining human life.&lt;ref name="ametsoc"/&gt;}}

===== Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society =====
The [[Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society]] has issued a ''Statement on Climate Change'', wherein they conclude:

{{quote|Global climate change and global warming are real and observable ... It is highly likely that those human activities that have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have been largely responsible for the observed warming since 1950. The warming associated with increases in greenhouse gases originating from human activity is called the enhanced [[greenhouse effect]]. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by more than 30% since the start of the industrial age and is higher now than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years. This increase is a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale [[deforestation]] and other human activity."&lt;ref name="amos"/&gt;}}

===== Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences =====
In November 2005, the [[Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences]] (CFCAS) issued a letter to the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] stating that

{{quote|We concur with the climate science assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 ... We endorse the conclusions of the IPCC assessment that 'There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities'. ... There is increasingly unambiguous evidence of changing climate in Canada and around the world. There will be increasing impacts of climate change on Canada's natural ecosystems and on our socio-economic activities. Advances in climate science since the 2001 IPCC Assessment have provided more evidence supporting the need for action and development of a strategy for adaptation to projected changes.&lt;ref name="cfcas"/&gt;}}

===== Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society =====
In November 2009,  a letter to the Canadian Parliament by The [[Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society]] states:
{{quote|Rigorous international research, including work carried out and supported by the Government of Canada, reveals that greenhouse gases resulting from human activities contribute to the warming of the atmosphere and the oceans and constitute a serious risk to the health and safety of our society, as well as having an impact on all life.&lt;ref name="cmos"/&gt;}}

===== Royal Meteorological Society (UK) =====
In February 2007, after the release of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] issued an endorsement of the report. In addition to referring to the IPCC as "[the] world's best climate scientists", they stated that climate change is happening as "the result of emissions since industrialization and we have already set in motion the next 50 years of global warming – what we do from now on will determine how worse it will get."&lt;ref name="rmets"/&gt;

===== World Meteorological Organization =====
In its ''Statement at the Twelfth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change'' presented on November 15, 2006, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) confirms the need to "[[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system]]." The WMO concurs that "scientific assessments have increasingly reaffirmed that human activities are indeed changing the composition of the atmosphere, in particular through the burning of fossil fuels for energy production and transportation." The WMO concurs that "the present atmospheric concentration of {{CO2}} was never exceeded over the past 420,000 years;" and that the IPCC "assessments provide the most authoritative, up-to-date scientific advice."

===== American Quaternary Association =====
The [[American Quaternary Association]] (AMQUA) has stated

{{quote|Few credible Scientists now doubt that humans have influenced the documented rise of global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution," citing "the growing body of evidence that warming of the atmosphere, especially over the past 50 years, is directly impacted by human activity.&lt;ref name="agu13"/&gt;}}

===== International Union for Quaternary Research =====
The statement on climate change issued by the [[International Union for Quaternary Research]] (INQUA) reiterates the conclusions of the IPCC, and urges all nations to take prompt action in line with the [[UNFCCC]] principles.

{{quote|Human activities are now causing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide, methane, tropospheric ozone, and nitrous oxide — to rise well above pre-industrial levels….Increases in greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise…The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action….Minimizing the amount of this carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere presents a huge challenge but must be a global priority.&lt;ref name="inqua"/&gt;}}

{{quote|There is now widespread agreement that the Earth is warming, due to emissions of greenhouse gases caused by human activity. It is also clear that current trends in energy use, development, and population growth will lead to continuing – and more severe – climate change.}}

{{quote|The changing climate will inevitably affect the basic requirements for maintaining health: clean air and water, sufficient food and adequate shelter. Each year, about 800,000 people die from causes attributable to [[urban air pollution]], 1.8 million from [[diarrhoea]] resulting from lack of access to clean water supply, sanitation, and poor hygiene, 3.5 million from [[malnutrition]] and approximately 60,000 in natural disasters. A warmer and more variable climate threatens to lead to higher levels of some air pollutants, increase transmission of diseases through unclean water and through contaminated food, to compromise agricultural production in some of the least developed countries, and increase the hazards of extreme weather.}}

{{anchor|Non-committal statements}}

==== American Association of Petroleum Geologists ====
As of June 2007, the [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]] (AAPG) Position Statement on climate change stated:

{{quote|the AAPG membership is divided on the degree of influence that anthropogenic {{CO2}} has on recent and potential global temperature increases ... Certain climate simulation models predict that the warming trend will continue, as reported through NAS, AGU, AAAS and AMS. AAPG respects these scientific opinions but wants to add that the current climate warming projections could fall within well-documented natural variations in past climate and observed temperature data. These data do not necessarily support the maximum case scenarios forecast in some models.&lt;ref name="aapg"/&gt;}}

Prior to the adoption of this statement, the AAPG was the only major scientific organization that rejected the finding of significant human influence on recent climate, according to a statement by the Council of the American Quaternary Association.&lt;ref name="AQAonAAPG"/&gt; Explaining the plan for a revision, AAPG president Lee Billingsly wrote in March 2007:

{{quote|Members have threatened to not renew their memberships… if AAPG does not alter its position on global climate change... And I have been told of members who already have resigned in previous years because of our current global climate change position… The current policy statement is not supported by a significant number of our members and prospective members.&lt;ref name="aapg14"/&gt;}}

AAPG President John Lorenz announced the "sunsetting" of AAPG's Global Climate Change Committee in January 2010.  The AAPG Executive Committee determined:

{{quote|Climate change is peripheral at best to our science […] AAPG does not have credibility in that field […] and as a group we have no particular knowledge of global atmospheric geophysics.&lt;ref name="2010_tpgmarapr"/&gt;}}

==== American Institute of Professional Geologists (AIPG) ====
The official position statement from AIPG on the Environment states that "combustion of fossil fuel include and the generation of GHGs [greenhouse gases] including carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).  Emissions of GHGs are perceived by some to be one of the largest, global environmental concerns related to energy production due to potential effects on the global energy system and possibly global climate. Fossil fuel use is the primary source of the increased atmospheric concentration of GHGs since industrialization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AIPG Position Statements |url=http://aipg.org/posstatements |accessdate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, AIPG's Executive Director issued a statement regarding polarization of opinions on climate change within the membership and announced that the AIPG Executive had made a decision to cease publication of articles and opinion pieces concerning climate change in AIPG's news journal, ''The Professional Geologist''.&lt;ref name="aipg17"/&gt;

Various surveys have been conducted to evaluate scientific opinion on [[global warming]]. They have concluded that the majority of scientists support the idea of anthropogenic climate change.

In 2004, the geologist and historian of science [[Naomi Oreskes]] summarized a study of the scientific literature on climate change.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change"/&gt; She analyzed 928 [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] of papers from refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003 and concluded that there is a scientific consensus on the reality of [[anthropogenic climate change]].

Oreskes divided the abstracts into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. Seventy-five per cent of the abstracts were placed in the first three categories (either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view); 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, thus taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change. None of the abstracts disagreed with the consensus position, which the author found to be "remarkable". According to the report, "authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point."

In 2007, [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] surveyed 489 randomly selected members of either the [[American Meteorological Society]] or the [[American Geophysical Union]] for the [[Statistical Assessment Service]] (STATS) at [[George Mason University]]. 97% of the scientists surveyed agreed that global temperatures had increased during the past 100 years; 84% said they personally believed human-induced warming was occurring, and 74% agreed that "currently available scientific evidence" substantiated its occurrence. Catastrophic effects in 50–100 years would likely be observed according to 41%, while 44% thought the effects would be moderate and about 13 percent saw relatively little danger. 5% said they thought human activity did not contribute to greenhouse warming.&lt;ref name="Survey Tracks Scientists' Growing Climate Concern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Scientists Agree on Warming, Disagree on Dangers, and Don't Trust the Media's Coverage of Climate Change"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lichter |first=S.

Dennis Bray and [[Hans von Storch]] conducted a survey in August 2008 of 2058 climate scientists from 34 different countries.&lt;ref name="A Survey of the Perspectives of Climate Scientists Concerning Climate Science and Climate Change"/&gt; A web link with a unique identifier was given to each respondent to eliminate multiple responses. A total of 373 responses were received giving an overall response rate of 18.2%. No paper on climate change consensus based on this survey has been published yet (February 2010), but one on another subject has been published based on the survey.&lt;ref name="Prediction' or 'Projection; The nomenclature of climate science"/&gt;

The survey was composed of 76 questions split into a number of sections.
There were sections on the demographics of the respondents, their assessment of the state of climate science, how good the science is, climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, their opinion of the IPCC, and how well climate science was being communicated to the public.
Most of the answers were on a scale from 1 to 7 from 'not at all' to 'very much'.

To the question "How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?", 67.1% said they very much agreed, 26.7% agreed to some large extent, 6.2% said to they agreed to some small extent (2–4), none said they did not agree at all. To the question "How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will
be, a result of anthropogenic causes?" the responses were 34.6% very much agree, 48.9% agreeing to a large extent, 15.1% to a small extent, and 1.35% not agreeing at all.

A poll performed by [[Peter Doran]] and Maggie Kendall Zimmerman at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] received replies from 3,146 of the 10,257 polled Earth scientists. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. 76 out of 79 [[climatologists]] who "listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change" believed that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels. Seventy-five of 77 believed that human activity is a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures have risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. [[Economic geologist]]s and [[meteorologist]]s were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent, respectively, believing in significant human involvement. The authors summarised the findings:

{{quote|It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes.&lt;ref name="DZ_EOS_2009"/&gt;}}

A 2010 paper in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States'']] (PNAS) reviewed publication and citation data for 1,372 climate researchers and drew the following two conclusions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(i) 97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field support the tenets of ACC (Anthropogenic Climate Change) outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and (ii) the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.&lt;ref name="Expert credibility in climate change"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2013 paper in [[Environmental Research Letters]] reviewed 11,944 abstracts of scientific papers matching "global warming" or "global climate change". They found 4,014 which discussed the cause of recent global warming, and of these "97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming".&lt;ref name="Cook_etal_13"/&gt; This study was criticised by [[Richard Tol]].&lt;ref name="Tol p=048001"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tol | first=Richard S J | title=Comment on ‘Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature’ | journal=Environmental Research Letters | publisher=IOP Publishing | volume=11 | issue=4 | date=1 April 2016 | issn=1748-9326 | doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048001 | page=048001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James L. Powell]], a former member of the [[National Science Board]] and current executive director of the [[National Physical Science Consortium]], analyzed published research on global warming and climate change between 1991 and 2012 and found that of the 13,950 articles in peer-reviewed journals, only 24 rejected anthropogenic global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plait|first=P.|date=11 December 2012|title=Why Climate Change Denial Is Just Hot Air|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2012/12/11/climate_change_denial_why_don_t_they_publish_scientific_papers.html|newspaper=Slate|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up analysis looking at 2,258 peer-reviewed climate articles with 9,136 authors published between November 2012 and December 2013 revealed that only one of the 9,136 authors rejected anthropogenic global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plait|first=P.|date=14 January 2014|title=The Very, Very Thin Wedge of Denial|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/01/14/climate_change_another_study_shows_they_don_t_publish_actual_papers.html|newspaper=Slate|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2015 paper on the topic, covering 24,210 articles published by 69,406 authors during 2013 and 2014 found only five articles by four authors rejecting anthropogenic global warming. Over 99.99% of climate scientists did not reject AGW in their peer-reviewed research.&lt;ref name=Powell2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=James Lawrence|title=Climate Scientists Virtually Unanimous Anthropogenic Global Warming Is True|journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society|date=1 October 2015|volume=35|issue=5–6|pages=121–124|doi=10.1177/0270467616634958|url=http://bst.sagepub.com/content/35/5-6/121|language=en|issn=0270-4676}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming, 2017.jpg|thumb|Peer-reviewed studies of the consensus on anthropogenic global warming.]]
In his latest paper, Powell reported that using rejection as the criterion of consensus, five surveys of the peer-reviewed literature from 1991 to 2015, including several of those above, combine to 54,195 articles with an average consensus of 99.94%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=James Lawrence|date=2017-05-24|title=The Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming Matters|journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=157–163|doi=10.1177/0270467617707079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replication studies have shown that the 2% of climate science papers that rejected the scientific consensus on climate change in 2016 were methodologically flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Learning from mistakes in climate research|first1=Rasmus E.|last1=Benestad|first2=Dana|last2=Nuccitelli|first3=Stephan|last3=Lewandowsky|first4=Katharine|last4=Hayhoe|first5=Hans Olav|last5=Hygen|first6=Rob van|last6=Dorland|first7=John|last7=Cook|date=1 November 2016|journal=Theoretical and Applied Climatology|volume=126|issue=3–4|pages=699–703|doi=10.1007/s00704-015-1597-5|bibcode=2016ThApC.126..699B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Existence of a scientific consensus ==
{{See also|Scientific consensus}}
A question that frequently arises in popular discussion of climate change is whether there is a scientific consensus on climate change.&lt;ref name="Oreskes_consensus"/&gt;  Several scientific organizations have explicitly used the term "consensus" in their statements:
* [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], 2006: "The conclusions in this statement reflect the scientific consensus represented by, for example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the Joint National Academies' statement."&lt;ref name="aaas board"/&gt;
* [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]]: "In the judgment of most climate scientists, Earth's warming in recent decades has been caused primarily by human activities that have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. ... On climate change, [the National Academies’ reports] have assessed consensus findings on the science..."&lt;ref name="nas"/&gt;
* Joint Science Academies' statement, 2005: "We recognise the international scientific consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."&lt;ref name="nationalacademies21"/&gt;
* Joint Science Academies' statement, 2001: "The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the consensus of the international scientific community on climate change science. We recognise IPCC as the world's most reliable source of information on climate change and its causes, and we endorse its method of achieving this consensus."&lt;ref name="The Science of Climate Change"/&gt;
* [[American Meteorological Society]], 2003: "The nature of science is such that there is rarely total agreement among scientists. Individual scientific statements and papers—the validity of some of which has yet to be assessed adequately—can be exploited in the policy debate and can leave the impression that the scientific community is sharply divided on issues where there is, in reality, a strong scientific consensus.... IPCC assessment reports are prepared at approximately five-year intervals by a large international group of experts who represent the broad range of expertise and perspectives relevant to the issues. The reports strive to reflect a consensus evaluation of the results of the full body of peer-reviewed research.... They provide an analysis of what is known and not known, the degree of consensus, and some indication of the degree of confidence that can be placed on the various statements and conclusions."&lt;ref name="ametsoc22"/&gt;
* [[Network of African Science Academies]]: "A consensus, based on current evidence, now exists within the global scientific community that human activities are the main source of climate change and that the burning of fossil fuels is largely responsible for driving this change."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
* [[International Union for Quaternary Research]], 2008: "INQUA recognizes the international scientific consensus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."&lt;ref name="inqua"/&gt;
* Australian Coral Reef Society,&lt;ref name="australiancoralreefsociety"/&gt; 2006: "There is almost total consensus among experts that the earth's climate is changing as a result of the build-up of greenhouse gases.... There is broad scientific consensus that coral reefs are heavily affected by the activities of man and there are significant global influences that can make reefs more vulnerable such as global warming...."&lt;ref name="australiancoralreefsociety24"/&gt;

While ‘climate change’ can be due to natural forces or human activity, there is now substantial evidence to indicate that human activity – and specifically increased greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions – is a key factor in the pace and extent of global temperature increases.  Health impacts of climate change include the direct impacts of extreme events such as storms, floods, [[Heat wave|heatwaves]] and fires and the indirect effects of longer-term changes, such as drought, changes to the [[Food security|food]] and [[water supply]], resource conflicts and population shifts.  Increases in average temperatures mean that alterations in the geographic range and seasonality of certain infections and diseases (including vector-borne diseases such as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[Ross River virus]] and food-borne infections such as [[Salmonellosis]]) may be among the first detectable impacts of climate change on human health.  Human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem. The AMA believes that measures which mitigate climate change will also benefit public health. Reducing GHGs should therefore be seen as a public health priority."&lt;/ref&gt;

There is very little room for doubt that observed climate trends are due to human activities. The threats are serious and action is urgently needed to mitigate the risks of climate change.  The reality of global warming, its current serious and potentially disastrous impacts on Earth system properties, and the key role emissions from human activities play in driving these phenomena have been recognized by earlier versions of this ACS policy statement (ACS, 2004), by other major scientific societies, including the American Geophysical Union (AGU, 2003), the American Meteorological Society (AMS, 2007) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS, 2007), and by the U.

Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide as well as methane, nitrous oxide and other gases. They are emitted from fossil fuel combustion and a range of industrial and agricultural processes.  The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth's physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.  Because the complexity of the climate makes accurate prediction difficult, the APS urges an enhanced effort to understand the effects of human activity on the Earth's climate, and to provide the technological options for meeting the climate challenge in the near and longer terms. The APS also urges governments, universities, national laboratories and its membership to support policies and actions that will reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.&lt;/ref&gt;

These greenhouse gases affect the global climate by retaining heat in the troposphere, thus raising the average temperature of the planet and altering global atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns.  While on-going national and international actions to curtail and reduce greenhouse gas emissions are essential, the levels of greenhouse gases currently in the atmosphere, and their impact, are likely to persist for several decades. On-going and increased efforts to mitigate climate change through reduction in greenhouse gases are therefore crucial."&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the start of the 20th century, the global mean surface temperature of the Earth has increased by more than 0.7°C and the rate of warming has been largest in the last 30 years.  Key vulnerabilities arising from climate change include water resources, food supply, health, coastal settlements, biodiversity and some key [[ecosystems]] such as coral reefs and alpine regions. As the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases increases, impacts become more severe and widespread. To reduce the global net economic, environmental and social losses in the face of these impacts, the policy objective must remain squarely focused on returning greenhouse gas concentrations to near pre-industrial levels through the reduction of emissions.  The spatial and temporal fingerprint of warming can be traced to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, which are a direct result of burning fossil fuels, broad-scale deforestation and other human activity."&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, a by-product of the burning of fossil fuels. Since the time of the Industrial Revolution about 200 years ago, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from about 280 parts per million to 370 parts per million, an increase of around 30%.  On the basis of available data, climate scientists are now projecting an average global temperature rise over this century of 2.0 to 4.5°C. This compared with 0.6°C over the previous century – about a 500% increase... This could lead to changing, and for all emissions scenarios more unpredictable, weather patterns around the world, less frost days, more extreme events (droughts and storm or flood disasters), and warmer sea temperatures and melting glaciers causing sea levels to rise.  ... Professional engineers commonly deal with risk, and frequently have to make judgments based on incomplete data. The available evidence suggests very strongly that human activities have already begun to make significant changes to the earth's climate, and that the long-term risk of delaying action is greater than the cost of avoiding/minimising the risk."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although climates have varied dramatically since the Earth was formed, few scientists question the role of humans in exacerbating recent climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases. The critical issue is no longer "if" climate change is occurring, but rather how to address its effects on [[wildlife]] and [[wildlife habitat]]s."  The statement goes on to assert that "evidence is accumulating that wildlife and wildlife habitats have been and will continue to be significantly affected by ongoing large-scale rapid climate change."  The statement concludes with a call for "reduction in anthropogenic (human-caused) sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global climate change and the conservation of {{CO2}}- consuming [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesizers]] (i.e., plants)."&lt;/ref&gt;

This photo shows regeneration, a tree growing out of the stump of another tree that was felled in 1962 by the remnants of [[1962 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Freda|Typhoon Freda]].]]

A '''secondary forest''' (or '''second-growth forest''') is a [[forest]] or [[woodland]] area which has re-grown after a [[logging|timber harvest]], until a long enough period has passed so that the effects of the [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] are no longer evident. It is distinguished from an [[old-growth forest]] (primary or primeval forest), which has not recently undergone such disruption, and complex early seral forest, as well as third-growth forests that result from harvest in second growth forests. Secondary forest regrowing after timber harvest differs from forest [[Ecological succession|regrowing]] after natural [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] such as [[Wildfire|fire]], insect infestation, or [[windthrow]] because the dead trees remain to provide nutrients, structure, and water retention after natural disturbances. However, often after natural disturbance the timber is harvested and removed from the system, in which case the system more closely resembles secondary forest rather than complex early [[Seral community|seral]] forest.

==Description==
Depending on the forest, the development of primary characteristics may take anywhere from a century to several millennia. [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|Hardwood forests]] of the [[eastern United States]], for example, can develop primary characteristics in one or two generations of [[tree]]s, or 150–500 years. Often the disruption is the result of human activity, such as [[logging]], but natural phenomena that produce the same effect are often included in the definition. 
Secondary forests tend to have trees closer spaced than primary forests and contain less [[undergrowth]] than primary forests.  Secondary forests typically were thought to lack [[biodiversity]] compared to primary forests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chazdon|first=Robin L.|title=Beyond deforestation: restoring forests and ecosystem services on degraded lands|journal=Science|volume=320|issue=5882|year=2008|pages=1458–1460|url=http://lerf.eco.br/img/publicacoes/2008_2411%20Beyond%20Deforestation%20Restoring%20Forests%20and%20Ecosystem%20Services%20on%20Degraded%20Lands.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this has been challenged in recent years.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Usually, secondary forests have only one [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] layer, whereas primary forests have several.

Secondary forestation is common in areas where forests have been lost by the [[Slash and burn|slash-and-burn]] method, a component of some [[shifting cultivation]] systems of agriculture. Secondary forests may also arise from forest that has been harvested heavily or over a long period of time, forest that is naturally regenerating from fire and from abandoned pastures or areas of agriculture.  It takes a secondary forest typically forty to 100 years to begin to resemble the original old-growth forest; however, in some cases a secondary forest will not succeed, due to [[erosion]] or [[soil conservation|soil nutrient loss]] in certain [[tropical forest]]s.

Secondary forests re-establish by the process of succession.  Openings created in the [[Canopy (forest)|forest canopy]] allow sunlight to reach the forest floor.  An area that has been cleared will first be colonized by pioneer species.  Even though some species loss may occur with primary forest removal, a secondary forest can protect the watershed from further erosion and provides habitat.  Secondary forests may also buffer [[edge effect]]s around [[habitat fragmentation|mature forest fragments]] and increase connectivity between them.  They may also be a source of wood and other forest products.

Today most of the forest of the United States, the eastern part of North America and Europe consist of secondary forest.

==Rainforests==
In the case of tropical [[rainforest]]s, where soil [[nutrient]] levels are characteristically low, the soil quality may be significantly diminished following the removal of [[primary forest]]. In [[Panama]], growth of new forests from abandoned farmland exceeded loss of primary rainforest in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/30/science/earth/30forest.html "New Jungles Prompt a Debate on Rain Forests"] article by Elisabeth Rosenthal in ''[[The New York Times]]''  January 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the diminished quality of soil, among other factors, the presence of a significant majority of primary forest species fail to recover in these second-growth forests.

In [[computer science]], a [[subroutine|function]] or [[expression (programming)|expression]] is said to have a '''side effect''' if it modifies some [[State (computer science)|state]] outside its local environment, that is to say has an observable interaction with the outside world besides returning a value. Example side effects of a particular function might consist in modifying a [[non-local variable]], modifying a [[static local variable]], modifying a mutable argument passed by reference, performing [[I/O]] or calling other side-effect functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.70.2096&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |title=Compiler Detection of Function Call Side Effects |last1=Spuler |first=David A. |last2=Sajeev |first2=A. S. M. |date=January 1994 |website=CiteSeerX |publisher=James Cook University |access-date=2018-07-11 |quote=The term Side effect refers to the modification of the nonlocal environment.  Generally this happens when a function (or a procedure) modifies a global variable or arguments passed by reference parameters. But here are other ways in which the nonlocal environment can be modified. We consider the following causes of side effects through a function call: 1. Performing I/O. 2. Modifying global variables. 3. Modifying local permanent variables (like static variables in C). 4. Modifying an argument passed by reference. 5. Modifying a local variable, either automatic or static, of a function higher up in the function call sequence (usually via a pointer).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of side effects, a program's behaviour may depend on history; that is, the order of evaluation matters. Understanding and debugging a function with side effects requires knowledge about the context and its possible histories.&lt;ref&gt;“Research Topics in Functional Programming” ed. D. Turner, Addison-Wesley, 1990, pp 17–42. Retrieved from: {{Citation|last=Hughes|first=John|title=Why Functional Programming Matters|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/courses/cs345/whyfp.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Collberg|title=CSc 520 Principles of Programming Languages|url=http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~collberg/Teaching/520/2005/Html/Html-24/index.html|publisher= Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Side effects are the most common way that a program interacts with the outside world (people, filesystems, other computers on networks). The degree to which side effects are used depends on the programming paradigm. [[Imperative programming]] is known for its frequent utilization of side effects. 

In [[functional programming]], side effects are rarely used. The lack of side effects makes it easier to do [[formal verification]]s of a program. Functional languages such as [[Standard ML]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] do not restrict side effects, but it is customary for programmers to avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.htdp.org/ Matthias Felleisen et al., ''How To Design Programs'', MIT Press]&lt;/ref&gt; The functional language [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] expresses side effects such as [[Input/output|I/O]] and other stateful computations using [[Monad (functional programming)|monadic]] actions.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell 98 report, http://www.haskell.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Imperative Functional Programming'', Simon Peyton Jones and Phil Wadler, ''Conference Record of the 20th Annual ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages'', pages 71&amp;ndash;84, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Assembly language]] programmers must be aware of ''hidden'' side effects—instructions that modify parts of the processor state which are not mentioned in the instruction's mnemonic. A classic example of a hidden side effect is an arithmetic instruction that implicitly modifies [[status register|condition codes]] (a hidden side effect) while it explicitly modifies a [[processor register|register]] (the overt effect). One potential drawback of an [[instruction set]] with hidden side effects is that, if many instructions have side effects on a single piece of state, like condition codes, then the logic required to update that state sequentially may become a performance bottleneck. The problem is particularly acute on some processors designed with [[instruction pipeline|pipelining]] (since 1990) or with [[out-of-order execution]]. Such a processor may require additional control circuitry to detect hidden side effects and stall the pipeline if the next instruction depends on the results of those effects.

== Referential transparency ==
{{Main|Referential transparency}}
Absence of side effects is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for referential transparency. Referential transparency means that an expression (such as a function call) can be replaced with its value. This requires that the expression is [[Pure function|pure]], that is to say the expression must be [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] (always give the same [[Value (computer science)|value]] for the same input) and side-effect free. A function without side effects can return different values according to its history or its environment, for example if its output depends on the value of a local static variable or a non-local variable respectively.

== Temporal side effects ==
Side effects caused by the time taken for an operation to execute are usually ignored when discussing side effects and referential transparency. There are some cases, such as with hardware timing or testing, where operations are inserted specifically for their temporal side effects e.g. &lt;code&gt;sleep(5000)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000; ++i) {}&lt;/code&gt;. These instructions do not change state other than taking an amount of time to complete.

== Idempotence ==
{{Main|Idempotence#Computer science meaning}}
A function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; with side effects is said to be idempotent under sequential composition &lt;code&gt;f; f&lt;/code&gt; if, when called twice with the same list of arguments, the second call has no side effects {{Citation needed span|and returns the same value as the first call|date=December 2017}} (assuming no other procedures were called between the end of the first call and the start of the second call).

For instance, consider the following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
x = 0

def setx(n):
    global x
    x = n

setx(5)
setx(5)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, &lt;code&gt;setx&lt;/code&gt; is idempotent because the second call to &lt;code&gt;setx&lt;/code&gt; (with the same argument) does not change the visible program state: &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; was already set to 5 in the first call, and is again set to 5 in the second call, thus keeping the same value. Note that this is distinct from [[Idempotence#Unary operation|idempotence]] under function composition &lt;code&gt;f ∘ f&lt;/code&gt;. For example, the [[absolute value]] is idempotent under function composition:

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
def abs(n):
    if n &lt; 0:
        return -n
    else:
        return n

abs(-5) == abs(abs(-5)) == abs(5) == 5
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example ==
One common demonstration of side effect behavior is that of the [[assignment operator]] in [[C++]]. For example, assignment returns the right operand and has the side effect of assigning that value to a variable. This allows for syntactically clean multiple assignment:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
int i, j;
i = j = 3;
&lt;/source&gt;

Because the operator [[Operator associativity#Right-associativity of assignment operators|right associates]], this equates to

&lt;source lang = "cpp"&gt;
int i, j;
i = (j = 3);  // j = 3 returns 3, which then gets assigned to i
&lt;/source&gt;

Where the result of assigning 3 into &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; then gets assigned into &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;. This presents a potential hangup for novice programmers who may confuse

&lt;source lang = "cpp"&gt;
while (b == 10) {}  // tests if b evaluates to 10
&lt;/source&gt;

with

&lt;source lang = "cpp"&gt;
while (b = 10) {}  // = returns 10 which automatically casts to true so the test is always true
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Structural complexity''' is a science of [[applied mathematics]], that aims at relating fundamental physical or biological aspects of a [[complex system]] with the mathematical description of the morphological complexity that the system exhibits, by establishing rigorous relations between mathematical and physical properties of such system (Ricca 2005). 

Structural complexity emerges from all systems that display morphological organization (Nicolis &amp; Prigogine 1989). Filamentary structures, for instance, are an example of [[Lagrangian_coherent_structures |coherent structures]] that emerge, interact and evolve in many physical and biological systems, such as mass distribution in the [[Shape of the universe|Universe]], [[Vortex |vortex filaments]] in turbulent flows, [[neural networks]] in our brain and genetic material (such as [[DNA]]) in a cell. In general information on the degree of morphological [[Order_and_disorder_(physics) |disorder]] present in the system tells us something important about fundamental physical or biological processes.

Structural complexity methods are based on applications of [[differential geometry]] and [[topology]] (and in particular [[knot theory]]) to interpret physical properties of [[dynamical systems]] (Abraham &amp; Shaw 1992; Ricca 2009), such as relations between [[kinetic energy]] and tangles of vortex filaments in a turbulent flow or [[magnetic energy]] and braiding of magnetic fields in the solar corona, including aspects of [[topological fluid dynamics]].

'''The Energy and Resources Institute''' (TERI) is a [[research institute]] based in [[New Delhi]] that conducts research work in the fields of energy, environment and sustainable development. Established in 1974, it was formerly known as Tata Energy and Research Institute.  As the scope of its activities widened, it was renamed The Energy and Resources Institute in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/teri-stays-teri-but-says-ta-ta-to-tata/70815/|title=Teri Stays Teri, But Says Ta-Ta To Tata|date=|publisher=Financialexpress.com|accessdate=2003-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bombay House, Tata Group Headquarters in Mumbai.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bombay House]] the head office of Tata Group from where TERI started operations]]

The origins of TERI lie in [[Mithapur]], a remote town in [[Gujarat]], where a TATA engineer, Darbari Seth, was concerned about the enormous quantities of energy his factory spent on [[desalination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/teri-championing-the-green-alternative/articleshow/5420185.cms?from=mdr |title=Championing the green alternative |publisher=Economic Times |date=2 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the idea of a research institute to tackle the depletion of natural resources and energy scarcity. [[J. R. D. Tata]], chairman of the [[Tata Group|TATA Group]], liked the idea and accepted the proposal. TERI was set up with a modest corpus of 35 million rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.teriin.org/themes/teriday/pdf/5-DSMLecture2006Fifth.pdf |title=Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture 2006 | date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the invitation of the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], TERI was registered in Delhi in 1974 as the Tata Energy Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://envfor.nic.in/envis/compendium/21-teri.pdf |title=ENVIS Centre on Renewable Energy and Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
TERI initially began its operations in the [[Bombay House]], Mumbai, headquarters  of [[Tata Group|Tata]]. In 1984, it moved to Delhi where it continued to operate out on the rented premises (which included the [[India International Centre]] ) for almost a decade. In 1993, the organization set up its permanent base in Darbari Seth Block, named after its founder, in the [[India Habitat Centre]] complex located at Lodhi Road, New Delhi. Today TERI has a global presence with many centres in India and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teriin.org/network-linkages | title=Location and Linkages - TERI | date=15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood''''' is a [[book]] by science history writer [[James Gleick]] published in March 2011 which covers the genesis of our current [[information age]]. It was on the [[New York Times]] [[New York Times best seller list|best-seller list]] for three weeks following its debut.&lt;ref name="bestseller"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-03-27/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|title=Best Sellers|date=27 May 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

''The Information'' has also been published in [[ebook]] formats by [[HarperCollins|Fourth Estate]] and [[Random House]], and as an [[audiobook]] by [[Random House Audio]]. 

==Synopsis==

Gleick begins with the tale of colonial European explorers and their fascination with African [[talking drums]] and their observed use to send [[Complexity|complex]] and widely understood messages back and forth between villages far apart, and over even longer distances by relay. Gleick transitions from the information implications of such drum signaling to the impact of the arrival of long distance [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] and then [[telephone]] communication to the commercial and social prospects of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial age]] west. Research to improve these technologies ultimately led to our understanding the essentially [[Digital data|digital]] nature of [[information]], quantized down to the unit of the [[bit]] (or [[qubit]]).

Starting with the development of symbolic written language (and the eventual perceived need for a [[dictionary]]), Gleick examines the history of intellectual insights central to [[information theory]], detailing the key figures responsible such as [[Claude Shannon]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[Ada Byron]], [[Samuel Morse]], [[Alan Turing]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler]]. The author also delves into how digital information is now being understood in relation to [[Digital physics|physics]] and [[genetics]]. Following the circulation of [[Claude Shannon]]'s ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]'' and [[Norbert Wiener]]'s ''[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine|Cybernetics]]'' many disciplines attempted to jump on the information theory bandwagon to varying success. Information theory concepts of [[data compression]] and [[error correction]] became especially important to the computer and electronics industries.

Gleick finally discusses [[Wikipedia]] as an emerging internet based [[Library of Babel]], investigating the implications of its expansive user generated content, including the ongoing [[Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia|struggle]] between inclusionists, deletionists, and [[Vandalism on Wikipedia|vandals]]. Gleick uses the [[Jimmy Wales]] created article for the Cape Town butchery restaurant [[Mzoli's]] as a case study of this struggle. The flood of information humanity is now exposed to presents new challenges Gleick says, as we retain more of our information now than at any previous point in human history, it takes much more effort to delete or remove unwanted information than to accumulate it. This is the ultimate [[entropy]] cost of generating additional information and the answer to slay [[Maxwell's Demon]].

==Reception==

In addition to winning major awards for science writing and history, ''The Information'' received mostly positive reviews. In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] said it is "so ambitious, illuminating and sexily theoretical that it will amount to aspirational reading for many of those who have the mettle to tackle it." Other admirers were [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] for ''[[The Daily Beast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carr|first=Nicholas|title=Drowning in Beeps|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-03-01/the-information-by-james-gleick-review-by-nicholas-carr/|accessdate=23 May 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[physicist]] [[Freeman Dyson]] for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dyson|first=Freeman|title=How We Know|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/mar/10/how-we-know/|accessdate=23 May 2011|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction author [[Cory Doctorow]] in his [[BoingBoing]] review called Gleick "one of the great science writers of all time", "Not a biographer of scientists... but a biographer of the ''idea'' itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|title=James Gleick's tour-de-force: The Information, a natural history of information theory|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2011/03/24/james-gleicks-tour-d.html|accessdate=15 June 2011|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Wu]] for [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] praised "a mind-bending explanation of theory" but wished Gleick had examined the economic importance of information more deeply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wu|first=Tim|title=Bit by Bit: James Gleick on the fascinating quest to understand and wield information.|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2011/03/bit_by_bit.html|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Pindar writing for ''[[The Guardian]]''  complained that ''The Information'' does not fully address the relationship between social control of information ([[censorship]], [[propaganda]]) and access to [[political power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pindar|first=Ian|title=How a costly toy came to transform our world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/30/information-history-james-gleick-review|accessdate=23 May 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies''' ('''UTIAS''', {{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|t|aɪ|ə|s}} {{respell|yoo|TY|əs}}) is an advanced research facility for [[aeronautics]] and [[aerospace engineering]], located in the [[Downsview]] district of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Established in 1949 by founding Director Gordon N. Patterson, the institute is managed by the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering]] and mainly receives funding from governmental agencies such as the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]], the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] and the [[Canadian space agency|Canadian Space Agency]]. Notable international sponsors include the [[European Space Agency]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], [[Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik]], [[NASA Ames Research Center]] and the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]].

==History==

In 1970, the institute was involved in the emergency rescue of the [[Apollo 13]] astronauts, after the mission was aborted by a major accident en route to the Moon. UTIAS was contacted for assistance due to its expertise in shockwaves and aerospace dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=220 |title=An Account of UTIAS Involvement in the Rescue of Apollo 13 |last=Sullivan |first=Phil |publisher=University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers and scientists at UTIAS calculated the amount of pressure needed to separate the [[Lunar Module]] from the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] without damaging the hatch, allowing the crew to survive the re-entry to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casmuseum.org/common/PDF/pressreleases/CASM_Apollo_13_Release_2010.pdf |title=Canadians celebrate Canada's contribution to the safe return of the Apollo 13 astronauts on 40th anniversary of original space mission |publisher=[[Canadian Air and Space Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observing the 40th anniversary of the incident in 2010, lunar module pilot [[Fred Haise]] wrote a letter thanking the UTIAS team for its contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiac.ca/success-stories/utias-bringing-apollo-13-home.aspx |title=UTIAS - Bringing Apollo 13 Home |publisher=Aerospace Industries Association of Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523072844/http://www.aiac.ca/success-stories/utias-bringing-apollo-13-home.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=October 2013}} the institute has produced the world's first [[microwave]]-powered aircraft, the world's first engine-powered [[ornithopter]] (both inventions of [[James DeLaurier]]), and Canada's first [[space telescope]], [[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]].  The major expertise areas represented are [[aerospace engineering|aircraft design]], particularly at [[subsonic flight|subsonic]] speeds, [[flight simulation]], space [[mechatronics]] and [[robotics]], [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellite]] technology, [[computational fluid dynamics]] and [[nuclear fusion]]. The institute's partners in the aerospace industry include [[Bombardier Aerospace]], [[MD Robotics]] (formerly [[Spar Aerospace]]) and [[General Atomics]]. It operates the [[Canadian Advanced Nanospace eXperiment Program]] for the study and testing of nanosatellite technology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
