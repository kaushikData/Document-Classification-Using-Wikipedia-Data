:''See also [[Alcazar Theatre (1911)]] and [[Alcazar Theatre (1976)]] for two other SF theaters of the same name.''

The '''Alcazar Theatre''' was a [[theater (structure)|theatre]] at 116 O'Farrell Street, between Stockton and Powell, in [[San Francisco, California]]. Opened in 1885, the structure served as a [[lecture]] and [[music hall]], but soon housed a popular resident [[repertory|stock company]], which included [[Maude Adams]], under the management of the younger brother of [[David Belasco]], [[Fred Belasco]].

The Alcazar Theatre was destroyed in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. In 1911, another [[Alcazar Theatre (1911)|Alcazar Theatre]] opened one block to the west.

'''Aëdon''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀηδών}}) was in [[Greek mythology]], the daughter of [[Pandareus]] of [[Ephesus]]. According to Homer she was the wife of [[Amphion and Zethus|Zethus]], and the mother of [[Itylus]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' xix. 517, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
Envious of [[Niobe]], the wife of her husband's brother [[Amphion]], who had six sons and six daughters, she formed the plan of killing the eldest of Niobe's sons, but by mistake slew her own son Itylus. Zeus relieved her grief by changing her into a [[nightingale]], whose melancholy tunes are represented by the poet as Aëdon's lamentations about her child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to a later tradition preserved in [[Antoninus Liberalis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], c. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Aëdon is instead the wife of Polytechnos, an artist of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]].  The couple boasted that they loved each other more than [[Hera]] and [[Zeus]].  Hera sent [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] to cause trouble between the two of them.  Polytechnus was then making a chair, and Aëdon a piece of [[embroidery]], and they agreed that whoever should finish the work first should receive from the other a female slave as the prize.  Polytechnos was furious when Aëdon (with Hera's help) won.  He went to Aëdon's father, and pretending that his wife wished to see her sister Chelidonis, he took her with him.  On his way home he [[rape]]d her, dressed her in slave's attire, commanded her to silence, and gave her to his wife as the promised prize.  After some time Chelidonis, believing herself unobserved, lamented her own fate, but she was overheard by Aëdon, and the two sisters conspired against Polytechnus for revenge.  They murdered Polytechnos' son [[Itys]] and served him up as a meal to his father.

Aëdon then fled with Chelidonis to her father, who, when Polytechnos came in pursuit of his wife, had him bound, smeared with honey, and exposed to the insects.  Aëdon now took pity upon the sufferings of her husband, and when her relations were on the point of killing her for this weakness, Zeus changed Polytechnos into a [[pelican]], the brother of Aëdon into a whoop, her father into a sea-eagle, Chelidonis into a [[swallow]], and Aëdon herself into a [[nightingale]].  This myth seems to have originated in mere [[etymology|etymologies]], and is of the same class as that about [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] and [[Procne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | contribution = Aedon  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 23–24  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0032.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berlin State Opera''' ('''{{lang-de|Staatsoper Unter den Linden}}''') is a [[Germany|German]] opera company based in [[Berlin]]. Its permanent home is the Staatsoper [[Unter den Linden]], commonly referred to as ''Lindenoper'', in the central [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] district, which also hosts the [[Staatskapelle Berlin]] orchestra. Originally the ''Hofoper'' (court opera) from 1742, it was named ''Königliches Opernhaus'' (Royal Opera House) in 1844, and ''Staatsoper Unter den Linden'' in 1918. From 1949 to 1990 it housed the state opera of [[East Germany]]. Since 2004, the State Opera company belongs to the Berlin Opera Foundation, like the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], the [[Komische Oper Berlin]], the [[Berlin State Ballet]], and the Bühnenservice Berlin (Stage and Costume Design).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oper-in-berlin.de/en_EN/news/index/ Oper in Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:Berlin Opernhaus um 1745.jpg|thumb|The Court Opera, about 1745]]
King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] shortly after his accession to the throne commissioned the original building on the site. Construction work began in July 1741 with what was designed by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] to be the first part of a "Forum Fredericianum" on present-day [[Bebelplatz]]. Although not entirely completed, the Court Opera (''Hofoper'') was inaugurated with a performance of Carl Heinrich Graun's ''[[Cesare e Cleopatra]]'' on December 7, 1742. This event marked the beginning of the successful, 250-year co-operation between the Staatsoper and the [[Staatskapelle Berlin]], the state orchestra, whose roots trace back to the 16th century.

In 1821, the Berlin Opera—hosted at the [[Schauspielhaus Berlin]]—gave the premiere of Weber's ''[[Der Freischütz]]''. In 1842, [[Wilhelm Taubert]] instituted the tradition of regular symphonic concerts. In the same year, [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] succeeded [[Gaspare Spontini]] as General Music Director. [[Felix Mendelssohn]] also conducted symphonic concerts for a year.
[[File:Koenigliches opernhaus berl.jpg|thumb|Interior, rebuilt after the fire in 1843]]
On August 18, 1843 the Linden Opera was destroyed by fire. The reconstruction of the building was supervised by architect [[Carl Ferdinand Langhans]], and the Königliches Opernhaus (Royal Opera House) was inaugurated the following autumn by a performance of Meyerbeer's ''[[Ein Feldlager in Schlesien]]''. In 1849, Otto Nicolai's ''[[Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor]]'' was premiered at the Royal Opera House, conducted by the composer.

===20th century===
[[File:BerlinStaatsoper.JPG|thumb|Auditorium, view to the stage]]
At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the Royal Court Opera, Berlin, attracted many illustrious conductors. They included [[Felix von Weingartner]], [[Karl Muck]], [[Richard Strauss]], and [[Leo Blech]]. After the collapse of the [[German Empire]] in 1918, the Opera was renamed ''Staatsoper unter den Linden'' and the ''Königliche Kapelle'' became ''Kapelle der Staatsoper''.

In the 1920s, [[Kurt Adler]], [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]], [[Erich Kleiber]], [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]], [[Bruno Walter]] occupied the conductor's post. In 1925, [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Wozzeck]]'', was given its premiere in a production conducted by [[Erich Kleiber]] in the composer's presence.

After having undergone an extensive renovation, the Linden Opera reopened on 28 April 1928 with a new production of Mozart's ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]''. The cast included [[Delia Reinhardt]], [[Richard Tauber]], [[Friedrich Schorr]] and [[Leo Schützendorf]], conducted by Erich Kleiber. The same year, the famous [[Russia]]n bass [[Feodor Chaliapin]] and [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s ''[[Ballets Russes]]'' with conductor [[Ernest Ansermet]] were guest performers. In 1930 Erich Kleiber conducted the premiere of Darius Milhaud's ''[[Christophe Colomb]]''. However, in 1934, when symphonic pieces from Alban Berg's ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' were performed by Kleiber, the [[National Socialists]] provoked a scandal and the conductor was forced into exile.

After [[Hitler]]'s [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Machtergreifung|takeover]], members of [[Jew]]ish origin were dismissed from the ensemble. Many German musicians associated with the opera went into exile, including the conductors [[Kurt Adler]], [[Otto Klemperer]] and [[Fritz Busch]]. [[Clemens Krauss]] became a prominent German conductor first at the Berlin State Opera in 1933 and was then appointed as its director in 1935 due to Fritz Busch and Erich Kleiber resigning, respectively, their positions in protest over Nazi rule. During the [[Third Reich]], [[Robert Heger]], [[Herbert von Karajan]] (1939–1945) and Johannes Schüler were the "Staatskapellmeister".
 
* 1938: [[Werner Egk]] conducted the first night of his opera ''[[Peer Gynt (opera)|Peer Gynt]]'' on 24 November. [[Herbert von Karajan]]'s interpretation of ''Die Zauberflöte'' was performed on 18 December. Karajan continued as Generalmusikdirektor, the principal musical director of the Staatsoper Unter den Linden between 1941 and 1945.
* 1939: Karajan conducted a performance of [[Rudolf Wagner-Régeny]]'s ''Die Bürger von Calais''.
* 1940: On 21 October, Karajan conducted a symphonic concert with the Staatskapelle at the [[Berlin Philharmonic#Concert halls|Old Philharmonic]].
* 1942: The Lindenoper was bombed in 1941. The house reopened on 12 December with Furtwängler's interpretation of Wagner's ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''.
* 1944: When [[Joseph Goebbels]] proclaimed his "[[total war]]", the Staatsoper was closed. The last performance before was Mozart's ''[[Le nozze di Figaro]]'', conducted by Johannes Schüler on 31 August. The Staatskapelle continued to perform symphonic and opera concerts. On 4 and 5 October, Karajan conducted Bruckner's [[Symphony No. 8 (Bruckner)|Eighth Symphony]].
* 1945: The Lindenoper was once again destroyed [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II#The largest American raid on Berlin|on February 3]]. The concerts were relocated to the Admiralspalast and the Schauspielhaus. On 18 February, Karajan conducted his last symphonic concert with the Staatskapelle in the Beethoven hall.

===Postwar years===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-11116-0001, Berlin, Deutsche Staatsoper, Außenansicht.jpg|thumb|Damaged opera house, 1951 condition]]

The second rebuilding took a long time. From 1945, the opera company played in the former ''[[Admiralspalast]]'' (today's ''Metropoltheater''). From 1949, the company served as the state opera of [[East Germany]]. It moved back to its original home after the rebuilding in freely adapted baroque forms was finally completed in 1955. The newly rebuilt opera house was opened, again, with Wagner's ''Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg''. The capacity is now about 1,300. After the [[Berlin Wall]] was built in 1961, the Opera was somewhat isolated, but still maintained a comprehensive repertoire that featured the classic and romantic period together with contemporary ballet and operas.

After reunification, the Linden Opera rejoined the operatic world. Important works that had already performed in the past were rediscovered and discussed anew within the framework of a "Berlin Dramaturgy". Baroque Opera in particular was at the center of attention, with Graun's ''Cleopatra e Cesare'', Keiser's ''[[Croesus (opera)|Croesus]]'', [[Florian Leopold Gassmann]]'s ''L'opera seria'' and Scarlatti's ''[[Griselda (A. Scarlatti)|Griselda]]''. These works were performed by Belgian conductor [[René Jacobs]] together with the [[Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin]] and the [[Freiburger Barockorchester]] on [[Historically informed performance|period instruments]]. In the 1990s, the opera was officially renamed ''Staatsoper Unter den Linden''.

In 1992, the [[Argentina|Argentine]]-[[Israel]]i conductor [[Daniel Barenboim]] was appointed Music Director. In 2000, the orchestra (according to its official website) elected Barenboim "conductor for life." During the 2002 ''Festtage'', he led a Wagner cycle in ten parts, a production created in collaboration with director [[Harry Kupfer]].

Since 2009, the Berlin State Opera has been undergoing considerable renovation work led by German architect [[HG Merz]]. The roof of the opera building was raised and the [[proscenium]] prolonged to improve the acoustics. Other renovation and extension works include the director's building, the below-ground connection building and the depot building. The latter will house the new rehearsal center.

The house was reopened in 2017 with premieres of Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' and Monteverdi's ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'' on one weekend.&lt;ref name="BZ" /&gt;

'''Boi''' is a style of Central [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonian]] [[folk music]] now moving into the mainstream in [[Brazil]]. It is a combination of traditional Amazonian rhythms with African and European influence. The genre was made known throughout Brazil after Amazonian group [[Carrapicho]]'s hit "[[Tic Tic Tac]]".

'''''Charles I Insulted by Cromwell's Soldiers''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the French artist [[Hippolyte Delaroche]], depicting [[Charles I of England]] taunted by the victorious soldiers of [[Oliver Cromwell]] after the [[Second English Civil War]], prior to his execution in 1649. Completed in 1836, it is thought to be one of Delaroche's greatest masterpieces. It was displayed as part of the [[Orleans Collection#Bridgewater collection|Bridgewater Collection]] in London, although it was latterly thought to have been lost when, during [[The Blitz]] of 1941, a German bomb struck close to [[Bridgewater House, Westminster|Bridgewater House]], causing shrapnel damage to the canvas in the ensuing explosion. In 2009 it was rediscovered in Scotland in an unexpectedly good condition, having been rolled up and stored after the war, but recorded in the intervening years as badly damaged or destroyed. After a partial restoration it went on display in the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London, in an exhibition re-appraising Delaroche's work. After the exhibition, it is to be fully restored.

==Subject==
[[File:DelarocheCromwell.jpg|thumb|right|In ''Cromwell and Charles I'' painted in 1831, Delaroche also depicts Charles I, with Cromwell standing over his dead body]]
''Charles I Insulted'' features Charles I, the King of England, who had by 1648 lost the Second English Civil War fought against Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army, after the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]]. By January 1649, he was being put on trial for treason, and on 30 January, he was [[Decapitation|beheaded]].

The painting depicts Charles in the days before his execution, being bullied and taunted by Cromwell's defiant troops, one of whom is blowing [[Pipe smoking|pipe smoke]] in his face.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt; The deposed king remains calm, holding a book which he appears to have been reading.

==Ownership==
[[Hippolyte Delaroche|Delaroche]]'s ''Charles I Insulted'' was commissioned by [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere]],&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt; who was known as Lord Francis Leveson-Gower until 1833 when, following the death of his father, he was created the first [[Earl of Ellesmere]], inheriting [[Bridgewater House, Westminster|Bridgewater House]] in London from his bachelor great uncle, [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph22Sep2000SutherlandObituary/&gt; The family line of the Earls of Ellesmere became the Dukes of Sutherland when, in 1963, [[John Egerton, 6th Duke of Sutherland|John Egerton, 5th Earl of Ellesmere]], succeeded to the title of duke of Sutherland on the death of the 5th Duke of Sutherland with no male heir in the elder line.&lt;ref name=Telegraph22Sep2000SutherlandObituary/&gt; As of its rediscovery in 2009, the painting remained privately owned by the present Duke, [[Francis Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland]].&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; The 7th Duke was the 6th Duke's cousin and heir to the Dukedom, since the 6th Duke had no children himself.&lt;ref name=Telegraph22Sep2000SutherlandObituary/&gt;

==History==

===1836 to 2009===
''Charles I Insulted'' is a large piece, painted on a canvas measuring {{convert|13|ft|m}} by {{convert|10|ft|m}}.,&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt; also described as being nearly three metres square.&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt; It was completed in 1836.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt; It was first displayed at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1837,&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt; and in 1838 at the [[British Institution]] in London. The painting was then hung for decades as part of the semi-public [[Orleans Collection#Bridgewater collection|Bridgewater Collection]] in Bridgewater House in London.&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;

The painting suffered serious damage during a Second World War German bombing raid on London. Unlike other collections, the Bridgewater artworks had not been stored underground before the war, due to the 5th Earl having been captured at [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt; On 11 May 1941, during the last night and most deadly raid of what became known as [[The Blitz]], one bomb landed on the street outside Bridgewater House, leaving a {{convert|3|m|ft}} deep [[bomb crater]]. Hanging in the dining room at the time, the painting suffered extensive [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] damage.&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; At least four paintings in the collection were totally destroyed in the raid, while others less damaged were eventually restored.&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt; ''Charles I Insulted'' was demounted, and rolled up, having been given a rudimentary repair using paper to hold together the largest tears.&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt; After the war, it was transported to [[Mertoun House]] in [[St. Boswells]], [[Scottish Borders]], the family's Scottish home, for storage.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph22Sep2000SutherlandObituary/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt;

While stored safe and dry in Mertoun, over the next 68 years the existence of the painting was gradually forgotten about by its owners, and presumed by the art world to be lost as irreparably damaged in the raid.&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; In subsequent catalogues of Delaroche's work, it had been listed as either 'badly damaged' or sometimes 'destroyed'.&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt;

===2009 onwards===
The painting was rediscovered in the summer of 2009 by National Gallery curators, after they made enquiries about the painting as they prepared a Delaroche exhibition.&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mail26Nov2009Found/&gt; The 2010 exhibition was to be the first major show on Delaroche to be held in Britain, aiming to re-assess the works of Delaroche, who fell out of fashion during the early 20th century, and featuring his most famous work from the National Gallery collection, ''[[The Execution of Lady Jane Grey]]'' (1833), which was also a rediscovered work: it had been thought lost when the Tate Gallery was [[1928 Thames flood|flooded in 1928]], and found rolled up in 1973.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;

On 7 June 2009 at Mertoun, it was unrolled for the first time since being moved to Scotland.&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; To the surprise of those present, the painting was largely intact, having "lost none of its intensity".&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt; The explosion damage consisted of around 200 individual tears in the canvas, which still contained plaster fragments and dust from the blast.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times13Feb2010StarPariah/&gt;

After moving the painting to London, it was restored sufficiently to be able to be displayed in the exhibition, albeit with the shrapnel scars still visible, and "somewhat yellowed by a layer of discoloured varnish".&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times13Feb2010StarPariah/&gt; Because the canvas had been rolled up for nearly 70 years, it had to be weighed down flat for six weeks.&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt; The tears were then stitched together, and the canvas lined.&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt;

The painting's first ever public display since rediscovery was as part of the exhibition ''Painting History: Delaroche and Lady Jane Grey'', running from 24 February to 24 May 2010.&lt;ref name=BBC24Nov2009ReturningAfter70Years/&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt; It went on display on 23 February in a separate room in the museum's free admission area, with the main part of the exhibition held in the adjacent [[Sainsbury Wing]] of the gallery.&lt;ref name=Reuters23Feb2010WorkOnShow/&gt; The painting is to be fully restored after the London exhibition whereupon work would start to remove the discoloured varnish and retouch the damaged areas.&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters23Feb2010WorkOnShow/&gt;

==Reception==
According to the London National Gallery, it is "one of the great paintings on themes of English history for which Delaroche had become renowned", in which Delaroche was "able to imply striking parallels between the poignant fate of Charles and the recent course of French history".&lt;ref name=NatGallAMasterpieceRecoveredCharlesIInsulted/&gt; According to the gallery director [[Nicholas Penny]], the rediscovery was "huge" and its redisplay would be an historic moment, describing it as "an extraordinarily powerful work", "one of the great French paintings" and by "one of the greatest painters" of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; According to Penny, Delaroche, a Frenchman, was a notable painter of [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] history, as a method of "exploring the violence and vicissitudes of the [[French Revolution]]" without actually portraying the events themselves, which were regarded as too recent to paint.&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt;

According to the National Gallery's exhibition curator Christopher Riopelle, both ''Charles I Insulted'' and Delaroche's other painting, ''[[Marie-Antoinette]] Before the Tribunal'', painted fifteen years later in 1851, "suggest episodes of the [[suffering of Christ]]".&lt;ref name=Reuters23Feb2010WorkOnShow/&gt; Riopelle added that Delaroche's "obsession with English royalist history" was "classic displacement of what you want to talk about but can't, because it's still so raw and recent", particularly referring to [[Execution of Louis XVI|the execution]] of [[Louis XVI of France]] in January 1793, and nine months later of his Queen [[Marie Antoinette]].&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt;

[[Charlotte Higgins]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described it as "one of Delaroche's masterpieces", which "owes a debt" to [[Anthony van Dyck]]'s famous painting of Charles I.&lt;ref name=Guardian24Nov2009FearedLost/&gt; Higgins also said that it "clearly references the popular artistic subject of the [[mocking of Christ]] by his guards".&lt;ref name=Guardian23Feb2010Strike/&gt; According to Arifa Akbar of ''[[The Independent]]'', "Delaroche's monumental painting featuring Charles I as a Christ-like figure" is regarded as "one of Delaroche's most powerful pieces", commissioned at the "height of his fame".&lt;ref name=Independent24Nov2009Blitzed/&gt;

[[David Horspool]] of ''[[The Times]]'', reflecting on the fate of Delaroche's ''Execution of Lady Jane Grey'' which was relegated to a basement, in which it was later flood damaged, due to Delaroche's falling fame, said "there seems no chance that [''Charles I Insulted''] will be rolled up and put away. Delaroche's days as the forgotten master seem to be over", predicting the rediscovered piece would be perhaps "the most exciting exhibit to go on display" in the 2010 National Gallery exhibition.&lt;ref name=Times13Feb2010StarPariah/&gt;

'''''Communion: A True Story''''' is a book by [[United States|American]] [[ufologist]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] author [[Whitley Strieber]] that was first published in February 1987. The book is based on the experiences of Whitley Strieber, who experiences "lost time" and terrifying [[flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], which hypnosis undertaken by [[Budd Hopkins]] later links to an alleged encounter with aliens.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Groves in ''Skeptical - a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7316-5794-2}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was later made into [[Communion (1989 film)|a film]] directed by [[Philippe Mora]] and starring [[Christopher Walken]] as Strieber and [[Lindsay Crouse]] as his wife, [[Anne Strieber|Anne]].  A 2008 trade paperback edition presents a new preface by the author.

Strieber compares the "familiar" being he sees, whom he describes as female, to the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] goddess [[Ishtar]].

==Cover art==
The cover painting of an alien was rendered by [[Ted Seth Jacobs]]. The painting is considered one of the most widely recognized popular culture images of alleged "[[Grey alien|grey]]" aliens. "The ''Communion'' cover," Jacobs recounts,
:"was painted in my small apartment on East 83rd St, in New York City. Whitley sat with me first for a drawing of the Alien. As I sketched, he would indicate how to change the portrait so that it would more match what he saw. It was, I believe, the process used by police sketch artists. Every last detail was corrected according to his instructions. At one point, he said the image corresponded exactly to what he had seen. With Whitley beside me for the subsequent session, I began to paint the image on a wooden prepared panel, going through the same process as for the drawing, until Whitley finally said the image was exact. ... As to the gender of the Alien image, to tell the truth, the subject didn't come up. I don't even know if the 'greys' have gender as we understand it. Whitley corrected the developing image to have a certain fragility, a vulnerability. I suppose we Earthlings usually associate these qualities with femininity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondcommunion.com/communion/9910tsjacobs.html Bueche, W., "Ted Seth Jacobs: An interview with the artist"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821042337/http://www.beyondcommunion.com/communion/9910tsjacobs.html |date=2008-08-21 }} URL accessed Aug 18, 2008(1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cowles Art School''' (aka '''Cowles School of Art''') was a studio building on 148 Dartmouth Street, [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States, that was established in 1883 and continued operation until 1900.&lt;ref name="bacon1886"&gt;Edwin Munroe, George Bacon, Edward Ellis. Bacon’s Dictionary of Boston. 1886. P. 123-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of the largest art schools in the city, having several hundred scholars.

By the end of the 19th century, Boston had become an important art center.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} A number of highly respected artists were teaching in city. The rich environment for art had been promoted at least in part by the Massachusetts Drawing Act of 1870. The act mandated drawing lessons in public schools. To fill the need for art teachers, [[Massachusetts Normal Art]] (MNA) was established in 1873. Two blocks behind the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], in the New Studio Building near the [[Back Bay Station]], was the Cowles Art School (1883).

Cowles Art School offered instruction in figure drawing and painting from the flat cast and life, artistic anatomy, perspective and composition, painting still life, drawing and painting the head from life, drawing still life, oil and water colors, ad perspective.&lt;ref name="bacon1886" /&gt;

'''Defacement''', in [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], is the addition of a symbol or [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] to another flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/vxt-dv-d.html#deface |title=Deface |work=Dictionary of Vexillology |publisher=Flags of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nava.org/Flag%20Information/dictionary/index.html#D |title=Deface |work=Illustrated Dictionary of Vexillological Terms |publisher=North American Vexillological Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301211311/http://www.nava.org/Flag%20Information/dictionary/index.html |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand flag]] is the British [[Blue Ensign]] defaced with a [[Crux|Southern Cross]] in the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|fly]]. In the context of [[vexillology]], the word "deface" carries no negative connotations, in contrast to general usage. It simply indicates differentiation of the flag from that of another owner by addition of elements. For example, many [[state flag]]s are formed by defacing the national flag with a coat of arms.
==History==
Where countries pass through changes of regime with contrasting ideological orientations (monarchist/republican, fascist/democratic, communist/capitalist, secular/religious etc.)—all of which, despite their differences, claim allegiance to a common national heritage expressed in a venerated national flag—it can happen that a new regime defaces that flag with its own specific emblem while keeping the basic flag design unchanged.{{cn|date=May 2016}} Such changing ideological emblems appeared over time, among others, on the flags of [[Italy]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Germany]] (West and East, see illustration) [[Ethiopia]] and [[Iran]]. As a result, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], insurgents tore out of the national flag the emblem of the regime which they opposed and waved the flag itself with which they identified.  

An already defaced flag can be further defaced. For example, the [[Flag of Australia|Australian flag]] is a defaced [[Blue Ensign]]. The [[Australian Border Force Flag]] is further defaced with the words "Australian border force" in block letters.

In the United States, it is against the [[United States Flag Code|Flag Code]] to deface the [[Flag of the United States|national flag]] with advertising or with any other [[Seal (emblem)| sigil]], image or insignia. Such flags are nevertheless commercially available, depicting the seals of various branches of the [[U.S. military]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] related objects such as [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]]s or [[war bonnet]]s, and the like.

It is common for [[association football]] supporters travelling abroad for a match to bring a national flag defaced with the name of their hometown or a similar local identifier.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}
A '''devotional song''' is a [[hymn]] which accompanies religious observances and rituals. Traditionally devotional music has been a part of [[Christian music]], [[Hindu music]], [[Sufi music]], [[Buddhist music]], [[Islamic music]]  and [[Jewish music]]

Each major religion has its own tradition with devotional hymns. In the West, the devotional has been a part of the [[liturgy]] in [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and others, since their earliest days. A devotional is a part of the prayer service proper and is not, in these contexts, ornamentation.  During the [[Protestant Reformation]], church music in general was hotly debated. Some [[Puritan]]s objected to all ornament and sought to abolish choirs, hymns, and, inasmuch as liturgy itself was rejected, devotionals.

In Eastern and Near-Eastern religions, devotionals can function as communion prayer and meditation. These are sung in particular [[rhythms]] which are sustained over a prolonged period to give practitioners a [[mysticism|mystical]] experience. In [[Hindu music]], the genre arising out of the [[Bhakti movement]] (devotion), it takes forms like [[Bhajan]], [[Kirtan]] and [[Aarti]].&lt;ref name="GoswamiThielemann2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Saurabh Goswami|author2=[[Selina Sharma|Selina Thielemann]]|title=Music and Fine Arts in the Devotional Traditions of India: Worship Through Beauty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xEnT57bbZG8C|year= 2005|pages=2–10|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-811-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nijenhuis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emmie Te Nijenhuis|title=Kīrtana: Traditional South Indian Devotional Songs: Compositions of Tyāgarāja, Muttusvāmi Dīkṣitar and Śyāma Śāstri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BI8sygAACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|isbn=978-90-04-20933-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her travels eventually take her to New York, where she becomes a model for a homosexual feminine hygiene products mogul, known as The Countess, a few years later, he introduces her to his "beauty ranch" the Rubber Rose Ranch. The main plot revolves around the cowgirls who work at the ranch after they violently take over and drug the endangered whooping cranes who nest along the lake on their land making the once migratory birds stay. The cowgirls end up in a showdown with government agencies because the cranes won't leave the ranch and the cowgirls refuse to allow the men on the ranch to take the cranes.

''Even Cowgirls Get the Blues'' was shot throughout [[Oregon]]: [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Terrebonne, Oregon|Terrebonne]], [[Sisters, Oregon|Sisters]], and [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]].

==Reception==
The film was a critical and commercial failure. After its world premiere in September 1993 at the [[1993 Toronto International Film Festival]], the film was set to open, but due to the negative response, it was delayed for more editing. The picture opened in [[wide release]] on May 20, 1994 and grossed a mere $1,708,873&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{mojo title|evencowgirlsgettheblues|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues}}&lt;/ref&gt; on an estimated $8 million budget. It currently holds a 25% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 20 reviews.

According to film critic/historian [[Leonard Maltin]], "The novel was hopelessly dated, and there is not enough peyote in the entire American Southwest to render this movie comprehensible or endurable...K.D. Lang's score is the picture's sole worthy component."

===Accolades===
* [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]] - [[Uma Thurman]] (''nominated'' - lost to [[Sharon Stone]] for ''[[Intersection (1994 film)|Intersection]]'' and ''[[The Specialist]]'')
* [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress]] - [[Sean Young]] (''nominated'' - lost to [[Rosie O'Donnell]] for ''[[Car 54, Where Are You? (film)|Car 54, Where Are You?]]'', ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]'' and ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'')

The film is directed by [[Brillante Mendoza]].

''Foster Child'' is Brillante Mendoza's fourth feature film, following ''Manoro'' (2006). Mendoza is the fourth Filipino director whose work was screened in the Directors' Fortnight of the Cannes film fest.

==Plot==
Thelma (Cherry Pie Picache), together with her husband Dado (Dan Alvaro) and teenage sons Gerald (Alwyn Uytingco) and Yuri (Jiro Manio), are an urban poor family hired by a local foster care facility to provide temporary home and care to abandoned babies pending the latter's formal adoption. The inevitable separation is heart-rending for the foster family.

Thelma's foster child John-John (Kier Segismundo) is to be turned over to his adoptive American parents. Every moment with the 3-year-old John-John becomes more precious as Thelma goes through the day fulfilling her motherly duties for the last time—bathing John-John, feeding him, and bringing him to school where the boy participates in a school presentation.

'''''Fräulein Doktor''''' is a [[First World War]] [[spy film]] released in 1969, loosely based on the life of [[Elsbeth Schragmüller]]. It was an Italian and Yugoslavian co-production directed by [[Alberto Lattuada]], starring [[Suzy Kendall]] and [[Kenneth More]], and featuring [[Capucine]], [[James Booth]], [[Giancarlo Giannini]] and [[Nigel Green]]. It was produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and has a music score by [[Ennio Morricone]]. It was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the United States.

==Plot==
A woman spy and some male agents working for the Germans during [[World War I]] land at night near the British naval base at [[Scapa Flow]], from a U-boat. The British, led by Col. Foreman, ambush the landing party, capturing two of the men, but the woman gets away. Foreman fakes the [[Firing squad|execution]] of one of the spies, thus tricking the second one, Meyer, into becoming a double agent in the hopes of using him to capture his woman accomplice, whom Meyer identifies under the codename Fraulein Doktor. Fraulein Doktor is portrayed as a brilliant spy who stole a formula for a skin blistering gas similar to mustard gas which the Germans used to great effect against the Allies on the battlefield. 

Meanwhile, Fraulein Doktor seduces a laundryman to find out which ship [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] will be sailing on to Russia, and when it will sail. She then helps a German [[U-boat]] to sink [[HMS Hampshire (1903)|HMS ''Hampshire'']] outside Scapa Flow with Kitchener on it, taking his life. For this, she is awarded the Pour Le Merite. Meyer re-appears in Berlin and courts her. The German intelligence service is suspicious of Meyer's escape from the British, but use him to poison Fraulein Doktor because of her addiction to morphine.  Meyer is shown her dead body and later makes his way back to the British to confirm her death.

However, Fraulein Doktor's death was faked for Meyer's benefit so she would be free of suspicion for her next assignment, getting Allied defense plans for a German attack in Belgium.  Under cover as a Spanish contessa, she recruits Spanish nurses to staff a hospital train to serve the Allied front. During the trip from Spain to France, she brings aboard German agents who will impersonate Belgian officers to penetrate Belgium Army headquarters and steal the plans.

Col. Foremen is still not convinced of her death and shows up at the same army headquarters with Meyer in tow. The German agents steal the plans and in a deadly shootout with sentries, one gets away back to German lines.  The Germans then launch their attack with great success, but Col. Foreman confronts Fraulein Doktor. Meyer kills Foreman but is in turned killed by the advancing German troops.  Fraulein Doktor is then whisked away by the Germans, but suffers a breakdown as she is being driven off through all the carnage and death about her.

'''''Grey Gardens''''' is a 1975 American [[documentary film]] by [[Albert and David Maysles]]. The film depicts the everyday lives of two [[Recluse|reclusive]], formerly [[upper class]] women, a mother and daughter both named Edith Beale, who lived in poverty at [[Grey Gardens (estate)|Grey Gardens]], a derelict mansion at 3 West End Road in the wealthy [[Georgica Pond]] neighborhood of [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], New York. The film was screened at the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival]] but was not entered into the main competition.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2151/year/1976.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Grey Gardens |accessdate=2009-05-10|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellen Hovde]] and [[Muffie Meyer]] also directed, and [[Susan Froemke]] was the associate producer. The film's editors are credited as Hovde (who also edited ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' and ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]''), Meyer and Froemke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Official website|http://mayslesfilms.com/film/grey-gardens/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the film was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". In a 2014 ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' poll, film critics voted ''Grey Gardens'' the joint ninth best documentary film of all time.&lt;ref name="BBC-doc"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28602506 |title=Silent film tops documentary poll |accessdate=August 1, 2014 |publisher=BBC News |date=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Eh-village-map.gif|thumb|Map of [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton]]; the Beales lived at Georgica Pond in the southwest of the [[Administrative_divisions_of_New_York#Village|village]].]]
[[Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale]] (1895–1977), known as "Big Edie", and her daughter [[Edith Bouvier Beale]] (1917–2002), known as "Little Edie", were the aunt and the first cousin, respectively, of former US First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]]. The two women lived together at the [[Grey Gardens (estate)|Grey Gardens estate]] for decades with limited funds in increasing squalor and isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The top houses from the movies| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/propertypicturegalleries/9239346/The-top-houses-from-the-movies.html| newspaper=Daily Telegraph | location=London|date=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house was designed in 1897 by Joseph Greenleaf Thorpe and purchased in 1923 by "Big Edie" and her husband [[Phelan Beale]]. After Phelan left his wife, "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" lived there for more than 50 years. The house was called Grey Gardens because of the color of the dunes, the cement garden walls, and the sea mist.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.easthamptonhistory.org/events/greygardens08-info2.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422050405/http://www.easthamptonhistory.org/events/greygardens08-info2.html| archivedate=2009-04-22| accessdate=October 13, 2013|title=A Return to Grey Gardens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the fall of 1971 and into 1972, their living conditions—their house was infested by fleas, inhabited by numerous cats and raccoons, deprived of running water, and filled with garbage and decay—were exposed as the result of an article in the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' and a cover story in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheehy| first=Gail| title=The Secret Of Grey Gardens | publisher =''New York Magazine'' | url =http://nymag.com/news/features/56102/}} Retrieved on 20 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; after a series of inspections (which the Beales called "raids") by the [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] Health Department. With the Beale women facing eviction and the razing of their house, in the summer of 1972 Jacqueline Onassis and her sister [[Lee Radziwill]] provided the necessary funds to stabilize and repair the dilapidated house so that it would meet village codes.

Albert and David Maysles became interested in their story and received permission to film a documentary about the women, which was released in 1976 to wide critical acclaim. Their ''[[direct cinema]]'' technique left the women to tell their own stories.

==Production==
[[Albert and David Maysles]] initially came into contact with the Beales after [[Lee Radziwill]] suggested they make a documentary on her childhood in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] and brought them with her on a trip to Grey Gardens. According to Ellen Hovde, the initial film was being funded by Radziwill; when the Maysles attempted to show her their early footage of the Beales to convince her that a documentary about them was a better idea, Radziwill confiscated their negatives and withdrew her funding.

The Maysles brothers shot and recorded all the footage themselves. Ellen Hovde and [[Muffie Meyer]] received co-directing credit for their editing work.

==Soundtrack==
* Edith Bouvier Beale – "[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]" (music by [[Vincent Youmans]] and lyrics by [[Irving Caesar]])
* Edith Bouvier Beale – "We Belong Together" from ''[[Music in the Air]]'' (lyrics and book by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] and music by [[Jerome Kern]]) 
* Edith Bouvier Beale – "[[You and the Night and the Music]]" (music by [[Arthur Schwartz]] and lyrics by [[Howard Dietz]])
* Edith Bouvier Beale – "[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]" (written by [[Cole Porter]])

* Edith "Little Edie" Bouvier Beale – "[[Lili Marleen]]"

==Aftermath==
"Big Edie" died in 1977 and "Little Edie" sold the house in 1979 for $220,000 (${{Inflation|US|220000|1979|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to [[Sally Quinn]] and her husband, longtime ''[[Washington Post]]'' editor [[Ben Bradlee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/let-go | title=Let it Go | first=Joan | last=Acocella | work=[[The New Yorker]] | date=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who promised to restore the dilapidated structure (the sale agreement forbade razing the house). The couple subsequently restored the house and grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Bray |first=Sarah |date=2015-05-14 |title=This is What Grey Gardens Looks Like Now |url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/news/g1281/what-grey-gardens-looks-like-now/ |magazine=Town &amp; Country |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Little Edie" died in [[Florida]] in 2002 at the age of 84.

[[Jerry Torre]], the teenaged handyman shown in the documentary (nicknamed [[The Marble Faun]] by "Little Edie"), was sought by the filmmakers for years afterward, and was found by chance in 2005 driving a [[New York City]] taxicab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green| first=Adam| title=The Marble Faun | work=[[The New Yorker]] | date =March 6, 2006 | url =http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/06/060306ta_talk_green}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 documentary, ''The Marble Faun of Grey Gardens'' by Jason Hay and Steve Pelizza, showed that he was then a sculptor at The [[Art Students League of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2012/06/a-beautiful-youth-dark-days-and-redemption-for-the-gardener-of-grey-gardens-067223 |last=Smith |first=Melissa |publisher=[[Politico]] |title=A beautiful youth, dark days, and redemption for the gardener of 'Grey Gardens' |date=2012-06-12 |accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lois Wright]], one of the two birthday party guests in the film, has hosted a public television show in East Hampton since the 1980s. She wrote a book about her experiences at the house with the Beales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn=9780977746217 | last=Wright | first=Lois | title=My Life at Grey Gardens: 13 Months and Beyond, a True and Factual Book | url=http://www.loiswright.net/ | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Maysles made available previously unreleased footage for a special two-disc edition for [[the Criterion Collection]]. It included a new feature titled ''[[The Beales of Grey Gardens]]'', which also received a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]]. In 2018, a prequel, ''That Summer,'' shot in 1972 and using 16mm footage, was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/that-summer-review-1202740165/|title=That Summer Review|last=Weissberg|first=Jay|date=March 30, 2018|website=Variety|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5269">'''Grupo Santa Helena''', or '''Santa Helena Group''', was the name given by the critic [[Sérgio Milliet]] to the painters that met in the [[wikt:atelier|ateliers]] of [[Francisco Rebolo]] and [[Mario Zanini]] starting in the 1930s. The ateliers belonged to a [[Praça da Sé]] building named ''Palacete Santa Helena''. This building was demolished in 1971, when the [[List of São Paulo metro stations|Sé station]] of [[São Paulo Metro]] was built.

The Santa Helena Group was formed spontaneously, without any conceptual commitment. Most of its members were [[Italian Brazilian|Italian immigrants]], like [[Alfredo Volpi]] and [[Fulvio Pennacchi]]; sons of Italian immigrants, like [[Aldo Bonadei]], [[Alfredo Rizzotti]], Mario Zanini and [[Humberto Rosa (painter)|Humberto Rosa]]; some were [[Spanish people|Spanish immigrants]] like Francisco Rebolo; some [[Portuguese people|Portuguese immigrants]] like [[Manuel Martins (visual artist)|Manuel Martins]].

They all shared a humble origin, and worked as [[artisan]]s or [[proletariat|proletarian]]s. Rebolo, Volpi and Zanini were wall painters. [[Clóvis Graciano]] was a railroad worker. Fulvio Pennacchi was a butcher. Aldo Bonadei worked with [[costume design]] and [[embroidery]]. Rizzotti was an auto mechanic and a [[lathe]] worker. Manoel Martins was a [[goldsmith]]. Rebolo was a football player. Humberto Rosa and Pennacchi taught drawing. Painting was for the weekends or leisure time.

Most of them had courses in the ''[[Liceu de Artes e Ofícios de São Paulo|Liceu de Artes e Ofícios]]'' (or "Arts and Crafts Lyceum", that was one [[Liceo scientifico]]), or the ''Escola Profissional Masculina do Brás'' (or "Men's Professional School of Brás"). However, they reduced what they learned to drawing and painting techniques, not to the academic guiding of formal order, were they aware of that or not.

By this time, some painters associations were created in São Paulo, like the ''Sociedade Pró-Arte Moderna'' (or "Pro-Modern Art Society", aka SPAM) or ''Clube dos Artistas Modernos'' (CAM, or "Modern Artists Club"). They joined the participants of the ''[[Semana de Arte Moderna]]'' (or "Modern Art Week"). These groups were formed by intellectuals and members of the São Paulo elite, which kept a great distance from the Santa Helena members and other proletarian groups, about which they had little or no knowledge.

The group union, that lasted for years, can be explained as a reaction against the enormous prejudice that existed about the poor immigrants, that came not only from the pre-existent Brazilian elite families, but also from immigrants that became wealthy in Brazil. That prejudice was made clear in several criticisms that were directed to the Group's work, particularly when it started to cause a sensation, and to threaten positions already established.

Some Santa Helena artists had already studied art in Europe before arriving in Brazil; for instance Pennacchi, Rizzotti and Bonadei. All others had difficulty learning about the art created there, and could only be taught by teachers in Brazil. Bonadei was a student of [[Pedro Alexandrino]], [[Antonio Rocco (painter)|Antonio Rocco]] and [[Amadeo Scavone]]. Graciano was taught by [[Waldemar da Costa]], and Zanini was a [[Georg Elpons]] student.

The perseverance of the group, in its fight for survival, caused interest and attracted new friends and partners. So, in due time, the place became the meeting point of many other artists.

The Santa Helena Group's major achievement was to reveal some of the most important Brazilian visual artists of the 20th century.

==Exhibitions==

In 1937, an exhibition named ''[[Família Artística Paulista]]'', or "Artistic Family of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo" shown a set of artists, including the ''Grupo Santa Helena'', that could show their work publicly for the first time. From then on, the Grupo became known. They provoked the interest of [[Mário de Andrade]], that identified in them a "S&amp;atilde;o Paulo school of painting".

In 1940, the "Exhibition of French Painters", that presented [[Cézanne]], [[Picasso]], [[Braque]] and [[Juan Gris|Gris]], among others, caused an enormous impact and several components of the group started to redirect his work, what made them more distant of the Grupo's themes or in their formal aspects.

'''''Harikrishnans''''' is a 1998 Indian [[Malayalam]]-language detective comedy film written and directed by [[Fazil (director)|Fazil]]. The film was produced and distributed by Suchitra Mohanlal under the production company [[Pranavam Arts]] and starring [[Mohanlal]], [[Mammootty]], and [[Juhi Chawla]], along with [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]], [[Shamili]], [[Nedumudi Venu]], and [[Kunchacko Boban]]. The film received a great pre-release hype due to the combined screen presence of Mohanlal and Mammootty after a gap of several years. ''Harikrishnans'' was the highest-grossing Malayalam film of the year. The film was dubbed in Tamil with same name.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViSliQLmdKM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The Harikrishnans are of the most famous lawyer duos in India. To avoid confusion one is called as Hari and the other as Krishnan. They head the organization called Harikrishnan Associates, which consists of around 300 lawyers. They get engaged in a murder case of Guptan, who was allegedly killed by Gabriel. Gabriel is a friend of Hari's sister and Harikrishnans become the defense lawyers upon her request.

Harikrishnans begin investigation and come across Meera, a friend of Guptan. Both of them fall in love with her. After some trouble over the matter, they rediscover their friendship and get involved in the case again. They discover that Guptan actually died due to poisoning by his relatives who were doctors.

At the end Meera decides to go for a random method of choosing her lover as she liked both Harikrishnans equally. The film features multiple endings. One shows Krishnan winning the toss for being Meera's friend; the losing person Hari presumably becoming Meera's life partner and another shows Hari winning the toss for being Meera's friend; the losing person Krishnan presumably becoming Meera's life partner. There was also a third climax planned for the movie with [[Shahrukh Khan]]. He was proposed to do the role of lover of Juhi Chawla in the movie. But due to some technical problems finally it was cancelled.

==Release==
===Multiple endings===
''Harikrishnans'' had multiple climaxes to appease the fan base of the lead actors [[Mohanlal]] and [[Mammootty]]. This had also caused some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/lf/2003/06/17/stories/2003061701910200.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The scene was when Meera ([[Juhi Chawla]]) chooses one of them to be her friend among both the Harikrishnans. She admires both equally and goes for a selection method which her grandmother taught her, whenever she had to make tough decisions. She sets the method so as to choose her friend; the loser of the toss presumably becoming Mira's lover. One of the climax shots shows Hari (Mammootty) winning the toss and the other one Krishnan (Mohanlal) winning it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980912/25550174.html|title=Hari gets Meera, so does Krishnan in Fazil's Harikrishnans|work=[[Indian Express]]|date=12 September 1998 |accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harlequin print''' is a repeating pattern of contrasting diamonds or elongated squares standing on end.

== Origins ==
A harlequin is character from [[Commedia dell'arte]], a 16th-century Italian theater movement. Harlequins were witty, mischievous clowns.  Their early costumes were sewn together from fabric scraps.  Over time, the diamond pattern became associated with harlequins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7NuCOmcUQ9IC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=harlequin+history+fashion#v=onepage&amp;q=harlequin&amp;f=false|title=Fashion: The Definitive History of Costume and Style|last=DK|date=2012-10-01|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465407801|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1949–1950s==
Harlequin fabric was popularized in 1944 when [[Adele Simpson]] presented the harlequin print in a bold diamond design on the town suits she created. It was also featured in green and white with a green jacket and a black skirt.&lt;ref&gt;"Designer Studies Small-Town Needs", ''[[New York Times]]'', January 30, 1944, pg.  36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1949, [[Louella Ballerino]] employed a harlequin print motif in the [[jester blouse]] "sun and fun" fashions she made popular. The design appeared along with pointed collars, tipped with buttons reminiscent of bells, and jagged points which sometimes adorned an apron overskirt.&lt;ref&gt;"California Styles Exhibited Before 400 At Breakfast", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', October 26, 1949, Pg. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1950, Fashion Frocks of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] marketed a white [[Piqué (weaving)|piqué]] dress, with an exaggerated side drape, in a red, white, and black harlequin print piqué, It was sold directly to homes by housewife representatives.&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion-Of-Week", ''[[Philadelphia Tribune]]'', August 29, 1950,  pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tammis Keefe]], a cloth designer whose patterns appeared at [[Lord and Taylor]] in September 1952, used a harlequin print diamond pattern on a large cloth she crafted for a table setting show.&lt;ref&gt;"Table Settings And Mats On View", ''New York Times'',  September 10, 1952, pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 1954 article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', columnist Olga Curtis mentioned harlequin print fabrics and cellophane as very novel ideas in accessories.&lt;ref&gt;"'54 Decorator Ideas: Old Fashioned Accessories", ''Washington Post'', July 8, 1954,  pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sports costume In a harlequin print topped by bright orange received the most applause at a Simplicity Patterns Fashion Show at Sulzberger Junior High School, in March 1955. Presented by Norma Riseman, the orange wraparound blouse was one of many colorful fashions modeled for teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;"Sulzberger Previews Cute Spring Fashions", ''Philadelphia Tribune'', March 8, 1955, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1955 a silk  dress at Peck &amp; Peck had white, pink, and blue tints of harlequin print. The colors and diamond motif were embellished when worn together with a white cashmere sweater highlighted by spangles.&lt;ref&gt;"Decorated Sweaters Keep in trim with the Dress", ''New York Times'', June 27, 1955,
pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freddie Mercury]] was very well known for performing in various concerts during the late seventies in harlequin print trousers. He also wore them in his music video "[[Living on My Own]]".

== 1960s ==
Harlequin print became particularly popular in the 1960s, appearing on underwear, umbrellas, pajamas, ski wear, maternity clothes, and hosiery. A 1962 Picasso retrospective in New York fueled the trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2015/10/fun-furs.html|title=Merry Pranksters|website=FIDM Museum Blog|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s and 2000s==

Beene and Rowley employed harlequin prints in their fashion designs presented at spring fashion week in November 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"New York designers say sheer styles will rule", ''Philadelphia Tribune'',  November 8, 1996, pg. 2C.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2001 Ebony Fashion Fair designer [[Oscar de la Renta]] presented a multicolored harlequin print silk [[charmeuse]] gown with a skirt fashioned with accordion pleats and a halter top with a gold neck ring.&lt;ref&gt;"New York", ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', May 2001, pg. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Helga Grabstein.jpg|thumb|Helga Festival Gravestone]]

Calling „'''Helga!'''“ is a [[running gag]] at German concerts and festivals.

== Ritual==
A person may call for a ''[[Helga]]'',&lt;ref name="Neon"&gt;[http://www.neon.de/kat/freie_zeit/musik/88151.html Das Festival] auf neon.de&lt;/ref&gt; others answer and come to a chorus like group effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/de/music/faq/ &lt;2004-04-14&gt; Allgemeine Musiknewsgruppen-FAQ] auf faqs.org&lt;/ref&gt; „Helga ist tot!“ (Helga is dead) denies the helgaing request.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Thiel: [http://www.einslive.de/musik/extras/2011/06/festival_abc.jsp Das Festival-ABC] auf einslive.de&lt;/ref&gt; Further allegations se gravestones, memorials or graffiti. The background is unknown, some reports point to a rather rainy [[Hurricane Festival]] in [[Scheeßel]], where a high pressure cyclone called Helga was called for but didn't arrive in time. The call was namegiver for an annual prize for German festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festivalguide.de/derhelga/ Der Helga]&lt;/ref&gt; and is being  used by a service company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/wunderbar/festival-rituale-oliver-uschmann-ueber-crowdsurfing-und-helga-rufe-a-828387-4.html Rituale auf Festivals: Götter im Dixi, erhöret uns], Spiegel 2012

The '''Hittite Sun Disk''' or '''Hittite Sun Course''' is an ancient [[Anatolia]]n symbol dating back to the 5th century BC.

The disks can be divided into four distinct variations. These are Semi-circular, Diamond shaped, Circular with bulls' horn and circular of semicircular with a complex design including animals and horns. The last one of those types was replicated in a [[Hittite Sun Course Monument|monument]]. The sun disks have been found in at least 13 Royal Tombs from the early bronze age in [[Alacahöyük]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiccanrede.org/2014/07/tales-of-anatolia-from-ankara-to-hattusa-and-the-hittites-part-1/|title=Tales of Anatolia – from Ankara to Hattuşa and the Hittites – part 1|website=wiccanrede.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeless.com.au/hittitesunsymbol.html|title=HITTITE SUN SYMBOL - TIMELESS TOURS' LOGO - Timeless Tours Australia|website=www.timeless.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Description==
[[File:Sundisk Alacahoyuk.jpg|A sun disk found in tombs in Alacahöyük dates back to the early [[Bronze Age]].|thumb|upright]]
"''The symbol belongs to the Hattis from the pre-Hittite period. The Sun Disc is made of bronze, and was commonly used about 4250 years ago in religious ceremonies. The circle which forms the perimeter of the disc represents either the earth or the sun. At the bottom, there are two horn-like protrusions but what they represent is not clear. The protrusions at the top represent fertility, and the procreation of nature. The birds symbolize fertility and the freedom in nature. The sun disc is known to have been made about 300 years prior to the Hittite settlement in Anatolia. Hatti kings were buried in funeral ceremonies typically with 4-5 such symbols of similar design.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.ankara.edu.tr/about/profile-history/the-sun-disc/|title=The Sun Disc - Ankara University|website=en.ankara.edu.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern uses==
The sun disk is used as the symbol of [[Ankara University]].

A monument, [[Hittite Sun Course Monument]], to the [[Hittites]] was created by the sculptor [[Nusret Suman]] and was erected in [[Sıhhiye Square]] in 1978.

The [[Turkey|Turkish]] food giant [[Eti (company)|Eti]] uses the sun disk as their logo.

A '''Hollander beater''' is a machine developed by the Dutch in 1680 to produce [[paper]] pulp from cellulose containing plant fibers.  It replaced [[stamp mill]]s for preparing pulp because the Hollander could produce in one day the same quantity of pulp it would take a stamp mill eight days to prepare.&lt;ref name="Clapp"&gt;

[[File:Hollander beater.gif|Hollander beater patent|thumb]]

However, the wooden paddles and beating process of a stamp mill produced longer, more easily hydrated, and more fibrillated cellulose fibers; thus increasing the resulting paper's strength. The Hollander used metal blades and a chopping action to cut the raw material, resulting in shorter cellulose fibers and weaker paper. Further, the metal blades of the Hollander often introduced metal contaminants into the paper as one metal blade struck another. These contaminants often acted as catalysts for oxidation that have been implicated in browning of old paper called [[foxing]].&lt;ref name="Clapp"/&gt;

In turn, the Hollander was (partially) replaced by the [[conical refiner]] or Jordan refiner, named after its American inventor Joseph Jordan, who patented the device in 1858.&lt;ref name="Clapp"/&gt;

[[File:Hollander beater.jpg|A Hollander beater|thumb]]

A Hollander beater design consists of a circular or ovoid water raceway with a beater wheel at a single point along the raceway. The beater wheel is a centrifugal compressor or radial impeller cylinder parallel to a grooved plate,&lt;ref name=lumiainen2000refining&gt;{{cite book|chapter=4: Refining of chemical pulp|last1=Lumiainen|first1=J|title=Papermaking Part 1|isbn=952521608X|page=98|date=2000|url=http://www.fing.edu.uy/iiq/maestrias/icp/materiales/2010/06_Papermaking/book8chapter4refining%20of%20chemical%20pulp.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- full book table of contents: http://www.tappi.org/oldtappi/content/pdf/bookstore/0202fin08.pdf --&gt; similar to the construction of a [[water wheel]] or timing pulley. Under power, the blades &lt;!-- "blades" would generally denote cutting not beating--&gt; rotate to beat the fiber into a usable pulp slurry.  The beater wheel and plate do not touch, as this would result in cutting. The distance between the two is adjusted to increase or decrease the pressure on the fibers  when passing through the beater.

The objective of using a beater (rather than another process like grinding, as many [[Wood pulp#Manufacture of wood pulp|wood-pulp]] mills do) is to create longer, hydrated, fibrillated fibers. (Fibrillated fibers are abraded to the extent that many partially broken-off fibers extend from the main fiber, increasing the fiber's surface area, and hence its potential for [[hydrogen bond]]ing). Grinding of fibers is not desirable. Therefore, the "blades" are not what might be thought of as "sharpened," and well-designed beaters make it possible to minimize the shear action of the rotating blades against the bottom of the water raceway.&lt;!-- this statement can be eliminated by replacing the word blades, with a more accurate description --&gt;

'''''Inger on the Beach''''' (also ''Summernacht''; [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Inger på stranden, Sommernatt'') is a painting by the Norwegian artist [[Edvard Munch]]. It was created in the summer of 1889, at [[Åsgårdstrand]] and is a portrait of Munch's youngest sister Inger.

==Description==
A young woman, identified by the title as Munch's youngest sister Inger, sits in a quiet pose, a straw hat in her hands, on a large granite rock and holds her head in profile. Her bright white dress contrasts with the green mossy stones and the blues and purples of the sea water behind her, which, as the alternative titles indicate, suggests ''Nordic summer nights''. Only a few [[Fish trap|pots]] and a fishing boat behind her betray human life in the countryside.{{sfn|Bischoff|1988|p.17}}

Munch used a similar pose for his 1884 interior composition ''Morning'', featuring a girl on the edge of a bed.{{sfn|O'Neill|1996|p=13}}

==History==
In the summer of 1889, Munch rented a small house in Åsgårdstrand, a small Norwegian coastal town on the [[Oslofjord]], which served as a summer resort of many citizens and artists from nearby Kristiana, now Oslo. Among them were Munch's friends [[Christian Krohg]] and [[Frits Thaulow]]. The place acquired great importance in the life of Munch: Here he spent not only many summers, and bought in 1897 a house, it was the place for many important pictures of his life work. In 1889, his first year in Åsgårdstrand, he painted ''Inger on the beach''. The model was his youngest sister Inger, who had previously modeled for him. The painting was preceded by a series of studies Munch made between 9 and 11 pm to study the lighting conditions of Norwegian summer night.{{sfn|Heller|1993|p. 38.}}

==Interpretation==
Ulrich Bischoff suggests that—unlike Munch's earlier 1884 portrait of the then 14-year-old Inger in her black [[First Communion|confirmation]] dress, a youthful work in the tradition of portraiture of the 19th century—''Inger on the beach'' shows the future importance of the artist. Munch displays in this work his artistic repertoire for expressing loneliness, melancholy and angst, and foreshadows the compositional breakdown in horizontal and vertical axes of the later ''Frieze of Life''.{{sfn|Bischoff|1988|pp. 17-18}}

For Reinhold Heller the painting conveys less a time of day than a mood, created by the contours and dimensional representations of figure and stones, the nonexistent horizon between sky and sea, and the almost monochrome blue.{{sfn|Heller|1993|p. 38.}}
Anni Carlsson describes the work as a "character landscape" in which the beach, sea and figure are incorporated into a mood and the boundaries cancel space. 

In a later statement, Munch compared seaside rocks with living creatures, goblins and sea spirits:{{sfn|Carlsson|1989|p. 33.}} "In the night's light which forms have fantastic tones". Nicolay Stang compares the "simplification of form and color, which is a colored form against the other" to Paul Gauguin, a painter whose work was familiar to Munch before 1889.{{sfn|Stang|1981|p. 33}}

Tone Skedsmo says ''Inger on the beach'' is in the tradition of the naturalistic painters of the "Fleksum colony", namely [[Christian Skredsvig]], [[Eilif Peterssen]], [[Erik Werenskiold]], [[Gerhard Munthe]], [[Kitty Kielland]] and [[Harriet Backer]], who were known for their quiet summer night moods. While the composition of a figure in a landscape and the elegiac mood are typical of the work of Munch's Norwegian colleagues, Munch's simplification of forms to express a mood adds elements of modernity. He may have been influenced by [[Puvis de Chavannes]] and [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]], whom he had met at the [[Exposition Universelle d'Anvers (1885)]], in the rigid countenance of Ingers with her blank stare and the dry handling of the paint.

==Reception==
A few months after its completion, the painting (originally titled ''Evening'') was displayed for the first time at the annual autumn exhibition in Kristiana, while Munch had already traveled to Paris to collect impressions of the local art scene through which his [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] would find expressive style.{{sfn|Skedsmo|1988}} 
The contemporary criticism was extremely hostile.{{sfn|Bischoff|1988|p. 18}} 
''Morgenbladet'' called the painting pure "gibberish" and said the public was being bamboozled. Other voices criticized the "easily thrown stones that seem to be made only from soft, shapeless substance".{{sfn|Stang|1981|p. 33}}
''Aftenposten'' described the seated figure as "a physical entity with no trace of life and expression, as untrue in the form as in the color [...] On the whole this seems to us to have such a low artistic value that his presence at the exhibition itself is difficult to defend. " Dagbladet nevertheless pointed out: "To understand it, one must constantly have in mind that Munch poet is - a person who can be entirely covered by a mood to her and her playing devotedly, without regard to conventional laws and forms, often with a tendency to fantasy. "{{sfn|Carlsson|1989|p. 34.}}

Munch's Norwegian colleague [[Erik Werenskiold]] bought it directly from the exhibition{{sfn|Bischoff|1988|p. 18}} in 1909; it was acquired in 1924 by the Norwegian art collector [[Rasmus Meyer]] as part of his public collections in Bergen.

[[File:Psychological Morphology38?.jpg|thumb| [[Roberto Matta]]'s ''Psychological Morphology'', (painted in about 1938), with its landscape-like blue sky and horizon, combined with [[biomorphism|biomorphically]] suggestive and fluidly interacting figures, is a good example of what Prof. Claude Cernuschi ([[Boston College]]) has identified in Matta's work as "the psychoanalytic view of the mind as a three-dimensional space: the 'inscape'."]] 

'''Inscape''', in [[visual art]], is a term especially associated with certain works of [[Chile]]an artist [[Roberto Matta]], but it is also used in other senses within the [[visual arts]]. Though the term ''inscape'' has been applied to stylistically diverse artworks, it usually conveys some notion of representing the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as a kind of interior [[landscape art|landscape]]. The word ''inscape'' can therefore be read as a kind of [[portmanteau]], combining ''interior'' (or ''inward'') with ''landscape''.

==The psychological inscape: surrealist, abstract, and fantastic art==

According to Professor Claude Cernuschi, writing in a catalogue for a Matta exhibition at [[Boston College]] (see external link below), Matta's use of the term ''inscape'' for a series of [[landscape art|landscape]]-like [[abstract art|abstract]] or [[surrealist]] [[painting]]s reflects "the [[psychoanalytic]] view of the mind as a three-dimensional space: the 'inscape'." The 'inscape' concept is particularly apt for Matta's works of the late 1930s. As [[Dawn Adès]] (p. 233) writes, "A series of brilliant oil paintings done during the years of his [Matta's] first association with the [[Surrealist]]s explore visual metaphors for the mental landscape." And Valerie Fletcher, in ''Crosscurrents of Modernism'' (p. 241), writes that during this time Matta "created with startling mastery the paintings he called 'inscapes' or 'psychological morphologies.' " See also Miriam Basilio's essay, "[[Wifredo Lam]]'s 'The Jungle' and Matta's 'Inscapes' ".

The term ''inscape'' was later taken up by the leading Australian surrealist [[James Gleeson]], American [[abstract art]]ists such as [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Jane Frank]], and [[Mary Frank]] (no relation), and even a group of British [[fantasy art]]ists founded by [[Brigid Marlin]] in 1961 and calling themselves the 'Inscape Group.' (The latter group may have had in mind another sense of the word '[[inscape]]', associated with the British poet [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]. See the article titled simply '[[inscape]]' for more information on this.)  More recently, in a 1998 review of a Mary Frank exhibition in [[New York City]] (cited below), Carol Diehl writes, "Titled 'Inscapes', the [[painting]]s are [[landscape art|landscapes]] of the [[soul]]...."

Also clearly referring to the psychoanalytical meaning of the word as described by Prof. Cernuschi and others above, the leading journal of [[art therapy]] was formerly called simply ''Inscape''.  The journal is now called ''International journal of art therapy : Inscape.'' (This is not to be confused with the ''Inscape'' magazine produced by Brigid Marlin's [[Society for Art of Imagination]].)

==Architectural interiors as 'inscapes'==
The word "inscape" is sometimes used, perhaps with a bit of poetic license, to refer to the domain of [[interior design]], suggesting that the interior of a house or building is a kind of interior (or indoor) landscape, a counterpart to the landscape surrounding the structure. This is the sense suggested by the name of the [[South Africa]]n interior design school [[Inscape Design College]], which see. It could be, however, that this use of the term is intended as a [[double-entendre]], evoking those other meanings of "inscape".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10091">[[File:Messe des hl Papstes Gregor Bode-Museum.jpg|thumb|A rare sculpted version of the ''Mass''. German, 1480.]]
The '''Mass of Saint Gregory''' is a subject in [[Roman Catholic art]] which first appears in the late [[Middle Ages]] and was still found in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. [[Pope Gregory I]] (c. 540–604) is shown saying [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] just as a vision of Christ as the ''[[Man of Sorrows]]'' has appeared on the altar in front of him, in response to the Pope's prayers for a sign to convince a doubter of the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]].

==History of the story and the image==
The earliest version of the story is found in the 8th-century biography of Gregory by [[Paul the Deacon]], and was repeated in the 9th-century one by [[Johannes Hymonides|John the Deacon]]. In this version, the Pope was saying Mass when a woman present started to laugh at the time of the [[Eucharist|Communion]], saying to a companion that she could not believe the bread was Christ, as she herself had baked it. Gregory prayed for a sign, and the [[Sacramental bread|host]] turned into a bleeding finger.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 121–122&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Israhel van Meckenem The Mass of Saint Gregory.jpg|thumb|left|The largest of 10 [[engraving]]s by [[Israhel van Meckenem]], 1490s, with an [[indulgence]] of 20,000 years at bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Shestack, 214&lt;/ref&gt;]]

This story is retained in the popular 13th century compilation the ''[[Golden Legend]]'', but other versions conflate the legend with other stories and the finger is changed into a visionary appearance of the whole of Christ on the altar, and the doubter becomes one of the [[deacon]]s.

The story was hardly seen in art until the [[Jubilee (Christian)|Jubilee Year]] of 1350,&lt;ref&gt;An early fresco version by [[Ugolino di Prete Ilario]] in a cycle of 1357–1363 dedicated to the history of the Eucharist in the [[Orvieto Cathedral#Chapel of the Corporal|Chapel of the Corporal in Orvieto Cathedral]] has been restored but evidently never showed the ''Man of Sorrows'' as the vision.&lt;/ref&gt; when pilgrims to Rome saw a Byzantine [[icon]], the ''Imago Pietatis'', in the [[basilica]] of [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]], which was claimed to have been made at the time of the vision as a true representation.&lt;ref&gt;Parshall, 58. For a somewhat different chronology, see Pattison, 150&lt;/ref&gt; In this the figure of Christ was typical of the Byzantine forerunners of the ''Man of Sorrows'', at half-length, with crossed hands and a head slumped sideways to the viewer's left. According to Gertrud Schiller and the German scholars she cites, this has now been lost, but is known from many copies, including the small Byzantine [[micromosaic]] icon of about 1300 now in Santa Croce.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 199. The original seems to have been in Rome since the 12th century (Schiller). For the icon now there, see [http://www.learn.columbia.edu/treasuresofheaven/relics/Imago-pietatis-Man-of-Sorrows.php ''Treasures of Heaven'']&lt;/ref&gt; This image seems to have had, perhaps initially only for the Jubilee, a Papal [[indulgence]] of 14,000 years granted for prayers said in its presence. This form of the image, converted to a more standard Western ''Man of Sorrows'', rising from the tabernacle on the altar, shown as a tomb-like box, with the ''[[Arma Christi]]'' around him, became standard across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 122 and Shestack, 214&lt;/ref&gt; and very popular, especially north of the Alps, as an [[altarpiece]], in [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and other media. The strong connection of the image with indulgences was also maintained, and largely escaped from any Papal control. There was another Jubilee year in 1500, and the years on either side of this perhaps show the height of popularity of the image.&lt;ref&gt;Parshall, 58&lt;/ref&gt; It often appeared in [[books of hours]], usually at the start of the [[Hours of the Cross]] or [[Penitential Psalms]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamerick, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[iconography]] is one of a number of examples where detached [[andachtsbilder]] images such as the ''Man of Sorrows'' intended for intense personal meditation, are worked back into monumental compositions for prominent display. The deacon is invariably shown, and in larger compositions there is often a crowd of cardinals, attendants and worshippers, often with a [[donor portrait]] included. Sometimes the [[chalice (cup)|chalice]] on the altar is being filled with blood pouring from the wound in Christ's side. The head tilted to the left of the mosaic in Rome is typically retained in modified form. Sometimes Christ is full-length, and he may appear to be stepping forward onto the altar in later versions.&lt;ref&gt;For example in the [[Adriaen Isenbrandt]] panel in the Getty Museum - link below.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several [[old master print|prints]] that were often copied by artists, notably ten different [[engraving]]s of the subject by [[Israhel van Meckenem]] and a [[woodcut]] by [[Albrecht Dürer]] of 1511.&lt;ref&gt;Last item in [https://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=69208&amp;id=9992457269&amp;ref=mf this online album]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these included printed indulgences, usually unauthorised.&lt;ref&gt;Field, 22–-230&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest dated [[Mexican feather work|Aztec feather painting]] is a ''Mass'' of 1539 (see gallery) following one of the van Meckenem indulgence prints (not the one illustrated).&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, 95–98, see Shestack, 214 for the print used.&lt;/ref&gt; The print illustrated began with a "bootlegged" indulgence of 20,000 years, but in a later [[state (printmaking)|state]] the plate has been altered to increase it to 45,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Parshall, 58 (quoted), and Shestack, 214 (illustrated in both). The indulgences (as with no. 215 below) applied each time a specified collection of prayers, here 7 each of the [[Creed]], [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]] and [[Hail Mary]], were recited in front of the image.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Protestant Reformation]], an image that asserted both divine approval of the [[Papacy]] and the doctrine of the [[Real Presence]] was attractive to Catholics, and the iconography continued to be used.

The '''Merdeka Palace''' ({{Lang-id|'''Istana Merdeka'''}}; also known in Indonesian as '''Istana Gambir''' and during the Dutch colonial times as '''Paleis te Koningsplein'''), is one of six presidential palaces in Indonesia. It is located on the north side of the [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]] in [[Central Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] and is used as the [[official residence]] of the [[President of the Republic of Indonesia]].

The palace was a residence for the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] during the colonial era. In 1949, the palace was renamed Merdeka Palace, "(ke)[[merdeka]](an)" meaning "freedom" or "independence".

The Merdeka Palace is part of the {{convert|6.8|ha|acre}} Jakarta Presidential Palace Complex, which also includes the [[Istana Negara (Jakarta)|Negara Palace]], Wisma Negara (State Guesthouse), Sekretariat Negara (State Secretariat), and the Bina Graha building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesia.go.id/in/istana/istana-jakarta|title=Istana Jakarta|trans-title=Jakarta Palace|language=id|website=National website|access-date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the center of the Indonesian [[Executive (government)|executive]] authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://djamandoeloe.com/read/15/gedung/mengenal-kecantikan-dua-istana-kepresidenan Mengenal Kecantikan Dua Istana Kepresidenan], djamandoeloe.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===The beginning===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Het paleis van de gouverneur- generaal op het Koningsplein in Batavia TMnr 3728-795.jpg|thumb|left|Lithograph of the ''Paleis te Koningsplein'' in the 1880s (now Merdeka Palace)]]

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zaal in paleis van de Gouverneur-Generaal Batavia TMnr 10013665.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the Palace in 1936]]
The building that is now the Merdeka Palace was built in the premise of the Rijswijk Palace (present [[Istana Negara (Jakarta)|Istana Negara]]) when it was considered no longer sufficed for administrative purposes e.g. big receptions and conferences during the mid-19th-century. In 1869, the instruction to construct a new palace was given by Governor-General [[Pieter Mijer]]. Construction took place on the south lawn of the Rijswijk Palace on March 23, 1873 during the tenure of Governor-General [[James Loudon (politician)|James Loudon]].

The Neo-Palladian palace was designed by Jacobus Bartholomeus Drossaers and was built by the Department of Public Works and the contracting firm Drossaers &amp; Company at a cost of [[Netherlands Indies gulden|ƒ]] 360,000. The new building was built in southern part of the Rijswijk Palace grounds, directly facing Koningsplein (now [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]]).

Construction of the palace was finished in 1879 during the tenure of Governor-General [[Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge]]. The new palace was given the official name ''Paleis van de Gouverneur Generaal'' ("Palace of the Governor-General"), the official residence of the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] and his family.&lt;ref name=setneg&gt;[http://www.setneg.go.id/images/stories/kepmen/ppid/istana_istana_kepresidenan_republik_indonesia.pdf ISTANA-ISTANA KEPRESIDENAN REPUBLIK INDONESIA], setneg.go.id&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merdeka&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |archive-url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/web/encyclopedia/detail/1933/Merdeka-lstana |title=Merdeka, Istana |encyclopedia=Jakarta |url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/web/encyclopedia/detail/1933/Merdeka-Astana |archive-date=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor-General [[Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge]] (1875-1881) was the first to reside in the building.{{sfn|Djawatan Penerangan Kotapradja Djakarta Raya|1957|p=152}} Governor-General [[Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer]] (1936-1942) was the last Dutch governor-general to reside in the Palace.

===Japanese occupation===
During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]] (1942-1945), the ''Saiko Shikikan'' (army commander) of the Japanese garrison resided in the Rijswijk Palace compound. Three Japanese commanders have taken residence in the Merdeka Palace.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;&lt;ref name=merdeka /&gt;

===Post-independence===
The [[Indonesian national revolution]] (1945–1949) ended with the Netherlands' recognition of the Republic of Indonesia. The Indonesian declaration of independence from the Dutch in 1949 was announced in Gambir Palace. During the ceremony, the Dutch flag was substituted with the [[Flag of Indonesia]]. Many spectators were rejoicing when the flag was hoisted, and yelled "[[Merdeka]]! (Freedom!)". From that moment, Gambir Palace became known as Merdeka Palace.&lt;ref name=merdeka /&gt; [[Tony Lovink]], the High Commissioner of the Dutch Crown was the last man representing the Dutch power to leave the Palace.{{sfn|Djawatan Penerangan Kotapradja Djakarta Raya|1957|p=152}} The name of the palace officially changed to Istana Merdeka ("Indendepence Place") on 28 December 1949 at 17.55 hours.{{sfn|Djawatan Penerangan Kotapradja Djakarta Raya|1957|p=152}}

On 27 December 1949, a day after the ceremony, President [[Sukarno]] and his family arrived from [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]]. For the first time, the President of the Republic of Indonesia settled in Merdeka Palace.

The first annual Independence Day ceremony was held at the Merdeka Palace in 1950.

==Evolution of the Merdeka Palace==
The building has remain unchanged since the building was finished in 1879.&lt;ref name=merdeka /&gt; After the Indonesian independence, the Merdeka Palace compound was expanded to include not only [[Istana Negara (Jakarta)|Istana Negara]] (State Palace), but also to construct Wisma Negara, Sekretariat Negara (State Sectreatiat) and Bina Graha. Several colonial buildings and residences were demolished in the Weltevreden area to make way for today's State Palace compound.

A small octagonal [[gazebo]] located in the courtyard of the palace was used as private school for [[Sukarno]]'s and the palace staff's children. This gazebo was previously used by Dutch colonial officials as ''muziekkoepel'' (music gazebo), where music performances were played during formal [[Ball (dance party)|balls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.detik.com/read/2012/08/30/100042/2002862/1383/4/yuk-main-ke-istana-presiden Yuk, Main ke Istana Presiden!], 30 August 2012, detik.com&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Suharto]] became president of Indonesia, he made changes to the previously residential function of the Palace. Sukarno's bedroom was converted into Ruang Bendera Pustaka (Regalia Room) and the room of Sukarno's wife Fatmawati became the President's bedroom.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt; An old wooden building in the palace complex known as "Sanggar" was demolished to make way for the Puri Bhakti Renatama building, and was used as a museum to store valuable artifacts, artwork and gifts from foreign emissaries. Later{{when|date=August 2015}} he also built the Bina Graha building on the palace grounds, which he used as his office.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;

When [[Megawati]] took office, she had the Puri Bhakti Renatama building converted into the President's office, while its contents moved to Bina Graha building. She also restored the furniture and decorations of the palace back to the way it was under Sukarno. Suharto's Jepara [[wood carving]] furniture was removed, with the exception of the Ruang Jepara (Jepara Room, as a reminder of Suharto's regime), and replaced with the old colonial refurbishment.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;

==The Merdeka Palace now==
[[File:Istana Merdeka.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aerial view of the Palace compound]]
[[File:Vladimir Putin with Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono-5.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Vladimir Putin meets Yudhoyono at the Merdeka Palace during the Russian state visit of 2007]]

The Merdeka Palace serves as an official venue for state events such as the Independence Day ceremony, welcoming (foreign) dignitaries, cabinet meetings, state banquets and reception of letters of credence from foreign ambassadors. Additionally, it still contains the president's private quarters and offices.

The administrative role that the palace once had, has been shifted to the State Palace and State Secretariat, while the Merdeka Palace remains a symbol of authority.

===Layout of the Palace===
A 17&amp;nbsp;m tall flagpole and a fountain are located on the front lawn of the Merdeka Palace. The annual flag raising ceremony takes place during the Indonesian Independence day on 17 August. During the Independence ceremony, the [[veranda]] is often used as a ceremonial stage for the President and dignitaries.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;

Notable rooms in the Palace include:

* '''Ruang Kredensial''' ([[Letter of credence|credential]] hall) provides entrance to the palace and is the place where most diplomatic activities are conducted, such as receiving state guests and ambassadors. The credential hall is decorated with furniture that dates back to the colonial days, as well as paintings and ceramic works.&lt;ref name=merdeka /&gt;
* '''Ruang Jepara''' (Jepara room) was a former study room of [[Sukarno]], and named after the [[Central Java]]nese town of [[Jepara]], source of the room's [[wood carving|carved wooden]] furniture and ornaments.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;
* '''Ruang Raden Saleh''' (Raden Saleh room) is located in front{{where|date=August 2015}} of Ruang Jepara. The room was previously used as the First Lady's office and living room. Megawati used the room to store 5 paintings by Indonesian painter [[Raden Saleh]].&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;
* '''Ruang Resepsi''' ([[Party|reception]] room) is the largest room of the palace. It is usually used for state banquets, state gala dinners, national meetings, and cultural performances. There are two paintings of [[Basuki Abdullah]]. On the eastern wall hangs "Pergiwa Pergiwati", a painting theme from [[Mahabharata]], and on the west wall hangs the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] "[[Jaka Tarub]]" painting.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;
* '''Ruang Bendera Pusaka''' (the heirloom flag room), or Regalia room. The room is used to store "[[Bendera Pusaka]]", the first [[Indonesian flag]] that was raised during [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence]] on 17 August 1945.&lt;ref name=setneg /&gt;

The presidents after Sukarno no longer use the palace as a residence, although it is still the official presidential residence. The palace's offices are still in use by the current Indonesian president. During the [[Suharto]] administration, Suharto preferred to reside in his own house at Jalan Cendana, [[Menteng]], while the palace and Bina Graha only served as his office. The palace once again became the official presidential residence during the [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] and [[Megawati]] administrations. [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] sometimes resides in Merdeka Palace, however just like Suharto, he often prefers to reside in his own house, at Puri Cikeas, Cibubur, south of Jakarta.&lt;ref name=Suharto&gt;{{cite news |title=Zaman Soeharto, Istana Negara Jarang Digunakan |first=Meutia Febrina |last=Anugrah |url=http://economy.okezone.com/read/2014/04/18/471/972345/zaman-soeharto-istana-negara-jarang-digunakan |newspaper=okezone.com |date=April 19, 2014 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Caccini - le nuove musiche.jpg|thumb|right|Caccini, ''[[Le Nuove musiche]]'', 1601, title page]]
In [[poetry]], the term '''monody''' has become specialized to refer to a poem in which one person laments another's death.  (In the context of [[ancient Greek literature]], monody, {{lang|grc|μονῳδία}} could simply refer to lyric poetry sung by a single performer, rather than by a [[Greek chorus|chorus]].)

In music, '''monody''' refers to a solo vocal style distinguished by having a single [[melody|melodic]] line and instrumental accompaniment. Although such music is found in various cultures throughout history, the term is specifically applied to [[Italy|Italian]] song of the early 17th century, particularly the period from about 1600 to 1640. The term is used both for the style and for individual songs (so one can speak both of monody as a whole as well as a particular monody). The term itself is a recent invention of scholars. No composer of the 17th century ever called a piece a monody.  Compositions in monodic form might be called [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]], [[motet]]s, or even [[concerto]]s (in the earlier sense of "[[concertato]]", meaning "with instruments").

In monody, which developed out of an attempt by the [[Florentine Camerata]] in the 1580s to restore [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ideas of melody and declamation (probably with little historical accuracy), one solo voice sings a melodic part, usually with considerable [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]], over a rhythmically independent bass line.  Accompanying instruments could be [[lute]], [[chitarrone]], [[theorbo]], [[harpsichord]], [[Organ (music)|organ]], and even on occasion [[guitar]].  While some monodies were arrangements for smaller forces of the music for large ensembles which was common at the end of the 16th century, especially in the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], most monodies were composed independently.  The development of monody was one of the defining characteristics of early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] practice, as opposed to late [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] style, in which groups of voices sang independently and with a greater balance between parts.

Other musical streams which came together in the monody were the madrigal and the motet, both of which developed into solo forms after 1600 and borrowed ideas from the monody.

Contrasting passages in monodies could be more melodic or more declamatory:  these two styles of presentation eventually developed into the [[aria]] and the [[recitative]], and the overall form merged with the [[cantata]] by about 1635.

The parallel development of solo song with accompaniment in [[France]] was called the ''[[air de cour]]'':  the term monody is not normally applied to these more conservative songs, however, which retained many musical characteristics of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] ''[[chanson]]''.

An important early treatise on monody is contained in [[Giulio Caccini]]'s song collection, ''[[Le nuove musiche]]'' (Florence, 1601).

In the [[music industry]], a '''music publisher''' (or '''publishing company''') is responsible for ensuring the [[songwriter]]s and [[composer]]s receive payment when their [[musical composition|composition]]s are used commercially. Through an agreement called a [[publishing contract]], a songwriter or composer "assigns" the [[copyright]] of their composition to a publishing company. In return, the company licenses compositions, helps monitor where compositions are used, collects [[royalties]] and distributes them to the composers. They also secure commissions for music and promote existing compositions to [[recording artist]]s, film and television.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web | title = What is music publishing? | url = http://www.mpaonline.org.uk/FAQ | publisher = music publishers association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The copyrights owned and administered by publishing companies are one of the most important forms of [[intellectual property]] in the music industry. (The other is the copyright on a [[master recording]] which is typically owned by a [[record company]]) Publishing companies play a central role in managing this vital asset.

==The music publisher's role==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}

Successful songwriters and composers have a relationship with a publishing company defined by a [[publishing contract]].  Publishers also sometimes provide substantial advances against future income. In return, the publishing company receives a percentage, which can be as high as 50% and varies for different kinds of royalty.

There are several types of royalty: [[Royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]] derive from the sale of recorded music, such as CDs or digital downloads. These royalties are paid to publishers by [[record companies]] (through the [[Harry Fox Agency]] as well as through [http://www.amermechrights.com American Mechanical Rights Agency] in the U.S.). [[Royalties#Performance royalties|Performance royalties]] are collected by [[performance rights organization]]s such as [[SESAC]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], [[ASCAP]] or [[PRS_for_Music|PRS]] and are paid by radio stations and others who broadcast recorded music; and are paid by venues, event organizers for live performances of the compositions. [[Royalties#Synchronization royalties|Synchronization royalties]] are required when a composition is used in a film or television soundtrack. These royalties typically pass through the hands of a music publisher before they reach the composer.

Publishers also work to link up new songs by songwriters with suitable [[recording artist]]s to record them and to place writers' songs in other media such as movie [[soundtrack]]s and commercials. They will typically also handle [[copyright registration]] and "ownership" matters for the composer. Music print publishers also supervise the issue of [[songbook]]s and [[sheet music]] by their artists.

==Publishing disputes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Traditionally, music publishing royalties are split seventy/thirty, with thirty percent going to the publisher (as payment for their services) and the rest going to the songwriter &amp;ndash; or songwriters, as the case may be. Other arrangements have been made in the past, and continue to be; some better for the writers, some better for the publishers. Occasionally a recording artist will ask for a co-writer's credit on a song (thus sharing in both the artist and publishing royalties) in exchange for selecting it to perform, particularly if the writer is not well known. Sometimes an artist's manager or producer will expect a co-credit or share of the publishing (as with [[Norman Petty]] and [[Phil Spector]]), and occasionally a publisher will insist on writer's credit (as [[Morris Levy]] did with several of his acts); these practices are listed in ascending order of scrupulousness, as regarded by the music industry.

The most unscrupulous type of music publisher is the [[songshark]], who does little if any real "legwork" or promotion on behalf of songwriters. Songsharks make their profit not on royalties from sales, but by charging inexperienced writers for "services" (some real, such as [[demo (music)|demo]] recording or [[musical arrangement|musical arranging]], some fictional, such as "audition" or "review" fees) a legitimate publisher would provide without cost to the writer, as part of their job. (By comparison, a bona fide publisher who charges admission to a workshop for writers, where songs may be auditioned or reviewed, isn't wrong to do so.)

Rock-n-roll pioneer [[Buddy Holly]] split with longtime manager Norman Petty over publishing matters in late 1958, as did the [[The Buckinghams|Buckinghams]] with producer [[James William Guercio]] almost a decade later. [[John Fogerty]] of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] was sued by his former publisher [[Saul Zaentz]] (who'd also served as his manager) over a later Fogerty song that sounded slightly like a CCR song Zaentz published. (Fogerty won in court.)

Several bands and artists own (or later purchase) their own publishing, and start their own companies, with or without help from an outside agent. The sale or loss of publishing ownership can be devastating to a given artist or writer, financially and emotionally. R&amp;B legend [[Little Richard]] was largely cheated on his music publishing and copyrights, as were many performers. [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Mike Love]] of [[The Beach Boys]] were crushed to learn that [[Murry Wilson]] (father to three of the Beach Boys, Love's uncle, and the band's music publisher) had sold their company [[Sea of Tunes]] to [[A&amp;M Records]] during 1969 for a fraction of what it was worth &amp;ndash; or earned in the following years.

A large factor in the [[Beatles]]' breakup was when their publisher [[Dick James]] sold his share of [[Northern Songs]], the company they'd formed with him in 1963 (then taken public in 1967, with shares trading on the [[London Stock Exchange]]), to Britain's Associated TeleVision ([[Associated TeleVision|ATV]]) in 1969. Neither the Beatles nor managers [[Lee Eastman]] and [[Allen Klein]] were able to prevent ATV from becoming majority stockholders in Northern Songs, whose assets included virtually all the group's song copyrights. Losing control of the company, [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] elected to sell their share of Northern Songs (and thus their own copyrights), while retaining their writer's royalties. ([[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] retained minority holdings in the company.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8792">The '''American Negro Academy''' (ANA) was the first organization in the United States to support African-American academic scholarship. It operated from 1897 to 1928,&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged classical academic studies and [[liberal arts]]. 

It was formed to provide support to classic scholarship, in contrast to [[Booker T. Washington]]'s approach to education. Washington's [[Tuskegee University]] emphasized  vocational and industrial training for southern blacks, as he thought this was more practical for the lives most would live in the segregated South, where most blacks lived in rural areas. 

==Founder members==
The founders of the ANA were primarily authors, scholars, and artists. They included [[Alexander Crummell]], an Episcopal priest and Republican from New York City;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Alexander Crummell : A Study of Civilization and Discontent: A Study of Civilization and Discontent|author=University, W.J.M.P.A.C.B.|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195364088|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZOFnrBAzmYC|page=339|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Wesley Cromwell]] of Washington, DC;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gunter|first1=Donald W.|title=John Wesley Cromwell (1846–1927)|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Cromwell_John_Wesley_1846-1927|publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], poet and writer in Washington; [[Walter B. Hayson]], and [[Kelly Miller (scientist)|Kelly Miller]]. Crummell served as the first president.

Their first meeting on March 5, 1897 included eighteen members:

==Early meetings==

The Academy was organized in 1897 in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;''Publications of the Southern History Association:'' Volume 9 - Page 49&lt;/ref&gt; Black newspapers expressed excitement that the Academy would have wide possibilities to serve a large audience, seeking to elevate the race through educational enlightenment. Through an assessment of statistical tends, mainly concerning black illiteracy, the Academy-based its work that was to then be published in its Occasional Papers. The scholarly contributions aided the spirit of blacks who were being forced into legal segregation in southern states.&lt;ref&gt;"An American Negro Academy." ''The Freeman,'' February 5, 1898, News sec.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy generally held an annual meeting of one-two days at the Lincoln Memorial Church in Washington, D.C. A public audience was invited to attend all but the Academy's business meetings, reserved solely for members. The schedule would occupy the entire day. Reports were presented by the Academy's secretary and treasurer. During this time, new membership applications to the Academy were considered, as well as discussions on current business. In the evening, an annual address was delivered. For example, W.E.B. Du Bois presented the Academy's second annual address. A presentation of a paper would follow. The following day, after several paper presentations, discussions took place. Discussions centered around the efficacy of a scholar's musings. In order to distribute the works of various Academy members, copies were available upon requests made directly to the Academy's secretary, or through newspaper requests.

==Legacy and efficacy==
The ANA took its turn in the struggle for [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|equal rights for blacks]]. It was organized shortly after the United States Supreme Court had upheld the principle of "separate but equal" in the 1896 case, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]].'' 

Du Bois suggested that a [[Talented Tenth]] of African Americans, primarily composed of blacks trained in classical [[higher education]], could lead in educating masses of black citizens. Most of the latter would work in rural or unskilled jobs; in the South they suffered second-class status. Through a publication of works among the Academy's Occasional Papers, the group wanted to expand the reach of its scholarship, and to aid black intellectuals' efforts having influence on “his schools, academies and colleges; and then enters his pulpits; and so filters down into his families and his homes…to be a laborer with intelligence, enlightenment and manly ambitions”.&lt;ref&gt;Crummel, Alexander. "Papers of the American Negro Academy." Project Gutenberg. December 28, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have disputed the influence of the Academy. Dr. Alfred A. Moss Jr. argued for its efficacy in ''The American Negro Academy: Voice of the Talented Tenth''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Negro Academy: Voice of the Talented Tenth|last=Moss|first=Alfred A, Jr.|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=1981|isbn=0807106992|location=Baton Rouge|pages=180-181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his analysis of a collection of private letters written by Crummell, Moss explains that nearly from the beginning, the Academy was bound to become fully defunct. The organization was unable to consistently organize; it struggled to recruit new members, and to raise scholarship funds for educational uplift of more students. Moss claims that founding member [[Archibald Henry Grimké]] expressed in his writings an understanding of the difficulties and socio-economic hardships among African Americans, but that due to efforts to unseat [[Archibald Henry Grimké|Grimké]] as ANA president, he was more concerned with self-serving interests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''The Pavilion Theatre''' at 191–193 [[Whitechapel Road]], London, was the first major theatre to open in London's [[East End]]. It was destroyed by fire in 1856 and rebuilt as the '''New Royal Pavilion Theatre'''.

==History==
The theatre was opened in 1828 on the site of a former factory, and was the first major theatre to open in London's East End.&lt;ref name="DavisEmeljanow2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jim Davis|author2=Victor Emeljanow|title=Reflecting the Audience: London Theatregoing, 1840-1880|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o_LKMEgAARgC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=25 November 2016|date=1 April 2005|publisher=University of Iowa Press|isbn=978-1-58729-402-0|pages=55–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first managers were William Wyatt and John Farrell.&lt;ref name="elta-project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elta-project.org/browse.html?recordId=1142|publisher=elta-project.org|title=East London Theatre Archive|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Pavilion Theatre was entirely destroyed by fire on 13 February 1856, and was rebuilt in 1858 as the New Royal Pavilion Theatre, with a capacity of 3,500.&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PavilionTheatreAndWonderlandWhitechapelRoad.htm|publisher=arthurlloyd.co.uk|title=Pavilion Theatre and Wonderland, Whitechapel Road, Stepney|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was further reconstructed in 1871 by the architect [[J. T. Robinson]], and the capacity increased to 4,000.&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd"/&gt; [[Charles Dickens, Jr.]] (eldest child of [[Charles Dickens]]), in his 1879 book ''[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]'', described the Pavilion this way: "A large East-end theatre capable of holding considerably over 3,000 persons. Melodrama of a rough type, farce, pantomime, [[et cetera|&lt;!--SIC, &amp;c.--&gt;&amp;c.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dickens, Charles, Jr.|year=1879|title=Pavilion Theatre|work=[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-p.htm|accessdate=22 August 2007|authorlink=Charles Dickens, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century it became the home of Yiddish theatre, catering to the large Jewish population of the area, and gave birth to the Anglo-Jewish 'Whitechapel Boys' avant-garde literary and artistic movement.

In later years, it operated under the names, Royal Clarence Theatre, Eastern Opera House, and New Royal Pavilion Theatre,&lt;ref name="arthurlloyd"/&gt; continuing in business until 1935. The building was demolished in 1962.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6523">The '''Peugeot Concours Design''' competition was a [[wiktionary:Biennial|biennial]] competition run by the French [[car]] manufacturer [[Peugeot]]. For each [[competition]], entrants had to submit their designs for a car. A model of the winning design was built by the Peugeot Styling Centre and unveiled at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. The last competition took place in 2008.

==History==
The first contest took place in 2000-2001, with the theme "2020" - a challenge to design a [[Peugeot]] car for the year 2020. The contest was announced at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in 2000, and culminated in the winning design being built by Peugeot, and unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2001.  Since then, the contest has followed a similar schedule every two years. For the 2006-2007 contest, the winning design featured in an [[Xbox 360]] game.

==Rules==
The contest runs to a similar schedule, with similar rules, each year. In 2008, the contest opened in June, with the deadline for submissions on July 20. When the deadline for submissions has passed, Peugeot selects 30 entries to go forward to the next stage. These 30 entries are placed on the competition's website and are voted on by visitors to the site and selected industry and press figures. Based on these votes, these 30 entries are narrowed down to ten entries and these entries are posted to the website. This stage is not a majority vote - the ten entries which are selected may not be the highest-voted entries.

In the final stage of voting, the Peugeot Jury select the winner and 2nd and 3rd runners-up from the final ten. The results of this are then posted to the competition's website, usually some time in February.

==Winners==
===2000-2001===
The winner of the 2000-2001 competition was ''Moonster'' by Marko Lukovic. The concept behind this design was that the vehicle should be totally original. It features a wheel-level engine with a raised central compartment capable of seating two people.&lt;ref name="2001 winner article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.cardesignnews.com/news/2001/010327peugeot-contest/index.html|title='2020' Design Contest winnder announced - car design news|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===2002-2003===
This contest, themed "Retrofuturism", was won by Stefan Schulze with ''4002''. With this design, the artist intended to make the car look like a typical Peugeot. Many commentators felt that he was successful with this, citing the design of the headlights as particularly Peugeot-like.&lt;ref name="2003 winner article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1722/Peugeot-4002.html|title=Peugeot 4002 - ultimatecarpage.com|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===2004-2005===
This contest was won by André Costa with ''Moovie''. His was an unusual design, almost totally enclosed by dark glass with few visible external features. The creator has stated that the car was designed to be environmentally friendly and ideal for use in cities.&lt;ref name="2005 winner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peugeot-concours-design.com/en/01_vainqueur/|title=''Moovie'' by Andre Costa|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===2006-2007===
The 2006-2007 competition was won by Mihai Panaitescu with his design, ''Flux''. According to its creator, the car is intended to be sporty and versatile, and able to handle many different environments with ease. ''Flux'' is meant to symbolise "the continuous change and flow of our daily lives during work and play" - to this end, the car contains an integrated Xbox 360 console.&lt;ref name="2007 winner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peugeot-concours-design.com/en/10vainqueurs/grandvainqueur/|title=''Flux'' by Mihai Panaitescu|accessdate=2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5395">'''Prince Darling''' is a [[fairy tale]] included by [[Andrew Lang]] in his [[Andrew Lang's Fairy Books|Blue Fairy Book]].

==Synopsis==
An aged king who is a widower lavishes indulgence on his only son, who the people consequently call "Prince Darling."  He fears he will die before the child is of age and confesses his concern to his friend, the Fairy of Truth.  The fairy promises to grant the boy a boon such as beauty, wealth or military success, but the king asks only that the fairy make the boy a good person.  The fairy says she cannot change the boy's character, but she can give him advice and correct him when he errs.

After the king's death, the fairy appears to Prince Darling, now the king, and gives him a magic ring that will prick his finger whenever he does wrong.  Prince Darling continues to follow the instructions of his wise old mentor, Suleiman, but begins carousing at night with power-seeking [[sycophants]] who encourage his bad behaviour.  Prince Darling meets a young shepherdess and arrogantly announces to her that he will marry her.  Instead of being honoured, the shepherdess refuses because of Prince Darling's wicked reputation.  The sycophants tell him that if he won't punish subjects who disobey him, his power will dissolve and the people will depose him.  By this time Prince Darling has discarded the magic ring because it was almost constantly pricking him.  So he puts the shepherdess in prison to force her consent to the marriage.  When she mysteriously vanishes from her cell, the sycophants accuse Suleiman of freeing her, and that he is trying to undermine Prince Darling's authority and take over the kingdom.  Prince Darling then imprisons Suleiman.

At this time the fairy of truth again appears to Prince Darling in a rage, saying that because he did not heed the ring's gentle correction he has become a monster.  She transforms him into a beast with the body of a snake, the legs of a wolf, the head of a lion and the horns of a bull.  The fairy tells him that as ugly as she can make him, his soul is still a hundred times more hideous.  She disappears, and the creature is left alone in the woods to ruminate on the error of his ways.

The monster prince is captured by a hunter, who hopes to sell him as a curiosity.  On the way back to the town, they encounter a reveller who says the whole town is rejoicing because Prince Darling is dead.  He says the people have released Suleiman from prison and crowned him as the new king.  Prince Darling sees this as a confirmation of everything his flattering friends said, and roars in rage.  The hunter decides to take the monster to the new king as a coronation gift.

The hunter takes the monster prince to the coronation ceremony where they hear Suleiman announce that he is only taking the throne in trust for Prince Darling, who is not dead and will return one day.  The hunter presents the monster to the king, who puts it in his menagerie.  In his cage, Prince Darling observes that the animal keeper is a drunkard who abuses the animals.  Prince Darling reflects that he was wrong about Suleiman, who only has his best interests in mind.  He realizes that his friends were really the ones manipulating him and seeking power, and the prince resolves to do only good from now on.  When the animal keeper has a near-fatal accident, the prince monster breaks out of his cage to save him.  The Fairy of Truth appears momentarily, saying that good actions will be rewarded, and transforms him from the horrible monster into a dog.

The animal keeper takes the dog to King Suleiman to report that a miracle has happened.  Suleiman's daughter takes a liking to the dog and decides to keep him herself.  One morning the dog receives a spare breakfast of one dinner roll, which he takes out in the countryside.  As he roams, he discovers a house of splendour, made of jewels.  There are well-dressed people going into the building, but when they come out, they are thin and pale, wearing rags and apparently starving to death.  One young girl crawling out of the palace passes the dog, and attempts to eat a blade of grass.  The dog decides to give his roll to the girl.  The girl tells the dog not to go in the house, because it is the [[Palace of Pleasure]], and all the food is poisoned.  The dog sees the shepherdess entering the palace and is desperate to save her.  At this time, the Fairy of Truth appears and rewards his generosity by turning him into a dove.  The dove prince flies around the palace, and through a window he sees the shepherdess, who suddenly vanishes in a puff of smoke.  Resolving to find her, the dove flies all across the land.  Eventually he spies her in a remote place, walking with an old beggar woman in rags.  He flies down and lights on the shepherdess' finger, cooing.  She remarks that it is the most beautiful dove in the world and that if it were a man, she would marry it.   The beggar woman throws off her rags and reveals that she is the Fairy of Truth.  She transforms the dove back into Prince Darling.  The Prince kneels and begs the shepherdess for forgiveness.   The fairy declares that the girl had always loved the prince, but didn't like his bad behaviour.  Prince Darling and the shepherdess are then married, and Prince Darling resumes the throne to become a just and beloved ruler.

[[File:Straße der Romanik - Gernrode.jpg|thumb|right|Road sign at Gernrode]]
The '''Romanesque Road''' ({{lang-de|Straße der Romanik}}) is a [[scenic route]] in the [[Germany|German]] state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in central-east Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strasse-der-romanik.net/ Straße der Romanik]. Accessed on 23 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the '''Transromanica''' network, a major [[European Cultural Route]] since 2006.

==Route==
The route takes the form of a figure-of-eight, with a northern and a southern loop, and the city of [[Magdeburg]] as its centre, linking village churches, monasteries, cathedrals and castles built between 950 and 1250 and which therefore represent the emergence of [[Christianisation|Christianity]] in this part of Germany. Their [[Romanesque architecture]] can be recognised by its angular shapes and the round arches of the windows and doors as shown on the official Romanesque Road signs. As well as the specific Romanesque stops en route, there are other villages and churches to explore.

The Special 301 Report is published pursuant to [[Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974|Section 301]] of the [[Trade Act of 1974]] ({{USPL|93|618}}, {{UnitedStatesCode|19|2242}}) as amended by Section 1303 of the [[Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988]].&lt;ref name="gpo.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?collectionCode=USCODE&amp;searchPath=Title+19%2FChapter+12%2FSubchapter+I%2FPart+8&amp;oldPath=Title+19%2FChapter+12%2FSUBCHAPTER+I&amp;isCollapsed=true&amp;selectedYearFrom=2011&amp;ycord=1413&amp;browsePath=Title+19%2FChapter+12%2FSubchapter+I%2FPart+8%2FSec.+2242&amp;granuleId=USCODE-2011-title19-chap12-subchapI-part8-sec2242&amp;packageId=USCODE-2011-title19&amp;collapse=true&amp;fromBrowse=true|title=19 U.S.C. 2242 - Identification of countries that deny adequate protection, or market access, for intellectual property rights|work=gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Special 301 Report was first published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://keionline.org/sites/default/files/ustr_special301_1989.pdf |title=1989 Special 301 Report |publisher=USTR |date=1989-05-25 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By statute, the annual Special 301 Report includes a list of "Priority Foreign Countries", that are  judged to have inadequate intellectual property laws; these countries may be subject to sanctions. In addition, the report contains a "Priority Watch List" and a "Watch List", containing countries whose intellectual property regimes are deemed of concern.

== Preparation ==
=== Special 301 Sub-Committee ===
The Special 301 Sub-Committee of the [[Trade Policy Staff Committee]] (TPSC) advises the United States Trade Representative on which countries to designate as "priority foreign countries" or to include in the watchlists. The Special 301 Sub-Committee is chaired by the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]] (USTR) and its members include the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]], the [[US Patent and Trademark Office|Patent and Trademark Office]], the [[US Department of State|Department of State]], the [[US Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], the [[US Copyright Office|Copyright Office]], the [[US Council of Economic Advisers|Council of Economic Advisers]], and other agencies. U.S. companies provide extensive comments in the annual National Trade Estimate Report. The Special 301 Sub-Committee also takes the views of foreign governments and the views of U.S. embassies on [[intellectual property rights]].&lt;ref name="Masterson20" /&gt;

=== Complaints by U.S. companies ===
U.S. companies and [[intellectual property]] owners, including [[copyright]]s, [[patents]] and [[trademarks]], can submit complaints (ie., a petition alleging that a country has violated an international agreement with the United States that adversely affects the company or industry) to the Trade Compliance Centre, which provides a template for such complaints, or the country or industry desk at the [[International Trade Administration]] (ITA) of the [[US Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]]. The ITA then reviews trade-related complaints with co-operation from the [[Office of General Counsel]] and the [[US Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]]. The complaint cannot be in relation to disputes between companies on [[intellectual property rights]], but must be about instances where a country has violated an international agreement with the United States. Complaints can be made in relation to the intellectual property law of the country, judicial or administrative procedures that discriminate against the US company, and failure to enforce intellectual property laws, particularly in relation to trade in [[counterfeit]] goods, and lately online [[copyright infringement]]. Complaints do not need to reference specific international agreements or provisions that are being breached. Complaints will focus on a country's failure to protect the intellectual property rights of a US company or lack of intellectual property rights relates market access. Complaints are expected to include a description of the efforts the company has made to enforce its intellectual property rights in that country and provide estimates of economic losses resulting from the infringement of intellectual property rights in that country.&lt;ref name="Masterson21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masterson22"&gt;Masterson (2004), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries included in the ''Priority Watch List'' and ''Watch List'' between 1996 and 2000 were requested by [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA) or the [[International Intellectual Property Alliance]] (IIPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sell|first=Susan K.|title=Private Power, Public Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003
|pages=126–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Andres Guadamuz of the [[University of Edinburgh]], the IIPA, which represents the U.S. media industry, urged the U.S. government to consider countries like [[Indonesia]], [[Brazil]], and [[India]] for inclusion in the Special 301 Watchlist in early 2010 because they either mandated or suggested the use of [[open source|open-source]] software.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/feb/23/opensource-intellectual-property When using open source makes you an enemy of the state], Bobbie Johnson, guardian.co.uk, 23 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NGO submissions ===
In 2010, NGOs such as [[PhRMA]], [[Oxfam]], and [[Médecins Sans Frontières|MSF]] made submissions to the USTR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://keionline.org/ustr/special301 |title=The US Special 301 Reports, 1989-2010 |publisher=Knowledge Ecology International |work=USTR |accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Designations ==
===Priority Foreign Country===
[[File:Annual Special 301 Report countries.png|thumb|right|300px| Special 301 Report 2013  {{legend|#7851A9|Priority Foreign Country}} {{legend|#ff5254|Priority Watch List}} {{legend|#fcb653|Watch List}} {{legend|#8cd19d|Section 306 Monitoring}} {{legend|#46a0ff|Status Pending}}]]
A ''Priority Foreign Country'' is the worst classification given to ''"foreign countries that deny "adequate and effective" protection of [[intellectual property rights]] (IPR) or "fair and equitable market access" to U.S. persons relying upon IPR protection"'' under the [[Trade Act]]. 

On 13 March 2001, the [[United States Trade Representative]] designated [[Ukraine]] as a Priority Foreign Country [http://www.ustr.gov/Document_Library/Press_Releases/2001/March/Ukraine_Designated_as_Priority_Foreign_Country_Under_Special_301.html] citing the massive amounts of unlicensed CDs sold in Europe that originate in the Ukraine. In 2011 and 2012, no countries were classified as a Priority Foreign Country; however, Paraguay was made subject to Section 306 Monitoring. In 2013, Ukraine was redesignated as a Priority Foreign Country. In 2014, the US was in talks with the WTO to designate India as a "Priority Foreign Country" especially for the pharmaceutical sector.

Under the amended [[Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974|Section 301]] of the [[Trade Act of 1974]] the USTR must by April 30 of each year:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"identify (1) those foreign countries that (A) deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, or (B) deny fair and equitable markets access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection, and (2) those foreign countries identified under paragraph (1) that are determined by the Trade Representative to be priority foreign countries".&lt;ref name="gpo.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masterson18"&gt;Masterson (2004), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masterson19"&gt;Masterson (2004), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Act defines "priority foreign countries" as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"those foreign countries - (A) that have the most onerous or egregious acts, policies, or practices that (i) deny adequate and effective intellectual property rights, or (ii) deny fair and equitable market access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection, (B) whose acts, policies, or practices described in subparagraph (A) have the greatest adverse impact (actual or potential) on the relevant United States products, and (C) that are not (i) entering into good faith negotiations, or (ii) making significant progress in bilateral or multilateral negotiations to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights".&lt;ref name="gpo.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masterson19" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Uruguay Round Agreement Act]] furthermore states that countries may be identified under Special 301 "taking into account the history of intellectual property laws and practices of the foreign country, including any previous identifications" and "the history of efforts of the United States, and the response of the foreign country, to achieve adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights". It also states that compliance with the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) does not preclude a country from being identified as denying "adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights".&lt;ref name="Masterson18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masterson19" /&gt;

The USTR acts on the information available at the time and can identify new "priority foreign countries" on an annual basis. The Special 301 Sub-Committee conducts additional reviews throughout the year for countries that "merit additional monitoring". The Trade Act of 1974 requires that the USTR to start investigations within 30 days of a country being identified as "priority foreign country", unless the USTR concludes that such an investigation "would be detrimental to United States economic interests". Unless the "priority foreign country" is regarded as being in breach of a trade agreement, including the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS), investigations must conclude within six months, with the possibility of a three-month extension.&lt;ref name="Masterson19" /&gt; Reasons for extension include "substantial progress in drafting or implementing legislative or administrative measures that will provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights" by the "priority foreign country".&lt;ref name="Masterson19" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masterson20"&gt;Masterson (2004), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; If the USTR believes that a trade agreement is being breached the USTR must conclude the investigation within 18 months, or within 30 days after the "dispute settlement procedure" has finished. If the USTR concludes that a trade agreement is being breached, "retaliation actions" may be taken under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.&lt;ref name="Masterson20" /&gt;

=== Priority Watch List and Watch List Countries ===
Two non-statutory categories have been created in addition to the statutory category of "priority foreign country", which once identified as such needs to be investigated and if found in breach with a trade agreement is subject to possible "retaliation actions" under [[Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974|Section 301]] of the [[Trade Act of 1974]]. "Priority Watch List" and "Watch List" countries are identified by the annual Special 301 Report. "Priority Watchlist countries" are judged by the USTR as having "serious intellectual property rights deficiencies" that require increased USTR attention. "Watch List" countries have been identified by the USTR as having "serious intellectual property rights deficiencies" but are not yet placed on the "Priority Watchlist". The USTR can move countries from one list to the other, or remove them from the lists, throughout the year.&lt;ref name="Masterson20" /&gt;

===Historical designations===

== Consequences ==
In response to countries being included on the Special 301 Report Watchlists the U.S. government may initiate dispute settlement proceedings at the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) or other relevant trade agreement, including the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). The U.S. government can also eliminate tariff preferences [[unilaterally]] granted, such as the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] (GSP).&lt;ref name="Masterson20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masterson21"&gt;Masterson (2004), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

If an USTR investigation concludes that a country has violated a trade agreement [[Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974|Section 301]] allows the U.S. government to impose [[unilateral]] [[trade sanctions]] if the country is not a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) or any other trade agreement establishing dispute settlement provisions, such as free trade agreements, which are relevant to the alleged violation. Unilateral trade sanctions under section 301 were imposed on December 20, 2001, on [[Ukraine]], which was not yet a WTO member, by imposing a prohibitive tariff on metals, footwear, and other imports because the USTR concluded that the country had failed to enact legislation to enforce copyright in relation to music [[Compact Discs|CDs]] and their export.&lt;ref name="Masterson20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masterson21" /&gt; Section 301 was also invoked by [[President Trump]] in March 2018, setting off the [[2018 China–United States trade dispute]].

According to the [[International Intellectual Property Alliance]] (IIPA) the Special 301 Report and the Watchlists is used to pressure other nations to adopt stricter copyright laws and take a more active role in combating [[Copyright infringements|copyright infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://www.iipa.com/pdf/IIPASpecial3012010SubmissionPressReleaseFinal011810.pdf |title=Copyright Industries Urge Greater Global Protection of American Jobs and Exports Threatened by Piracy |publisher=[[International Intellectual Property Alliance|IIPA]] |date=2010-02-18 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WTO dispute settlement proceedings ===
The USTR has used the Special 301 Reports to initiate formal dispute settlement proceedings at the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) if it believes a country does not comply with the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS). WTO dispute settlement proceedings are initiated when the country's noncompliance with TRIPS is judged to be too narrow to make the country a "priority foreign country". The countries against which the USTR intends to pursue dispute settlement proceedings are announced every April in the Special 301 Report.&lt;ref name="Masterson20" /&gt;

==Criticism==
===Lobbying power===
[[Peter Drahos]], a law professor at the [[Centre for Commercial Law Studies]] at [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary University of London]]'s School of Law, has called the Special 301 Report "a public law devoted to the service of private corporate interests".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Drahos, '''Information Feudalism''', The New Press, 2002, p89&lt;/ref&gt; It explicitly protects and acts in favor of U.S. [[intellectual property]] owners, most often large corporations, against any foreign national policy or unofficial action that does not conform, even in its domestic legislation, to the United States' position on international copyright and IP. Threat of action under Special 301 has been used to insert U.S. trade lobby backed advisers into states' domestic legislative process in order to ensure compliance with U.S. trade norms. One of the most direct examples comes from a former U.S. trade lobbyist, speaking in 1993:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Jamaica had no intellectual property law, but they wrote one (with our help). Similarly the Dominican Republic. I sat down with their lawyer and together we wrote their copyright law." &lt;ref&gt;Peter Drahos, '''Information Feudalism''', The New Press, 2002, p87&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Such methods of drafting national-level legislation inevitably raise questions about undue influence from the private sector. Lobbyists for the IP industry have been successful in their efforts to secure legal backing in foreign countries to already existing regimes such as TRIPS, and private corporations are now able to act as watchdogs to foreign national legislation on behalf of the U.S. government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Trade warring===
Most countries included in the ''Priority Watch List'' and ''Watch List'' between 1996 and 2000 were requested by [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] or [[International Intellectual Property Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Intellectual property is not violated, as this affects all manufacturers equally; nevertheless, this retaliatory measure has had a negative impact on investment decisions unrelated to the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kauppalehti.fi/5/i/talous/uutiset/etusivu/uutinen.jsp?oid=2010/06/34418 |title=Hätähuuto: Suomi luisuu takapajulaksi |publisher=Kauppalehti |language=Finnish |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5528">'''The King of England and his Three Sons''' is a Gypsy [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Joseph Jacobs]] in ''More English Fairy Tales''.  He listed as his source [[Francis Hindes Groome]]'s ''In Gypsy Tents'', where the informant was John Roberts, a Welsh gypsy.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''More English Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/moreenglish/kingengland.html "The King of England and his Three Sons"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of this tale appears in [[The Red King and the Witch: Gypsy Folk and Fairy Tales]] by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]], under the title ''An Old King and His Three Sons of England''.

== Synopsis ==

An old king could be cured only by golden apples from a far country.  His three sons set out to find them, and parted ways at a crossroads.  The [[youngest son]] found a house in a forest, where an old man greeted him as a king's son, and told him to put his horse in the stable and have something to eat.  After the meal, he asked how the man knew he was a king's son, and the man said he knew many things, including what the prince was doing.  He told the prince that he had to stay there the night, though many snakes and toads would crawl over him, and if he stirred, he would turn into one himself.

The prince got little sleep but did not stir.  In the morning, the old man gave him breakfast, a new horse, and a ball of yarn to throw between the horse's ears.  When the prince threw it and chased it, he came to the old man's brother, who was uglier than the first one.  He received the same hospitality, and the same unpleasant night, and this brother sent him on to the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] brother.

At the third brother's, the brother, who was even uglier than the second one, told him he must go on to a castle.  There, he must tell swans to bear him over the lake to a castle.  It was guarded by [[Giant (mythology)|giants]], lions, and [[dragon]]s, but they would be asleep, and so he must go in at one o'clock and come out again by two.  He must go through some grand rooms, go down into the kitchen, and then go out into the garden.  There he must pick the apples.  He should come back the same way, and when riding off, never look back because they would pursue him into he nearly reached the old man's house.

He went to bed, and this time the brother assured him that nothing would disturb him, and nothing did.  In the morning, the old man warned him not to tarry because of a beautiful woman.

He reached the castle by the swans and saw a beautiful woman there.  He exchanged his garter, gold watch, and pocket-handkerchief for hers, and kissed her.  Then he got the apples and had to flee with all speed, because the hour was nearly up, but he escaped.

The old man brought him to a well and insisted that the prince cut his head off and throw it into the well.  This [[Shapeshifting|turned]] him into a young, handsome man, and the house into a palace.  At the second brother's, he received a new bed, with no snakes or toads, and cut off his head as well, and then same with the first.

He met up with his brothers again.  [[False hero|They]] stole his apples and put others in their place, and went on before him.  When he reached home, his apples were not as good as his brother's, and his father thought they were poisoned and told his headsman to cut his head off.  The headsman instead took him into the woods and left him there.  A bear came up to him, and he climbed a tree, but the bear persuaded him to come down.  The bear brought him to some tents, where they made him welcome, and changed in a handsome young man, Jubal.  He stayed with them and was happy, although he had lost the golden watch somewhere.  One day, he saw it in the tree where he had climbed to hide from the bear, and climbed it to get it again.

Meanwhile, the princess, realizing one of the king's sons had been there, set out with an army.  When she reached the king, she demanded to see his sons.  When the oldest came, he said he had been to her castle, but when she threw down the handkerchief and he walked over it, he broke his leg; then the second brother said the same, but also broke his leg.  She demanded of the king whether he had more sons; the king sent to the headsman, who confessed he had not killed the prince, and the king said he must find him, to save the king's life.  They found Jubal, who pointed to the tree where the prince was, and they told the prince he must come because a lady was looking for him, and they brought Jubal with them.  He did not break his leg over the handkerchief, and the princess knew he was the prince, so they married, and went back to her castle.

==Commentary==
Jacobs noted the king with three sons was a common motif, and that the [[Sleeping Beauty]] is found in [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]].&lt;ref name="jacobs" /&gt;

'''Willard Van Orman Quine''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|aɪ|n}}; known to intimates as "Van";&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Quine|date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; June 25, 1908 – December 25, 2000) was an [[American philosopher]]  and [[logician]] in the [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]], recognized as "one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/arts/29QUIN.html "W. V. Quine, Philosopher Who Analyzed Language and Reality, Dies at 92"]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1930 until his death 70 years later, Quine was continually affiliated with [[Harvard University]] in one way or another, first as a student, then as a professor of philosophy and a teacher of logic and [[set theory]], and finally as a professor emeritus who published or revised several books in retirement. He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard from 1956 to 1978. A 2009 poll conducted among analytic philosophers named Quine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/03/so-who-is-the-most-important-philosopher-of-the-past-200-years.html "So who *is* the most important philosopher of the past 200 years?"] Leiter Reports.

Quine falls squarely into the analytic philosophy tradition while also being the main proponent of the view that philosophy is not [[conceptual analysis]] but the abstract branch of the empirical sciences.  His major writings include "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" (1951), which attacked the distinction between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] and [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]] [[proposition]]s and advocated a form of [[semantic holism]], and ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine's famous [[indeterminacy of translation]] thesis, advocating a [[behaviorist]] [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]]. He also developed an influential [[naturalized epistemology]] that tried to provide "an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input."&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/quine-sc/ "Quine's Philosophy of Science"]. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Iep.utm.edu. July 27, 2009. Accessed March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also important in [[philosophy of science]] for his "systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself"&lt;ref name="iep" /&gt; and for his conception of philosophy as continuous with science. This led to his famous quip that "philosophy of science is philosophy enough."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2251091?cookieSet=1 "Mr Strawson on Logical Theory"]. WV Quine. ''Mind'' Vol. 62 No. 248. Oct. 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[philosophy of mathematics]], he and his Harvard colleague [[Hilary Putnam]] developed the "[[Philosophy of mathematics#Indispensability argument for realism|Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis]]," an argument for the [[Philosophy of mathematics#Empiricism|reality of mathematical entities]].&lt;ref&gt;Colyvan, Mark, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2004/entries/mathphil-indis/ "Indispensability Arguments in the Philosophy of Mathematics"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
According to his autobiography, ''The Time of My Life'' (1986), Quine grew up in [[Akron, Ohio]], where he lived with his parents and older brother Robert Cloyd. His father, Cloyd Robert,&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Quine, ed. Roger F. Gibson, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; was a manufacturing entrepreneur (founder of the Akron Equipment Company, which produced tire molds)&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Quine, ed. Roger F. Gibson, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, Harriett E., was a schoolteacher and later a housewife.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt; He received his B.A. in mathematics from [[Oberlin College]] in 1930, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Harvard University]] in 1932. His thesis supervisor was [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. He was then appointed a [[Harvard Junior Fellow]], which excused him from having to teach for four years. During the academic year 1932–33, he travelled in Europe thanks to a Sheldon fellowship, meeting Polish logicians (including [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]] and [[Alfred Tarski]]) and members of the [[Vienna Circle]] (including [[Rudolf Carnap]]), as well as the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt;

It was Quine who arranged for Tarski to be invited to the September 1939 [[Unity of Science]] Congress in Cambridge, for which Tarski sailed on the last ship to leave [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] before the [[Third Reich]] invaded Poland. Tarski survived the war and worked another 44 years in the US.

During World War II, Quine lectured on logic in Brazil, in Portuguese, and served in the United States Navy in a [[military intelligence]] role, deciphering messages from German submarines, and reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt;

At Harvard, Quine helped supervise the Harvard [[graduate theses]] of, among others, [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Gilbert Harman]], [[Dagfinn Føllesdal]], [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]], [[Hugues LeBlanc]],  [[Henry Hiz]] and [[George Myro]]. For the academic year 1964–1965, Quine was a fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at [[Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html "Guide to the Center for Advanced Studies Records, 1958–1969"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314083709/http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html |date=March 14, 2017 }}. Weselyan University. Wesleyan.edu. Accessed March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980
Quine received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Humanities at [[Uppsala University]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt;

Quine was an atheist when he was a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of W.V. Quine|year=1986|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812690101|page=6|last1=Quine |first1=Willard Van Orman |last2=Hahn |first2=Lewis Edwin |quote=In my third year of high school I walked often with my new Jamaican friends, Fred and Harold Cassidy, trying to convert them from their Episcopalian faith to atheism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had four children by two marriages.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt; Guitarist [[Robert Quine]] was his nephew.

In the foreword to the new edition of ''Word and Object'', Quine's student Dagfinn Føllesdal noted that Quine began to lose his memory toward the end of his life. The deterioration of his short-term memory was so severe that he struggled to continue following arguments. Quine also had considerable difficulty in his project to make the desired revisions to ''Word and Object.'' Before passing away, Quine noted to Morton White, "I do not remember what my illness is called, Althusser or Alzheimer, but since I cannot remember it, it must be Alzheimer." He passed away from the illness on Christmas Day in 2000.&lt;ref&gt; W.V. Quine. ''Word and Object'' 2013. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political beliefs===
Quine was politically conservative, but the bulk of his writing was in technical areas of philosophy removed from direct political issues.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [http://www.wvquine.org/wvq-obit3.html obituary] for W V Quine – January 4, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, write in defense of several conservative positions: for example, in ''Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary'', he wrote a defense of [[moral censorship]];&lt;ref&gt;''Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary'', entry for Tolerance (pp. 206–8)&lt;/ref&gt; while, in his autobiography, he made some criticisms of American postwar academic culture.&lt;ref&gt;"Paradoxes of Plenty" in ''Theories and Things'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Time of My Life: An Autobiography'', pp. 352–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Quine's Ph.D. thesis and early publications were on [[formal logic]] and [[set theory]]. Only after World War II did he, by virtue of seminal papers on [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and language, emerge as a major philosopher. By the 1960s, he had worked out his "naturalized epistemology" whose aim was to answer all substantive questions of knowledge and meaning using the methods and tools of the natural sciences. Quine roundly rejected the notion that there should be a "first philosophy", a theoretical standpoint somehow prior to natural science and capable of justifying it. These views are intrinsic to his [[philosophical naturalism|naturalism]].

Quine could lecture in French, Spanish, Portuguese and German, as well as his native English.

Like the logical positivists, Quine evinced little interest in the philosophical canon: only once did he teach a course in the history of philosophy, on Hume.{{Clarify|reason=These words mean nothing to non-experts: 'logical positivist', 'philosophical canon', and 'Hume.'  What is this sentence trying to tell me?|date=October 2014}}

===Rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction===
{{See also|Two Dogmas of Empiricism#Analyticity and circularity|l1=Two Dogmas of Empiricism}}
In the 1930s and 40s, discussions with [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Nelson Goodman]] and [[Alfred Tarski]], among others, led Quine to doubt the tenability of the distinction between "analytic" statements—those true simply by the meanings of their words, such as "All bachelors are unmarried"—and "synthetic" statements, those true or false by virtue of facts about the world, such as "There is a cat on the mat." This distinction was central to [[logical positivism]]. Although Quine is not normally associated with [[verificationism]], some philosophers believe the tenet is not incompatible with his general philosophy of language, citing his Harvard colleague [[B. F. Skinner]] and his analysis of language in ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Prawitz, Dag. 'Quine and Verificationism.' In ''Inquiry'', Stockholm, 1994, pp 487–494&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] philosophers before him, Quine accepted the [[definition]] of "analytic" as "true in virtue of meaning alone". Unlike them, however, he concluded that ultimately the definition was [[circular definition|circular]]. In other words, Quine accepted that analytic statements are those that are true by definition, then argued that the notion of truth by definition was unsatisfactory. 

Quine's chief objection to analyticity is with the notion of [[synonymy]] (sameness of meaning), a sentence being analytic, just in case it substitutes a synonym for one "black" in a proposition like "All black things are black" (or any other [[logical truth]]). The objection to synonymy hinges upon the problem of collateral information. We intuitively feel that there is a distinction between "All unmarried men are bachelors" and "There have been black dogs", but a competent English speaker will assent to both sentences under all conditions since such speakers also have access to ''collateral information'' bearing on the historical existence of black dogs. Quine maintains that there is no distinction between universally known collateral information and conceptual or analytic truths.

Another approach to Quine's objection to analyticity and synonymy emerges from the modal notion of [[logical possibility]]. A traditional [[Wittgenstein]]ian view of meaning held that each meaningful sentence was associated with a region in the space of possible worlds.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Quine finds the notion of such a space problematic, arguing that there is no distinction between those truths which are universally and confidently believed and those which are necessarily true.

===Confirmation holism and ontological relativity===
The central theses underlying the [[indeterminacy of translation]] and other extensions of Quine's work are [[ontological relativity]] and the related [[doctrine]] of [[confirmation holism]]. The premise of confirmation [[holism]] is that all theories (and the propositions derived from them) are under-determined by empirical data (data, sensory-data, evidence); although some theories are not justifiable, failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex, there are many equally justifiable alternatives. While the Greeks' assumption that (unobservable) Homeric gods exist is false, and our supposition of (unobservable) electromagnetic waves is true, both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations.

Quine concluded his "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As an empiricist I continue to think of the conceptual scheme of science as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light of past experience. Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of [[Homer]] . . . For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine's ontological [[relativism]] (evident in the passage above) led him to agree with [[Pierre Duhem]] that for any collection of [[empirical evidence]], there would always be many theories able to account for it. However, Duhem's [[holism]] is much more restricted and limited than Quine's. For Duhem, underdetermination applies only to [[physics]] or possibly to [[natural science]], while for Quine it applies to all of human knowledge. Thus, while it is possible to verify or [[falsifiability|falsify]] whole theories, it is not possible to verify or falsify individual statements. Almost any particular statement can be saved, given sufficiently radical modifications of the containing theory. For Quine, scientific thought forms a [[Coherentism|coherent]] web in which any part could be altered in the light of empirical evidence, and in which no empirical evidence could force the revision of a given part.

===Existence and its contrary===
The [[Problem of empty names|problem of non-referring names]] is an old puzzle in philosophy, which Quine captured when he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity.  It can be put into three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables: 'What is there?'  It can be answered, moreover, in a word—'Everything'—and everyone will accept this answer as true.&lt;ref&gt;W. V. O. Quine, "[[On What There Is]]", ''The Review of Metaphysics'' '''2'''(5), 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More directly, the controversy goes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;How can we talk about [[Pegasus]]?  To what does the word 'Pegasus' refer?  If our answer is, 'Something,' then we seem to believe in mystical entities; if our answer is, 'nothing', then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this?  Certainly when we said that Pegasus was a mythological winged horse we make sense, and moreover we speak the truth!  If we speak the truth, this must be truth ''about something''.  So we cannot be speaking of nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine resists the temptation to say that non-referring terms are meaningless for reasons made clear above.  Instead he tells us that we must first determine whether our terms refer or not before we know the proper way to understand them.  However, [[Czesław Lejewski]] criticizes this belief for reducing the matter to empirical discovery when it seems we should have a formal distinction between referring and non-referring terms or elements of our domain.  Lejewski writes further,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This state of affairs does not seem to be very satisfactory.  The idea that some of our rules of inference should depend on empirical information, which may not be forthcoming, is so foreign to the character of logical inquiry that a thorough re-examination of the two inferences [existential generalization and universal instantiation] may prove worth our while.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lejewski then goes on to offer a description of [[free logic]], which he claims accommodates an answer to the problem.

Lejewski also points out that free logic additionally can handle the problem of the empty set for statements like &lt;math&gt;\forall x\,Fx \rightarrow \exists x\,Fx&lt;/math&gt;.  Quine had considered the problem of the empty set unrealistic, which left Lejewski unsatisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Czeslaw Lejewski, "Logic and Existence". ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 5 (1954–55), pp. 104–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logic===
Over the course of his career, Quine published numerous technical and expository papers on formal logic, some of which are reprinted in his ''Selected Logic Papers'' and in ''The Ways of Paradox''.

Quine confined logic to classical bivalent [[first-order logic]], hence to truth and falsity under any (nonempty) [[universe of discourse]]. Hence the following were not logic for Quine:
* Higher-order logic and set theory. He referred to [[higher-order logic]] as "set theory in disguise";
* Much of what ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' included in logic was not logic for Quine.
* Formal systems involving [[intension]]al notions, especially [[modal logic|modality]]. Quine was especially hostile to modal logic with [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]], a battle he largely lost when [[Saul Kripke]]'s [[Kripke semantics|relational semantics]] became canonical for [[modal logic]]s.

Quine wrote three undergraduate texts on formal logic:
* ''Elementary Logic''. While teaching an introductory course in 1940, Quine discovered that extant texts for philosophy students did not do justice to [[quantification theory]] or [[first-order predicate logic]]. Quine wrote this book in 6 weeks as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' solution to his teaching needs.
* ''Methods of Logic''. The four editions of this book resulted from a more advanced undergraduate course in logic Quine taught from the end of World War II until his 1978 retirement.
* ''Philosophy of Logic''. A concise and witty undergraduate treatment of a number of Quinian themes, such as the prevalence of use-mention confusions, the dubiousness of [[modal logic|quantified modal logic]], and the non-logical character of higher-order logic.

''Mathematical Logic'' is based on Quine's graduate teaching during the 1930s and '40s. It shows that much of what ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' took more than 1000 pages to say can be said in 250 pages. The proofs are concise, even cryptic. The last chapter, on [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] and [[Tarski's indefinability theorem]], along with the article Quine (1946), became a launching point for [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s later lucid exposition of these and related results.

Quine's work in logic gradually became dated in some respects. Techniques he did not teach and discuss include [[analytic tableau]]x, [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive function]]s, and [[model theory]]. His treatment of [[metalogic]] left something to be desired. For example, ''Mathematical Logic'' does not include any proofs of [[soundness]] and [[completeness (logic)|completeness]]. Early in his career, the notation of his writings on logic was often idiosyncratic. His later writings nearly always employed the now-dated notation of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Set against all this are the simplicity of his preferred method (as exposited in his ''Methods of Logic'') for determining the satisfiability of quantified formulas, the richness of his philosophical and linguistic insights, and the fine prose in which he expressed them.

Most of Quine's original work in formal logic from 1960 onwards was on variants of his [[predicate functor logic]], one of several ways that have been proposed for doing logic without [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]]s. For a comprehensive treatment of predicate functor logic and its history, see Quine (1976). For an introduction, see chpt. 45 of his ''Methods of Logic''.

Quine was very warm to the possibility that formal logic would eventually be applied outside of philosophy and mathematics. He wrote several papers on the sort of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] employed in [[electrical engineering]], and with [[Edward J. McCluskey]], devised the [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm]] of reducing [[Boolean equation]]s to a minimum covering sum of [[prime implicant]]s.

===Set theory===
While his contributions to logic include elegant expositions and a number of technical results, it is in [[set theory]] that Quine was most innovative. He always maintained that mathematics required set theory and that set theory was quite distinct from logic. He flirted with [[Nelson Goodman]]'s [[nominalism]] for a while, but backed away when he failed to find a nominalist grounding of mathematics.

Over the course of his career, Quine proposed three variants of axiomatic set theory, each including the [[axiom of extensionality]]:
* [[New Foundations]], NF, creates and manipulates sets using a single axiom schema for set admissibility, namely an axiom schema of stratified comprehension, whereby all individuals satisfying a stratified formula compose a set. A stratified formula is one that [[type theory]] would allow, were the [[ontology]] to include types. However, Quine's set theory does not feature types. The metamathematics of NF are curious. NF allows many "large" sets the now-canonical [[ZFC]] set theory does not allow, even sets for which the [[axiom of choice]] does not hold. Since the axiom of choice holds for all finite sets, the failure of this axiom in NF proves that NF includes infinite sets. The consistency of NF relative to other formal systems adequate for mathematics is an open question, albeit that a number of candidate proofs are current in the NF community suggesting that NF is equiconsistent with [[Zermelo set theory]] without Choice. A modification of NF, [[New Foundations|NFU]], due to R. B. Jensen and admitting [[urelement]]s (entities that can be members of sets but that lack elements), turns out to be consistent relative to [[Peano arithmetic]], thus vindicating the intuition behind NF. NF and NFU are the only Quinean set theories with a following. For a derivation of foundational mathematics in NF, see Rosser (1952);
* The set theory of ''Mathematical Logic'' is NF augmented by the [[proper class]]es of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], except axiomatized in a much simpler way;
* The set theory of ''Set Theory and Its Logic'' does away with stratification and is almost entirely derived from a single axiom schema. Quine derived the foundations of mathematics once again. This book includes the definitive exposition of Quine's theory of virtual sets and relations, and surveyed axiomatic set theory as it stood circa 1960. 

All three set theories admit a universal class, but since they are free of any [[hierarchy]] of [[Type (metaphysics)|types]], they have no need for a distinct universal class at each type level.

Quine's set theory and its background logic were driven by a desire to minimize posits; each innovation is pushed as far as it can be pushed before further innovations are introduced. For Quine, there is but one connective, the [[Sheffer stroke]], and one quantifier, the [[universal quantifier]]. All polyadic [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] can be reduced to one dyadic predicate, interpretable as set membership. His rules of proof were limited to [[modus ponens]] and substitution. He preferred [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] to either [[disjunction]] or the [[Material conditional|conditional]], because conjunction has the least semantic ambiguity. He was delighted to discover early in his career that all of first order logic and set theory could be grounded in a mere two primitive notions: [[set abstraction|abstraction]] and [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]]. For an elegant introduction to the parsimony of Quine's approach to logic, see his "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic," ch. 5 in his ''From a Logical Point of View''.

===Epistemology===
Just as he challenged the dominant analytic–synthetic distinction, Quine also took aim at traditional [[normative]] [[epistemology]].  According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by [[Rudolf Carnap]]) failed, and so we should replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/#2|title=Naturalized Epistemology|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input — certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance — and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output a description of the three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one's theory of nature transcends any available evidence...But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that we can now make free use of empirical psychology." (Quine, 1969: 82–3)

Quine's proposal is controversial among contemporary philosophers and has several critics, with [[Jaegwon Kim]] the most prominent among them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/ "Naturalized Epistemology"].

* A [[computer program]] whose output is its own source code is called a "[[Quine (computing)|quine]]" after Quine. This usage was introduced by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his 1979 book, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''.
