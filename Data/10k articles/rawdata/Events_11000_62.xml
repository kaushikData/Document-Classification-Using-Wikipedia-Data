The '''1972 Chicago commuter rail crash''', the worst in [[Chicago]]'s history, occurred during the cloudy morning rush hour on October 30, 1972.

[[Illinois Central Gulf]] train 416, made up of newly purchased [[Highliner]]s, overshot the [[27th Street (Metra station)|27th Street Station]] on what is now the [[Metra Electric Line]], and the [[Railroad engineer|engineer]] asked and received permission from the train's [[conductor (transportation)|conductor]] to back the train to the platform. This move was then made without the flag protection required by the railroad's rules. Unfortunately, his train had cleared automatic block signals which cleared express train 720, made up of more heavily constructed single level cars, to continue at full speed on the same track. The engineer of the express train did not see the bilevel train backing up until it was too late. When the trains collided, the front car of the express train [[Telescoping (railway)|telescoped]] the rear car of the bilevel train, killing 45 people and injuring 332.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/disasters/ilcentral_crash.html |title=1972, October 30: Illinois Central Commuter Train Crash|publisher=Chicago Public Library|accessdate=July 7, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001031/http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/disasters/ilcentral_crash.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=David P.|date=January 1973|title=7:38 A.M., October 30, 1972|journal=Trains Magazine|publisher=Kalmbach Publishing|location=Milwaukee, WI|volume=33|issue=3|pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
Year '''459 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Vibulanus and Uritinus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 295 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 459 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Persian Empire ====
* The Jewish priest [[Ezra]] assembles and leads a band of approximately 5,000 [[Jews]] from [[Babylon]] to [[Jerusalem]].

==== Greece ====
* [[Athens]] allies itself with the city state of [[Megara]] which is under pressure from [[Corinth]]. This alliance leads to war between Corinth and Athens. The first battle of the war, at [[Haliesis]] in the Gulf of [[Argolis]], results in a Corinthian victory, but the next battle, at [[Cecryphalea]] (modern [[Angistrion]]), goes Athens' way.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The [[Aequi]] occupy [[Tusculum]]. In response to the threat, the [[Roman Senate]] decide to send an army to help the allied city, under the command of consul [[Lucius Cornelius Maluginensis]]. In addition, the consul [[Fabius Vibulanus]], who was at that point besieging [[Antium]], moves his forces to attack Tusculum. The Tusculans are able to recapture their city. A truce is then arranged with the Aequi.

==== Sicily ====
* The [[Sicily|Sicilian]] town of [[Morgantina]] is destroyed by [[Ducetius]], hellenised leader of the [[Siculi]] (according to [[Diodorus Siculus]]).

'''Abbas Abdullahi Sheikh Siraji''' ([[Somali language|Somali]]: ''Cabaas Cabdulaahi Sheekh Siraaji''; [[Arabic]]: (عباس عبد الله شيخ سراج) born 08 May 1985 – 3 May 2017&lt;ref name="BNO"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bnonews.com/news/index.php/news/id5870 |title=Somalia’s Public Works Minister shot dead in Mogadishu |date=3 May 2017 |work=[[BNO News]] |access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Somalia|Somali]] politician who briefly served as the Minister of [[Public Works]] and Reconstruction until he was shot dead in Mogadishu in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mpwr.gov.so/en/minister-handover-ceremony/|title=Minister Handover ceremony – Ministry of Public Works &amp; Reconstruction|website=mpwr.gov.so|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Born to a prestigious religious family of the [[Rahanweyn]] clan, Abbas spent an overwhelming majority of his life living in Dadaab Refugee Camps.&lt;ref name=DeadMin/&gt; By the age of 5, his parents moved with him and his siblings to Liboi Refugee camps in 1991 and later relocated to [[Dadaab refugee camp]] in 1992. e ahadith (prophet's teachings) and the Fiqh. 

Abbass as a bright young kid started his education with Qur'anic Dugsi (school) and completed learning the holy Qur'an before the age of 10. His father was a Sheikh and a respected scholar in the Somali community and so is his grandfather. It wasn't too long before he had a full grasp of the ahadith (prophet's teachings) and the Fiqh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-05-25|title=Fiqh|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fiqh&amp;oldid=782183743|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Islamic Jurisprudence).

He started primary school by the then Jack Asiyo Primary School later renamed as Halane Primary School (1994-1998) and proceeded to Midnimo ("Unity") primary school&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://midnimo.primary.school.co.ke/|title=MIDNIMO PRIMARY SCHOOL - GARISSA|website=midnimo.primary.school.co.ke|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Upper Primary education (1999-2001). He finished high school at Ifo Secondary School (ISS)&lt;ref&gt;http://ifo.secondary.school.co.ke/||title=Ifo Secondary School&lt;/ref&gt; in Ifo Camp (Dadaab) in 2005. He later proceeded to Nep Technical Training College (NEP TTC)in Garissa, NE Kenya. It was at NEP technical where Abbas had his first exposure to politics and was the president of the Students Union. Historically, there has always been a tension between the Somali students and the non-Somali students at Nep Technical. It was Abass that brokered peace between the two teams. He's remembered in his former alma mater as "Abass, the president, the peace maker!"

He later joined [[Kenya Methodist University]] and then [[Moi University]] to pursue a degree in [[Business Administration]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

With high hopes and dreams of changing his motherland, Abbas went back to Somalia in 2011 to take a job with the humanitarian agencies working in Somalia. He worked with the likes of [[FAO]] and later fully moved on embarking politics. In 2016 he was selected by an [[Electoral college]] for the position as [[Member of parliament|MP]] for [[Kismayo]] ([[Lower house|House of the People]]) in the current term of the [[Federal Parliament of Somalia#10th Parliament .282016.29|Federal Parliament of Somalia]], otherwise known as the '''Tenth Parliament'''.&lt;ref name=DeadMin/&gt;.

==Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction==
{{see also|Cabinet of Somalia|Federal Government of Somalia}}
[[File:Abbass Siraji Last picture alive.jpg|thumb]]
On 21 March 2017, Prime Minister [[Hassan Ali Khaire]] named Hon. Siraji as the next Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hiiraan.com/news4/2017/Mar/141153/pm_khaire_announces_27_member_cabinet.aspx|title=PM Khaire announces 27 member cabinet|website=www.hiiraan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took office on 4 April during a handover ceremony at the Ministry of Public Works, making him the youngest ever cabinet member at age 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpwr.gov.so/en/minister-handover-ceremony/|title=Minister Handover ceremony – Ministry of Public Works &amp; Reconstruction|website=mpwr.gov.so}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his short period as a public works minister, Abass implemented far more projects than the entire cabinet combined. This made him the most popular and one of the most loved politicians in Somalia. According to the [http://mpwr.gov.so/en/national-condolence/ Ministry of Public Works and Reconstruction] website, Hon. Abass was in office for only one month but has done more than 30 months of tasks/work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mpwr.gov.so/en/national-condolence/|title=National Condolence – Ministry of Public Works &amp; Reconstruction|website=mpwr.gov.so|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agent of Peace and Hope ==
Hon. Abass is widely regarded as an agent of peace and hope for the Somali nation.

In his early years in college, he brokered a peace deal between different student factions (who were arch rivals) in his college. That gave him the title "Peace maker." He carried that same attitude and mentality in Federal government level. Many of his colleagues in the parliament and cabinet have attested that he brought together politicians that have not spoken to each other for decades. He was a friend to everyone and slowly instilled peace between rival politicians.

He represented hope for Dadaab Youth and the Somali community at large. He was the first person from Dadaab to hold such a high government office. Everyone looked up to him and started dreaming of the days they will all go back home.

He was young, educated, energetic with a vision of prosperous [[Somalia]] with functioning government institutions. He breached peace, unity and love. Somalia was waking up to  a new dawn, a new reality, a new hope.

== Community &amp; Charity Work ==
Besides his public service to the nation, Hon. Abbass was doing multiple community and charity work.

Before his death, he was involved in the construction of [[water well]]s in his hometown of [[Afmadow|Afmadoow]] and his constituency.

He was also building the [[Somalia|Somali nation]] few students at a time. Abass was paying for the tuition fees of close to a dozen Somali students both in [[Somalia]] and [[Kenya]]. This has never been disclosed prior to his death making it genuine work of nationalism. Abbass's vision was to eradicate poverty &amp; diseases like tribalism and terrorism through education. He believed the root cause of all evil was ignorance and he was ready to fight it to his last breath.

==Death==
[[File:Body of Abass Siraji.jpg|thumb]]
Initial reports suggested that Siraji was shot and killed on 3 May 2017 when soldiers on a patrol opened fire as he drove his vehicle near the [[Villa Somalia]].&lt;ref name=BNO/&gt; The circumstances of the shooting were not immediately clear. Media reports said the soldiers may have perceived Siraji's vehicle as a threat.&lt;ref name=DeadMin&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39799961 | title =Somalia attack: Minister Abdullahi Sheikh Abas killed in Mogadishu  | date = 4 May 2017| website =www.bbc.com | publisher =[[BBC]] | access-date =4 May 2017 | quote =Somalia's security forces have shot dead a 31-year-old government minister after mistaking him for a militant Islamist, officials have said. He was killed in his vehicle near the presidential palace in the capital, Mogadishu, the officials added.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of people have been reportedly arrested in connection with his death. Later reports have indicated that Siraji was traveling in his car behind a vehicle convoy bearing the [[Auditor General]] Nur Jimale Farah, when the bodyguards of the latter apparently somehow mistook Siraji's car for a [[Improvised explosive device#Background|VBIED]] being driven by a suicide bomber targeting the Auditor General and so opened fire on it.&lt;ref name=VOA&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-government-minister-killed-mogadishu/3836315.html | title =Somali Government Minister Killed in Mogadishu | date =3 May 2017 | website =www.voanews.com | publisher =[[Voice of America]] | access-date =6 May 2017 | quote =Abbas Abdullahi Sheikh Siraji, 31, was fatally shot near the Presidential Palace, Information Minister Abdirahman Omar Osman told VOA. Witnesses told VOA Somali that Siraji was hit by gunshots fired from a vehicle in which Auditor General Nur Jimale Farah was riding. Farah told VOA Somali that his bodyguards suspected a vehicle behind them was transporting a suicide bomber. The vehicles were about 500 meters from the Presidential Palace when the bodyguards opened fire, Farah said.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ALJ&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/05/somalia-buries-killed-minister-siraji-opens-probe-170504154646099.html | title =Somalia buries slain minister Siraji, opens probe | date =5 May 2017 | website =www.aljazeera.com | publisher =[[Al Jazeera]] | access-date =6 May 2017 | quote =Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed has ordered an investigation into what he called an "unfortunate tragedy" as the country buried a minister killed by another official's guards.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All evidence however suggest that this was a planned assissination carried out by the [[Auditor General]] Nur Jimale Farah.

The [[Auditor General]] Nur Jimale Farah, spoke with the media immediately after his security team assassinated the late minister and claimed that there was a fire exchange but all evidence (including CCTV cameras) and eye witness accounts indicate that there was no existence of such fire exchange. There were only two shots fired from Nur Jimale Farah vehicle that killed the minister (execution style).

The minister received a full [[state funeral]] the day after his killing, attended by President [[Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed]] and Prime Minister [[Hassan Ali Khayre]] along with other senior figures.&lt;ref name="StateFuneral"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-africa-39261849|title=Funeral held for Somali minister shot dead in Mogadishu (Africa highlights)|date=4 May 2017|website=www.bbc.com|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=6 May 2017|quote=A state funeral has been held in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, for the 31-year-old government minister shot dead yesterday after security forces mistook him for a militant Islamist. Abas Abdullahi Sheikh, who grew up in the Dadaab refugee camp before later becoming the country's youngest ever cabinet minister, was an inspiring role model to many Somalis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ALJ" /&gt;

'''Alchemy Film &amp; Moving Image Festival''' is an annual [[film festival]] held in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/festivals/uk-festivals/film/alchemy-film-and-moving-image-festival-2018 |title=Alchemy Film &amp; Moving Image Festival: 2018 Report |last=Dunn |first=Jamie |publisher=The Skinny |date=May 15, 2018 |access-date=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a leading festival of experimental and artists' film within the UK and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cloughton |first=Rachael |date=2016 |title=Alchemy Film Festival |url=https://alchemyfilmfestival.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Scottish-Art-News-Autumn-2016.pdf |magazine=Scottish Art News |location=Scotland |publisher=Fleming-Wyfold Art Foundation |access-date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was held in September 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://alchemyfilmfestival.org.uk/2010/programme.pdf |title=Alchemy Film &amp; Moving Image Festival 2010 Programme |publisher=Alchemy Film &amp; Arts |date=September 2010 |access-date=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the festival shows around 130 films each year, with a mixed programme of short films, feature films, moving image installations, specialist curated programmes and live expanded cinema performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://film.list.co.uk/article/100156-alchemy-film-and-moving-image-festival-launches-its-2018-programme/ |title=Alchemy Film and Moving Image Festival 2018 |last=Robertson |first=Murray |publisher=The List |date=April 11, 2018 |access-date=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/film/film-review-alchemy-film-and-moving-image-festival-1-4382673 |title=Film review: Alchemy Film and Moving Image Festival|last=Harkness |first=Alistair |publisher=The Scotsman |date=March 4, 2017 |access-date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated in the rural [[Scottish Borders]] town of [[Hawick]] the festival's Creative Director, [[Richard Ashrowan]], described its foundation as "a provocation to the prevailing urban-centrism in terms of culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creativescotland.com/explore/read/stories/film/2017/filmmakers-and-artists-head-to-hawick-for-alchemy-film-and-moving-image-festival |title=Filmmakers and artists head to Hawick for Alchemy Film Festival |publisher=Creative Scotland |date=February 20, 2016 |access-date=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main cinema screenings are held in an award-winning converted spinning mill, Tower Mill, which is part of Heart of [[Hawick]], a key partner organisation for the festival. The festival also utilises a variety of disused and ex-industrial spaces for moving image installations throughout the town. 

Alchemy has premiered screenings by such filmmakers as [[Jan Švankmajer]], [[Sarah Pucill]], [[Andrew Kötting]], [[Rachel Maclean]], [[The Quay Brothers]], [[Semiconductor (artists)]], [[Mike Hoolboom]], [[Nina Danino]], [[Patrick Bokanowski]], [[Jacques Perconte]], [[Mark Leckey]], and [[Ben Rivers]]. 

Alchemy Film &amp; Moving Image Festival is run by Alchemy Film &amp; Arts, which is registered with the [[Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator]].

[[File:All India Muslim league conference 1906 attendees in Dhaka.jpg|right|260px|thumb|The All India Muhammadan Educational Conference, at [[Dhaka]] (1906), which led to the foundation of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], on 30 December 1906]]
The '''All India Muhammadan Educational Conference''' was an organisation promoting modern, liberal education for the [[Muslim]] community in [[India]]. It was founded by Sir [[Syed Ahmed Khan]], also the founder of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-India Muhammadan Educational Conference|url=http://global.britannica.com/topic/All-India-Muhammadan-Educational-Conference|website=global.britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All India Mumammadan Educational Conference was the origin of the All-India Muslim League. The Muslim League was born in the 20th session of All India Muhammadan Educational Conference, which was established by Syed Ahmed Khan in [[Aligarh]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rrioNz8_EwwC|title=Shi'a Islam in Colonial India: Religion, Community and Sectarianism|last=Jones|first=Justin|date=24 October 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139501231|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Muhammadan Educational Conference used to hold its annual meetings in various cities where, by the co-operation of local Muslims, steps were taken for the progress of education.

==Aims==
The principal aims of the Conference were:

* To make an effort to spread among the Muslims western education to the higher standard.' 
* To enquire into the state of religious education in English schools founded and endowed by the Muslims, and to find out means to conduct it in the best possible way. 
*  To give some strengthened support to the instruction voluntarily imparted by Muslim divines in religious and other oriental learning's and adopt some measures to maintain it as a living concern. 
* To examine a state of education and instruction in the indigenous primary schools and take steps to remove their present state of decay in directing them onto the path of progress.

==The 1906 conference==
[[Image:SAKhan.jpg|thumb|200px|Sir [[Syed Ahmed Khan]], the founder of All India Muhammadan Educational Conference]]
After the Congress sponsored agitation against the partition of Bengal (1905) an All India Muhammadan Educational Conference was held at [[Shahbag]] in [[Dhaka]], capital of the then [[East Bengal|East Bengal and Assam Province]] in the year 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Zaigham|title=Pakistan of the Ismailis|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-319508-Pakistan-of-the-Ismailis|website=thenews.com.pk|publisher=The News International|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was sponsored by [[Khwaja Salimullah|Nawab Khwaja Salimullah]] the [[Dhaka Nawab Family|Nawab of Dhaka]]. The conference was inaugurated on 27 December 1906 and continued till 29 December 1906 as Conference on Education. The inaugural session was chaired by Nawab Justice Sharfuddin, the newly appointed justice of Calcutta High Court.

On 30 December 1906 political session of the conference took place. It was chaired by [[Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk]]. In this session a motion to form an [[All India Muslim League]] (AIML) was proceeded. Initially a party styled as ''All India Muslim Confederacy'' was discussed. But, in the process the name ''All India Muslim League'', proposed by Nawab Khawaja Sir Salimullah Bahadur and seconded by Hakim Ajmal Khan, was resolved in the meeting. All delegates were registered as members of the proposed party led by Janab Muhsin-ul-mulk and Janab Wakar-ul-mulk was Joint Conveners.

AIML was first Muslim political party in the history of India. From the even date Muslims of all Indian provinces were under the mainstream political umbrella of Muslim League until independence achieved in the year 1947 under the leadership of Muslim League.  Awami Muslim League and Awami League was also formed as a late production of the party in the Pakistan Period. In Indo pak Bangla sub continent those parties have the part ''League'' possess heritage of Muslim League till date. Political awareness, eagerness and rising of Muslims was organised and institutionalised from the starting point of establishing ''All India Muslim League''.

===Venue===
[[Image:Israt Manzil.jpg|thumb|Ishrat Manzil]]
It is to be noted that the place where All India Muhammadan Educational Conference were held was known to all as [[Shahbag#Historic mansions|Ishrat Manzil]], a mansion of the Dhaka Nawab Family that was later donated for the establishment of the Dhaka University. After 5 years of this conference in the year 1911 Partition of Bengal was annulled in the Delhi Durbar. In the year 1912 A delegation headed by Khawaja Nawab Sir Salimulla met Lord Hardinge Lt. Governor, to the same venue demanding establishment of a University at Dacca and it was agreed.  Upon whom present Dhaka University was started its functioning on 1 July 1921 in the same venue.  Now the Eshrat Manzil lapsed its heritage, fame and name of Dhaka's Nawab family and prevailed as a canteen named ''[[Madhur Canteen]]''.

===Delegates===

The '''Apollo Theatre''' is a [[listed building|Grade II listed]] [[West End theatre]], on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] in the [[City of Westminster]], in central [[London]].&lt;ref name=listing&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=427104 English Heritage listing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022153102/http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&amp;id=427104 |date=22 October 2012 }} accessed 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by the architect [[Lewin Sharp]] for owner [[Henry Lowenfeld]],&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt; it became the fourth legitimate theatre to be constructed on the street when it opened its doors on 21 February 1901,&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt; with the American [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] ''The Belle of Bohemia''.&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt;

==History==

===Construction===
[[Henry Lowenfeld]] had bought land on the newly created [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] at the turn of the 20th century—next door to the [[Lyric Theatre, London|Lyric Theatre]], which opened in 1888—and as a consequence the Apollo is one of the few theatres in London to be [[freehold (law)|freehold]].&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt;&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt;

The only complete theatre design of architect Lewin Sharp,&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt; the Apollo was specifically designed for [[musical theatre]] and named after the Greek god of the arts and leader of the muses.&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt; It was constructed by builder Walter Wallis of plain [[London stock brick|London brick]] in keeping with the neighbouring streets; the front piece is in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]] with a sculpted stone fascia by T. Simpson. The structure encloses a four-level auditorium, with three cantilevered balconies and a first-floor central loggia, decorated in the [[Louis XIV Style]] by [[Hubert van Hooydonk]]. In keeping with then European style, each level has its own foyer and promenade.&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt;

Owing to the death of [[Queen Victoria]] the previous month, it became the first London theatre to be completed in the [[Edwardian period]].&lt;ref name=TITheatre/&gt; The capacity on the opening night, 21 February 1901,&lt;ref name="tel"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/10529373/Apollo-Theatre-history.html| title=Apollo Theatre: history| publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]| work=telegraph.co.uk| date=19 December 2013| accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was 893, with a [[proscenium]] of {{convert|9.14|m}} wide and {{convert|8.89|m}} deep.&lt;ref name=ALloyd&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/ApolloTheatre.htm| title=Apollo Theatre| publisher=Arthur Lloyd| accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacity today is 775 seats,&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt; with the balcony on the 3rd tier considered the steepest in London.&lt;ref name=TITheatre&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thisistheatre.com/londontheatre/apollotheatre.html| title=Apollo Theatre, Shaftsbury Ave, London| publisher=ThisIsTheatre.com| date=22 April 2014| accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stand/&gt;

===Operations===
Owing to a relatively unsuccessful opening, impresario [[Tom B. Davis]] took a lease on the building, and hence management of operations, from 1902.&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt; The theatre was renovated by [[Ernest Schaufelberg]] in 1932, with a private foyer and [[Antechamber|anteroom]] installed to the Royal Box.&lt;ref name=ALloyd/&gt; [[Prince Littler]] took control of the theatre in 1944.&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt;

[[Stoll Moss Group]] purchased the theatre in 1975,&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo/&gt; selling it to [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s [[Really Useful Group]] and [[Bridgepoint Capital]] in 2000. [[Nica Burns]] and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased the theatre and several others in 2005,&lt;ref name="stand"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/the-history-of-the-london-apollo-9017564.html | title=The history of the London Apollo | publisher=[[London Evening Standard|London Standard]] | work=standard.co.uk | date=20 December 2013 | accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating [[Nimax Theatres]], which still owns the theatre.&lt;ref name=NimaxApollo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimaxtheatres.com/apollo-theatre/|title=Apollo Theatre|publisher=[[Nimax Theatres]]|accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013 ceiling collapse ===
On 19 December 2013, at about 20:15 GMT,&lt;ref name=BBC25458009&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25458009| title=Apollo Theatre balcony collapses| work=[[BBC News]]| date=19 December 2013| accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{convert|10|m2}} of the auditorium's ornate plasterwork ceiling collapsed around 40 minutes into a performance of ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (play)|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]''.&lt;ref name=BBC25459567&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25459567| title=Apollo Theatre: Ceiling collapse injures 76 people| work=[[BBC News]]| date=19 December 2013| accessdate=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sky&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.sky.com/story/1185016/apollo-theatre-collapse-causes-injuries| title=Apollo Theatre Collapse Causes Injuries| publisher=[[Sky News]]| work=news.sky.com| date=19 December 2013| accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brought down a lighting rig and a section of balcony, thereby trapping two people and injuring around 88, including seven seriously. There were 720 people in the audience at the time. The incident was preceded by heavy rain.&lt;ref name=BBC25458009/&gt;

The [[emergency services]] responded with 25 ambulance crews, an air ambulance rapid response team, 8 fire engines with more than 50 firefighters, and the [[Metropolitan Police]].&lt;ref name=BBC25459567/&gt; Casualties were taken to the [[foyer]]s of the adjacent [[Gielgud Theatre|Gielgud]] and [[Queen's Theatre|Queen's]] theatres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/12-2013/roof-collapses-at-west-ends-apollo-theatre-serious_33042.html?cid=homepage_news| title='Roof collapses' at West End's Apollo Theatre, serious injuries reported| publisher=Whats On Stage| work=whatsonstage.com| date=19 December 2013| accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the emergency services could [[triage]]. The [[London Ambulance Service]] later stated that they had treated 76 injured people, with 58 taken to four London hospitals, some on commandeered buses.&lt;ref name=BBC25459567/&gt; [[Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust]] said 34 adults and 5 children were subsequently treated in accident and emergency at [[St Thomas' Hospital]].&lt;ref name=BBC25459567/&gt;

The venue reopened on 26 March 2014, with an adaptation of [[Let the Right One In (novel)|''Let the Right One In'']] produced by the [[National Theatre of Scotland]]. The owners were able to reopen the theatre by sealing the fourth level and balcony with a temporary floor, which allowed investigators to continue their work in determining the cause of the collapse.&lt;ref name=reopen&gt;{{cite news| title=Apollo Theatre to reopen after ceiling collapse| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/10659795/Apollo-Theatre-to-reopen-after-ceiling-collapse.html| date=25 February 2014| work=The Telegraph| accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==

== History ==
=== Background ===
In 1207, the [[Shah-Armens]] was taken over by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]], who had long coveted Ahlat. The Ayyubids had come to the city at the invitation of people of Ahlat after the last Sökmenli ruler, [[Shah-Armens|Izzeddin Balaban]] ({{Circa}}1206–1207), who was killed by Tuğrulshah, ''[[emir]]'' of [[Erzurum]] on behalf of the [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultanate of Rûm]] and brother of Sultan [[Kayqubad I]]. 

Before Ayyubid control could be solidified, [[Al-Awhad Ayyub|al-Awhad]] faced revolts in [[Erciş|Artchesh]] and [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. As he attempted to quash those insurrections, Khlat joined the rebellion later in 1208. Upon the orders of [[Al-Adil I|al-Adid]], [[Al-Ashraf Musa, Emir of Damascus|al-Ashraf]] led an army of roughly 1,000 troops to support [[Al-Awhad Ayyub|al-Awhad]] and the Ayyubids managed to put down the revolt in Ahlat, resulting in a heavy loss of life.&lt;ref name="Humphreys129"&gt;Humphreys, 1977, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict ===
The neighbouring Muslim rulers and the Georgians met the advent of the Ayyubids with mixed feelings. By 1208, Kingdom of Georgia challenged Ayyubid rule in eastern Anatolia and led liberational war for south Armenia. Georgians advanced towards Artchesh and captured the town. In response Sultan al-Adil assembled and personally led large Muslim army that included the ''[[emir]]s'' of [[Homs]], [[Hama]] and [[Baalbek]] as well as contingents from other Ayyubid principalities to back al-Awhad and al-Ashraf.

In 1210 Georgian general [[Ivane Mkhargrdzeli]] reached the walls of Ahlat but unexpectedly became the victim of his own foolhardiness. During the siege, Ivane Mkhargrdzeli accidentally fell into the hands of the al-Awhad on the outskirts of Ahlat. He was taken prisoner and by way of ransom had to cede several castles, to liberate 5000 Muslim prisoners and to promise the hand of his daughter [[Tamta Mkhargrdzeli|Tamta]] to his captor.&lt;ref&gt;V. Minorsky, Studies in Caucasian history, Taylors Foreign Press, 1953. pg 90-93&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgians had to lift the siege and conclude peace with the Sultan, the latter demanded a thirty-year truce, it was this accident, so typical of al-Adil's luck, that ended the Georgian menace to Ayyubid Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, 1977 p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia refrained from hostilities against enemy with whom [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar the Great]] had signed a treaty, and the border or Christian-Muslim world was established.

al-Ahwad died in the same year and was succeeded by his brother al-Ashraf who assumed the title of "''Shah-Armen''" (Rulers of Ahlat). It was he who married Tamta.

The '''Brownsville affair''', or the '''Brownsville raid''', was an incident of racial injustice that occurred in 1906 in the southwestern United States due to resentment by white residents of [[Brownsville, Texas]], of the [[Buffalo Soldiers]], black soldiers in a segregated unit stationed at nearby [[Fort Brown]]. When a white bartender was killed and a white police officer wounded by gunshots one night, townspeople accused the members of the African-American [[25th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th Infantry Regiment]]. Although their commanders said the soldiers had been in the barracks all night, evidence was planted against the men.

As a result of a [[United States Army]] Inspector General's investigation, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] ordered the discharge without honor of 167 soldiers of the 25th Infantry Regiment, costing them pensions and preventing them from ever serving in federal civil service jobs. The case aroused national outrage in both black and white communities. After more investigation, several of the men were allowed to re-enlist.

Following publication of a history of the affair in the early 1970s, a renewed military investigation exonerated the discharged black troops. The government pardoned the men in 1972 and restored their records to show honorable discharges, but it did not provide retroactive compensation to them or their descendants. Only one man had survived to that time; Congress passed an act to provide him with a tax-free pension. The other soldiers who had been expelled all received posthumous honorable discharges.

== Background ==

Since arriving at Fort Brown on July 28, 1906, the black US soldiers had been required to follow the legal [[color line (racism)|''color line mandate'']] from white citizens of Brownsville, which included the state's racial segregation law dictating separate accommodation for black people and white people, and [[Jim Crow]] customs such as showing respect for white people, as well as respect for local laws.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt;

== August 12–13, 1906 ==

A reported attack on a white woman during the night of August 12 so incensed many townspeople that Maj. Charles W. Penrose, after consultation with Mayor Frederick Combe, declared an early curfew for soldiers the following day to avoid trouble.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt;

On the night of August 13, 1906, a white bartender was killed and a Hispanic police officer was wounded by gunshots in the town. Immediately the residents of Brownsville cast the blame on the black soldiers of the 25th Infantry at Fort Brown. But the all-white commanders at Fort Brown confirmed that all of the soldiers were in their barracks at the time of the shootings. Local whites, including Brownsville's mayor, still claimed that some of the black soldiers participated in the shooting.&lt;ref name="Wormser" /&gt;

== Evidence ==

Local townspeople of Brownsville began providing evidence of the 25th Infantry's part in the shooting by producing spent bullet cartridges from Army rifles which they said belonged to the 25th's men. Despite the contradictory evidence that demonstrated the spent shells were planted in order to frame men of the 25th Infantry in the shootings, investigators accepted the statements of the local whites and the Brownsville mayor.&lt;ref name="Wormser" /&gt;

== Outcome ==

When soldiers of the 25th Infantry were pressured to name who fired the shots, they insisted that they had no idea who had committed the crime.&lt;ref name="Wormser" /&gt; [[Captain Bill McDonald]] of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] investigated 12 enlisted men and tried to tie the case to them. The local county court did not return any indictments based on his investigation, but residents kept up complaints about the black soldiers of the 25th.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt;

At the recommendation of the Army's Inspector General, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] ordered 167 of the black troops to be dishonorably discharged because of their "[[Conspiracy of silence (expression)|conspiracy of silence]]". Although some accounts have claimed that six of the troops were [[Medal of Honor]] recipients, historian Frank N. Schubert showed that none were. Fourteen of the men were later reinstated into the army.&lt;ref&gt;Frank N. Schubert, "The 25th Infantry at Brownsville, Texas: Buffalo Soldiers, the “Brownsville Six,” and the Medal of Honor," ''Journal of Military History'', October 2011, pp. 1217-1224.&lt;/ref&gt; The dishonorable discharge prevented the 153 other men from ever working in a military or civil service capacity. Some of the black soldiers had been in the U.S. Army for more than 20 years, while others were extremely close to retirement with pensions, which they lost as a result.&lt;ref name="Wormser" /&gt;

The prominent African-American educator and activist, [[Booker T. Washington]], president of [[Tuskegee Institute]], got involved in the case. He asked President Roosevelt to reconsider his decision in the affair.&lt;ref name="Wormser" /&gt; Roosevelt dismissed Washington's plea and allowed his decision to stand.

== Congress steps in ==

Both blacks and many whites across the United States were outraged at Roosevelt's actions.&lt;ref name="Wormser" /&gt; The black community began to turn against him, although it had previously supported the Republican president (in addition to maintaining loyalty to the party of [[Abraham Lincoln]], black people approved of Roosevelt having invited Booker T. Washington to dinner at the White House and speaking out publicly against [[lynching]]). The administration withheld news of the dishonorable discharge of the soldiers until after the 1906 Congressional elections, so that the pro-Republican black vote would not be affected. The case became a [[political football]], with [[William Howard Taft]], positioning for the next candidacy for presidency, trying to avoid trouble.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt;

Leaders of major black organizations, such as the Constitution League, the [[National Association of Colored Women]], and the [[Niagara Movement]], tried to persuade the administration not to discharge the soldiers, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Rucker" /&gt; From 1907–1908, the US Senate Military Affairs Committee investigated the Brownsville Affair, and the majority in March 1908 reached the same conclusion as Roosevelt. Senator [[Joseph B. Foraker]] of Ohio had lobbied for the investigation and filed a minority report in support of the soldiers' innocence. Another minority report by four Republicans concluded that the evidence was too inconclusive to support the discharges.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt; In September 1908, prominent educator and leader [[W. E. B. DuBois]] urged black people to register to vote and to remember their treatment by the Republican administration when it was time to vote for president.&lt;ref name="Rucker" /&gt;

Feelings across the nation remained high against the government actions, but with Taft succeeding Roosevelt as President, and Foraker failing to win re-election, some of the political pressure declined.

On February 23, 1909, the Committee on Military Affairs recommended favorably on Bill S.5729 for correction of records and reenlistment of officers and men of Companies B, C, and D of the 25th Infantry &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HxEpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=1910+25th+Infantry+to+reenlist&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3SXzUJHbNOiN0QGN04D4Aw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=2248&amp;f=false Congressional serial set, By United States. Government Printing Office 1909 Report #2248]&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Foraker was not re-elected. He continued to work on the Brownsville affair during his remaining time in office, guiding a resolution through Congress to establish a board of inquiry with the power to reinstate the soldiers.  The bill, which the administration did not oppose, was less than Foraker wanted. He had hoped for a requirement that unless specific evidence was shown against a man, he would be allowed to re-enlist. The legislation passed both houses{{sfn|Weaver|pp=147–150}}, and was signed by Roosevelt on March 2, 1909.{{sfn|Walters|p=246}}

On March 6, 1909, shortly after he left the Senate, Foraker was the guest of honor at a mass meeting at Washington's [[Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church]].  Though both whites and African Americans assembled to recognize the former senator, all the speakers but Foraker were African American.  Presented with a silver loving cup, he addressed the crowd,
{{quote |
I have said that I do not believe that a man in that battalion had anything to do with the shooting up of "Brownsville," but whether any one of them had, it was our duty to ourselves as a great, strong, and powerful nation to give every man a hearing, to deal fairly and squarely with every man; to see to it that justice was done to him; that he should be heard.{{sfn|Joseph Foraker, vol. 2|pp=320–321, 326}}
}}

On April 7, 1909, under the provisions of the Act of March 30, 1909, a Military Court of Inquiry was set up by Secretary of War [[Jacob M. Dickinson]] to report on the charges and recommend for reenlistment those men who had been discharged under Special Order # 266, November 9, 1906. Of the 167 discharged men, 76 were located as witnesses, and 6 did not wish to appear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ujJPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Roosevelt+1909+military+Court+of+Inquiry&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pSzzUILqFZG10QGk9ICgCQ&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Roosevelt%201909%20military%20Court%20of%20Inquiry&amp;f=false Annual reports / United States. War Dept, Volume 1, 1909, p. 57-68]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1910 Court of Military Inquiry undertook an examination of the soldiers' bids for re-enlistment, in view of the Senate committee's reports, but its members interviewed only about one-half of the soldiers discharged. It accepted 14 for re-enlistment, and eleven of these re-entered the Army.&lt;ref name="Rucker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Congressional serial set, Issue 5943 1911 Senate Document #833. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w5c3AQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=reenlistment%20of%2025th%20Infantrymen%201911&amp;pg=RA4-PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp.67–68.] (Includes a list of those who re-enlisted.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The government did not re-examine the case until the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt;

== Justice in 1970s ==

In 1970, historian [[John D. Weaver]] published ''[[The Brownsville Raid]],'' which investigated the affair in depth. Weaver argued that the accused members of the 25th Infantry were innocent and that they were discharged without benefit of [[due process]] of law as guaranteed by the [[United States Constitution]]. After reading his book, Congressman [[Augustus F. Hawkins]] of Los Angeles introduced a bill to have the Defense Department re-investigate the matter to provide justice to the accused soldiers.

In 1972, the Army found the accused members of the 25th Infantry to be innocent. At its recommendations, President [[Richard Nixon]] pardoned the men and awarded them honorable discharges, without backpay. These discharges were generally issued posthumously, as there were only two surviving soldiers from the affair: one had re-enlisted in 1910. In 1973, Hawkins and Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] gained congressional passage of a tax-free pension for the last survivor, Dorsie Willis, who received $25,000. He was honored in ceremonies in Washington, DC, and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Weaver 1992" /&gt;

The '''''Chesapeake''–''Leopard'' affair''' was a naval engagement that occurred off the coast of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on June 22, 1807, between the British warship {{HMS|Leopard|1790|6}} and the American [[frigate]] {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|6}}.  The crew of ''Leopard'' pursued, attacked, and boarded the American frigate, looking for deserters from the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name=mackenzie145&gt;{{cite book |title=Life of Stephen Decatur: a commodore in the Navy of the United States |last= Mackenzie |first=Alexander Slidell|authorlink=Alexander Slidell Mackenzie |publisher=C. C. Little and J. Brown |year=1846 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chesapeake'' was caught unprepared and after a short battle involving broadsides received from ''Leopard'', the commander of ''Chesapeake'', [[James Barron]], surrendered his vessel to the British. ''Chesapeake'' had fired only one shot.

Four crew members were removed from the American vessel and were tried for desertion, one of whom was subsequently hanged. ''Chesapeake'' was allowed to return home, where James Barron was [[court martial]]ed and relieved of command.

The ''Chesapeake–Leopard Affair'' created an uproar among Americans. There were strident calls for war with Great Britain, but these quickly subsided. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] initially attempted to use this widespread bellicosity to diplomatically threaten the British government into settling the matter. The United States Congress backed away from armed conflict when British envoys showed no contrition for the ''Chesapeake'' affair, delivering proclamations reaffirming [[impressment]]. Jefferson's political failure to coerce Great Britain led him toward economic warfare: the [[Embargo of 1807]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Perkins, Bradford |origyear=1968 |title=Embargo: Alternative to War, Chapter 8: Prologue to War: England and the United States, 1805–1812 |work=first published by University of California Press |edition=Essays on the Early Republic 1789–1815 |editor=Livy, Leonard |publisher=Dryden Press |year=1974 |pages=317–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:USSChesapeake.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Chesapeake|1799|6}}, depicted in a {{circa|lk=no|1900}} painting by F. Muller]]
In the spring of 1807, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], several British naval vessels were on duty on the [[North American Station]], blockading two French third-rate warships in the [[Chesapeake Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=James Fenimore |title=History of the navy of the United States of America |year=1826 |publisher=Stringer &amp; Townsend, New York |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Royal Navy]] seamen had deserted from their ships and local American authorities gave them sanctuary. One of the deserters, a Londoner named Jenkin Ratford, joined the crew of {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|6}}. Ratford had made himself conspicuous to British officers by shouting at them on the streets of [[Norfolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Perkins315&gt;{{cite book |author=Perkins, Bradford |origyear=1968  |title=Embargo: Alternative to War, Chapter 8: Prologue to War: England and the United States, 1805–1812 |work=first published by University of California Press |edition=Essays on the Early Republic 1789–1815 |editor=Levy, Leonard |publisher=Dryden Press |year=1974 |page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other deserters were reported to be at the [[Gosport Navy Yard]], then commanded by [[Stephen Decatur]]. Decatur received a letter from the British consul ordering him to turn over three men alleged to have deserted from {{HMS|Melampus|1785|6}}. The consul claimed the men had enlisted in the U.S. Navy, which was recruiting a crew for ''Chesapeake'', then at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] outfitting for a voyage to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=mackenzie145/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=James Fenimore |title=History of the navy of the United States of America |year=1826 |publisher=Stringer &amp; Townsend, New York |page=224 |oclc=197401914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice-Admiral [[George Cranfield Berkeley|Sir George Berkeley]] dispatched his flagship, the [[fourth-rate]] warship {{HMS|Leopard|1790|6}}, with written orders authorizing him to board and search  the United States warship to recover any deserters.&lt;ref name=Perkins315/&gt; Berkeley ordered ''Leopard''{{'}}s captain to search for deserters from {{HMS|Belleisle|1795|6}}, {{HMS|Bellona|1760|6}}, {{HMS|Triumph|1764|6}}, {{HMS|Chichester|1753|6}}, {{HMS|Halifax|1806|6}}, and the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Zenobia|1806|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=William |authorlink=William James (naval historian) |year=1824 |title=The Naval History of Great Britain, from the Declaration of War by France in 1793, to the Accession of George IV |volume=4 |publisher=Baldwin, Chadock and Joy |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0PAQAAMAAJ&amp;vq=decatur&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack and search==
[[File:Story of one hundred years - A comprehensive review of the political and military events, the social, intellectual and material progress, and the general state of mankind in all lands. Embodying (14595946297).jpg|thumb|Officers of Chesapeake  offering their swords to officers of the Leopard, depicted {{circa|lk=no|1900}}]]
''Chesapeake'' was off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, commanded by Commodore [[James Barron]], when ''Leopard'', under  Captain [[Salusbury Pryce Humphreys]], encountered and hailed her. Barron was not alarmed, and received Lieutenant John Meade on board, who presented Barron with the search warrant. After an inconclusive discussion, Meade returned to ''Leopard''. Captain Humphreys, using a hailing trumpet, ordered the American ship to submit. When ''Chesapeake'' did not, Humphreys fired a round across her [[Bow (ship)|bow]]. This was followed immediately by ''Leopard'' firing [[broadside]]s into the American ship.&lt;ref name=Perkinsp316&gt;{{cite book |author=Perkins, Bradford |origyear=1968  |title=Embargo: Alternative to War, Chapter 8: Prologue to War: England and the United States, 1805–1812 |work=first published by University of California Press |edition=Essays on the Early Republic 1789–1815 |editor=Levy, Leonard |publisher=Dryden Press |year=1974 |page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her guns unloaded and her decks cluttered with stores in preparation for a long cruise, ''Chesapeake'' managed to fire only a single gun in reply. The humiliated Barron [[Striking the colors|struck his colors]] and surrendered. Three of ''Chesapeake''{{'}}s crew had been killed and 18 wounded, including Barron, by the attack. However, Humphreys refused the surrender and sent a boarding party to ''Chesapeake'' to search for deserters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Guttridge, Leonard F |title=Stephen Decatur American Naval Hero, 1779–1820 |year=2006 |publisher=Tom Doherty Associates, LLC, |location=New York, NY  |pages=96–98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scores of British nationals had signed on as crewmen of ''Chesapeake'',&lt;ref name=Perkinsp316/&gt; but Humphreys seized only the four Royal Navy deserters: Daniel Martin, John Strachan and William Ware, all from HMS ''Melampus'', and Jenkin Ratford, formerly on {{HMS|Halifax|1806|6}}. Only Ratford was British-born. The others were American citizens — two of them demonstrably non-British because they were [[African-Americans]], but they had been serving on British warships.&lt;ref name=Perkinsp316/&gt;

The [[brig]] {{HMS|Columbine|1806|2}} brought the first dispatches to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] in early July. ''Leopard'' followed with her prisoners for trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=William |authorlink=William James (naval historian) |year=1824 |title=The Naval History of Great Britain, from the Declaration of War by France in 1793, to the Accession of George IV |volume=4 |publisher=Baldwin, Chadock and Joy |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0PAQAAMAAJ&amp;vq=decatur&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkin Ratford, the sole British citizen, was sentenced to death and was hanged from the [[yardarm]] of ''Halifax'' on August 31, 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McMaster |first=John Bach |ref=McMaster |title=A History of the People of the United States: 1803–1812 |page=259 |publisher=D.

The bloody encounter caused a storm of protest from the United States government, and the British government eventually offered to return the three American citizens and to pay reparations for the damage to ''Chesapeake''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickon |first=Chris |ref=Thomson |title=The enduring journey of the USS Chesapeake: ... |publisher=The Hickory Press, Charleston, SC |year=2008 |page=54 |isbn=978-1-59629-298-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCGjg46NS_kC&amp;vq=decatur&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[schooner]] {{HMS|Bream|1807|6}} returned the last two British deserters to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], one month after the outbreak of the War of 1812.

==Aftermath==
{{Warof1812-Origins}}
The incident outraged the American sense of honor.&lt;ref&gt;Norman K. Risjord, "1812: Conservatives, War Hawks and the Nation's Honor". ''William and Mary Quarterly: A Magazine of Early American History'' (1961): 196–210. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918543 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honor, and to reject  the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Ivie, "The metaphor of force in prowar discourse: The case of 1812". ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 68#3 (1982) pp. 240–253.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Thomas Jefferson]] noted: "Never since the [[Battle of Lexington]] have I seen this country in such a state of exasperation as at present, and even that did not produce such unanimity."&lt;ref name="Jefferson1900"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Foley, John P. |title=The Jeffersonian Cyclopedia: A Comprehensive Collection of the Views of Thomas Jefferson Classified and Arranged in Alphabetical Order Under Nine Thousand Titles Relating to Government, Politics, Law, Education, Political Economy, Finance, Science, Art, Literature, Religious Freedom, Morals, Etc |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTIoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA137 |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |year=1900 |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Monroe]], then a foreign minister acting under instructions from U.S. Secretary of State James Madison, demanded British disavowal of the deed, the restoration of the four seamen, the recall of Admiral Berkeley, the exclusion of British warships from U.S. territorial waters, and the abolition of [[impressment]]s from vessels under the United States flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toll |first=Ian W |title=Six Frigates: The Epic of the Founding of the U.S. Navy |isbn=978-0-393-05847-5 |oclc=70291925 |location=New York |publisher=W. W. Norton |year=2006 |pages=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event raised tensions between the two countries and, while possibly not a direct cause, was one of the events leading up to the [[War of 1812]]. In fact, many Americans demanded war because of the attack, but President Jefferson turned to diplomacy and economic pressure in the form of the ill-fated [[Embargo Act of 1807]].

The Federal government began to be concerned about the lack of war material. Their concerns led to the establishment of a tariff protecting the manufacturers of gunpowder, which helped ensure the fortunes of the [[DuPont]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fagal, Andrew |year=2012 |title=Foreign Capital, American Armament, and the Rise of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. |work=Unpublished paper, SUNY-Binghamton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- UNPUBLISHED? --&gt;{{better source needed|date=October 2018}}

The humiliating incident had significant repercussions for the U.S. Navy. The public was shocked that ''Chesapeake'' had not been able to put up any resistance and surrendered so quickly, questioning the ability of the Navy to defend the country from a possible British invasion, despite the expensive and controversial [[Original six frigates of the United States Navy|frigate-building program]]. A [[court-martial]] blamed Barron and suspended him from service for five years as punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=James Fenimore |title=History of the navy of the United States of America |ref=Cooper |year=1826 |publisher=Stringer &amp; Townsend, New York |page=231 |oclc=197401914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, Commodore Barron challenged and mortally wounded Commodore [[Stephen Decatur]] in a [[duel]] over remarks Decatur had made about Barron's conduct in 1807 (Barron was also wounded). Decatur had served on the court-martial that found Barron guilty of being unprepared and barred him from command for five years.

''Chesapeake'' herself proved unlucky during the War of 1812, when on June 1, 1813, after a long and surprising series of naval victories over the Royal Navy, the British frigate {{HMS|Shannon|1806|6}} captured ''Chesapeake'' in a ship-to-ship action near Boston. The Royal Navy commissioned ''Chesapeake'', but put her up for sale at Portsmouth in July 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17494|page=1228|date=July 13, 1819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her timbers are now part of the [[Chesapeake Mill]] in [[Wickham, Hampshire|Wickham]], England.

==In fiction==
The fallout from the ''Chesapeake–Leopard'' affair features prominently in two novels of the [[Aubrey–Maturin series]] by [[Patrick O'Brian]]. It is first mentioned in the fifth novel, ''[[Desolation Island (novel)|Desolation Island]]'', when the fictional Captain [[Jack Aubrey]] is given command of ''Leopard'' (which he privately refers to as the "horrible old ''Leopard''") a few years after the incident. Though the United States and Great Britain are at peace at the time and neither he nor any member of his crew had anything to do with the earlier affair, he is met with mistrust and hostility from American naval personnel due to the negative association of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=A. G. |date= 2006 |title=The Patrick O'Brian Muster Book: Persons, Animals, Ships and Cannon in the Aubrey-Maturin Sea Novels|edition=2nd |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson NC and London |isbn=0-7864-2482-6 |page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[Capture of USS Chesapeake|capture of ''Chesapeake'']] during the War of 1812 features prominently in the sixth Aubrey–Maturin novel, ''[[The Fortune of War]],'' as Aubrey is aboard {{HMS|Shannon|1806|6}} during the famous engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/11/the-american-navy-was-the-staple-diet-of-conversation-patrick-obrians-the-fortune-of-war |title=The American navy was the staple diet of conversation: Patrick O'Brian's The Fortune of War |author=Jo Walton |date=November 8, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Concert for Freedom''' was a concert held at [[Camp Nou]] football stadium in [[Barcelona]] on June 29, 2013, organized by [[Òmnium Cultural]] in conjunction with other civil society organization such as the [[Assemblea Nacional Catalana]] and the [[Plataforma Pro Seleccions Esportives Catalanes]] with the goal using the universal language of music to demand the right of [[Catalonia]] and other nations of the world to freely and democratically decide their future. Some 90,000 people were in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4130445/20130629/lindependentisme-esclata-camp.html |accessdate=30 June 2013|title=L'independentisme esclata al Camp Nou (An Explosion of Pro-independence Sentiments at Camp Nou)|work=VilaWeb|date=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the [[2012 Catalan independence demonstration]] and the [[Catalan Way]], the concert was another social mobilization event in favor of [[Catalonia independence|independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colomer|first=Marc|title=El Barça cedeix el Camp Nou el 29 de juny per al concert amb Llach per l'estat propi (Barça Vacates Camp Nou on June 29 for a Concert Featuring Llach to Benefit Independence Movement)|work=Ara|date=April 24, 2013|url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/Camp_Nou-estat_propi-independencia-29_juny-Lluis_Llach-Lluis_Danes-Gerard_Quintana_0_907109517.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 400 artists performed, among them [[Lluís Llach]], [[Sopa de Cabra]], Miquel Gil, [[Pastora]], Joana Serrat, Jofre Bardagí, Jordi Batiste, Lídia Pujol, [[Maria del Mar Bonet]], [[Marina Rossell]], Mercedes Peón, Nena Venetsanou, [[Orfeó Català]], [[Paco Ibáñez]], [[Pascal Comelade]],  [[Pau Alabajos]], [[Pep Sala]], [[Peret]], Projecte Mut, Sabor de Gràcia, Ferran Piqué, Joan Enric Barceló &amp; Eduard Costa from [[Els Amics de les Arts]], and [[Brams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4120235/20130530/omnium-lanc-presenten-detalls-concert-independencia-camp.html|accessdate=May 30, 2013|title=Lluís Llach, Sopa de Cabra, Miquel Gil i Pastora entre més al concert per la independencia (Lluís Llach, Sopa de Cabra, Miquel Gil and Pastora among others at the concert for independence)|work=VilaWeb|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic directors were [[Gerard Quintana]] and Lluís Danés, who was in charge of [[set design]].

== Background==
Concert tickets went on sale on Monday, June 3, and almost all (60,000) were sold the same day, with online wait times to purchase tickets that exceeded six hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20130604/54375339627/concert-per-la-llibertat-vende-60-000-entradas.html|accessdate=July 3, 2013|title= El Concert per la Llibertat vende 60.000 entradas (El Concierto por la Libertad vende 60.000 entradas)|work= la Vanguardia|date=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused the organization to initially freeze ticket sales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2013/06/04/catalunya/1370340897_903057.html|accessdate=3 July 2013|title=Paralizada la venta de entradas del Concert per la Llibertat (Paralizada la venta de entradas del Concierto por la Libertad)|author=el País |date= June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and then release 30,000 tickets for sale on the 17th, though these were for seats at the south goal post of the stadium, behind the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/concert-per-llibertat-entradas-omnium-anc-2416797 |accessdate=3 July 2013|title=A la venta 30.000 nuevas entradas para el 'Concert per la Llibertat' (30,000 New Tickets on Sale for "Concert for Freedom")|work=el Periódico |date=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the singer [[Dyango]] announced his participation in the Concert for Freedom, some Spaniards were outraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=13TV, sorpresa i preocupada perquè Dyango hagi passat de cantar 'Suspiros de España' a donar suport al "separatisme català" (13TV, Surprised and Worried because Dyango Has Gone from Singing "Suspiros de España" to Supporting Catalan Separatism)|work=Ara|url=http://www.ara.cat/media/dyango-concert-llibertat_0_932307050.html|date=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyango was not intimidated by the attitudes of the hosts on [[13 TV]], an ecclesiastic television channel that is one of the stalwarts of Spanish nationalism, in the face of his support for [[separatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dyango no es deixa intimidar per l'actitud agressiva dels tertulians de 13tv contra el seu independentisme (Dyango not Intimidated by Aggressive Attitude of13tv Hosts against his Support for Separatism)|work=Vilaweb|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4122253/20130605/dyango-escandalitza-tertulians-independentisme-entrevista-13tv.html|date=June 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He affirmed that the current goal is to hold a Catalan referendum, and ultimately achieve full separation from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dyango escandalitza 13tv (Dyango scandalizes 13tv)|work=Regió7|url=http://www.regio7.cat/televisio/2013/06/06/dyango-escandalitza-13tv/235218.html|date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dyango: "We can't go back now; it would hurt the movement"|work= El Punt Avui|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/noticia/article/3-politica/17-politica/655402-no-es-pot-fer-marxa-enrere-ens-fariem-mal.html|date=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peret]] also denounced pressure and threats he has received for participating in the concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.elsingulardigital.cat/cat/notices/2013/06/dyango_i_peret_denuncien_les_amenaces_de_la_caverna_94892.php |accessdate=July 1, 2013|title= Dyango and Peret Denounce Threats from the Establishment |work=VilaWeb|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer-songwriter from the Canary Islands, [[Pedro Guerra]], cancelled his participation in the concert alleging that the event had veered toward "purely separatist motivations that he doesn't share" and that "this is not his fight," while affirming that he was not pressured into withdrawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Pedro Guerra es retira del Concert per la Llibertat perquè "aquesta lluita no és la meva (Pedro Guerra Withdraws from the Concert for Freedom because "This Is not my Fight") |work=diari Ara|url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/guerra-concert-llibertat_0_946105691.html|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Mayte Martín]] also withdrew at the last minute for similar motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.elsingulardigital.cat/cat/notices/2013/06/mayte_martin_i_pedro_guerra_no_seran_al_concert_per_la_llibertat_per_pressions_espanyoles_94875.php |accessdate=June 27, 2013|title= Mayte Martín i Pedro Guerra no seran al Concert per la Llibertat per pressions españoles (Mayte Martín and Pedro Guerra will not attend the Concert for Freedom due to pressure from Spaniards)

== Program ==
[[File:Cau la nit al Concert per la Llibertat.jpg|thumb|left|325px| Partial view of [[Camp Nou]] during the concert.]]
Before the concert an information fair was set up outside [[Camp Nou]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4127676/20130621/concert-llibertat-incloura-fira-dentitats.html|title=El Concert per la Llibertat inclourà una fira d'entitats (Concert for Freedom Will Include an Information Fair)|author=VilaWeb|date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the local [[Food Bank]] established collection points to benefit the needy, collecting a total of 25 tons of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El Concert per la Llibertat recapta 25 tones d'aliments (Concert for Freedom Collects 25 Tons of Food))|work=Ara|date=June 30, 2013|url=http://www.ara.cat/politica/Concert_per_la_Llibertat-recapte_aliments_0_947305454.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was divided in two halves. In the first half, various artists interpreted songs related to [[Liberty|freedom]] and popular Catalan tunes such as "L'emigrant" (The Emigrant) sung by [[Peret]]; "Què volen aquesta gent?" (What do these people want?) sung by [[María del Mar Bonet]] and [[Companyia Elèctrica Dharma]], and "Camins" (Paths) sung by Sopa de Cabra.&lt;ref name="324cat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.324.cat/noticia/2143007/ociicultura/Tossudament-alcats-de-Llach-tancara-el-Concert-per-la-Llibertat-al-Camp-Nou-que-aplegara-mes-de-400-artistes|accessdate=1 July 2013|title="Tossudament alçats", de Llach, tancarà el Concert per la Llibertat al Camp Nou, que aplegarà més de 400 artistes ("Tossudament alçats", by Llach, will close the Concert for Freedom at Camp Nou Bringing Together More than 400 Artists)|author=324.cat|date=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second half featured songs by [[Lluís Llach]] sung both by the artist himself and other artists such as Orfeó Català, [[Perros]], Ramoncín, [[Pastora]] and Miquel Gil, in homage to Llach's concert at Camp Nou in 1985, remembered as a protest in supports of the rights of the Catalan nation.&lt;ref name="324cat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colomer|first=M.|last2=González|first2=S.|title=Un Camp Nou per l'estat propi per impulsar el procés (Camp Nou gathering in support of the process toward self-rule )|work=Ara|date=20 April 2013|url=http://www.ara.cat/premium/politica/Camp-Nou-lestat-impulsar-proces_0_904709623.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At halftime, the [[Castellers de Vilafranca]] orchestrated a 9 level high human tower called a ''3 de 9 amb folre'' and they played the Catalan national anthem "[[Els segadors]]," while forming a giant mosaic reading "Freedom Catalonia 2014." &lt;ref name="324cat"/&gt;

"'''Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)'''" is a [[protest song]] with [[lyrics]] by [[Woody Guthrie]] and music by Martin Hoffman detailing the [[1948 Los Gatos DC-3 crash|January 28, 1948 crash]] of a plane near Los Gatos Canyon,&lt;ref name="klein"&gt;{{cite book |author=Klein, Joe. |year=1999 |title=Woody Guthrie: A Life |publisher=Delta |isbn=0-385-33385-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|20|mi}} west of [[Coalinga]] in [[Fresno County, California]], United States.&lt;ref name="indybay"&gt;{{cite web |title=60th anniversary of "Plane Wreck at Los Gatos (Deportee)" |publisher=[[Indybay]] |url=https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/01/30/18475895.php |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DC3"&gt;{{cite web |title=DC3 Aircraft Crash Site in Los Gatos Canyon |publisher=Three Rocks Research |url=http://www.picacho.org/interest/dc3-site.html |accessdate=2009-10-16 |archivedate=2014-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320011329/http://www.picacho.org/interest/dc3-site.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crash occurred in [[Los Gatos Creek (Fresno County, California)|Los Gatos Canyon]] and not in the town of [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]] itself, which is in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]], approximately 150 miles away.  Guthrie was inspired to write the song by what he considered the racist mistreatment of the passengers before and after the accident.&lt;ref name="klein"/&gt;  The crash resulted in the deaths of 32 people, 4 Americans and 28 [[Migrant worker|migrant farm workers]] who were being deported from California back to [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="DC3"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Woody Guthrie 2.jpg|right|thumb|Woody Guthrie.]]
The genesis of "Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)" reportedly occurred when Guthrie was struck by the fact that radio and newspaper coverage of the Los Gatos plane crash did not give the victims' names, but instead referred to them merely as "deportees."&lt;ref name="indybay"/&gt;  Guthrie lived in New York City at the time,&lt;ref name="death2"/&gt; and none of the deportees' names were printed in the January 29, 1948, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' report, only those of the flight crew and the security guard.&lt;ref name="DC3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Los Gatos Canyon Plane Crash, Fresno County, California|publisher=Eastern Mojave Vegetation|url=http://www.schweich.com/geoCAFreLosGatosCynCrash.html|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the local newspaper, ''[[The Fresno Bee]]'', covered the tragedy extensively and listed all of the known names of the deportees.&lt;ref name="death2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kulczyk|first=David|title=Death in California – The Bizarre, Freakish, and Just Curious Ways People Die in the Golden State|year=2009|publisher=Craven Street Books|location=Fresno, CA|isbn=978-1-884995-57-6|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unaware of the extensive local coverage of the disaster,&lt;ref name="death2"/&gt; Guthrie responded with a poem, which, when it was first written, featured only rudimentary musical accompaniment, with Guthrie chanting the song rather than singing it.&lt;ref name="klein"/&gt; In the poem, Guthrie assigned symbolic names to the dead: "Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita; adiós, mis amigos, Jesús y María..."&lt;ref name="lyrics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deeportee (Plane Wreck at Los gatos) lyrics|publisher=The Official Woody Guthrie Website|url=http://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/Deportee.htm|accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A decade later, Guthrie's poem was set to music and given a haunting melody by a schoolteacher named Martin Hoffman.&lt;ref name="indybay"/&gt;  Shortly after, [[folk singer]] [[Pete Seeger]], a friend of Woody Guthrie, began performing the song at concerts, and it was Seeger's rendition that popularized the song during this time.&lt;ref name="indybay"/&gt;

It has been suggested by the Three Rocks Research website that, in fact, "Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)" betrays Guthrie's lack of understanding regarding the [[Bracero Program]].&lt;ref name="DC3"/&gt; The program was a series of laws and diplomatic agreements created by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in 1942, that permitted Mexican farm laborers (or Braceros) to work in the United States due to the severe labor shortages caused by World War II.  Under the terms of the program, the labor contractors were expected to provide transportation to and from the Mexican border, with the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|U.S. Immigration Service]] being required to repatriate the Mexican citizens if the contractor defaulted.&lt;ref name="DC3"/&gt;  As such, the "deportation" of Braceros in this fashion was simply a way of meeting the obligations of the program—although some newspapers, e.g., the New York Times, did refer to the braceros as "deportees".&lt;ref name="DC3"/&gt;  However, the presence in the song of the lines, "Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted/Our work contract's out and we have to move on." suggests that Guthrie did in fact understand the workings of the Bracero Program. Furthermore, it could be argued that Guthrie's song is less about the program itself and more a comment on the attitude of American society and the media towards the Mexican farm laborers.

In addition to being a [[lament]] for the braceros killed in the crash, the opening lines of "Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)":

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;The crops are all in and the peaches are rott'ning,
The oranges piled in their [[creosote]] dumps."&lt;ref name="lyrics"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

are another protest by Guthrie.  At the time, government policies paid farmers to destroy their crops in order to keep farm production and prices high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mark Hammond: Chapel Talk |publisher=The Irene DuPont Library |url=http://library.standrews-de.org/lists/ChapelTalks/CTFaculty/HammondCT-01-7-2004.pdf |accessdate=2009-10-16}} {{Dead link |date=October 2010 |bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guthrie felt that it was wrong to render food inedible by poisoning it in a world where hungry people lived.

"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)" has been described by journalist [[Joe Klein]] as "the last great song he [Guthrie] would write, a memorial to the nameless migrants 'all scattered like dry leaves' in Los Gatos Canyon."&lt;ref name="klein"/&gt;  The song has been recorded many times, often under a variety of other titles, including "Deportees", "Ballad of the Deportees", "Deportee Song", "Plane Crash at Los Gatos" and "Plane Wreck at Los Gatos (Deportee)".

In July 2010, [[Terry Jones (pastor)|Terry Jones]], the pastor of the Christian [[Dove World Outreach Center]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], U.S., announced he would burn 200 Qurans on the 2010 anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]]. He gained media coverage, resulting in international outrage over his plans and pleas from world leaders to cancel the event. Jones's threat sparked protests in the Middle East and Asia, in which at least 20 people were killed. In early September 2010, Jones cancelled and pledged never to burn a Quran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39113743/ns/us_news-security/ Pastor Terry Jones: 'We will not burn the Quran' - US news - Security - msnbc.com].

Jones received an [[honorary degree]] from an [[unaccredited]] theology school in 1983, and began using the title "Doctor."

Following an invitation from the [[English Defence League]], Jones considered attending a rally in [[Luton]] in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] in February 2011 to share his views.

==2010 threat to burn a Quran==
In 2010 Jones announced plans to burn the [[Quran]] on the ninth anniversary of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], which he dubbed "International Burn a Quran Day". A wide range of politicians and religious groups strongly condemned the planned [[Quran desecration]] event. Jones said he canceled the event and intended to go to New York to meet with the [[imam]] of [[Park51]], [[Feisal Abdul Rauf]].&lt;ref name="yahoocancel"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100909/ap_on_re_us/quran_burning |title=Pastor nixes Quran-burning, claims NYC mosque deal |last=Gonzalez |first=Antonio |date=September 9, 2010 |work=[[Yahoo!]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=September 10, 2010 |location=Gainesville, Fla.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After saying he would never burn the scriptures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/09/11/new.york.jones/index.html?hpt=T1#fbid=IcyXM-ln_iY&amp;wom=false|title=Florida pastor calls off Quran burning |date=September 11, 2010 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on March 20, 2011, Jones oversaw the burning of a Quran.

===Background===
[[Dove World Outreach Center]], where the Quran burning was to occur, is a small congregation in Gainesville, with approximately 50 members. The church, led by pastor Terry Jones and his wife, Sylvia, first gained media attention in the late 2000s (decade) for its [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] and [[Homophobia|anti-homosexual]] messages. In 2009, Dove World posted a sign on its lawn which stated in large red letters "Islam is of the Devil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090708/ARTICLES/907081008 |title=Anti-Islam church sign stirs up community outrage |author1=Lise Fisher |author2=Karen Voyles |publisher=Gainesville.com |date = July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the church also sent their children to their first day of school in August 2009 wearing t-shirts with "Islam is of the Devil" printed on the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090826/ARTICLES/908261007 |title='Devil' shirts send kids home |author=Christopher Curry |publisher=Gainesville.com |date=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal to burn Qurans began with a series of Twitter messages on July 12,&lt;ref name=WPO910&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/10/AR2010091007428.html |title=Pastor Terry Jones's Quran-burning threat started with a tweet |author1=Ann Gerhart |author2=Ernesto Londoño |publisher=Washington Post |date=September 10, 2010 |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a related discussion on the now-removed [[Facebook]] group "Islam is of the Devil", named after Terry Jones's book. Jones invited Christians to burn the Muslim holy book to remember all 9/11 victims. It was to be held from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-29/us/florida.burn.quran.day_1_american-muslims-religion-cair-spokesman-ibrahim-hooper?_s=PM |title=Church plans Quran-burning event |date=July 30, 2010 |author=Lauren Russell |publisher=US CNN News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716131328/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-29/us/florida.burn.quran.day_1_quran-burning-florida-church-terry-jones-american-muslims-religion?_s=PM:US |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |accessdate=September 20, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea initially had little support and considerable opposition, but [[Religion News Service]] ran a story describing Jones's claim that he had received Qurans to burn. [[Council on American-Islamic Relations|CAIR]] refused to respond, but other religious organizations did. On July 25 Jones posted a YouTube video in which he held up a Quran and said "This is the book that is responsible for 9/11. No, to me it looks like the religion of the devil" which garnered substantial media attention. On August 3, Gainesville mayor [[Craig Lowe]] asked the world's media to ignore Jones's church as a "tiny fringe group and an embarrassment to our community", but coverage continued to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/how-the-media-ignited-koran-burning-story-20100911-155yf.html |title=How the media ignited Quran burning story |date=September 12, 2010 |publisher=The Age (from Guardian?) |location=Melbourne |first=Matthew |last=Weaver}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early August, [[Sunni]] scholars at [[al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]] issued a statement warning of "dangerous consequences" if Qurans were burned.&lt;ref name=WPO910 /&gt; U.S. President Obama condemned the plan saying it would endanger the lives of U.S. troops abroad.&lt;ref name=WPO910 /&gt; American Muslims responded by saying they would celebrate September 11, 2010 as 'love Jesus day' emphasizing the fact that Jesus is believed to be a messenger of God in Islam. Other groups asked people to celebrate Read the Quran day as a means to international understanding.

John Rankin, President of the Theological Education Institute in Connecticut, has started a "Yes to the Bible, No to the Burning of the Quran" effort.

Feisal Abdul Rauf, the cleric behind the move to build a Muslim community centre near "Ground Zero" ([[Park51]]) said that, should the burning of Qurans have gone ahead,

&lt;/blockquote&gt;it would have created a disaster in the Muslim world. It would have strengthened the radicals. It would have enhanced the possibility of terrorist acts against America and American interests.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also added that retracting the decision to build the mosque would send a wrong message that "moving it is that the headline in the Muslim world will be Islam is under attack in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=153744&amp;language=en |publisher=Al-Manar TV |title=NY Imam: Quran Burning would Have Been A Disaster |date=September 12, 2010 |accessdate=September 13, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commander of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] in [[Afghanistan]], General [[David Petraeus]] said, "It is precisely the kind of action the Taliban uses and could cause significant problems.

On the same day hundreds of Afghans protested in [[Kabul]] against the planned Quran burning event, chanting "[[death to America]]" and throwing rocks at a passing military convoy. Military officials also expressed fears that the protests would spread to other cities. Military officers at [[the Pentagon]] consequently said they hoped the rare incursion into politics by a military commander would convince Pastor Jones to cancel his plans. The pastor responded to Petraeus' statement that, "We understand the General's concerns. We are sure that his concerns are legitimate.

The prominent [[Qatar]] based scholar, [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] despite condemning the desecration said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Responding to an assault is not by carrying out another assault, as this is discouraged in Islam .... Moreover, we, as Muslims, are required to show respect to and believe in the divinely-revealed books and all preceding prophets. If a person insults Jesus (peace be upon him), I, as a Muslim, should feel annoyed by this and act in his defense. This is what happened upon the release of a film which attacked Jesus: Muslims living in the country where the film was shown reacted angrily in protest. We believe in and highly respect all prophets and messengers, including Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them all).... The noble Quran even goes further and forbids us from cursing the pagans' idols, saying: (And do not abuse those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest exceeding the limits they should abuse Allah out of ignorance.)

====Media reactions====
Some in the media attributed the event to [[silly season]] and [[Yellow journalism|sensationalism]].&lt;ref name=ALJ910 /&gt;

James Poniewozik, of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' gave a few reasons for media coverage of the event: "tiny groups of fringe idiots" often get coverage, presumably because the vast majority of readers find them strange and different. The event also happens to coincide with a seeming American "Islamophobia" and concern over the "Ground Zero mosque;" he also added that "This is, unfortunately, one of those cases in which, by having become news, the story is now making legitimate news." ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s David Weigel, said reporters should "Ignore This Idiot" (the title of his blog post on the controversy). "[Jones] gets to hold the country, or at least the part of the country that pays attention to such news, hostage, with reporters getting the secretary of state and our general in Afghanistan on the record to condemn this nobody. Instead of dying in obscurity, he'll die a has-been. Good work." ''[[ABC News]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Chris Cuomo]] wrote that the "media gave life to this Florida burning ... and that was reckless." Roger Simon, a columnist for ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' responded to David Petraeus' remarks saying "The issue is not the images; it is the acts."&lt;ref name=ALJ910&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2010/09/2010910123534220284.html|title=Quran row feeds media frenzy|author=Evan Hill|date=September 10, 2010|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[Associated Press]] and [[Fox News]] stated their intention to ignore it.&lt;ref name=ALJ910 /&gt;

;Other media reactions
The conservative ''[[Power Line|Powerline]]'' blog stated it was against the Qu'ran burning, but also said that "what gives rise to this dilemma, of course, is the fanaticism of radical Muslims, who have, indeed, responded violently to real or perceived slights to their religion." John Hinderaker, a lawyer and freelance writer, argued that "Perversely, the crazier radical Muslims behave, the more it benefits them (those burning the Qurans). Today it is burning Qurans, but the broader objective is to outlaw, de facto, any criticism of Islam." Another conservative writer [[Michelle Malkin]], echoed an article by [[Christopher Hitchens]], when she bemoaned "the eternal flame of Muslim outrage. When everything from sneakers to stuffed animals to comics to frescos to beauty queens to fast-food packaging to undies serves as dry tinder for [[Allah]]'s avengers, it's a grand farce to feign concern about the recruitment effect of a few burnt Qurans in the hands of a two-bit attention-seeker in Florida."

A [[Facebook]] page support the pastor's plan got more than 16,000 fans by eve of the event, while fans opposing the event numbered in the hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{cite web|author=Evan Hill |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2010/09/2010910123534220284.html |title=Quran row feeds media frenzy |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=September 10, 2010 |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death threats====
Jones said that he hoped the event would not lead to violence. He said that he had been receiving [[death threat]]s regularly since the event was announced.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; [[Evan Kohlmann]] of Flashpoint Global Partners, a firm that "tracks radical militant websites," said that a suicide bomber had threatened to drive a truck into the church and others had discussed setting the building on fire, though it was not known if the discussions were serious. The Wall Street Journal quoted an individual calling himself Abu Dujanah from a jihadist website, "Now, I wish to bomb myself in this church as revenge for the sake of [[Allah]]'s talk... And here I register my name here that I want to be an intended martyr."&lt;ref name=FOX827 /&gt;

When death threats directed against Jones were mailed to ''[[The Gainesville Sun]]'' in a letter postmarked from Johnstown, Pa.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gainesville.com/article/20100901/ARTICLES/9011007/1002|title = Letter says assassins plan to kill Dove World pastor|author = Chad Smith|publisher = The Gainesville Sun|date = September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Muslim Association of North America issued a statement signed by 15 imams including Ahmed Al Mehdawi of the Islamic Center of Gainesville condemning the death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.gainesville.com/article/20100901/ARTICLES/100909964/1109/sports|title = Blog: Muslim groups condemn threats against Dove World|author = Chad Smith|publisher = The Gainesville Sun|date = September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Jones's September 11 visit to New York, Police Commissioner [[Raymond Kelly|Ray Kelly]] said that police plan to keep a "close tab on him" for his own safety.&lt;ref name=CNN911 /&gt;

A Quran was found shot and burned in the driveway of the Annoor Mosque in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. Knoxville police and the FBI began investigating the incident as a possible civil rights violation, a threat, and a hate crime. A YouTube video posted by a user "MuslimKnoxvilleOrg" showing the burning of a Quran stuffed with bacon and doused with lighter fluid was also being investigated, though it was not immediately connected to the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=134130&amp;provider=rss |title=Knoxville mosque leaders downplay shot, burned Quran |author=Anthony Welsch |date=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvJcv1DQya4 |title=How to cook/ burn a Quran and send it to hell.

Federal charges were considered, based on a 1968 law making it an offense "to use force to prevent anyone from carrying out their religious beliefs"; state charges were also considered under Tennessee civil rights law prohibiting intimidation, and misdemeanor offenses such as [[disorderly conduct]] were also explored.&lt;ref name=RNN924 /&gt;

In Michigan, a burned Quran was found in front of the Islamic Center of East Lansing. Local police and the FBI were called in to investigate.

On September 9, Jones announced the cancellation of the event, and a plan to fly to New York to meet with the Imam of Park51, Feisal Abdul Rauf.&lt;ref name="yahoocancel" /&gt; In an interview on the morning of September 11, the day of the intended protest, he said, "We will definitely not burn the Quran...Not today, not ever."&lt;ref name=CNN911&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/09/11/new.york.jones/index.html?hpt=T1 |title=Florida pastor calls off Quran burning |author=CNN wire staff |date=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the cancellation, visiting protesters from both sides attempted to reach the rally, but a heavy police presence dominated the area. A visitor from Atlanta who attempted to burn a Quran had his book and lighter seized by police.&lt;ref name=AFP912 /&gt;

The World Evangelical Alliance later contacted Jones, asking him to apologize for the planned Quran burning. In a public statement, he refused, saying, "We will not repent for standing up for the gospel", adding that Christian churches "have lost their guts to stand up for Christianity. But instead, they bow down to the political powers and the false doctrines of the nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clickorlando.com/news/25036179/detail.html |title=Gainesville Pastor: 'We Will Not Repent' |author=Internet Broadcasting Systems |publisher=Clickorlando.com (WKMG Local 6) |date=September 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006004804/http://www.clickorlando.com/news/25036179/detail.html |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 22, 2010, Jones collected a new car which was offered as a reward to Jones in a "quirky radio" ad by a New Jersey [[Hyundai]] dealership owned by former [[New York Giants]], [[Brad Benson]] if Jones did not burn Qurans.

Jones sought a permit in April 2011 to hold a rally at the Islamic Center of America in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. A jury sided with prosecutors, ruling that Jones and Sapp would breach the peace.

'''Ernest Cary Brace''' (August 15, 1931 – December 5, 2014) was the longest-held civilian [[prisoner of war]] (POW) during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Republic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/mccain/articles/2007/03/01/20070301mccainbio-chapter3.html |title=McCain Profile: Prisoner of war |last1=Nowicki |first1=Dan |last2=Muller |first2=Bill |date=2007-03-01 |work=[[The Arizona Republic]] |publisher=azcentral.com |accessdate=2011-02-04 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wFYLPwdQ?url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/mccain/articles/2007/03/01/20070301mccainbio-chapter3.html |archivedate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A decorated [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] fighter pilot and [[Mustang (military officer)|mustang]], Brace was [[Courts-martial in the United States|court-martialed]] in 1961 for attempting to fake his own death. He flew as a civilian contract pilot before being captured in [[Laos]] in 1965 while flying supplies for [[USAID]].  He spent almost eight years as a POW and upon his release received a [[List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States|Presidential Pardon]] in light of his good conduct.

==Military career==
Brace was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1931.&lt;ref name="local"/&gt; He enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1947 at age 15 as an aviation radar and radio technician.  He earned his Pilot's Wings and his commission as a [[Second lieutenant|Second Lieutenant]] from the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN)|Aviation Cadet School]], graduating in August 1951.  During his tour in the [[Korean War]] (April 1952 - March 1953), he flew more than 100 missions.&lt;ref name="local"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldandnews.com/news/article_4d204f12-d9bc-11df-86f4-001cc4c03286.html |title=Aviation Hall of Honor inducts local|publisher=[[Herald and News]]|date=18 October 2010|accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ernest Brace: War hero court-martialled for desertion who became the longest-serving civilian prisoner of war in Vietnam|first=Emily|last=Langer|date=15 December 2014|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/ernest-brace-war-hero-court-martialled-for-desertion-who-became-the-longest-serving-civilian-9926791.html|website=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While assigned to [[VMFA-121|Marine Attack Squadron 121]] in November 1952, Second Lieutenant Brace participated in a [[Dive bomber|dive-bombing]] attack against a Korean hydroelectric plant.  Brace received surface-to-air fire as he took low-altitude reconnaissance imagery of the bombing results.  He was able to fly his damaged [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|AD-3 Skyraider]] clear of the Korean Peninsula, crashing in the Sea of Japan where he was rescued by ''[[USS Kidd (DD-661)|USS Kidd]]''.  For his courage and initiative, Brace was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jane Blakeney |url=http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=28065 |title=Valor awards for Ernest C.

Years later, Brace (then a [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]) crashed his [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28 Trojan]] into a cornfield near the mouth of the [[Choptank River]] near [[Cambridge, Maryland]] during a training flight on 3 January 1961.  He fled the scene but turned himself in ten days later once his empty flight-suit was found hidden in vegetation.&lt;ref name="Freelancestar"/&gt;  Brace faced a court-martial and was charged with deliberately crashing his aircraft and faking his death so that his wife Patricia could collect insurance money to pay off debts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Quantico to Open Brace Court-Martial|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19610705&amp;id=7vFNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qIoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5576,141019|date=5 July 1961|newspaper=[[Free-Lance Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brace pleaded guilty to ''unauthorized absence'' and was acquitted of the deliberate destruction of his aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=[[The Progress-Index|Petersburg Progress]]|title=Marine Pilot to Present Defense at Court Martial|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/petersburg-progress-index/1961-07-07/page-7|date=7 July 1961|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court-martial ended his military career.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-28/books/bk-265_1_marine-corps |title=Death Before Dishonor and Life After It|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=1988-02-28|author=William C.

What food I get is shoved through a hole;
At night I lie down, and my hands are tied,
The rope is stretched to a pole outside.&lt;/poem&gt;

Brace then worked as a civilian pilot for a number of companies before flying for [[BirdAir]], an airline contracted by the Thai [[Border Patrol Police]].  BirdAir also supported [[USAID]] interests in Southeast Asia.  On 21 May 1965, he flew Royal Thai Army Sergeant Chaicharn, as well as other passengers and cargo to a dirt airstrip in the Northern Laotian village of Baum Lao in Muong Houn District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conley |first=Margaret |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=5947378&amp;page=1#.Uafd5kDCb0s |title=POW Remembers McCain and Tapping Through Walls in Hanoi Prison |publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brace's aircraft, a [[Pilatus PC-6 Porter]], received small arms fire upon landing, rendering it incapable of taking off again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/locked-up-abroad/articles/ernest-brace-longest-held-civilian-pow/ |title=Ernest Brace: Longest Held Civilian POW|publisher=[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]|date= |accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both he and Chaicharn were immediately taken prisoner (either by the [[Vietnam People's Army]] or the [[Pathet Lao]]) and force-marched into the jungle from Boum Lao to Muong Hoc to Doi Sai, near [[Dien Bien Phu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1VhNF19vJcC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=ernest+brace+korea+pilot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=naplwDT-5C&amp;sig=taVfrRmTO4ZjMZWF39DPHrXdMg4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2N2nUcbGA8jpigKV64HQBA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ernest%20brace%20korea%20pilot&amp;f=false|title=An Enormous Crime: The Definitive Account of American POWs Abandoned in Southeast Asia|publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]]|last1=Hendon|first1=Bill|last2=Stewart|first2=Elizabeth|isbn=978-0-312-38538-5|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brace was held in a bamboo cage with his limbs and neck bound to prevent escape.  During his captivity he was beaten, interrogated, and faced with a [[mock execution]]. He escaped 6 June 1965 for a few days before being caught stealing food from a village. Upon his return to the cage his legs were put in stocks and bolted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGemFZmcn_AC&amp;pg=PA648&amp;lpg=PA648 |title=Honor Bound: American Prisoners of War in Southeast Asia, 1961–1973 |first1=Stuart I. |last1=Rochester | authorlink1 = Stuart Rochester |first2=Frederick T. |last2=Kiley |publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]] |year=1998 |accessdate=2013-06-05 |isbn=978-1-59114-738-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped on 17 April 1966, and was recaptured in minutes. Next buried up to his chin for seven days, Brace hit his low point and attempted to hang himself on 10 December 1967. He was sent in October 1968 to a POW camp on the outskirts of [[Hanoi]] nicknamed The Plantation, where he met [[John McCain]] in the cell next to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/locked-up-abroad/videos/captured-by-the-enemy/ |title=Captured by the Enemy|publisher=[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]|date=2013-03-22 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brace re-tells his story in Season 8 of ''[[Banged Up Abroad|Locked Up Abroad]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alfadl|first=Noura|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/294233-former-pows-mccain-and-brace-reunite-for-documentary-premiere |title=Former POWs McCain and Brace reunite for documentary premiere - The Hill's In The Know |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Jim Bedinger, he was sequestered from other prisoners because he had been captured in Laos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pownetwork.org/bios/b/b133.htm |title=Bio, Bedinger, Henry J |publisher=Pownetwork.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before [[Doug Hegdahl]]'s early release from the captivity, Brace contacted Hegdahl to ensure the outside world knew about the prisoners captured in Laos.{{r|monkeypaw}}

[[File:Feria Nacional de San Marcos 2012 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Feria Nacional de San Marcos in 2012]]

The '''''Feria Nacional de San Marcos''''' ('''San Marcos Fair''') is a national [[fair]] held in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Aguascalientes]] every year for three (or sometimes four) weeks. Most of the events related to the fair, however, occur in the city of [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]], the state capital. The exact date of the fair varies every year but is set around April 25, the [[Feast Day]] of [[Mark the Evangelist|San Marcos]]. 

Initially the fair was tied to the ''[[vendimia]]'' (harvesting of grapes) since wine production used to be an important activity in Aguascalientes. Nowadays, it is an important tourist attraction that is heavily associated with [[bullfighting]] and [[cockfighting]]. It is estimated that seven million people visit the fair every year and as a consequence hotels are usually filled to capacity, however some locals rent out their houses to visitors and go on vacation during this time.

==Activities==

The San Marcos National Fair is organized by an independent foundation that oversees the governance of what happens at the fair, but is supported by the state and city governments of Aguascalientes. 

The fair is host to a large range of activities, of which bullfighting and cockfighting are the most popular. Usually a concert is given by a prominent Mexican singer after a series of cockfights; this event tends to draw more attention than the fights themselves. 

Located in the main fair venue are an assortment of sponsored stands and mechanical games, as well as stages where various concerts and theater plays are performed. The [[livestock fair]] and the ''[[charreada]]s'' still remain an important part of the celebration. Parties where traditional Mexican music is played (''tamboras'') are also celebrated on the streets of Aguascalientes. Finally, a [[casino]] is licensed in downtown Aguascalientes just for the occasion.

Concerts, art exhibits and other cultural events complement the fair in many locations around the state. The award ceremony of the National Award for Youth Art occurs in Aguascalientes during this time as well.

==History==
[[Image:FNSM 14.jpg|thumb|250px|Attractions at the 2014 Fair]]
The fair was celebrated for the first time around [[harvest]] time from November 5 to November 20, 1828, as a showcase of the state's produce and livestock.  During that time it was in direct competition with the fairs of [[Acapulco]], [[Xalapa|Jalapa]] and [[San Juan de los Lagos]].

The celebrations centered in the ''Parián'', a market in the city of Aguascalientes, until 1848. In 1842 the outside [[balustrade]] of San Marcos Park was built in a plot of land donated by the [[Catholic Church]]. The balustrade is of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style and is still preserved to this day. Once San Marcos Park was completed the date of celebration was changed to April to coincide with the festivities in honor the patron saint San Marcos.

Construction of the San Marcos Plaza [[bullring]] started in 1896 and was completed in only 48 days. From that date bullfighting was included in the festivities. It was not until 1992 that the much larger Monumental Plaza de San Marcos was built, with a [[seating capacity]] of fifteen thousand people.

Since 1924 the winner of the [[beauty pageant]] has been crowned "Queen of the Fair". In 2006, after some electoral controversy, three queens were appointed.

In 1958 the fair was elevated to the rank of "National" by [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Adolfo López Mateos]].

On April 26, 2009, the fair was canceled due to the [[2009 flu pandemic|pandemic flu virus that was afflicting certain areas of Mexico]].
This was the first time in 181 fairs that the festivities had been canceled.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

'''Fun Palaces''' is an annual, free, nationwide celebration of culture at the heart of community, using arts, science, craft, tech, digital, heritage and sports activities as a catalyst for community engagement.  This takes place over the first weekend in October every year.  Fun Palaces are community events, created by and for local people.  They are held in a variety of locations, ranging from libraries, shopping centres, schools, parks, village squares, community halls, swimming pools, etc.  The original (never built) Fun Palace was the brainchild of celebrated theatre director [[Joan Littlewood]] and architect [[Cedric Price]]. Their never-realised vision was re-interpreted for the 21st century with the Fun Palaces campaign for cultural democracy, with community-led events in many locations. The first weekend of action took place in 2014, with 138 Fun Palaces taking place across the UK and internationally and in 2015 the number rose to 142, 292 Fun Palaces in 2016, and 362 in 2017.&lt;ref name="Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fun Palaces|url=http://funpalaces.co.uk/|website=Fun Palaces|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Joan Littlewood and the architect Cedric Price came up with the idea of the Fun Palace as one building in 1961.  It was their dream to build a space where people in the community could come together to celebrate arts, science and culture.&lt;ref name="Dream"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fun palaces: Joan Littlewood's dream to be realised 100 years after birth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/18/fun-palaces-joan-littlewood-dream-realised-100-years-birth|accessdate=16 April 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their original blueprint said:&lt;ref name="Dream" /&gt;

{{quote|Choose what you want to do – or watch someone else doing it. Learn how to handle tools, paint, babies, machinery, or just listen to your favourite tune. Dance, talk or be lifted up to where you can see how other people make things work. Sit out over space with a drink and tune in to what's happening elsewhere in the city. Try starting a riot or beginning a painting – or just lie back and stare at the sky.}}

Inspiration for the idea came from traditional pleasure gardens and working men's institutes, which were very much for the community as a whole.  They wanted to build a radical venue which was to be a "laboratory of fun" or a "university of the streets", where visitors could go along and enjoy performances, participate in arts and craft activities or just meet up and have fun.  As a result, allowing culture, science and education to be available to people from all backgrounds.&lt;ref name="BBC article"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joan Littlewood's 'Fun Palace' idea realised 50 years on|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29479645|accessdate=16 April 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The palace was never built. Councils would not give the land, the permissions and the money just did not materialise. As such the Fun Palace became an unrealised dream.  All this changed in 2013 when the first call for venues and organisation to create their own Fun Palaces locally was suggested by Stella Duffy, co-founder (with Sarah-Jane Rawlings) of the Fun Palaces organisation. On the 4 and 5 October, hundreds of Fun Palaces, supported by the Fun Palaces organisation, appeared across the UK and beyond.  Instead of building new buildings, temporary 'pop-up' fun palaces, appeared in various venues and locations.&lt;ref name="2nd Chance"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fun palaces: Joan Littlewood's dream for culture gets second chance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2014/jan/06/fun-palaces-joan-littlewood-culture|accessdate=16 April 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first weekend, 138 venues and companies enlisted along with independent artists, scientists and community events organisers. Since then there have been annual weekends of action on the first weekend of October every year. 

== Manifesto ==

The Fun Palaces Manifesto is:&lt;ref name="Website" /&gt;

{{quote|We believe in the genius in everyone, in everyone an artist and everyone a scientist, and that creativity in community can change the world for the better.  We believe we can do this together, locally, with radical fun – and that anyone, anywhere, can make a Fun Palace.}}

The '''Global Scholars Group''' are a group of [[scholarships]] in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[British Commonwealth]] and the [[United States]], which come together to hold an annual ''Global Scholars Symposium''. The project was initiated in 2008 by the [[Gates Scholars]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] and expanded due to funding from the [[McCall MacBain Foundation]] (initiated by Canadian, [[John MacBain]] of the [[Rhodes Trust]]). Since that time it has expanded to include scholars from 51 different countries across 9 different scholarship programs.

[[File:Steamrally.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the many tractors at the 2008 Henham Steam Rally]]
[[File:Steamrally1.jpg|thumb|One of the many steam engines at the 2008 Henham Steam Rally]]

The '''Grand Henham Steam Rally''' is held annually at the end of September at [[Henham Park]], near [[Southwold]], in the [[England|English]] county of [[Suffolk]]. It attracts a large number of exhibitors; including tractors, cars, army vehicles, fire engines, lorries and of course, steam engines.
The 1975 Rally attracted approximately 200 entries whereas the current Rallies can have over 1200 entries

==History==
The Henham Steam Rally really started two years before it was first held at Henham. It was first held at Lower Green Farm, [[Sotterley]]; where there was a small Steam Fair organised by Len Murray. There was another similar event held a year later in [[Brampton, Suffolk|Brampton]]. These events lacked space and it was obvious that more land and more people were needed to run the rally.

Thanks to the 4th [[Earl of Stradbroke]] the rally moved to the High Lodge area in Henham Park. The Earl also helped with funds. The main organisations involved with running the Rally are the Parochial Church Councils of Wangford-cum-Henham, [[Uggeshall]] &amp; Sotherton; [[Wangford]] Community Council and Southwold (Sole Bay) Lions Club. They are supported by a group of volunteers and organisations who provide much needed help.

In its history at Henham, the Rally has only moved elsewhere four times.
One very wet year the Rally had to be held at [[Sibton]] park near [[Yoxford]].
The 2001 Rally had to be held in a stubble field in Brampton due to the Foot &amp; Mouth problems; Henham park being home to many sheep and cattle.
In 2003 the rally was held at the [[Royal Norfolk Show]] Ground which made it easy lay out. Numbers of visitors were high as well.
The 2004 Rally was held in [[Benacre, Suffolk|Benacre]] Park.&lt;ref name="Grand Henham Steam Rally"&gt;Taken from [http://www.henhamsteamrally.co.uk/page7.htm Grand Henham Steam Rally]. 27 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Hard Music Festival was held on December 31, 2007 in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and featured [[Justice (band)|Justice]], [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]] and [[2 Live Crew]]. Hard is best known for the Hard Summer Music Festival and Hard Haunted Mansion, though also runs several smaller events and once-off shows.

[[Live Nation Entertainment]] acquired Hard in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/live-nation-acquires-electronic-music-promoter/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hard Summer Music Festival==
Since 2008, Hard has run an annual Hard Summer Music Festival. The first was held on July 19, 2008 in Downtown Los Angeles at the [[Shrine Exposition Hall]].  In 2009, Hard Summer changed venues to [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]]. The Inglewood police department and fire marshals were forced to shut the event because it was declared a "hazard" by the fire department. In 2010, the venue changes to again to the [[Los Angeles State Historic Park]], where it continued to he held until 2014, when it moved to the [[Whittier Narrows Recreation Area]] in [[El Monte, California]]. In 2015 Hard Summer once again switched venues this time the [[Fairplex]] in [[Pomona, California]], and in 2016 it moved to the  Fontana [[Auto Club Speedway]] and hosted around 146,000 people.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

For its 10th anniversary, the festival was set to return to the Auto Club Speedway; however, after a notable decline in ticket sales, LiveNation moved the event to [[Glen Helen Amphitheater]] in [[San Bernardino, California]]. About 80,000 people attended the two day weekend. Hard Summer 2018 is set to return to the [[Auto Club Speedway]] in August 2018.

'''Helicopter Shark''' is a [[photomontage|composition of two photographs]] that gives the impression that a [[great white shark]] is leaping out of the water attacking military personnel climbing a suspended ladder attached to a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopter. The photo was widely circulated via an [[email]] in 2001, along with a claim that it had been chosen as "[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Photo of the Year". The email in question was usually written in the following form: "AND YOU THINK {{sic|YOUR}} HAVING A BAD DAY AT WORK !!" The photo is similar to an incident in the 1966 film ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' where a shark attacks [[Batman]] on a ladder from a helicopter. This raised suspicions that the photo in question was a [[hoax]]. ''National Geographic'' publicly disavowed the photo and the claimed award as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0815_020815_photooftheyear.html Shark "Photo of the Year" Is E-Mail Hoax], ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', March 8, 2005.

The hoax has been discussed in various texts, including a marketing book to teach lessons about influence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buzz: Harness the Power of Influence and Create Demand|author=Ira Matathia and Marian L.

"So what? ...|year=2004|isbn=1-57110-376-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ous2ti3Nq7IC&amp;pg=PT72&amp;dq=helicopter+shark+bridge+photo&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=9KroRrxRgdKmAumJ5J4E&amp;sig=rOe-TelOeKS_thAsSpAWmIfMlkg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final edited photo was created by combining a photograph of a [[HH-60G Pave Hawk]] helicopter taken by Lance Cheung for the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF), and a photo taken by South African photographer Charles Maxwell. While the helicopter photo was in fact taken in front of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the photo of the shark was actually taken in [[False Bay]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dylan Loeb|last=McClain|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Compressed Data; Another Big Fish Story Comes Unraveled.|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04EEDE123BF934A35753C1A9649C8B63|quote=A photograph circulating on the Internet purports to show a great white shark leaping out of the water at a military diver hanging on a ladder from a hovering helicopter.

The '''Huemul Project''' ({{lang-es|Proyecto Huemul}}) was an early 1950s [[Argentina|Argentine]] effort to develop a [[fusion power]] device known as the '''Thermotron'''. The concept was invented by [[Austria]]n scientist [[Ronald Richter]], who claimed to have a design that would produce effectively unlimited power.

Richter was able to pitch the idea to [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Juan Perón]] in 1948, and soon received funding to build an experimental site on [[Huemul Island]], just outside the town of [[San Carlos de Bariloche]] in [[Patagonia]], near the [[Andes]] mountains. Construction began late in 1949, and by 1951 the site was completed and carrying out tests. On 16 February 1951, Richter measured high temperatures that suggested fusion had been achieved. On 24 March, the day before an important international meeting of the leaders of the Americas, Perón publicly announced that Richter had been successful, adding that in the future energy would be sold in packages the size of a milk bottle and perhaps free of charge.

A worldwide interest followed, along with significant skepticism on the part of other physicists. Little information was forthcoming; no papers were published on the topic, and over the next year a number of reporters visited the site but were denied access to the buildings. After increasing pressure, Perón arranged for a team to investigate the claims and return individual reports, all of which were negative. A review of these reports was equally negative, and the project was ended in 1952. By this time, the news had been used by groups around the world to begin their own fusion research projects.

Perón was overthrown in 1955, and in the aftermath, Richter was arrested for fraud. He appears to have spent periods of time abroad, including some time in Libya. Eventually he returned to Argentina, where he died in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =  RICHTER: DE LA FUSION NUCLEAR AL OLVIDO | journal = Microsemanario | volume = 2 | issue = 43 | pages = | date = November–December 1991 | year = |publisher=Secretaría de Extensión Universitaria de la Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y  Naturales - UBA| url = http://www.fcen.uba.ar/prensa/micro/1991/ms43.htm | doi = | id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior to Huemul==
According to Rainer Karlsch's ''[[Hitler's Bomb]]'', during [[World War II]] German scientists under [[Walter Gerlach]] and [[Kurt Diebner]] carried out experiments to explore the possibility of inducing [[thermonuclear|thermonuclear reactions]] in [[deuterium]] using high explosive-driven convergent shock waves, following Karl Gottfried Guderley's convergent [[shock wave]] solution. At the same time Richter proposed in a memorandum to German government officials the induction of nuclear fusion through shock waves by high-velocity particles shot into a highly compressed deuterium [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] contained in an ordinary [[uranium]] vessel. The proposal was not carried through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rainer |last=Karlsch |authorlink=Rainer Karlsch |title=Hitler's Bomb |publisher=DVA |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Argentine nuclear efforts==
Shortly after his election in 1946, Perón began a purge of the universities that eventually resulted in well over 1,000 professors being fired or quitting, causing a serious setback in Argentine sciences, and lasting enmity between Perón and Argentine [[intelligentsia]]. In response, the [[Physical Association of Argentina]] (AFA) began to organize as a community to retain links between Argentine scientists who now spread to industry.{{sfn|Hymans|2012|p=232}}

In 1946, the director of the AFA, physicist [[Enrique Gaviola]], wrote a proposal to set up the ''Comisión Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas'', or National Scientific Research Commission, arguing that post-[[World War II]] friction (leading to the [[Cold War]]) would present the opportunity for various northern hemisphere scientists to move south to escape limits on their research. In the same paper, Gaviola argued for the formation of a body to explore the peaceful use of atomic power. In spite of the poor relations between the science community and government, the proposal was seriously studied and Congress debated the matters on several occasions, before Perón decided to place it under military control. Gaviola objected, starting a long and acrimonious debate over the nature and aims of the program.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|pp=7-8}}

By 1947 plans to form an atomic study group were progressing slowly, when the entire issue was shut down by an article in the US political newsmagazine, ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]''. The 24 February 1947 issue contained an article by William Mizelle on "Peron's Atomic Plans", which claimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With world famous German atom-splitter Werner Heisenberg invited to come to Argentina by Peron's Government and with a major uranium source discovered in Argentina, that Nation is launching a military nuclear research program to crack Pandora's box of atomic energy wide open. Argentina's determined atomic adventure and its frankly military purposes cannot be dismissed as the impractical dream of a small nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William |last=Mizelle |title=Peron's Atomic Plans |journal=New Republic |date = 24 February 1947 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

International pressure on the country following the publication was intense, and the plans were soon dropped. This event appears to have made Perón more determined than ever to both develop atomic energy as well as prove its peaceful intentions.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=8}}

==Germans in Argentina==
In 1947 a dossier was provided to Argentina by the Spanish embassy in Buenos Aires, listing a number of German aeronautical engineers who were looking to sneak out of the country. Among them was [[Kurt Tank]], designer of the famed [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] and many other successful designs. The dossier was passed to the recently formed [[Argentine Air Force|Argentine Air Force's]] Commander in Chief, who passed it to Brigadier César Raúl Ojeda, in charge of aerodynamics research.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=8}} Ojeda and Tank communicated and formulated plans to begin building a jet fighter in Argentina, which would eventually emerge as the [[FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II]].{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=9}}

Just before leaving for Argentina, Tank briefly met Richter in London, where Richter told Tank of his ideas for [[nuclear powered aircraft]].{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=79}} Richter was at that time doing some work in the German chemical industry. Tank had also contacted a number of other engineers and even famed fighter pilot and ''Luftwaffe'' general [[Adolf Galland]]. Various members of the group made their way to Argentina under false passports during late 1947 and 1948. The Germans were warmly received by Perón, who effectively gave them a [[blank cheque]] in an effort to rapidly develop the Argentine economy. Tank set up an aircraft development plant in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], and continued to contact other German engineers and scientists who might be interested in joining them.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=9}} A total of 184 German scientists and engineers were known to have moved to Argentina during this period.{{sfn|Hymans|2012|p=220}}

Richter was invited to join the group and arrived in Argentina on 16 August 1948 travelling under the name "Dr. Pedro Matthies".{{sfn|Fantoni|2011|p=1}} Tank personally introduced him to Perón on 24 August,{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=80}} and Richter pitched him on the idea of a fusion device which would provide unlimited power, make Argentina a scientific leader in the world, and be of purely civilian intent. Perón was intrigued, and clearly impressed, later telling reporters that "in half an hour he explained to me all the secrets of nuclear physics and he did it so well that now I have a pretty good idea of the subject".{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=9}}

Gaviola, still maintaining pressure to form a nuclear research group, saw all interest evaporate. From that point on he offered his services only as a "member of Richter's firing squad."{{sfn|Hymans|2012|p=233}} Other German scientists, including [[Guido Beck]], Walter Seelmann-Eggbert and now-elderly [[Richard Gans]], quickly realized something was amiss in the entire affair, and began to align themselves with the AFA, steering clear of Richter and the government in general. At an AFA meeting in September 1951, Beck publicly resigned from the [[University of Buenos Aires]] over the issue.{{sfn|Hymans|2012|p=233}}

== The project ==
Richter was soon set up in a laboratory at Tank's Córdoba site, but in early 1949 a fire destroyed some of the equipment. Richter claimed it was sabotage, and demanded a more protected location free from spies.{{sfn|Hagood|2014|p=264}} When support was not immediately forthcoming, Richter went on a tour, visiting Canada and perhaps the US and Europe as well.{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=80}} A year later, [[Lise Meitner]] recalled meeting "a strange Austrian with an Argentine visa" in Vienna, where he demonstrated a device he claimed was a thermonuclear system, but Meitner later dismissed as a chemical effect.{{sfn|Newton|1992|p=379}}

Richter's tour was a thinly veiled threat to leave Argentina, which prompted action. Perón handed the problem of selecting a suitable experimental site to Colonel González, a friend from the [[1943 Argentine coup d'état]]. González selected a location deep within the country on Huemul Island where it would be easy to protect from prying eyes. Construction work began in July, causing a nationwide shortage of brick and cement. Richter moved to the site in March 1950 while construction on Laboratory 1, the reactor, was still ongoing.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=9}}

In May 1950, Perón formed the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (''CNEA''), bypassing Gaviola's earlier efforts and placing himself in the position of president, with Richter and the minister of technical affairs as the other chairs.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=10}} A year later, he formed the National Atomic Energy Directorate (''DNEA''), under González, to provide project assistance and logistics support.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=11}}

When the reactor was finally completed in May, Richter noticed there was no way to access the interior of the {{convert|12|m}} wide concrete cylinder, requiring a series of holes to be drilled through the {{convert|4|m}} thick walls. But before this could be completed, Richter declared that a crack on the outside rendered the entire reactor useless, and had it torn down.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=9}}

While this was taking place, Richter began experiments in the much smaller {{convert|2|m}} reactor in Laboratory 2. The experiments injected lithium and hydrogen into the cylinder and discharged a spark through it. The cylinder was supposed to reflect the energy created by these reactions back into the chamber to keep the reaction going.{{efn|A condition now known as ''[[Fusion ignition|ignition]]''.}} Diagnostic measurements were provided by taking photographs of the [[spectrum]] and using doppler widening to measure the temperature of the resulting reactions.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=9}}

==Announcement==
On 16 February 1951, Richter claimed he had successfully demonstrated fusion. He re-ran the experiment for members of the CNEA, later claiming that they had witnessed the world's first thermonuclear reaction.{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=82}}

On 23 February, a technician working for the project expressed his concerns about the claims, suggesting that the measurement was likely due to the accidental tilting of the spectrograph's photographic plate while the experimental run was being set up.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|pp=9-10}} Richter refused to re-run the experiment. Instead, a week later he ordered the reactor to be disassembled so a new one could be built that included a magnetic confinement system. Meanwhile, plans for a new Laboratory 1 were started with this new design, but this time to be buried underground. A {{convert|14|m}} deep hole in hard rock was constructed, only to have Richter change the design and have the hole filled in with concrete.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|p=10}}

On 2 March, [[Edward G. Miller, Jr.|Edward Miller]], the US Assistant Secretary of Station for Inter-American Affairs, visited Argentina. This was ostensibly to visit the [[Pan American Games]], but in reality was in advance of calling a meeting of American leaders later that month to discuss China's entry into the [[Korean War]]. Perón gave Miller an introduction to Richter's work, and Miller filed a memo on it on 6 March.{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=83}} During this period, Perón seized the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]'', whose editor fled to the US. This led to harsh criticism in the US. Miller suggested a policy of "masterful inaction", not actively denying support for the project, but simply never providing any.{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=83}}

The leadership meeting was to take place between 26 March and 7 April, by which time the Chinese "emergency" had passed and the war was entering a new phase. Perón then took the opportunity to announce Richter's results to the world. On 24 March, Perón held a press conference at [[Casa Rosada]] and stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On February 16, 1951, in the atomic energy pilot plant on Huemul Island... thermonuclear experiments were carried out under conditions of control on a technical scale."{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=85}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perón justified the project by noting the country's enormous energy shortage would be addressed by building plants across the country, and that the energy would be bought and sold in containers the size of a milk bottle.{{sfn|Newton|1992|p=379}} He went on to note that the country was simply unable to afford the cost of developing a uranium-based energy program, or that of a system using [[tritium]], normally generated in special fission plants. Richter's fuel meant the reaction could only take place in a reactor, not a bomb, and he then recommitted the country to exploring only peaceful uses of atomic energy. Richter added that he understood the secret of the hydrogen bomb, but that Perón had forbidden any work on it.{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=85}}

The next day Richter held another press conference on the topic, a meeting that became known as the "10,000 word interview".{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=86}} He explained that a hydrogen bomb required a fission trigger,{{efn|Note that this is prior to the first test of a hydrogen bomb, when the operational concept was still secret.}} and that the country was unable and unwilling to build such a device. Very little explanation of the thermotron was mentioned, beyond the announcement that he used the Doppler effect to measure speeds of 3,300&amp;nbsp;km/s and that the fuel was either [[lithium hydride]] or deuterium which was introduced into pre-heated hydrogen. He was careful to explain that these were small-scale experimental results, and refused to state whether it would work well at the industrial scale.{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=88}}

On 7 April, Perón awarded Richter the gold Peronista Party Medal in a highly publicized event.{{sfn|Hagood|2014|p=268}}

With the US refusing any support for the program, Richter turned to other countries for equipment. In April, [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands]] visited Perón, and offered technical help to the project from [[Philips]]. A visit by [[Cornelis Bakker]], later the director of [[CERN]], was arranged and a [[synchrotron]] and [[Cockcroft–Walton generator]] were suggested as possible products of interest. Perón wrote to Richter to arrange the visit, during which Richter refused to show Bakker any of the reactors. In spite of this, Perón offered to fund the purchase of a [[Cockcroft–Walton generator]] and a [[synchrotron]] from the company.{{sfn|Mariscotti|1992|pp=11-12}}

==Public reaction==
Shortly after Richter's conference, the matter was discussed in the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]. They noted that the announcement revealed no details of the system of operation. They also noted that Richter claimed three key advances during experimentation, but failed to mention any of them during the conference. Finally, although the method for measuring temperature was announced, the temperature itself was not. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]'s (AEC) comment on the announcement was simply that "the Argentine Government announced more than a year ago that it was planning to engage in nuclear research."{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=89}}

American physicists were universally dismissive of the announcement. Among the more famous responses was [[George Gamow]], who said "It seemed to be 95% pure propaganda, 4¾% thermonuclear reactions on a very small scale, and the remaining ¼% probably something better."{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=90}} But Edward Lawrence was not so dismissive, noting that "There is an tendency to laugh it off as being a lot of hot air or something. Well it may be, but we don't know all, and we should make every effort to find out."{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=90}} [[Edward Teller]] put it succinctly, "Reading one line one has to think he's a genius. Reading the next line, one realizes he's crazy."{{sfn|Arnoux|2011}}

British scientists, at that time working secretly on the [[z-pinch]] fusion concept, did not rule out the possibility of small-scale reactions.{{sfn|Davenport|1983|p=322}} [[George Paget Thomson|George Thomson]], at that time leading the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (AEA), suggested it was simply exaggerated. This opinion was mirrored by [[Mark Oliphant]] in Australia, and [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in Germany. Perhaps the most biting criticism came from [[Manfred von Ardenne]], a German physicist now working in the [[Soviet Union]]. He advised that people should ignore Richter's claims, noting that he had worked with Richter during the war and said he confused fantasy with reality.{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=91}}

In May, the ''United Nations World'' magazine carried a short article by [[Hans Thirring]], the director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Vienna, and well known author on nuclear matters. He stated that "the chances are 99 to 1 that the explosion in Argentina occurred only in the imagination of a crank or a fraud."{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=92}} When Thirring heard the announcement, he had gone searching for anyone that knew him from before he arrived in Argentina. He found that Richter had studied under Heinrich Rausch von Traubenberg in the 1930s, who described him as a peculiar eccentric, but von Traubenberg had died in 1944 so there was no way to follow up on the story. Richter's dissertation was never published, and the university in Prague burned during the war.{{sfn|Hagood|2014|p=268}}  Richter was invited to prepare a rebuttal, which appeared in the July issue. He simply dismissed Thirring as "a typical textbook professor with a strong scientific inferiority complex, probably supported by political hatred."{{sfn|Cabral|1987|p=94}}

==Private reaction==
Although essentially dismissed by everyone in the scientific community, the Richter announcement nevertheless had a major effect on the history of controlled fusion experiments.

The most direct outcome of the announcement was its effect on [[Lyman Spitzer]], an [[astrophysicist]] at [[Princeton University]]. Just prior to leaving for a ski trip to  [[Aspen Mountain (ski area)|Aspen]], Spitzer's father called and mentioned the announcement in ''[[The New York Times]]''. Spitzer read the articles and dismissed them, noting the system could not deliver enough energy to heat the gases to fusion temperatures. This led him to begin considering ways to confine a hot plasma for longer periods of time, giving the system enough time to be heated to 10 to 100 million degrees Celsius. Considering the problem of confining a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] in a toroid pointed out by [[Enrico Fermi]], he hit upon the solution now known as the [[stellarator]]. Spitzer was able to use the notoriety surrounding Richter's announcement to gain the attention of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) with the suggestion that the basic idea of controlled fusion was feasible. He eventually managed to arrange a meeting with the director of the AEC to pitch the stellarator concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenwald |first=J. |date=23 October 2013 |title=Celebrating Lyman Spitzer, the father of PPPL and the Hubble Space Telescope |url=http://www.pppl.gov/news/2013/10/celebrating-lyman-spitzer-father-pppl-and-hubble-space-telescope |publisher=Princeton Plasma Physics Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers in the UK had been experimenting with fusion since 1947 using a system known today as [[z-pinch]]. Small experimental devices had been built at the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] (AERE, "Harwell") and [[Imperial College London]], but requests for funding of a larger system were repeatedly refused. [[James L. Tuck|Jim Tuck]] had seen the work while in the UK, and introduced z-pinch to his coworkers at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in 1950.{{sfn|Herman|1990|p=41}} When Tuck heard of Spitzer's efforts to gain funding, he immediately applied as well, presenting his concept as the [[Perhapsatron]]. He felt that Spitzer's claims to have a fast track to fusion were "incredibly ambitious".{{sfn|Bromberg|1982|p=21}} Both Spitzer and Tuck met with AEC officials in May 1951; Spitzer was granted $50,000 to build an experimental device, while Tuck was turned away empty handed. Not to be outdone, Tuck soon arranged to receive $50,000 from the director of Los Alamos instead.{{sfn|Phillips|1982-1983|p=64}}

When news of the US efforts reached the UK, the researchers there started pushing for funding of a much larger machine. This time they found a much more favorable reaction from the AERE, and both teams soon began construction of larger devices. This work, through fits and starts, led to the [[ZETA (fusion reactor)|ZETA]] system,{{sfn|Bromberg|1982|p=75}} the first truly large-scale fusion reactor. Compared to the small tabletop devices built in the US, ZETA filled a hangar and operated at energy levels far beyond any other machine. When news of ZETA was made public, the US and Soviets were soon demanding funding to build devices of similar scale in order to catch up with the UK.

The announcement had a direct effect on research in the USSR as well. Prior to this several researchers, notably [[Igor Kurchatov]] and I.N. Golovin had put together a development plan similar to the ones being developed in the UK. They too were facing disinterest on the part of the funding groups, which was immediately swept away when Huemul hit the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robin |last=Herman |title=Fusion: The Search for Endless Energy |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wec8bjrc5UoC&amp;pg=PA36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argentine criticism, project cancellation ==
Argentine physicists were critical of the announcement, but found little interest on the part of Perón, who was still at odds with the group. But González was growing increasingly frustrated with Richter, and in February 1952 told Perón that either Richter left the project, or he did. Perón accepted González's resignation, and replaced him with his aide, Navy Captain Pedro Iraolagoitía. Iraolagoitía soon began to protest as well, finally convincing Perón to have the project investigated.{{sfn|Hymans|2012|p=227}}

Instead of calling upon the local physics community, Perón put together a team consisting of Iraolagoitía, a priest, two engineers including [[Mario Báncora]], and young physicist [[José Antonio Balseiro]], who was at that time studying in England and was asked to return with all haste.{{sfn|Cardona|Cohen|Louie|2003|p=9}} The team visited the site for a series of demonstrations between 5 and 8 September 1952.{{sfn|Balseiro|1952}}

The committee analyzed Richter's work and published separate reports on the topic on 15 September. Balseiro, in particular, was convinced nothing nuclear was taking place. His report critiques Richter's claims about how the system is supposed to work, especially the claims that the system was reaching the temperatures needed to demonstrate fusion; he stated that fusion reactions would require something on the order of 40 million kelvin, while the center of the electric arc would be perhaps 4,000 to 100,000 kelvin at the most. He then pointed out that Richter's radiation detectors showed large activity whenever the arc was discharged, even if there was no fuel present. Meanwhile, the team's own detectors showed low activity throughout.{{sfn|Hagood|2014|p=268}} They reported their findings to Perón on 15 February.{{sfn|Balseiro|1952}}

Richter was allowed to officially respond to the report. The government appointed physicists [[Richard Gans]] and Antonio Rodríguez to review the first report as well as Richter's response to it. This second group endorsed the findings of the first review panel and found Richter's response inadequate. On 22 November, while Richter was in Buenos Aires, a military team occupied the site. They found that many of the instruments were not even connected, and it was pronounced a fraud.{{sfn|Hagood|2014|p=268}} Argentines jokingly referred to the affair as the ''Huele a mula'', or "it smells like a con".{{sfn|Newton|1992|p=379}}

==After the project==
In the period immediately after the military takeover, Balseiro wrote a proposal to create a nuclear physics institute on the mainland in nearby [[Bariloche]] using the equipment on the island.{{sfn|Cardona|Cohen|Louie|2003|p=10}} Originally known as the Instituto de Física de Bariloche, it was renamed the [[Balseiro Institute|Instituto Balseiro]] in his honour in 1962.&lt;ref name=mayo&gt;{{cite web |last=Mayo |first=Santos |title=More on the Value of Ronald Richter's Work |publisher=[[Physics Today]] |date=March 2004 |url=http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_57/iss_3/14_1.shtml  |accessdate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1952 and 1955, Richter was effectively under [[house arrest]] in Buenos Aires, with an offer from Perón to "facilitate any travel he might have to make".{{sfn|Hymans|2012|p=232}} After Perón was deposed in September 1955, the new government arrested Richter on the night of 4 October 1955. He was accused of fraud,{{sfn|Davenport|1983|p=322}} and spend a short time in jail.{{sfn|Arnoux|2011|p=1}} At the time, it was estimated that 62.5 million Pesos had been spent on the project, about $15 million USD (${{inflation|US|15|1952}}M in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{sfn|Hagood|2014|p=268}} A more recent estimate places the value closer to [[United States dollar|$]]300 million in 2003 dollars.{{sfn|Cardona|Cohen|Louie|2003|p=9}}

Richter remained in Argentina for a time, but began to travel, eventually landing in [[Libya]]. He returned to Argentina and was extensively interviewed by Mario Mariscotti for his book on Huemul, which remains the most detailed account of the project.{{sfn|Cardona|Cohen|Louie|2003|p=283}} Mariscotti blames the affair primarily on Richter, who Mariscotti states was capable of great self-delusion, adding an autocratic and paranoid management style, and lack of oversight to the ills.{{sfn|Hagood|2014|p=269}}

Perón remains a controversial figure to this day, and opinions of Richter tend to be colored by how closely the author associates him with Perón.

'''Husayn ibn Hamdan ibn Hamdun ibn al-Harith al-Taghlibi''' was an early member of the [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] family, who distinguished himself as a general for the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and played a major role in the Hamdanids' rise to power among the Arab tribes in the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]].

Husayn entered caliphal service in 895, and through his co-operation with the caliphal government, he established himself and his family as the leader of the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira, leading his troops to successful campaigns against the [[Qarmatians]], [[Dulafids]] and [[Tulunids]] over the next few years. As one of the most distinguished generals of the Abbasid Caliphate, he rose in power and influence until 908, when he was one of the leading conspirators in the abortive coup against Caliph [[al-Muqtadir]]. Although the coup failed and Husayn was forced to flee the capital, he soon secured a pardon and served as governor in [[Jibal]], where he again distinguished himself in military operations in south-central Iran. In ca. 911, he was appointed governor in [[Mosul]], where he remained until rising in revolt in 914/5, for reasons that are unclear. Defeated and captured in 916, he was imprisoned in [[Baghdad]], where he was executed in 918. Through his influence, the family rose to high offices, beginning a long period during which Mosul and the entire Jazira were ruled by the Hamdanids. His nephews, [[Nasir al-Dawla]] and [[Sayf al-Dawla]], went on to establish autonomous emirates in Mosul and [[Aleppo]] respectively.

== Biography ==

=== Origin and early career ===
[[File:Hamdanid family tree.svg|thumb|300px|Family tree of the Hamdanid dynasty]]
Husayn was a son of the [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] family's patriarch, [[Hamdan ibn Hamdun]]. His family belonged to the [[Banu Taghlib]] tribe, established in the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] since before the [[Muslim conquests]]. In a pattern repeated across the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the Taghlibi leaders took advantage of the collapse of central caliphal authority of the  during the decade-long [[Anarchy at Samarra]]  (861–870) to assert increasing control over their particular area, centred on [[Mosul]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 265–266&lt;/ref&gt; Hamdan established himself among the leading tribal leaders during this time, and led the resistance against caliphal attempts to restore direct control, even allying with the [[Kharijite Rebellion (866–896)|Kharijite rebels]] in the 880s. Finally, in 895 Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] launched a determined attack to recover the Jazira. Hamdan fled before the Caliph's advance and was captured after a long pursuit and thrown in prison.&lt;ref name="K266"&gt;Kennedy (2004), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EI2-Hamdanids"&gt;Canard (1971), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Husayn, however, who had been entrusted with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the [[Tigris]], chose to surrender it instead, and offered his services to the Caliph. He managed to capture the Kharijite leader [[Harun al-Shari]], thereby bringing an end to the Kharijite revolt in the Jazira. In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father, but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay, and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"&gt;Canard (1971), pp. 619–620&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 182, 266&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major success, laying the groundwork for his own and his family's ascent to power. In the words of the Islamic scholar [[Hugh N. Kennedy]], &lt;blockquote&gt;to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own skilled and loyal leadership; to the Taghlib, and other people in the Jazira, he offered the prospect of salaries and booty; and to his own family military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government services. It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader, but rather as an intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira that al-Husayn made the family fortune.&lt;ref name="K266"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== In Abbasid service ===
[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), the homeland and main power base of the Hamdanids]]
Husayn led his Taghlibi regiment with distinction over the next few years. He fought against the [[Dulafid]] [[Bakr ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Ahmad ibn Abi Dulaf]] in the [[Jibal]] in 896.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt; After 903 he played a decisive role in the campaigns of [[Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib]] against the [[Qarmatians]] of the [[Syrian desert]], where his experienced cavalry was crucial in countering the highly mobile Qarmatians. In 903 he participated in Muhammad's [[Battle of Hama|major victory]] over the Qarmatian leader [[al-Husayn ibn Zikrawayh]], better known by his ''[[laqab]]'' of "''Sahib al-Shama''",  near [[Hama]]. The Qarmatian leaders fled to the desert, but were soon captured, and brought in triumph to Baghdad.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 184, 266–267, 286&lt;/ref&gt; Husayn then participated as commander of the vanguard in Muhammad's 904–905 campaign that ended the [[Tulunid]] dynasty and restored [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] and [[medieval Egypt|Egypt]] to direct caliphal control. Muhammad ibn Sulayman reportedly offered him the governorship of Egypt, but Husayn refused, preferring to return to [[Baghdad]] with the enormous booty he had collected.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 184–185&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return from Egypt, in 905–906, Husayn was sent against the [[Banu Kalb]] of Syria, who had risen in revolt at the instigation of the Qarmatians. Although he drove them into the desert, the Kalbis filled up the wells as they retreated, and he was unable to follow them. As a result, the rebels were able to reach the Lower [[Euphrates]], where they defeated another Abbasid force at al-Qadisiyya and raided the ''[[hajj]]'' caravan of the [[Mecca]] pilgrims (late 906). In the end, the forces of the central government defeated the Qarmatians and drove them to flight. On their retreat back to Syria along the Euphrates, they were attacked and annihilated by Husayn in March/April 907.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt; Although these victories did not entirely remove the Qarmatian threat—the Qarmatians based in [[Bahrain (region)|Bahrayn]] continued to remain active and raided lower Iraq—they signalled the near-eradication of the sect from Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Husayn then subdued the remaining Kalbi rebels between the Euphrates and [[Aleppo]], and in 907–908 confronted and drove back into Syria the [[Banu Tamim]] who had invaded the Jazira seeking pillage, defeating them near Khunasira.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;

By 908, this distinguished service had established Husayn as "one of the leading generals" (Kennedy) in the Caliphate, and enabled him to advance his own brothers to positions of power: they received various offices, the most important of which was the award of the governorship of Mosul to Husayn's brother [[Abdallah ibn Hamdan|Abu'l-Hayja Abdallah]] in 905.&lt;ref name="K267"&gt;Kennedy (2004), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; In December 908, Husayn became involved in a palace plot to depose the new Caliph, [[al-Muqtadir]], in favour of the older [[Ibn al-Mu'tazz]]. Along with two others, on 17 December 908 he attacked and killed the [[vizier]] [[al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i]], who had endorsed al-Muqtadir's accession. The conspirators then sought to kill the young caliph as well, but the latter had barricaded himself in the Hasani Palace. Ibn al-Mu'tazz was proclaimed as caliph, and Husayn went to the palace to persuade al-Muqtadir to surrender. However, the unexpected resistance of the palace servants under the chamberlains Sawsan, [[Mu'nis al-Fahl]] and [[Mu'nis al-Khadim]], and the plotters' indecision, doomed the coup. Al-Muqtadir prevailed, and Husayn fled from Baghdad to Mosul and to [[Balad, Iraq|Balad]].&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K267"/&gt; He then spent some time wandering with his followers across the Jazira. The caliph sent Husayn's own brother, Abu'l-Hayja Abdallah, to pursue him, but Husayn managed to surprise and defeat him. This success encouraged him to contact the new vizier, [[Ali ibn al-Furat]], through the mediation of his brother Ibrahim. Although he had been a leading figure in the conspiracy, and most of the other participants in the coup were executed or imprisoned, Husayn succeeded in receiving a pardon. He was not welcomed back to Baghdad, however, but appointed governor of [[Qumm]] and [[Kashan]] in the Jibal.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K267"/&gt;

As governor, he aided Mu'nis al-Khadim in his campaign against the [[Saffarid]] [[al-Layth ibn Ali]] in [[Sijistan]] and [[Fars Province|Fars]], and later against the former Saffarid general and rebel [[Subkara]] and his lieutenant al-Qattal. The Abbasid forces under Mu'nis al-Khadim succeeded in suppressing the rebellion by 910/1, with al-Qattal being captured by Husayn in person, according to a celebratory poem by the later Hamdanid poet [[Abu Firas]].&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;

Abu Firas further reports that Husayn was offered the governorship of Fars, but refused, and returned to Baghdad. Ibn al-Furat, who probably still mistrusted his intentions, promptly dispatched him to the governorship of the [[Diyar Rabi'a]], the province encompassing the eastern Jazira, including Mosul.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K267"/&gt; From this post, Husayn led a raiding campaign against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 913/4.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt; Soon after, however, an open rift developed between Husayn and the vizier [[Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah]]. The reason is unclear, but revolved around the finances of Husayn's province. In 914/5 he rose in open rebellion, assembling a force of 30,000 Arabs and Kurds in the Jazira, a testament to his influence there. He managed to defeat a caliphal army sent against him, but when confronted by the redoubtable Mu'nis al-Khadim, recalled from Egypt, he was defeated and captured in February 916 while trying to flee north into [[Armenian Highland|Armenia]].&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K267"/&gt; He was brought to Baghdad, where he was publicly paraded across the city in ritual humiliation, riding a camel and wearing a cap of shame. He was put into prison, and executed in October/November 918 on the caliph's orders.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="K267"/&gt;

The reason for Husayn's execution is unclear. The historian of the Hamdanid dynasty, [[Marius Canard]], suggested that it may have been due to his involvement in a [[Shi'a]]-inspired conspiracy, possibly connected to the dismissal of Ibn al-Furat from his second vizierate at the same period, or with the rebellion of the autonomous governor of [[Adharbayjan]], [[Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj]], whom al-Muqtadir may have suspected of ties with the imprisoned Husayn. As Canard writes, "in any case the caliph must have feared that if Husayn were released he would once again start a revolt, either through a desire for independence or as a Shi'i. In order to avoid attempts by those (probably numerous) who desired his release to secure it by force, the caliph preferred to take a measure which put a stop to all intrigue".&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;

Despite Husayn's rebellion and execution, the Hamdanid family continued to prosper: his brothers were soon released from captivity, and Abdallah rose to prominence by aligning himself with Mu'nis al-Khadim and sharing in the ups and downs of the court politics in Baghdad. It was Abdallah's two sons, however, al-Hasan and Ali, better known by their honorific titles [[Nasir al-Dawla]] and [[Sayf al-Dawla]], who established the family as the ruling dynasty in the semi-independent emirates of Mosul (until 978) and Aleppo (until 1002) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2004), pp. 267–282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canard (1971), pp. 126–131&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character and assessment ==
According to Canard, Husayn "stands out more clearly than the supreme commander Mu'nis or any other military leaders" of the period for his ability and valour, as well as for his restive and ambitious spirit. He was also singled out in being of Arab descent, an unusual case among the Caliphate's senior leaders of the period. Canard assesses him as unusually open-minded, and attuned to the ideological turmoil and ferment in the Muslim world of his time, as indicated by his contact with the [[Sufi]] mystic [[al-Hallaj]], who dedicated a work on politics to Husayn. Indeed, according to Canard, Husayn's espousal of Shi'ism, and his participation in the abortive coup of 908, can best be seen in light of a desire—typical of Shi'a sympathisers—for a renewal of the Caliphate and the establishment of an "ideal Muslim government", something which the corrupt and decadent Abbasids were no longer capable of.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt; Finally, although it fell to his brother to found the actual Hamdanid dynasty, it was Husayn who first gave his family a taste of power and glory, for which he was later celebrated in the poetry of Abu Firas.&lt;ref name="EI2-Husayn"/&gt;

{{Environmental law}}
'''Illegal logging''' is the harvest, transportation, purchase or sale of [[timber]] in violation of [[law]]s. The harvesting procedure itself may be illegal, including using [[corruption|corrupt]] means to gain access to forests; extraction without permission, or from a protected area; the cutting down of [[protected species]]; or the extraction of timber in excess of agreed limits.

Illegality may also occur during transport, such as illegal processing and export; [[smuggling|fraudulent declaration to customs]]; the [[tax avoidance|avoidance of taxes]] and other charges, and fraudulent certification.&lt;ref name=Guardian82415&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jonathan Watts|title=Dawn timber-laundering raids cast doubt on 'sustainable' Brazilian wood|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/24/dawn-raids-brazil-illegal-timber-laundering-operation|accessdate=24 August 2015|work=The Guardian|date=24 August 2015|quote=Most of the laundering was reportedly done through the creation of fake or inflated creditos florestais, a document that defines how much timber a landowner is entitled to extract from his property.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|'''Logging in national parks: the case of Korindo (Indonesia)'''
|- 
|In March 2004, [[Greenpeace]] carried out actions against a cargo ship transporting timber from the Indonesian company Korindo, which was being imported into France, UK, Belgium and the Netherlands.
Korindo is known to be using illegal timber from the last rainforests of Indonesia. In May 2003, an Indonesian Government investigation confirmed that Korindo was receiving illegal timber from notorious timber barons known to obtain timber from an orang-utan refuge – the [[Tanjung Puting National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia-international.org|title=Protecting the Environment with Intelligence – EIA International|work=EIA International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Protect forests"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveordelete.com|title=Protect forests|work=saveordelete.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tanjung Puting National Park is a 4,000 square kilometre conservation area of global importance. It is recognised as a world biosphere reserve by the [[United Nations]] and forms the largest protected area of swamp forest in South-East Asia.

Illegal logging is a pervasive problem, causing enormous damage to forests, local communities, and the economies of producer countries. Despite the economic importance of [[timber trade|trade in timber]] and forest products, major international timber consumer countries, such as the EU, have no legal means to halt the import of illegally sourced forest products,&lt;ref&gt;With the exception of CITES which is only partly applicable.&lt;/ref&gt; because the identification of illegally logged or traded timber is technically difficult. Therefore, a legal basis for normative acts against timber imports or other products manufactured out of illegal wood is missing. Scientific methods to pinpoint the geographic origin of timber are currently under development.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Possible actions to restrict imports cannot meet with [[WTO]] regulations of non-discrimination. They must instead be arranged in bilateral agreements. TRAFFIC,&lt;ref name="traffic.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traffic.org/|title=TRAFFIC - Wildlife Trade News|work=traffic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the wildlife trade monitoring network, strives to monitor the illegal trade of timber and provide expertise in policy and legal reviews.&lt;ref name="traffic.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traffic.org/timber-trade|title=TRAFFIC - Timber trade|work=traffic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale===

It is estimated that illegal logging on public land alone causes losses in assets and revenue in excess of 10 billion USD annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/illegal-logging-market-value/| title= Havocscope Illegal Logging Market Value | accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although exact figures are difficult to calculate, given the illegal nature of the activity, decent estimates show that more than half of the logging that takes place globally is illegal, especially in open and vulnerable areas such as the [[Amazon Basin]],&lt;ref name=GPSilent&gt;{{cite web|title=The Amazon's Silent Crisis: The EU Market and the EUTR|url=http://www.amazoncrisis.org/doc/US/timber_market_eu.pdf|website=amazoncrisis.org|publisher=Green Peace|accessdate=25 August 2015|date=May 2014|quote=Nearly 80% of the area logged in Pará between August 2011 and July 2012 was harvested illegally.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Russia|Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;For further details on illegal logging, see: Duncan Brack and Gavin Hayman (2001) Intergovernmental Actions on Illegal Logging. Royal Institute of International Affairs; Duncan Brack, Gavin Hayman and Kevin Gray (2002) ''Controlling the International Trade in Illegally Logged Timber and Wood Products''. Royal Institute of International Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Available figures and estimates must be treated with caution. Governments tend to underestimate the situation, given that high estimates of illegal logging may cause embarrassment as these suggest ineffective enforcement of legislation or, even worse, [[bribery]] and [[corruption]]. On the other hand, environmental NGOs publish alarming figures to raise awareness and to emphasise the need for stricter conservation measures. For companies in the forestry sector, publications making high estimates can be regarded as potentially threatening for their reputation and their market perspective, including the competitiveness of wood in comparison to other materials. However, for many countries, NGOs are the only source of information apart from state institutions, which probably clearly underestimate the true figures. For example, the Republic of [[Estonia]] calculated a rate of 1% illegally harvested timber in 2003, whereas it was estimated to reach as much as 50% by the NGO "Estonian Green Movement".&lt;ref&gt;Estonian Green Movement (2004) ''Illegal forestry and Estonian timber exports''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Latvia, the situation is comparable; anecdotal evidence points towards 25%&lt;ref&gt;WWF Latvia (2003)&lt;/rev&gt; ''The features of illegal logging and related trade in Baltic Sea region''; WWF International (2002) ''The Timber Footprint of the G8 and China''&lt;/ref&gt; of logging being illegal.

===Consequences===
[[File:Illegallogginginchiangmai.jpg|thumb|Illegal logging continues in Thailand. This photograph was taken from the roadside in Mae Wang District, Chiang Mai Province, in March 2011]]
Illegal logging contributes to [[deforestation]] and by extension [[global warming]], causes [[loss of biodiversity]], and undermines the rule of law. These illegal activities undermine responsible [[forest management]], encourage corruption and tax evasion and reduce the income of the producer countries, further limiting the resources producer countries can invest in [[sustainable development]]. Illegal logging has serious economic and social implications for the poor and disadvantaged with millions of dollars worth of timber revenue being lost each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traffic.org/home/2007/5/25/tanzanias-disappearing-timber-revenue.html|title=TRAFFIC - Wildlife Trade News - Tanzania’s disappearing timber revenue|work=traffic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the [[illegal trade]] of forest resources undermines [[international security]], and is frequently associated with corruption, [[money laundering]], [[organized crime]], [[human rights abuse]]s and, in some cases, violent conflict. In the forestry sector, cheap imports of illegal timber and forest products, together with the non-compliance of some economic players with basic social and environmental standards, destabilise international markets. This [[unfair competition]] affects those European companies, especially the small and medium-sized companies that are behaving responsibly and ready to play by fair rules.

|'''Box 2. Loss of revenue to governments of producer countries '''
|- 
|The scale of illegal logging represents a major loss of revenue to many countries and can lead to widespread associated environmental damage. A senate committee in the Philippines estimated that the country lost as much as US$1.8bn per year during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Callister (1992) ''Illegal tropical timber trade: Asia Pacific. TRAFFIC International''&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian government estimated in 2002 that costs related to illegal logging are US$3bn each year.&lt;ref&gt;ICG (2001) ''Natural Resources and Law Enforcement in Indonesia''&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (2002) ''Revised Forest Strategy’’&lt;/ref&gt; estimates that illegal logging costs timber-producing countries between 10 and 15 billion euros per year. This compares with 10 billion euros disbursed as EC aid in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Annual report 2003 from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the EC Development Policy and the implementation of External Assistance in 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political processes==

=== East Asia ===
[[File:Signs of illegal timber poaching on the boundary of the Mt. Cagua protected area - ZooKeys-266-001-g017.jpg|thumb|Signs of illegal timber poaching on the boundary of the protected area around the [[Cagua Volcano]], [[Cagayan]], Philippines.]]

The East Asia Forest Law Enforcement and Governance ('''EA FLEG''') Ministerial Conference took place in [[Bali]] in September 2001. The Conference brought together nearly 150 participants from 20 countries, representing government, international organizations, NGOs, and the private sector. The event was co-hosted by the [[World Bank]] and the [[Government of Indonesia]]. The meeting included detailed technical discussions of [[Forestry law|forest law]] enforcement in relation to governance, forest policy and forest management as well as ministerial engagement.

The Conference's primary aims were to share analysis on forest law enforcement; explore priority issues of forest law enforcement, including illegal logging in the East Asia region, among senior officials from forest and related ministries, NGOs and industry representatives; and commit to action at the national and regional level.

=== European Union ===
{{main|EU FLEGT Action Plan}}

In May 2003, the [[European Commission]] presented the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Action Plan ('''EU FLEGT'''). This marked the beginning of a long process by which the EU aims to develop and implement measures to address illegal logging and related trade. The primary means of implementing the Plan is through [[Voluntary Partnership Agreement]]s with timber producing countries. The [[European Union Timber Regulation]] was adopted in 2010 and went into effect 3 March 2013.&lt;ref name=ECEUTR&gt;{{cite web|title=Timber Regulation|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/forests/timber_regulation.htm|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=August 25, 2015|quote=Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It prohibits the placing on the EU market for the first time of illegally harvested timber and products derived from such timber;&lt;ref name=ECEUTR /&gt;
* It requires EU traders who place timber products on the EU market for the first time to exercise 'due diligence';&lt;ref name=ECEUTR /&gt;
* Once on the market, the timber and timber products may be sold on and/or transformed before they reach the final consumer.&lt;ref name=ECEUTR /&gt;
* To facilitate the traceability of timber products, economic operators in this part of the supply chain (referred to as traders in the regulation) have an obligation to keep records of their suppliers and customers.&lt;ref name=ECEUTR /&gt;

A Greenpeace investigation published in May 2014 demonstrates that EU Timber Regulation is ineffective if fraudulent paperwork is accepted at face value and there is not sufficient enforcement by EU authorities.&lt;ref name=GPSilent /&gt;

=== Africa ===

The ''Africa Forest Law Enforcement and Governance'' ('''AFLEG''') Ministerial Conference was held in [[Yaoundé]], [[Cameroon]] in October 2003. The meeting drew together ministers and stakeholders from Africa, Europe and North America to consider how partnerships between producers, consumers, donors, civil society and the private sector could address illegal forest exploitation and associated trade in Africa.

The AFLEG conference, the second regional forest law enforcement and governance meeting after East Asia, resulted in endorsement of a ministerial declaration and action plan as well as a variety of informal implementation initiatives.

In 2014, the FAU-EU-FLEGT Programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/eu-flegt/en/|title=EU FAO FLEGT programme|author=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|work=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] published the study ''The Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) process in Central and West Africa: from theory to practice''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) process in Central and West Africa: from theory to practice|date=2014|publisher=FAO|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3731e/i3731e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; to document and foster strategic reflection in partner countries already engaged in negotiating a VPA - or those who will be entering into such negotiations - by providing examples of good practices. These good practices were identified and recorded following interviews with the main stakeholders in the eight VPA countries in West and Central Africa, the European Forest Institute’s (EFI) EU FLEGT Facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euflegt.efi.int/home/|title=Home - EU FLEGT Facility|work=efi.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Commission]]. In 2016, the FAO-EU FLEGT Programme published an additional study, [http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6134e.pdf ''Traceability: a management tool for business and governments''], providing examples of good practices in the region's traceability systems, which help prevent illegal logging by tracking timber from its forest of origin throughout its journey along the supply chain.

=== Saint Petersburg Declaration ===
{{See also|Forest Law Enforcement and Governance Program}}

The ''Europe and North Asia Forest Law Enforcement and Governance'' ('''ENA FLEG''') Ministerial Conference was held in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia on 22–25 November 2005. In May 2004, the [[Russian Federation]] announced its intention to host the ENA FLEG process, supported by the World Bank. A preparatory conference was held in Moscow in June 2005.

The Saint Petersburg conference brought together nearly 300 participants representing 43 governments, the private sector, civil society and international organisations. It agreed to the ''Saint Petersburg Declaration on Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in Europe and North Asia''. The Declaration includes an indicative list of actions, intended to serve as a general framework for possible actions to be undertaken by governments as well as civil society.

The conference took place as the United Kingdom prepared to pass the [[G8]] Presidency to Russia. As Valery Roshchupkin, Head of the [[Federal Forestry Agency of the Russian Federation]], confirmed, illegal logging would be of special importance for Russia as the G8 President and for the following [[G8 Summit]], also held in Saint Petersburg.

===United States===
{{main|Deforestation in the United States}}
In response to growing concerns over illegal logging and advice from [[TRAFFIC]]&lt;ref name="traffic.org1"/&gt; and other organisations,&lt;ref name="traffic.org"/&gt; on May 22, 2008 the U.S. amended the [[Lacey Act of 1900|Lacey Act]], when the [[Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008]] expanded its protection to a broader range of plants and plant products (Section 8204. Prevention of Illegal Logging Practices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khatchadourian |first= Rafi|date=October 6, 2008|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/06/081006fa_fact_khatchadourian?currentPage=all|title=The Stolen Forests: Inside the covert war on illegal logging|work= ''The New Yorker''. |accessdate= July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements under the new Amendments are two-fold. First, the Lacey Act now makes it illegal to import into the United States plants that have been harvested contrary to any applicable Federal Law, State Law, Indian Tribal Law, or Foreign Law. If a plant is found to have been harvested in violation of the laws of the country where it was harvested, that plant would be subject to seizure and forfeiture if imported into the U.S. The Lacey Act also makes it unlawful, beginning December 15, 2008, to import certain plants and plant products without a Plant and Plant Product import declaration.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=USDA APHIS|date=October 26, 2011 |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/lacey_act|title=U.S. Department of Agriculture Lacey Act Guidance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Plant and Plant Product Declaration must contain (besides other information) the Genus, Species, and Country of Harvest of every plant found in commercial shipments of certain products, a list of applicable products (along with other requirements and guidance) can be found on the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service|APHIS]] website.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Australia===

The Timber Development Association (TDA) welcomes on June 6, 2014's release by the Australian Department of Agriculture of a position paper on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Regulation and guidance on how timber and wood products industry can comply on the Australian Government - Department of Agriculture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daff.gov.au/illegallogging|title=Department of Agriculture Illegal Logging|work=daff.gov.au|access-date=2014-07-28|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140805032307/http://www.daff.gov.au/illegallogging|archive-date=2014-08-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; official website. The release of the Government's guidance coincides with the release of industry developed timber due diligence tools and information through the industry website of Timber Due Diligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timberduediligence.com.au|title=Timber Due Diligence|work=timberduediligence.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Illegal Logging Prohibition Regulation applies to importers into Australia of "regulated timber products" such as sawn timber, wood panels, pulp, paper products, and wood furniture. The Regulation starts on 30 November 2014 and requires that before import of these products or processing of raw logs, due diligence is undertaken to minimise the risk that the timber products or raw logs were illegally logged or incorporate illegally logged timber.&lt;ref name="Fordaq"&gt;

Jain [[festival]]s occur on designated days of the year. Jain festivals are either related to life events of [[Tirthankara]] or they are performed with intention of purification of soul.

==Festivals==
There are many religious festivals in [[Jainism]]. Some of them are associated with five auspicious life events of [[Tirthankara]] known as [[Panch Kalyanaka]].&lt;ref name=nsdh&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=203–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paryushana===
{{main|Paryushana}}
[[Image:Das Lakshana (Paryusana) celebrations, New York City Jain temple 1.JPG|thumb|270px|Das Lakshana (Paryusana) celebrations, [[Jain Center of America]], New York City.]]
''[[Paryushana]] Parva'' is one of the most important festival for Jains. Paryusana is formed by two words meaning ‘a year’ and ‘a coming back’. This festival comes in the months of Shravana and Bhadra (August or September). [[Svetambara]] Jains celebrate it for eight-days while [[Digambara]] Jains celebrate it for ten days. It is also known as ''Das Lakshana Parva''. It is a festival of repentance and forgiveness. Many Jains [[Fasting in Jainism|fast]] and carry out different religious activities. [[Jain monks]] stop walking during [[Chaturmas#Jainism|chaturmas]] and reside at one place where they lecture on various religious subjects during paryushana. This festival is believed to remove accumulated karma of the previous year and develop control over new accumulating new karma, by following Jain austerities and other rituals. There are regular rituals at the Jain temples. Discourses of [[Kalpasutra (Jain)|Kalpa Sutra]] are given by monks. [[Kalpasutra (Jain)|Kalpa Sutra]] describes life of [[Mahavira]] and other [[Tirthankara]]s. On the third day, procession of Kalpa Sutra is carried out. On the fifth day, auspicious dreams of [[Trishala]], mother of Mahavira are demonstrated and after that birth of [[Mahavira]] is celebrated. The tenth day of festival is called Anant Chaurdsashi. Anant Chaturdashi is the day when Lord Vasupujya attained moksha(nirvan). Usually, a procession is taken out by Jains on this day. Kshamavani is generally observed a day after Anant Chaturdashi by digambaras,while the shwetambaras observe it after the 8th ie the last day of their paryushan.(last day is called samvatsari)
On Kshamavani, Jains ask for forgiveness from everybody for any acts during the previous year which may have hurt them.

[[File:Om Hrim Siddhi Chakra.jpg|thumb|300px|Om Hrim Siddhi Chakra used by Jains in dravya puja]]
[[Mahavira]] was born on the thirteenth day of the bright half  of the [[Jain calendar]] month of Chaitra, probably  599 BCE. It falls in March or April. This festival marks birth of [[Mahavira]]. Procession is carried out and lectures on message of [[Mahavira]] is presented. The idols of Mahavira is ceremonially bathed and rocked in a [[Bassinet|cradle]]. Events related to birth are also recited from sacred texts by monks.&lt;ref name=nsdh/&gt;

===Diwali===
{{Main|Diwali (Jainism)}}
Diwali is one of the most important festival in [[India]]. Mahavir attained [[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]] followed by [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]] on this day in 527 BCE. It falls on the last day of Ashvina month of [[Jain calendar]]. It is also the last day of [[Bikram Samwat|Indian calendar]]. It comes during October or November. It is believed that the eighteen kings of northern India, followers of [[Mahavira]], decided to light lamps (known as ''dipa'') symbolizing knowledge of [[Mahavira]]. So it is known as Deepavali or Diwali. Jains are forbidden to burst crackers.&lt;ref name=nsdi&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Lord Mahavira in all Jain temples all across the world. Gautam Gandhar Swami, the chief disciple of Lord Mahavira achieved omniscience (Kevala Gyan) later the same day.

===New Year===
After celebrating Diwali at the end of Ashwina, Jains celebrate new year on the first day of the following month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]]. Ritual of ''Snatra Puja'' is performed at the temple.

[[File:Queen Victoria 1887.jpg|thumb|Queen Victoria]]
The parentage of [[Queen Victoria]] has been the subject of speculation.

==Succession crisis==
[[File:Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales.jpg|left|thumb|Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales]] 
[[Princess Charlotte of Wales]] was the only daughter and [[heiress presumptive]] of the [[Prince Regent]] (later [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]). Her death in childbirth in 1817 set off a race between the Prince Regent's brothers, the six surviving younger sons of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], to see who could father a legitimate heir. Some of the brothers had been previously involved in scandals. [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]], the second in line to the throne, was amicably separated from his wife, [[Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia]]. The sixth son, [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]], had contracted two marriages in contravention of the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]] (as had the Prince Regent before his marriage to [[Caroline of Brunswick|Charlotte's mother]]). Three brothers, the third, fourth and seventh in line to the throne, married in 1818: [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Prince William, Duke of Clarence]]; [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]]; and [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge]]. The fifth son, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]], was already married.

The Duke of Clarence married Princess [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]]. Though he had been able to father ten illegitimate children with [[Dorothea Jordan|an earlier mistress]], none of his children by his wife survived childhood. The second daughter, [[William IV of the United Kingdom#Issue|Elizabeth]], lived the longest, being born on 10 December 1820 and dying on 4 March 1821. The next son to produce an heir was the Duke of Cambridge, whose son [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|George]] was born on 26 March 1819. He would be displaced two months later by the birth of a daughter to the Duke of Kent and [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|his wife]]. Their first and only child was called [[Queen Victoria|Princess Alexandrina Victoria]] but was known to her family as "Drina". She was born on 24 May 1819, just three days before the son of the Duke of Cumberland, also called [[George V of Hanover|George]].

Both George III and the Duke of Kent died in January 1820. The Prince Regent became George IV and Drina was third in line to the throne after her uncles, the Duke of York and Duke of Clarence (the future William IV). She would ultimately take the throne as Queen Victoria in 1837.

==Controversy==
[[File:Sir John Conroy, 1st Bt by Henry William Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir John Conroy]] in an 1837 painting by [[Henry William Pickersgill]]
]]
Rumours about Victoria's parentage centred on a controversial [[Irish people|Irish]] soldier and adventurer called [[Sir John Conroy]] who was her mother's private secretary and the [[comptroller]] of her household. The Duchess of Kent was the same age as Conroy, whereas she was nineteen years younger than her husband; the court gossiped openly about their relationship. After the Duke's death Conroy assumed a parental role towards Victoria that she bitterly resented. This caused a near permanent rift between Victoria and her mother, as well as between the Duchess and her brother-in-law, William IV. Conroy expected that when Victoria became queen he would be made her private secretary, but instead one of her first acts as monarch was to dismiss him from her household.

The belief that the Duchess and Conroy were lovers was widespread. When asked by [[Charles Cavendish Fulke Greville|Charles Greville]] whether he believed they were lovers, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] replied that he "supposed so".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher |last=Hibbert |authorlink=Christopher Hibbert |title=Queen Victoria: A Personal History |publisher=De Capo Press |location=|year=2001 |isbn=978-0-306-81085-5 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Duke later recounted a story that when Victoria was young she had caught Conroy and the Duchess engaged in what were diplomatically called "some familiarities".&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Elizabeth|last=Longford |authorlink=Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford|title=Queen Victoria: Born to Succeed |publisher=Pyramid Books |location=New York |year=1965 |asin=B001Q77XAQ|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington reported that she told [[Baroness Louise Lehzen]], who told her close ally, Madame de Späth, who confronted the Duchess about her behaviour. According to Wellington, the Duchess of Kent was furious and promptly dismissed de Späth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Kate|last=Williams|authorlink=Kate Williams (historian) |title=Becoming Queen Victoria: The Tragic Death of Princess Charlotte and the Unexpected Rise of Britain's Greatest Monarch |publisher=Ballatine Books|location=|year=2010 |isbn=978-0-345-46195-7 |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria, when queen, appears to have disputed the story, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented any undue familiarity with Conroy.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
[[A. N. Wilson]] suggested that Victoria's father could not have been the Duke of Kent for two reasons:
* The sudden appearance of [[haemophilia|hæmophilia]] in [[Haemophilia in European royalty|the descendants of Victoria]]. The illness did not exist in the royal family before.
* The supposed disappearance of [[porphyria]] from the descendants of Victoria. According to Wilson, the disease was prevalent in the royal family before Victoria but not afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Wilson, ''The Victorians'' (Hutchinson, 2002). {{ISBN|0-09-179421-8}}, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Both arguments can be countered. Since hæmophilia is [[X-linked]], in order for a father to transmit the condition he must have it himself, but Conroy was healthy. Hæmophiliacs were unlikely to survive in the early nineteenth century, given the poor state of medicine at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Packard, Jerrold (1973).  ''Victoria's Daughters''.  New York: St. Martin's Press, pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, life expectancy was 11 years or younger, even into the later half of the twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/210104-overview Hemophilia Overview] eMedicine from webMD.

Updated: 24 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and is still as low in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Konkle, Barbara A.; Josephson, Neil C.; Nakaya Fletcher, Shelley M.; Thompson, Arthur R.

Seattle, WA: University of Washington; 1993–2013&lt;/ref&gt; Nor is there evidence of hæmophilia in either Conroy's ancestors or descendants, or any mention of any hæmophiliacs in any document associated with the Kents. It is likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because the Duke of Kent was in his 50s when Victoria was conceived; hæmophilia-causing mutations arise more frequently in the children of older fathers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor A. McKusick|McKusick, Victor A.]] (1965) "The Royal Hemophilia", ''Scientific American'', vol. 213, p. 91; [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Jones, Steve]] (1993) ''The Language of the Genes'', London: HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0-00-255020-2}}, p. 69; Jones, Steve (1996) ''In The Blood: God, Genes and Destiny'', London: HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0-00-255511-5}}, p. 270; Rushton, Alan R. (2008) ''Royal Maladies: Inherited Diseases in the Royal Houses of Europe'', Victoria, British Columbia: Trafford, {{ISBN|1-4251-6810-8}}, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt; and spontaneous mutations account for about 30% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hemophilia.org/NHFWeb/MainPgs/MainNHF.aspx?menuid=181&amp;contentid=46&amp;rptname=bleeding|title=Hemophilia B (Factor IX)|publisher=National Hemophilia Foundation|year=2006|accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to porphyria (which famously George III may have had), there is no genetic evidence that the royal family even had the disease and its diagnosis in George III's case (and others) has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Peters, Timothy J. |author2=Wilkinson, D. | year = 2010 | title = King George III and porphyria: a clinical re-examination of the historical evidence | doi = 10.1177/0957154X09102616 | journal=History of Psychiatry | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 3–19 | pmid=21877427}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the diagnosis of hereditary porphyria is correct, it may have continued among descendants of Victoria. At least two of her descendants, [[Princess Charlotte of Prussia|Charlotte, Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen]], and [[Prince William of Gloucester]] are suspected of having suffered from it.&lt;ref&gt;[[John C.

Concrete evidence on the origins of the hæmophilia disease and paternity of Victoria could be achieved with a [[DNA]] test of her or her parents' remains, but no such study has been sanctioned by the Royal Family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Helen |last=Rappaport|title=Queen Victoria: A Biographical Companion|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc |location=Santa Barbara, CA|year=2003 |isbn=978-1-85109-355-7 |ref=harv}} page 195&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Navy 050714-N-9580K-001 Navy Chaplain Dave McBeth, left, leads an informal gathering of personnel aboard Naval Support Activity (NSA) Naples during a Europe-wide coordinated two-minute moment of silence.jpg|thumb|Naples, Italy (July 14, 2005) – Navy Chaplain Dave McBeth, left, leads an informal gathering of personnel aboard Naval Support Activity (NSA) Naples during a Europe-wide coordinated two-minute moment of silence held throughout the [[European Union]] in relation to the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London Bombings]].]]

A '''moment of silence''' is a period of silent [[contemplation]], prayer, reflection, or meditation. Similar to flying a flag at [[half-mast]], a moment of silence is often a gesture of respect, particularly in mourning for those who have died recently or as part of a tragic historical event. It is also sometimes referred to as a '''minute's silence''' or a '''one-minute silence'''.

Silent prayer, including moments of silence practiced during other group activities, have been practised by [[Quakers]] for more than 300 years. Since silence contains no statements or assumptions concerning beliefs and requires no understanding of language to interpret, it is more easily accepted and used than a spoken prayer or observance when persons of different religious and cultural backgrounds participate together. In the colonial period [[Pennsylvania]] Quakers and Americans worshipped silently together on occasions, yet both groups thought that this implied that they had altered their traditional belief system in doing so. Over time, the effectiveness of Quaker-style silence for non-sectarian and non-controversial public observances has led to its almost universal use in the [[English-speaking world]] as well as other plural societies. This is also the case within many institutions where diverse groups are expected to participate but not necessarily share beliefs such as in government, schools, businesses and the military.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

One minute is a common length of time for the commemoration, though other periods of time may be chosen, normally connected in some way with the event being commemorated (there might be a minute given for every death commemorated, for example). During the moment of silence, participants may typically bow their heads, remove hats, and refrain from speaking or moving for the duration.

Many people in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] observe the [[two-minute silence]] at 11:00am on November 11 each year ([[Armistice Day]]) to remember sacrifices of members of the armed forces and of civilians in times of war.

In [[Israel]], moments of silence are held in memory of the victims of [[the Holocaust]] and on Jewish holidays in memory of fallen soldiers and terrorist victims. The moment of silence are marked as a time to live peacefully with other countries.

Moments of silence are often observed prior to sports matches with reasons for silences range from national and international tragedies, to the death of individuals connected to the sport or specific clubs.

==Origins==
{{see also|Two-minute silence}}
The first recorded instance of an official moment of silence dedicated to a person's death took place in Portugal on February 13, 1912. The Portuguese Senate dedicated 10 minutes of silence to [[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco|José Maria da Silva Paranhos Júnior]], baron of [[Rio Branco, Acre|Rio Branco]], Brazil, and Minister of the Exterior of the Brazilian government, who had died three days earlier on February 10. This moment of silence was registered in the Senate's records of that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Debates Parlamentares - Diário 039, p. 2 (1912-02-13)|url = http://debates.parlamento.pt/catalogo/r1/cs/01/01/02/039/1912-02-13/2|website = debates.parlamento.pt|accessdate = 2016-01-01 |quote=O Sr. Presidente: Tenho de cumprir o doloroso dever de comunicar ao Senado o falecimento, no Rio de Janeiro, do Barão do Rio Branco, que ilustrou grandemente o seu nome, tanto pela maneira como dirigiu os negócios diplomáticos do Brasil como pela erudição manifestada nas suas obras, e que muito honrou a sua origem lusitana. (Apoiados gerais). Além disso devemos lembrar-nos de que o Barão do Rio Branco era Ministro do Govêrno que primeiro reconheceu a República Portuguesa. (Apoiados gerais).

Furthermore, we must remember that the baron of Rio Branco was a Minister of the government that first recognized the Portuguese Republic. Thus, in consideration of all these aspects related to this notable figure, I propose that the session be interrupted for 10 minutes, with the Senators remaining on their seats in silence for that period of time. At 14 hours and 45 minutes the session was therefore suspended, reopening at 14 hours and 55 minutes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, large parts of the US kept a ceremonial silence to honour the dead of the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|Maine]] and the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A book of silence|last=Maitland|first=Sara|location=Berkeley,Ca|publisher=Counterpoint|isbn=9781619021426|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy relating to church and school prayer in the United States==
[[File:White House silence return Tucson 2011.jpg|thumb|First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] and President [[Barack Obama]] return to the White House after leading a moment of silence for the victims of the [[2011 Tucson shooting]].]]
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in 1962 that official organization, sponsorship, or endorsement of [[school prayer]] is forbidden by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in public school.  Teachers and school officials may not lead classes in prayer, but prayer is permitted at voluntary religious clubs, and students are not prohibited from praying themselves.  Other rulings have forbidden public, organized prayer at school assemblies, sporting events, and similar school-sponsored activities.

Public moments of silence in the United States both arise from and contribute to this debate over prayer and the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]].  A moment of silence lacks any specific religious formulation, and therefore it has been presented as a way of creating reflection and respect without endorsing any particular sect.

President [[Ronald Reagan]] was a supporter of a moment of silence in American schools. In 1981 Reagan formally [[Ronald Reagan#Prayer in schools and a moment of silence|proposed a constitutional amendment]] permitting organized prayer in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/us/reagan-proposes-school-prayer-amendment.html&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1984 state of the union address, Reagan asked congress, who begin their day with an invocation: "If you can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right here leading you in prayer, then why can't freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land?"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=40205&lt;/ref&gt;
The Lubavitcher rebbe, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] was a strong advocate of a moment of silence every morning in public schools. Citing the many polls as proof that it reduces crime.
[[Colin Powell]], a longtime advocate, has recommended a simple moment of silence at the start of each school day.  Further, he states that students could use this interval to pray, meditate, contemplate or study.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Powel, [http://www.religioustolerance.org/ps_pra6.htm A "MOMENT OF SILENCE" IN PLACE OF PRAYER IN U.S. PUBLIC SCHOOLS]. Religious Tolerance.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, critics often view the moment of silence as publicly endorsing prayer "in disguise".  This issue has been especially raised by [[atheist]]s groups and advocates, who argue that no non-religious purpose is served by designating an official moment of silence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  They point out, for example, that many schools have entire class periods dedicated to silent study, which can equally be used for silent prayer or meditation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Moments of silence point to the tension in the U.S. Constitution and society between accommodation and endorsement.  Accommodation of religion is to ensure an environment where a person or student can practice their religion.  A question with "moments of silence" laws is whether accommodation was already achieved by the fact that a student can pray or meditate on his/her own without an official moment of silence.  Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State said, on a "moment of silence" case, "Students were already allowed to pray, meditate, or reflect under the statute before it was amended.  The addition of the word 'pray' where it wasn't needed clearly shows that legislators intended to promote religion, and that's not their job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.au.org/2009/02/04/moment-of-litigation-mandatory-moment-of-silence-in-texas-schools-faces-court-test/ |title=Moment of Litigation: Mandatory Moment Of Silence In Texas Schools Faces Court Test |publisher=Blog.au.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928151610/http://blog.au.org/2009/02/04/moment-of-litigation-mandatory-moment-of-silence-in-texas-schools-faces-court-test/ |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have stated on these moments of silence cases that a secular purpose is necessary and according to ''Wallace v. Jaffree'', a "statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=472&amp;invol=38 |title=Wallace V.

Although since 1976 the state [[Virginia]] law permitted school districts to implement 60 seconds of silence at the start of each school day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Virginia § 22.1–203 |url=http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+22.1-203 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001021202118/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000%2Bcod%2B22.1-203 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 21, 2000 |publisher=Leg1.state.va.us |accessdate=2012-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1985, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that an [[Alabama]] "moment of silence or voluntary prayer" law was unconstitutional, in the case ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]''. In April 2000, a new law came into being; requiring all Virginian public school students to observe a moment of silence.&lt;ref name="currentevents"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EPF/is_16_100/ai_70362014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211130100/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EPF/is_16_100/ai_70362014 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=February 11, 2006 | title= Gotta Minute? – Virginia enacts minute of silence in schools | work=Current Events |date=January 26, 2001}} &lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 2005, a law was passed in [[Indiana]] requiring all public schools to give students a chance to say the [[pledge of allegiance]] and observe a moment of silence every day.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In October 2007, Illinois enacted legislation to require public schools to provide students with a moment of silence at the start of the school day, a statute that is currently being challenged in Illinois state courts. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Alabama, Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite court |litigants=Bown v. Gwinnett County School District |vol=112 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1464 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |date=1997 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/112/1464/585284/ |accessdate=2017-11-02 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia also require such moments of quiet in the classroom. In more than 20 other states, teachers are allowed to decide whether they want such a classroom time-out.

In October 2000, the U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton ruled that the "moment of silence" law was constitutional.&lt;ref name="currentevents" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_32_117/ai_67492610 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102220028/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_32_117/ai_67492610 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=November 2, 2007 | title=Court upholds Virginia's 'moment of silence' | work=Christian Century |date=November 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Hilton stated, "The court finds that the Commonwealth's daily observance of one minute of silence act is constitutional. The act was enacted for a secular purpose, does not advance or inhibit religion, nor is there excessive entanglement with religion... Students may think as they wish – and this thinking can be purely religious in nature or purely secular in nature. All that is required is that they sit silently."&lt;ref&gt;"Court upholds constitutionality of 'silence' law", Baptist Joint Committee. Report from the Capital, 2000-NOV-7, Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His ruling was upheld in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|4th circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A45861-2001Jul24 | title=Va.

State Senator Charles R. Hawkins (R-Pennsylvania) stated the moment of silence is "a very small measure to address a very large problem." He also said, "Prayer is not a bad word in my vocabulary."  Kent Willis, Executive Director of the ACLU of Virginia, stated lawmakers are "at the very least placing Virginia law right on the line of separation of church and state or they are crossing it . . . the state is playing with fire here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/virginia-senate-oks-schools-moment-silence |title=Virginia Senate OKs Schools' Moment of Silence |publisher=Aclu.org |date=February 1, 2000 |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] was opposed to a proposed constitutional amendment by [[Newt Gingrich]] in the early 1990s which would have set aside a voluntary moment of prayer during the school day, which was later independently described by President [[Bill Clinton]] as a "moment of silence". They considered this stealth endorsement of prayer in school.

'''Ján Kuciak''' (17 May 1990 – 21 February 2018) was a [[Slovak people|Slovak]] [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalist]]. Kuciak worked as a reporter for the news website [[Aktuality.sk]], focused mainly on investigating [[tax fraud]] of several businessmen with connections to top-level Slovak politicians.&lt;ref name=rob&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cameron|first1=Rob|title=Slovakia grapples with murdered journalist's last story|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43226567|accessdate=28 February 2018|agency=BBC|date=28 February 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, were shot dead in February 2018 in their home in [[Veľká Mača]], [[Galanta District]], [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name=First/&gt;

== Background ==
Jan Kuciak was born on 17 May 1990 in the village of [[Štiavnik]] in [[Bytča District]]. He studied and graduated with a masters degree in [[journalism]] at the [[University of Constantine the Philosopher]] in [[Nitra]], where he continued his studies as a post-graduate student in the field of [[Mass media|mass media communication]]. While working on his [[PhD]], he also held a teaching position at the same faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Čunderlíková|first1=Jana|title=Skromný, pracovitý, čestný. Ján Kuciak očami jeho študentov|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/568283/skromny-pracovity-cestny-jan-kuciak-ocami-jeho-studentov/?AT=wgt.article_clanok-podclankom.c.x...B.|accessdate=8 March 2018|agency=Aktuality.sk|date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later started to work for the newspaper ''[[Hospodárske noviny]]'', before taking up a position in the editorial office of Aktuality.sk, primarily as an investigative journalist. He focused in particular on [[tax evasion]], including cases related to the ruling [[Direction - Social Democracy]] party headed by Prime Minister Robert Fico. He had previously written about companies with unclear ownership as well as suspected systemic embezzlement from [[European Union]] funds.&lt;ref name="muckrack"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Editorial Board|title=A muckraking journalist is murdered in Slovakia|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-muckraking-journalist-is-murdered-in-slovakia/2018/03/07/96a42c32-2174-11e8-86f6-54bfff693d2b_story.html|accessdate=9 March 2018|agency=[[The Washington Post]]|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last article published before his death, on 9 February 2018, he wrote about businessman [[Marián Kočner]], who first became known in Slovakia in 1998 due to his unsuccessful attempt to take over the private television news network [[TV Markíza]] with the help of the [[Slovenská informačná služba|State Intelligence Service]] (SIS). Kuciak had previously detailed in his articles how Kočner was involved in an elaborate [[VAT]] tax fraud scheme. According to Kuciak's investigation, Kočner was buying and selling luxury apartments to himself, sometimes at the symbolic rate of €1, defrauding the state of substantial tax revenue. Kočner then allegedly began to threaten Kuciak and his family. Kuciak filed a criminal complaint against Kočner in September 2017, but according to Kuciak, no police officer was assigned to the case in 44 days since the complaint was made.&lt;ref name=First/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATED: Marches for murdered journalist will be on Friday|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20770091/marches-for-murdered-journalist-will-be-on-friday.html|accessdate=8 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assassination ==
At the time of his death, Kuciak was 27 years old. He lived in the village of Veľká Mača, about 65&amp;nbsp;km (40 miles) east of the capital [[Bratislava]]. On the morning of 26 February, police were called to his home by family members after the couple had not answered phone calls for more than four days.&lt;ref name="shock"&gt;{{cite news|title=Slovakia shocked by killing of journalist and partner|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43202124|accessdate=1 March 2018|agency=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuciak's fiancée, Martina Kusnirova, usually spoke with her mother on a daily basis. Her mother stated that she last spoke with her daughter in the afternoon of 21 February. When she tried to contact her again that evening, there was no reply. The family stated that Kusnirova's cellphone appeared to switch off three days later, probably due to a dead battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cermakova|first1=Judita|title=Bratia zastrelenej Martiny: Namiesto svadby vybavujeme pohreb|url=https://presov.korzar.sme.sk/c/20769263/bratia-zastrelenej-martiny-namiesto-svadby-vybavujeme-pohreb.html|accessdate=14 March 2018|agency=Korzar}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Police entering the house found Kuciak and Kušnírová shot dead. Kuciak had been shot twice in the chest, while Kušnírová had been shot once in the head from the front. Both were shot at close range with a [[9 mm caliber]] handgun. There was no evidence of a struggle and nothing appeared to have been stolen. Police found two empty cartridges at the crime scene as well as several unused bullets.&lt;ref name=circum/&gt; The murders were initially believed to have been committed sometime between February 22 and 25,&lt;ref name="First"&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATED: Investigative journalist killed in his house|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20768866/investigative-journalist-and-fiancee-killed-in-their-house.html|accessdate=1 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were subsequently suspected to have taken place in the evening of February 21.&lt;ref name="circum"&gt;{{cite news|title=Circumstances indicate that Kuciak’s and Kušnírová’s deaths were a contract killing|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20790208/circumstances-indicate-that-kuciaks-and-kusnirovas-deaths-were-a-contract-killing.html?ref=av-right|accessdate=28 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The murders sent shockwaves throughout Slovakia.&lt;ref name=shock/&gt; The day after the news broke, gatherings were held around the country in tribute. Candles were lit at the [[SNP Square (Bratislava)|Slovak National Uprising Square]] in Bratislava and in front of the editorial office of Aktuality.sk, where Kuciak worked. Similar gatherings were also organised in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] cities of [[Prague]] and [[Brno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slovaks and Czechs pay tribute to the murdered journalist|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20769513/slovaks-and-czechs-pay-tribute-to-the-murdered-journalist.html|accessdate=1 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Andrej Kiska stated that he was "shocked and horrified that something like this happened in Slovakia".&lt;ref name=First/&gt; The President of the European Parliament, [[Antonio Tajani]], called on Slovakia to launch a thorough investigation, offering international support if needed, adding that "the [[European Parliament]] will not rest until justice is done".&lt;ref name="Jason"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rezaian|first1=Jason|title=Police believe a journalist was killed for reporting on fraud in the heart of Europe|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/26/police-believe-a-journalist-was-killed-for-reporting-on-fraud-in-the-heart-of-europe/|accessdate=9 March 2018|agency=[[The Washington Post]]|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ringier AG|Ringier Axel Springer]], the parent company of Aktuality.sk, called the murders a "cruel assassination", vowing to redouble their journalistic efforts.&lt;ref name=shock/&gt;

=== Protests ===
[[File:Bratislava protest.jpg|thumb|For decent Slovakia protest in Bratislava, 16 March 2018]]
On Friday, 2 March, up to 25,000 people protested in Bratislava against the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deloire: Bratislava is the capital of press freedom today|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20772206/deloire-bratislava-is-today-the-capital-of-press-freedom.html|accessdate=4 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 March, protests were held in 48 towns and cities in Slovakia as well as 17 other cities around the world. In Bratislava alone, about 60,000 people held a protest march, the biggest turnout of any demonstration since the [[Velvet Revolution]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zažili sme najväčšie protesty od roku 1989|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/571169/online-protesty-po-vrazde-jana-kuciaka-a-martiny-kusnirovej/|accessdate=9 March 2018|agency=Aktuality.sk|date=9 March 2018|language=Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were endorsed by several universities in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, teachers, school associations, artists and non-governmental organisations. 21 universities cancelled afternoon lectures to allow students and employees to attend the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enough of Fico, thousands of people shouted at gatherings across Slovakia|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20777059/enough-of-fico-thousands-of-people-shouted-at-gatherings-across-slovakia.html|accessdate=9 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk|ref=2march}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two days after Prime Minister Fico's resignation, an even larger demonstration was held in Bratislava with over 65,000 people participating under slogans such as "Enough of Smer" and "Early elections". Former Speaker of Parliament and ex-presidential candidate [[František Mikloško]] made an impassioned speech during the protest saying that "the revolution started by the parents has to be finished by their children". He argued that only twice in the history of post-war [[Czechoslovakia]] have popular protests managed to make the government resign: in November 1989 and now, adding that "when somebody tries to abuse their power in the future, they should remember March 2018 and the mass protests". Mikloško's speech was accompanied by the ringing of keys, reminiscent of the Velvet Revolution in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enough of Smer, people chanted in streets|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20782425/enough-of-smer-people-chanted-in-streets.html|accessdate=17 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk|date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
In a press conference the same morning, [[Police of Slovakia|Slovak Police]] President [[Tibor Gašpar]] stated that the murders "likely have something to do with [Kuciak’s] investigative activities".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boffey|first=Daniel|title=Slovakian journalist investigating claims of tax fraud linked to ruling party shot dead|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/slovakian-journalist-investigating-claims-of-tax-linked-to-ruling-party-shot-dead|accessdate=26 February 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigative journalist Jan Kuciak killed in Slovakia|url=http://www.dw.com/en/investigative-journalist-jan-kuciak-killed-in-slovakia/a-42745005|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=2018-02-26 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Janicek|first=Karel|title=Slovak investigative reporter, girlfriend found shot dead|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/slovak-investigative-reporter-his-girlfriend-killed/2018/02/26/6b9fec6e-1adb-11e8-98f5-ceecfa8741b6_story.html|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fico's Third Cabinet|Government of Slovakia]] offered €1 million for information leading to the murderers. Prime Minister [[Robert Fico]] made the announcement during a press conference with Interior Minister [[Robert Kaliňák]] and Police President Tibor Gašpar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jan Kuciak murder: Slovak PM offers €1m reward in appeal|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43220275|accessdate=1 March 2018|agency=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the press conference, described by critics as "surreal"&lt;ref name=rob/&gt; and "bizarre",&lt;ref name=muckrack/&gt; they displayed packs of banknotes amounting to one million euros, which the government promised to give to anyone who came forward with relevant information that could help explain the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fico stands by Trošková|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20770106/fico-stands-by-troskova.html|accessdate=1 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Prime Minister Fico announced the creation of an inter-agency task force involving employees of the General Prosecutor’s Office, Special Prosecutor’s Office, the Interior Ministry and the SIS in attempting to solve the case.&lt;ref name=First/&gt;

At the time of his murder, Kuciak was working on a report about Slovak connections with the [[Italy|Italian]] [[organized crime syndicate]] [['Ndrangheta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20769558/kuciak-investigated-links-between-politicians-and-mafia.html|title=Kuciak investigated links between politicians and mafia|first=Petit Press |last=a.s.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously reported on organized tax fraud involving businesspeople close to the ruling [[Smer-SD]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kuciak investigated links between politicians and mafia|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20769558/kuciak-investigated-links-between-politicians-and-mafia.html|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February, Aktuality.sk published Kuciak's last, unfinished story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuciak|first1=Ján|title=Talianska mafia na Slovensku.

=== Initial arrests ===
On 1 March, four days after the discovery of the murders, heavily armed units from the Slovak Police Corps' elite National Crime Agency (NAKA) raided several locations in eastern Slovakia, in the cities of [[Michalovce]] and [[Trebišov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jabrik|first1=Peter|title=Polícia udrela na východe.

Among other offences, he was said to have been planning to import large quantities of cocaine from South America. On 23 April, Slovakia approved Italy's request for extradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slovakia to extradite Vadala to Italy for prosecution|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20810188/slovakia-to-extradite-vadala-to-italy-for-prosecution.html|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of their investigation into the murder, the Slovak police stated that Kuciak had been murdered because of his work as an investigative journalist, and that the murder had been ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20768704/reportera-jana-kuciak-zavrazdili-v-jeho-dome.html|title=Investigatívneho reportéra Jána Kuciaka zavraždili, zrejme v súvislosti s jeho prácou|last=a.s.|first=Petit Press|work=domov.sme.sk|access-date=2018-09-28|language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-svet/identikit-vrazda-na-objednavku-jan-kuciak_1809171354_lac|title=Prokuratura: Jána Kuciaka zavraždili kvůli práci.

== Political crisis ==
The same day the murder was announced, Prime Minister Fico called on the political opposition not to "exploit" the situation.&lt;ref name=First/&gt; Meanwhile, a number of opposition politicians accused the ruling Smer-SD party of indirect involvement. Member of Parliament Veronika Remišová, from the opposition [[Ordinary People (Slovakia)|OĽaNO]] party, compared the killings to the infamous murder of [[Róbert Remiáš]], a police officer who was assassinated in 1996, in an act widely believed to have been a contract killing by the [[Slovak mafia]] on the orders of Prime Minister [[Vladimír Mečiar]].&lt;ref name="remias"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fico odmieta zneužívanie tragickej vraždy Kuciaka na politický boj|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20768892/politici-odsudili-vrazdu-investigativneho-novinara-kuciaka.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=Sme.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February, [[Freedom and Solidarity]] and OL'aNO demanded the resignation of Interior Minister Robert Kaliňák and Police President Tibor Gašpar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opozícia spúšťa petíciu za odstúpenie Kaliňáka a policajného šéfa|url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20769995/olano-a-sas-obvinuju-politikov-smeru-z-napojenie-na-taliansku-mafiu.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=SME.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VENUES OF BRATISLAVA SUMMIT 16.September 2016 (29073567594).jpg|thumb|Interior Minister [[Robert Kaliňák]] speaking with Prime Minister [[Robert Fico]] ]]

The crisis escalated on 4 March when President Kiska made a live broadcast on state television, warning the government against further polarising the country. He called for either a "radical cabinet reshuffle" or a [[snap election]].&lt;ref name="early"&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATED: Fico won't step down, accuses Kiska of joining opposition|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20773344/kiska-government-reshuffle-or-early-elections.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president's speech infuriated Fico, who accused Kiska of "joining the opposition".&lt;ref name=early/&gt; Furthermore, he accused the president of conspiring with Hungarian-American billionaire [[George Soros]] in the planning of a [[coup d'etat]], based on the fact that President Kiska met with Soros at Soros' apartment in [[New York City]] in September 2017, ostensibly to discuss issues related to the [[Romani people|Roma minority]].&lt;ref name="soros"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fico steers conversation to Soros, saying he will deal with politics later|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20774275/fico-mentions-soros-says-he-will-deal-with-politics-later.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February, two days after the news of Kuciak's murder broke, Minister of Culture [[Marek Maďarič]] announced his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vražda Kuciaka: Jasaň a Trošková opustí úřad vlády, ministr kultury Maďarič odstoupil|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/svet/2404909-slovensky-ministr-kultury-madaric-odstoupil-k-demisi-se-rozhodl-kvuli-vrazde-kuciaka|publisher=ČT24|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announcing his decision to the press, Madaric stated that "as a culture minister, I can't cope with the fact that a journalist was killed during my tenure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balogova|first1=Beata|title=Maďarič zrušil Fica aj jeho refrén|url=https://komentare.sme.sk/c/20770729/madaric-zrusil-fica-a-jeho-refren-ze-niet-dovodov-na-zodpovednost.html|accessdate=28 February 2018|agency=SME}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Culture Minister Maďarič resigns|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20770743/culture-minister-madaric-resigns.html|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Kaliňák]], Minister of the Interior and Deputy Prime Minister, resigned on 12 March 2018 after weeks of mounting pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dedinský|first1=Matej|title=Minister Kaliňák podáva demisiu|url=https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/571728/minister-kalinak-podava-demisiu/|publisher=Aktuality.sk|language=Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Most-Hid]] party, the junior coalition partner in the government, had demanded the resignation of Kalinak in exchange for continued support of Smer-SD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Slovakia journalist murder: Interior minister resigns|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43371821|accessdate=12 March 2018|agency=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Most-Hid joined the calls for snap elections, announcing that it would leave the government if it failed to reach a deal with its two coalition partners, Smer-SD and the [[Slovak National Party]] (SNS). Most-Híd Chairman, [[Béla Bugár]], announced the decision after an eight-hour session of the Most-Hid Republican Council, the party's decision-making body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most-Híd calls for early elections|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20779611/most-hid-calls-for-early-elections.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=Spectator.sme.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fico resigns ===

On 14 March, following a meeting with President Kiska, Prime Minister Fico announced that he would resign as Prime Minister to avoid [[Next Slovak parliamentary election|early elections]] and "solve the political crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terenzani|first1=Michaela|title=UPDATED: Fico is ready to resign tomorrow|url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20781295/fico-is-ready-to-resign-tomorrow.html|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting, Fico laid out a number of specific conditions to be met by the President in order for him to resign, including that the result of the [[Slovak parliamentary election, 2016|2016 Slovak parliamentary election]] be respected, that the current ruling government coalition must continue, and that Smer-SD, as the largest party in parliament, would name the next Prime Minister. Fico stated that he already had a candidate in mind, widely reported in Slovak media as Deputy Prime Minister [[Peter Pellegrini]].&lt;ref name="Pellegrini"&gt;{{cite news|title=Minúta po minúte: Fico podá demisiu, novým premiérom môže byť Pellegrini |url=https://domov.sme.sk/c/20780574/online-vladna-kriza-pokracuje.html?ref=st-bno-1|accessdate=14 March 2018|agency=Sme.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March, President Kiska formally accepted the resignation of Fico and his cabinet, and tasked Pellegrini with the forming of a new government.&lt;ref name=Newpm/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1983">A '''[[referendum]] on [[electoral reform]]''' was supposed to be held in the [[province (Canada)|province]] of '''[[New Brunswick]]''', [[Canada]] on '''May 12, 2008'''.  The date was announced by [[Premier of New Brunswick|Premier]] [[Bernard Lord]] on June 20, 2006 in announcing his response to the 2004 report of the [[Commission on Legislative Democracy]]. However, Lord and his [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Progressive Conservatives]] were defeated in the [[New Brunswick general election, 2006|September 2006 election]] and the new [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberal]] government, which had always expressed skepticism about the model proposed by the Commission and its mandate opted not proceed with a referendum in an announcement on June 28, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/news/ex/2007e0859ex.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was on a [[mixed member proportional representation]] system which would see 36 members elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] in [[first past the post]] single member [[Riding (division)|riding]]s and 20 additional members elected from 4 regions, using closed lists, to ensure proportionality. The threshold for proportional representation seats would be 5% of the provincial vote.

In October 2010, after the 2010 New Brunswick election, the group [[New Brunswickers For Proportional Representation]] was formed to push for the implementation of proportional representation as outlined by the Commission on Legislative Democracy.

"'''Plush'''" is a song by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Stone Temple Pilots]]. It is one of the band's biggest hits, and was released as the second single from the band's 1992 debut studio album, ''[[Core (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Core]]''.

==Composition and inspiration==
The song's chord structure was inspired by Robert DeLeo's love of [[ragtime]] music, and its lyrics were loosely based on a newspaper article Scott Weiland had read about a girl who had been found dead after having been kidnapped in the early 1990s. Weiland had also said that the song's lyrics are a metaphor for a failed relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Prato |first=Greg |date=2012-06-13 |title=Plush |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/plush-stone-temple-pilots |magazine=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The song was released in 1992 as ''Core'''s second single and became a major rock radio hit in the U.S., peaking at #1 on the [[Album Rock Tracks]] and #9 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]]. The song was also one of the first alternative rock songs to reach the #1 spot on the [[Album Rock Tracks]] chart during height of the alternative rock/grunge scene. "Plush" won in the category of "[[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]]" at the [[Grammy Awards of 1994|1994 Grammy Awards]]. The music video also earned the band an [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist]] in 1993. "Plush" remains one of the biggest rock hits of the 1990s, and is still commonly heard on radio stations today. The song also was voted #12 on the [[Australians|Australian]] annual music poll [[Triple J Hottest 100]] in [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1993|1993]]. In 2004, this song was featured in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' soundtrack on [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack#Radio X|Radio X]]. The song also appeared as a playable song in the music video games ''[[Rock Band 3]]'' and ''[[Power Gig: Rise of the SixString]]'' in addition to the VH1 series ''[[Hindsight (TV series)|Hindsight]]''.

==Music video==

The award-winning [[music video]], directed by [[Josh Taft]], was released in 1993 and had heavy rotation on [[MTV]]. It combines a visual interpretation of the song's lyrics with footage of a red-haired Weiland singing with the band as a lounge act in an empty bar. There are two different versions of this video, with minor but very noticeable differences. For example, in the version that appears on the ''[[Thank You (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Thank You]]'' Bonus DVD, the last shot of the video is a woman looking at a mirror image of herself and viewing her whole body while the mirror image drifts away. In another version, she's looking at a mirror image of her face, with water (possibly rain) dripping down the reflection of the mirror.

==Acoustic version==
Weiland and Stone Temple Pilots guitarist [[Dean DeLeo]] performed an impromptu acoustic version of "Plush" on the [[MTV]] show ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' in 1992. The recording was originally only available on a CD single from the United Kingdom for their single, "[[Creep (Stone Temple Pilots song)|Creep]]", and on the German promotional radio release "Plush (unplushed)", but it was not officially released anywhere else until it appeared on the band's 2003 "greatest hits" compilation, ''[[Thank You (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Thank You]]'', alongside the original studio recording. Like its original version, it also became a big hit to rock and alternative radio stations in 2003 (despite not charting on any U.S. or international charts) although it had moderate airplay when the original version had heavy airplay on radio at the time. A rare first take of the same acoustic version on MTV's Headbangers Ball was also available, but it was only found as a B-side to the rare "[[Crackerman]]" single. This version was notable for being a longer version of the one which appeared on "Thank You". It has the same length and processing as the original electric version, and also uses the last part of the original electric version. Although most radio stations play the original acoustic version, few radio stations also managed to play the rare acoustic version.

==Track listing==
#"Plush" [Edit] – 4:19
#"Sin" – 6:05
#"Sex Type Thing (Swing Type Version)" – 4:20
#"Sex Type Thing (Live on the Word)" – 3:32

'''''Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World''''' is a 1998 [[direct-to-video|straight-to-video]] sequel to the 1995 [[Disney]] film ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''. While the first film dealt with her meeting with John Smith and the arrival of the British settlers in Jamestown, the sequel focuses on Pocahontas's journey to England with John Rolfe to negotiate for peace between the two nations, although her death is omitted from the film's ending.

==Plot==
In London, [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] is ambushed by a group of soldiers with a warrant for his arrest and presumed dead in the ensuing confrontation; [[John Ratcliffe (governor)|Governor Ratcliffe]] has lied to [[James VI and I|King James]] (being a personal friend of the King) and framed Smith as the traitor from the first film in a plot to declare war against the [[Powhatan]] Nation and get ahold of the gold he still believes them to possess, all while avoiding punishment for his own crimes. In order to prevent this, the King sends a young diplomat, [[John Rolfe]], to bring [[Chief Powhatan]] to England for negotiations. In the New World, [[Pocahontas (character)|Pocahontas]], Powhatan's daughter, mourns John Smith's death but is eventually able to move on. John Rolfe soon arrives, greeted by English civilians (who by now have settled in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]) and a curious Pocahontas. Rolfe eventually speaks with Powhatan, but he refuses to accompany him to England, so Pocahontas goes in her father's stead, believing that she can bring about peace between the two nations. Powhatan sends a bodyguard, Uttamatomakkin (Uti) to accompany Pocahontas. Rolfe and Pocahontas have a rocky start, but gradually warm up to each other.

In England, Rolfe leaves Pocahontas at his mansion and meets with King James and [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]], but James refuses to meet with Pocahontas despite Rolfe's pleas. Instead, per Ratcliffe's suggestion, James invites both Rolfe and Pocahontas to an upcoming ball and promises that if Pocahontas impresses him by acting "civilised", he will prevent the armada from sailing to Jamestown, but if she does not, he will declare war. Knowing that Ratcliffe deliberately manipulated the King, Rolfe and his maid, Mrs. Jenkins, educate Pocahontas in the ways of British etiquette to prepare her. At the ball, Pocahontas wins over the King and Queen with flattery and almost manages to prevent war, but a bear-baiting arranged by Ratcliffe and greatly enjoyed by the snobbish nobility infuriates Pocahontas and she openly accuses the King of savage behaviour. James angrily orders Pocahontas and Uti imprisoned in the Tower of London, and declares war on the Powhatan tribe.

At his home, a despondent Rolfe is approached by a hooded stranger who helps him break Pocahontas and Uti out of the tower and take them to an inn, where the man reveals himself to be John Smith. Smith implores Pocahontas to stay hidden with him, but she instead takes Rolfe's advice and decides to try and stop the war one last time. She openly confronts the King in the palace and reveals Smith, thus proving that Ratcliffe had been lying the entire time. Realizing Ratcliffe's treachery, James sends a battalion (consisting of Pocahontas, Smith, Rolfe, Uti, and their animal friends) to stop the armada. They are successful in stopping the ships before they can set sail, but Ratcliffe refuses to give up and tries to kill Pocahontas. Smith appears and fights Ratcliffe one-on-one until Ratcliffe draws a gun, but before he can fire, Rolfe sends him overboard with the ship's mast. Ratcliffe makes it back to the port, where he is arrested by the King.

Smith receives a royal pardon and his own ship from the King as a sign of apology. Pocahontas and Rolfe, meanwhile, appear on the verge of admitting that they love each other. Before they can, Smith appears and implores Pocahontas to accompany him on his new journeys around the world, but Pocahontas chooses otherwise and she and Smith part ways as friends. As Pocahontas later prepares to return to Jamestown, she finds Rolfe waiting for her on the ship, having chosen to go and live with her in Jamestown (with Uti remaining in London in his stead). They kiss as the ship sails into the sunset.

==Cast==

== Reception ==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an [[approval rating]] of 29% based on 7 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 4.4/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pocahontas_ii_journey_to_a_new_world/|title=Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Keyes from ''Cinemaphile'' rated the movie with 3/4 saying: "Normally, I'd refuse to review such a sequel, but this attention must be paid here, because the original "''Pocahontas''" movie was not that great. Usually, a Disney sequel jumps back a step or two from its predecessors, as it did with "''Aladdin''". "''Pocahontas II: Journey To A New World''" does not&amp;ndash;it stays at the same level of the original, by creating entertaining and colorful new characters which have usually been the best things about Disney animated movies." Keyes went on to criticize the historical inaccuracy of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keyes |first=David |title=Pocahontas II |url=http://www.cinemaphile.org/reviews/1998/pocahontas2.html |publisher=Cinemaphile |date=September 2, 1998 |accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Movie Report'' rates the movie with 2 out of 4 stars writing: "While ''Journey to a New World'' is the best of the crop of Disney's direct-to-video animation sequels, it's still a slapdash effort, with none of gorgeous colors and animation of the first film, and little of its emotional resonance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World|url=http://themoviereport.com/movierpt38.html#poca2|publisher=The Movie Report|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4033">'''Queshuachaca''' (possibly from [[Quechua language|Quechua]] ''q'iswa'' a rope of twisted dried maguey or [[Jarava ichu|ichhu]], ''chaka'' bridge,&lt;ref name=laime/&gt;&lt;ref name=simi/&gt; "rope bridge", also spelled ''Keshwa Chaca, Q'iswa Chaca, Keswachaka, Q'eshwachaka, Qeswachaka, Q'eswachaca, Q'eswachaka, Queshuachaca, Queswachaka''), consisting of ropes made of grass and spanning the [[Apurimac River]] near Huinchiri, in [[Quehue District]], [[Canas Province]], [[Peru]], is the last remaining [[Inca rope bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/world_of_wonders/2011/02/the_last_incan_grass_bridge.html "The Last Incan Grass Bridge"], Joshua Foer, Feb. 22, 2011, slate.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there is a modern bridge nearby, the residents of the region keep the ancient tradition and skills alive by renewing the bridge annually, in June. Several family groups have each prepared a number of grass-ropes to be formed into cables at the site, others prepare mats for decking, and the reconstruction is a communal effort. In ancient times the effort would have been a form of tax, with participants coerced to perform the rebuilding; nowadays the builders have indicated that effort is performed to honor their ancestors and the [[Mama Pacha|Pachamama]] (Earth Mother). 

The event has also been supported by video productions for [[Nova (TV series)|Nova]] and the [[BBC]] and is the subject of an independent documentary titled ''The Last Bridge Master'' (in-production, 2014). It is becoming a minor tourist attraction, with some small tolls charged for tourists to use the road during the festival to walk the newly completed bridge. In 2009 the government recognized the bridge and its maintenance as part of the cultural heritage of Peru, and there is now some outside sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.co.nz/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://globedia.com/inc-declara-patrimonio-cultural-inmaterial-puente-eswachaka-cusco&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DDeclara%2BPatrimonio%2BCultural%2Bde%2Bla%2BNaci%25C3%25B3n%2Bal%2Britual%2Bde%2Breconstrucci%25C3%25B3n%2Bdel%2Bpuente%2BQ%2527eswachaka,%2Bdel%2Bdistrito%2Bde%2BQuehue,%2Bprovincia%2Bde%2BCanas,%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Dactive%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3Dezm%26tbo%3Dd%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7k0GUZG1OauUiQf8_4C4BQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ7gEwAg (automated translation)] of http://globedia.com/inc-declara-patrimonio-cultural-inmaterial-puente-eswachaka-cusco&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quneitra''' (also '''Al Qunaytirah''', '''Qunaitira''', or '''Kuneitra'''; {{lang-ar|القنيطرة}} ''al-Qunayṭrah''){{Pronunciation needed}} is the largely destroyed and abandoned [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Quneitra Governorate]] in south-western [[Syria]]. It is situated in a high valley in the [[Golan Heights]] at an elevation of 1,010&amp;nbsp;metres (3,313&amp;nbsp;feet)&lt;ref name="bromiley"/&gt; above sea level. Since 1974, pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 350]] and the [[Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria|Agreement on Disengagement]] between [[Israel]] and Syria, the city is inside the [[United Nations|UN]]-patrolled the [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force|buffer zone]].

Quneitra was founded in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]] as a way station on the caravan route to [[Damascus]] and subsequently became a garrison town of some 20,000 people. In 1946, it became part of the independent Syrian Republic within the Riff Dimashq Governorate and in 1964 became the capital of the split Quneitra Governorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/usy.html|title=Syria Provinces|website=www.statoids.com|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 1967, the last day of the [[Six-Day War]], Quneitra came under Israeli control.&lt;ref&gt;On 10 June, Israeli authorities utilized a [[postmark]], in Arabic, English and Hebrew, for mail sent from Quneitra.

The city was almost completely destroyed before the Israeli withdrawal in June 1974. Syria had refused to rebuild the city and actively discouraged resettlement in the area.

In 2004, its population was estimated at 153 persons, with some 4,000 more living in the surrounding areas of the former city. 

Between 2014 and July 2018 Quneitra was ''[[de facto]]'' controlled by the [[Southern Front (Syrian rebel group)|Southern Front]]. By the end of July, 2018, Syrian Government forces regained control over the city.&lt;ref name=syriahr2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuter2018/&gt;

Qantara is the Arabic word for arched bridge.&lt;ref name="Rajki"&gt;András Rajki, [https://archive.org/download/ArabicEtymologicalDictionary  Arabic Dictionary with etymologies], 2005, accessed 5 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Syria Gate: all about Syria (official government website) |url= http://www.syriagate.com/Syria/about/cities/Quneitra/ |accessdate= 2009-11-19 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221221152/http://www.syriagate.com/Syria/about/cities/Quneitra/ |archivedate= 2008-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quneitra means small arch or bridge, and the name is derived from the small-arches bridge around which the town has been built.&lt;ref&gt;Ahron Bregman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ew1PAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT84  Cursed Victory: A History of Israel and the Occupied Territories], Penguin, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political status==
{{Further information|International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict}}
Quneitra is the capital of the [[Quneitra Governorate]], a district of southwestern Syria that incorporates the whole of the Golan Heights. The city of Quneitra is within the portion of the Golan Heights controlled by Syria.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; [[Madinat al-Baath]] (Baath City), also known as New Quneitra, replaced Quneitra as the administrative centre of Quneitra Governorate.&lt;ref name=reuters20141120&gt;{{cite news |title=Syrian insurgents attack government-held town near Israel |first=Suleiman |last=Al-Khalidi |url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/11/20/uk-mideast-crisis-south-idUKKCN0J422U20141120 |newspaper=Reuters |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and demographics==
[[File:Golan heights rel89-orig.jpg|right|thumb|Map of the Golan Heights as of 1989, illustrating the location of Quneitra and the surrounding area.]]
Quneitra is situated in a high valley in the Golan Heights at an altitude of {{convert|942|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. It is overshadowed to the west by the Israeli-held portion of the Golan Heights and the peak of [[Mount Bental|Har Bental]]. The surrounding area is dominated by ancient volcanic lava flows interspersed by a number of dormant [[volcanic cone]]s which rise some {{convert|150|to|200|m|abbr=off}} above the surrounding plain. The volcanic hills of the region have played a key role as observation points and natural firing positions in the conflicts over the region, most notably in the Yom Kippur War.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Dunstan. ''The Yom Kippur War 1973: The Sinai'', p. 9. Osprey Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|1-84176-220-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more peaceful times, the fertile volcanic soil has supported agricultural activities such as [[wheat]] growing and [[pastoralism]].&lt;ref name="bromiley"&gt;Geoffrey William Bromiley. "Golan", in ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J'', p. 520. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8028-3782-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing during the inter-war period, the American traveller Harriet-Louise H. Patterson recorded that Quneitra was

{{quote|charmingly set in a grove of [[eucalyptus]] trees. Its chief claim to charm or the few moments of a traveller's time beyond passport formalities is the beautiful vista which it offers of Jordan as it flows down from Hermon through banks of tangled bush and flowering pink and white oleanders. Kuneitra is pleasant as a stopping-place for lunch. It is cool under the spreading trees, usually quiet and restful.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet-Louise H. Patterson, ''Around The Mediterranean With My Bible''. W. A. Wilde Co., 1941&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The city's position on an important trade route gave it a varied population for much of its history. By the start of the 20th century it was dominated by Muslim [[Circassians in Syria|Circassian]]s from the [[Caucasus]], accompanied by [[Syrian Turkmen|Turkmen]] and [[Arabs]].&lt;ref name="Chatty112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="t24 turkmen"/&gt;  Its population grew to some 21,000 people, mostly [[Arab]]s, followed by [[Syrian Turkmen|Turkmen]] and [[Circassians]], following Syrian [[French Mandate of Syria|independence from France]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="t24 turkmen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/suriyenin-turkmenleri-ne-zaman-geldiler-nufuslari-ne-kadar-hangi-bolgelerdeler,319482|publisher=[[T24 (media)|T24]]|title=Suriye'nin Türkmenleri: Ne zaman geldiler, nüfusları ne kadar, hangi bölgelerdeler?|date=8 December 2015|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://haberiniz.com.tr/haber/gundem/161836/suriye-turkmenleri-4.html|publisher=Haberiniz|title=Suriye Türkmenleri|date=3 July 2015|accessdate=19 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126133049/http://haberiniz.com.tr/haber/gundem/161836/suriye-turkmenleri-4.html|archivedate=26 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its abandonment in 1967 and subsequent destruction, its population was dispersed to other parts of Syria. The city remains abandoned apart from a residual Syrian security presence.  Due to frequent and large population movements within Syria and across borders caused by war, there are no reliable population estimates available post-2011. The impact of the crisis has led to massive displacements and a gradual deterioration of access to basic services. Quneitra has also been the destination for many internally displaced persons (IDPs) from neighbouring Daraa and Rif Dimashq governorates. In August 2013, many of the estimated 75,000 IDPs from Nawa and Al-Harra in Daraa Governorate reportedly fled to Quneitra.&lt;ref&gt;http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/140317%20-%20Quneitra%20Governorate%20Assessment%20Report%20-%20FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Prehistory===
[[File:Quneitra, 1929.jpg|thumb|right|Skyline of Quneitra, 1929]]

The surrounding area has been inhabited for millennia. [[Palaeolithic]] hunter-gatherers are thought to have lived there, as evidenced by the discovery of [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] and [[Mousterian]] flint tools in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Takeru Akazawa, Kenichi Aoki, Ofer Bar-Yosef, ''Neanderthals and Modern Humans in Western Asia'', p. 154. Springer, 1998. {{ISBN|0-306-45924-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenistic to Byzantine periods===
A settlement was established at least as early as the late Hellenistic period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HQyxvmYV-50C&amp;pg=PA395 |title= Ancient Synagogues: Historical Analysis and Archaeological Discovery|author= Dan Urman, Paul Virgil McCracken Flesher |page= 395 |year= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued through the [[Syria (Roman province)|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times; it was known by the name "Sarisai".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HQyxvmYV-50C&amp;pg=PA398 |title= Ancient Synagogues: Historical Analysis and Archaeological Discovery |author= Dan Urman, Paul Virgil McCracken Flesher |page= 398 |year= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement served as a stop on the road from [[Damascus]] to western [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] is said to have passed through the settlement on his way from [[Jerusalem]] to Damascus. The site of the [[Conversion of Paul]] was traditionally identified with the small village of Kokab, north-east of Quneitra, on the road to Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Mannheim, "Biblical Damascus", in ''Syria &amp; Lebanon Handbook'', p. 100. 2001, Footprint Travel Guides. {{ISBN|1-900949-90-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Ottoman period===
For much of the 18th and 19th centuries Quneitra was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Chatty112"&gt;{{cite book |last= Chatty |first= Dawn |title= Displacement and Dispossession in the Modern Middle East |date= 2010 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= New York |isbn=978-0-521-81792-9 |pages=112–114 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8OsgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868 a travel handbook reported that the site was a "ruined village of about 80 or 100 houses" and that a large ''[[caravanserai]]'' also stood in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josias Leslie Porter |Porter, Josias Leslie]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BIZEWykI9fMC&amp;pg=PA439 A handbook for travellers in Syria and Palestine], J. Murray, 1868,  pg. 439. [Harvard University, 4 Jan 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Semi-nomadic pastoral groups such as the [[Arab]] [[Al Fadl]] and Banu Nu'aym tribes and several [[Syrian Turkmens|Turkmen]] tribes grazed their flocks in Quneitra's rocky lands.&lt;ref name="Chatty112"/&gt;

In 1873, a group of [[Circassians in Syria|Circassians]] from [[Sivas]] in [[Anatolia]] settled in Quneitra. This initial group did not cultivate the area for a number of years.&lt;ref name="Chatty112"/&gt; A second wave of Circassians, numbering about 2,000, arrived in the Golan in 1878 via [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] after fleeing [[Bulgaria]] due to the [[Russo-Turkish War]].&lt;ref name="Chatty112"/&gt; Along with Quneitra, they settled or built number of other villages in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Golan Heights: Political History, Settlement and Geography since 1949 |last=Kipnis |first=Yigal |page=78 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2013 |isbn=9781136740923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Circassians began farming the area and each family was given title to 70 to 130 dunams of land by the government depending on the family's size.&lt;ref name="Chatty112"/&gt; The Ottomans encouraged Circassian settlement in the Golan as a means to drive a wedge between the frequently rebellious [[Druze]] villages of [[Mount Hermon]] and those in [[Jabal al-Druze|Jabal Hauran]].&lt;ref name="Chatty112"/&gt; The Circassians of Quneitra engaged in sustained conflicts with the Druze and the Al Fadl through the remainder of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Chatty112"/&gt;

Modern Quneitra grew around the nucleus of the old [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] caravanserai, which had been built using the stones of a ruined ancient settlement.&lt;ref name="flesher"&gt;Paul Virgil McCracken Flesher, Dan Urman, ''Ancient Synagogues: historical analysis and archaeological discovery'', p. 394. Brill Academic Publishers, 1995. {{ISBN|90-04-11254-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1880s, Quneitra had become the main city and seat of government of the Golan. Gottlieb Schumacher wrote in 1888 that it "consists of 260 buildings, which are mostly well and carefully constructed of basalt stones, and contains, excluding the soldiers and officials, 1,300 inhabitants, principally Circassians."&lt;ref name="Schmacher"&gt;{{cite book |author = G. Schmacher |title = The Jaulân |place = London |publisher= Richard Bentley and Son |year = 1888 |pages= 207–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circassians moved away from the Golan began after the [[Six-Day War]] and again after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Monitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/turkey-golan-heights-circassian-minority.html |title= How Circassians maintain identity in changing Golan |date= 9 February 2017 |work= Al-Monitor |accessdate= 10 February 2017 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170210020013/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/turkey-golan-heights-circassian-minority.html |archivedate= 10 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], the [[Australian Mounted Division]] and 5th Cavalry Division defeated the Ottoman Turks at Quneitra on 29 September 1918, before they took Damascus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sibert, E. L.|url=http://sill-www.army.mil/firesbulletin/archives/1928/MAY_JUN_1928/MAY_JUN_1928_FULL_EDITION.pdf |title=Campaign Summary and Notes on Horse Artillery in Sinai and Palestine|journal= The Field Artillery Journal |date= May–June 1928 |format=PDF |volume=XVIII|issue=3|pages=255–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)]]).

===Second World War===
Quneitra saw several battles during the [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign]] of the [[World War II|Second World War]],  including the [[Battle of Damascus (1941)|Battle of Damascus]] and [[Battle of Kissoué]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Compton Mackenzie |authorlink=Compton Mackenzie |title=Eastern Epic |location=London |year=1951 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab-Israeli conflict===
When the modern states of Syria and Israel gained their independence from [[French Mandate of Syria|France]] and [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Britain]] respectively after the Second World War, Quneitra gained a new strategic significance as a key road junction some {{convert|24|km}} from the border. It became a prosperous market town and military garrison, with its population tripling to over 20,000 people, predominately Arabs.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;"Qunaytirah, Al-." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Six-Day War====
Quneitra was the Syrian headquarters for the Golan Heights.&lt;ref name="time campaign"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,837237,00.html |title=A Campaign for the Books |work=Time Magazine |date=1 September 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli capture of the city occurred in chaotic circumstances on 10 June 1967, the last day of the Six-Day War. Israeli forces advancing towards Quneitra from the north-west prompted Syrian troops to deploy north of the city, under heavy bombardment, to defend the road to Damascus. At {{nowrap|8:45 a.m.}}, Syrian radio broadcast an announcement that the city had fallen, though it actually had not. Alarmed, the Syrian Army's redeployment turned into a chaotic retreat along the Damascus road.

According to 8th Brigade Commander Ibrahim Isma'il Khahya:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We received orders to block the roads leading to Quneitra. But then the fall of the city was announced and that caused many of my soldiers to leave the front and run back to Syria while the roads were still open. They piled onto vehicles. It further crushed our morale. I retreated before I ever saw an enemy soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Six Days of War |publisher=Ballantine Books |author=Oren, Michael |authorlink=Michael Oren |year=2002 |location=New York |pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although a correction was broadcast two hours later, the Israelis took advantage of the confusion to seize Quneitra.&lt;ref name="beattie"&gt;Andrew Beattie, Timothy Pepper, ''The Rough Guide to Syria'' 2nd edition, p. 146. Rough Guides, 2001. {{ISBN|1-85828-718-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An armoured brigade under Colonel [[Albert Mandler]] entered Quneitra at {{nowrap|2:30 p.m.}} and found the city deserted and strewn with abandoned military equipment. One of the Israeli commanders later commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We arrived almost without hindrance to the gates of Quneitra&amp;nbsp;... All around us there were huge quantities of booty. Everything was in working order. Tanks with their engines still running, communication equipment still in operation had been abandoned. We captured Quneitra without a fight.&lt;ref name="Bowen"&gt;Jeremy Bowen, ''Six Days: How the 1967 War Shaped the Middle East'', p. 304. Simon &amp; Schuster Ltd, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7432-3095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] reported: "In an effort to pressure the United Nations into enforcing a ceasefire, Damascus Radio undercut its own army by broadcasting the fall of the city of El Quneitra three hours before it actually capitulated. That premature report of the surrender of their headquarters destroyed the morale of the Syrian troops left in the Golan area."&lt;ref name="time campaign"/&gt;

A ceasefire was agreed later in the afternoon, leaving Quneitra under Israeli control. In June 1967, ''Time'' magazine wrote that: "The city of El Quneitra was a ghost town, its shops shuttered, its deserted streets patrolled by Israelis on house-to-house searches for caches of arms and ammunition. The hills echoed with explosions as Israeli sappers systematically destroyed the miniature Maginot line from which the Syrians had shelled kibbutzim across the [[Sea of Galilee]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coping with Victory |work=Time Magazine |date=23 June 1967 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839520,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Special Representative of the Secretary General|United Nations Special Representative]], [[Nils-Göran Gussing]], visited it in July and reported that "nearly every shop and every house seemed to have been broken into and looted" and that some buildings had been set on fire after they had been stripped. Although Israeli spokesmen told Gussing that Quneitra had actually been looted by the withdrawing Syrians, the UN representative viewed this as unlikely given the extremely short space of time between the erroneous radio announcement and the fall of the city a few hours later. He concluded that "responsibility for this extensive looting of the town of Quneitra lay to a great extent with the Israeli forces."&lt;ref name="Bowen"/&gt;

Circassians dispersion from the Golan began after the Six-Day War, then additional numbers moved to the Caucasus after the fall of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Monitor"/&gt;

====Israeli occupation====
The deserted city remained in Israeli hands for the next six years. However, Israel and Syria remained in a state of war throughout this period (and, indeed, to the present day). The town gained a fresh symbolic value; it was seen by the Syrians as "the badge of Syria's defeat, an emblem of hatred between Syria and Israel and a cross [Syrian President [[Hafez al-Assad]]] had to bear."&lt;ref&gt;Seale, Patrick. (1988). Asad of Syria: The struggle for the Middle East (p. 141). Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Syria shelled the city several times during the early 1970s; in June 1970 a Syrian armored unit launched an attack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel and Syria battle third day in the Golan area |work= The New York Times |date= 27 June 1970 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/27/archives/israel-and-syria-battle-third-day-in-the-golan-area-tanks-artillery.html |author= Charles Mohr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 1972, Damascus radio announced that Syrian [[artillery]] had again shelled Quneitra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syria Shells Israeli Bases in Occupied Golan Heights|work= The New York Times |date= 26 November 1972|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/26/archives/syria-shells-israeli-bases-in-occupied-golan-heights.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yom Kippur War====
[[File:1973 Yom Kippur War - Golan heights theater.jpg|thumb|400px|Golan Heights campaign during Yom Kippur War]]
During the first few days of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, Quneitra was briefly recaptured by the Syrian Army before it was repulsed in an Israeli counter-offensive.&lt;ref&gt;"Tables turned on Arabs, Israel general says". ''The Times'', 9 October 1973, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the middle of October 1973 the Israeli counter-offensive started. The Syrians had massed nearly 1,000 tanks along a {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip|abbr=on}} front. With a massive concentration of tanks, the Israelis lashed into the Syrian forces. The Syrians at first fell back, but then managed to counterattack and drive back into occupied territory.  Quneitra changed hands several times. Finally, Israeli [[Armoured warfare|armored units]], closely supported by [[F-4 Phantom II|Phantoms]] and [[A-4 Skyhawk|Skyhawks]] performing [[close air support]] with [[napalm]] strikes against the forward Syrian units, halted the Syrian drive and turned the Syrian Army back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The War of the Day of Judgment|publisher= Time Magazine|date= October 22, 1973|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908039,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Destruction of Quneitra and return to Syrian control====
[[File:Quneitra building.jpg|right|thumb|Destroyed building in Quneitra]]
[[File:Quneitra.jpg|thumb|The entrance to the city]]
Israel continued to control the city until early June 1974, when it was returned to Syrian civilian control following the signature of a United States-brokered [[Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria|disengagement agreement]] signed on 31 May 1974. The surrender of Quneitra was controversial, with Israeli settlers&lt;ref name="times070574"&gt;"Settlers insist Israel keeps Golan". ''The Times'', 7 May 1974, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Likud]] and [[National Religious Party]] opposing it.&lt;ref&gt;"Criticism in Israel over peace pact's concessions to Syria". ''The Times'', 30 May 1974, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided that the city was to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing so it would encourage the Israelis to pull back further.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mandelbaum, ''The Fate of Nations: The Search for National Security in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', p. 316. Cambridge University Press, 1988. {{ISBN|052135790X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to block the withdrawal, a group of settlers from [[Merom Golan]] – a settlement established in 1967 – took over an abandoned bunker in Quneitra and declared it to be a new settlement called [[Keshet, Golan Heights|Keshet]] (Quneitra in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]). The settlers also set about razing the existing town to the ground. The leader of Merom Golan, Yehuda Harel, and another Merom Golan member, Shimshon Wollner, initiated the destruction of Quneitra, which was carried out by the [[Land Development Administration]] of the [[Jewish National Fund]]. Harel later described what happened:

{{quote |Shimshon and I walked around Quneitra all day and tried decide what to do. And then these two strange ideas came up. One was to establish a settlement in Quneitra and the second was to destroy Quneitra.&lt;ref name="Kipnis160"&gt;Kipnis, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wollner and Harel asked the Jewish National Fund to carry out the work, ostensibly to prepare an area for agricultural cultivation, but were refused as they did not have permission from the Israeli army. They then approached the Assistant to the Head of Northern Command and asked him to mark on a map which buildings the army needed. According to Harel,

{{quote |So he took a felt pen and marked the hospital and a few other places – he wrote "not for destruction" and on other places he wrote "for destruction" and he signed.

''The Times'', 26 June 1974, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Western reporters accompanied Syrian refugees returning to the city in early July 1974 and described what they saw on the ground. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]'s correspondent reported that "Most of its buildings are knocked flat, as though by dynamite, or pockmarked by shellfire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Returning to Quneitra|publisher= Time Magazine|date= 8 July 1974|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943909,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Le Monde]]'''s Syria correspondent, in a report for ''[[The Times]]'', gave a detailed eyewitness description of the destruction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today the city is unrecognisable. The houses with their roofs lying on the ground look like gravestones. Parts of the rubble are covered with fresh earth furrowed by bulldozer tracks. Everywhere there are fragments of furniture, discarded kitchen utensils, Hebrew newspapers dating from the first week of June; here a ripped-up mattress, there the springs of an old sofa. On the few sections of wall still standing, Hebrew inscriptions proclaim: "There'll be another round"; "You want Quneitra, you'll have it destroyed."&lt;ref name="times100774"&gt;"Golan's capital turns into heap of stones". ''The Times'', 10 July 1974, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Israel asserted that most of the damage had been caused in the two wars and during the artillery duels in between.&lt;ref&gt;"Israel fears Russian incitement of Arabs". ''The Times'', 8 September 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Corrections | publisher= The New York Times | date= 9 May 2001 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E7DB153BF93AA35756C0A9679C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reports from before the withdrawal did refer to the city as "ruined" and "shell-scarred".&lt;ref&gt;"Syrian 160mm mortar shells were falling on the northern side of the city, a shell-scarred ghost city since its capture by the Israelis in 1967". "Debris of two armies litters Damascus road". ''The Times'', 5 October 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Kuneitra, the ruined capital of the Heights". "Village life on the wild frontier of the Golan". ''The Times'', 5 April 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The officer conceded that the ruined city itself was of no military importance to Israel." "Israel sees no end to Golan battle". ''The Times'', 2 May 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times''' correspondent saw the city for himself on 6 May, a month before the Israeli withdrawal, and described it as being "in ruins and deserted after seven years of war and dereliction. It looks like a wild west city struck by an earthquake and if the Syrians get it back they will face a major feat of reconstruction. Nearly every building is heavily damaged and scores have collapsed."&lt;ref name="times070574" /&gt;

Direct evidence of the city's condition was provided when it was filmed on 12 May 1974 by a British television news team which included the veteran journalist [[Peter Snow]], who was reporting for [[Independent Television News]] on the disengagement negotiations. His report was broadcast on ITN's ''News at Ten'' programme. According to ''The Times''' correspondent [[Edward Mortimer]], "viewers were thus afforded a panoramic view of the city, which had stood almost completely empty since the Syrian army evacuated it in 1967. It could be seen that many of the buildings were damaged, but most of them were still standing." After it was handed over, "very few buildings were left standing. Most of those destroyed did not present the jagged outline and random heaps of rubble usually produced by artillery or aerial bombardment. The roofs lay flat on the ground, 'pancaked' in a manner which I am told can only be achieved by systematic dynamiting of the support walls inside." Mortimer concluded that the footage "establishes beyond reasonable doubt that much of the destruction took place after 12 May—at a time when there was no fighting anywhere near Kuneitra."&lt;ref&gt;"A question mark over the death of a city." ''The Times'', 17 February 1975, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] established a ''Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories'', which engaged a Swiss engineer [[Eduard Gruner|Edward Gruner]] to investigate the damage.&lt;ref name=Gruner&gt;UN Secretary General: Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories; including Edward Gruner: Quneitra Report on Nature, Extent and Value of Damage. [https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/8BF5BE1EBC256B43852569EB006C4022 A/31/218] 1 October 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Gruner and a team of surveyors spent four months in Quneitra, documenting every building and its condition.&lt;ref name=Gruner/&gt; His report concluded that Israeli forces had deliberately destroyed the city prior to their withdrawal, including almost 4,000 buildings and a large amount of infrastructure, of value estimated at 463 million Syrian pounds.&lt;ref name=Gruner/&gt; The report's conclusions were subsequently adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. It passed a resolution on 29 November 1974 describing the destruction of Quneitra as "a grave breach of the [Fourth] [[Fourth Geneva Convention|Geneva Convention]]" and "condemn[ing] Israel for such acts," by a margin of 93 votes to 8, with 74 abstentions.&lt;ref name="ungar3240"/&gt; The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] also voted to condemn the "deliberate destruction and devastation" of Quneitra in a resolution of 22 February 1975, by a margin of 22 votes to one (the United States) with nine abstentions.&lt;ref name="times220275"&gt;"Human Rights Commission condemns Israel". ''The Times'', 22 February 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a city ruin====
[[File:Golan Hospital.jpeg|250px|right|thumb|Quneitra hospital. The sign reads: &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT AMEND THE FOLLOWING TRANSLATION --&gt;"Golan Hospital. Destructed by Zionists and changed it to firing target!" ''[sic]'']]
The city remains in a destroyed condition. Syria has left the ruins in place and built a museum to memorialize its destruction.  It maintains billboards at the ruins of many buildings and effectively preserves it in the condition that the Israeli army left it in. The former residents of the town have not returned and Syria discourages the re-population of the area.&lt;ref name="beattie"/&gt; However, in the 2004 census by the [[Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria)|Central Bureau of Statistics]], a small population of 153 people living in 28 households was recorded, all living in the neighborhood of Rasm al-Rawabi.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;[http://www.cbssyr.org/new%20web%20site/General_census/census_2004/NH/TAB14-1-2004.htm General Census of Population and Housing 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122165907/http://www.cbssyr.org/new%20web%20site/General_census/census_2004/NH/TAB14-1-2004.htm |date=2013-01-22 }}. [[Central Bureau of Statistics (Syria)|Syria Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS). Quneitra Governorate. {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Rough Guides|Rough Guide to Syria]]'' describes the appearance of the city in 2001: "The first sight of the flattened houses on Quneitra's outskirts is the most dramatic; many of the unscathed roofs simply lie on top of a mass of rubble, leaving the impression of a building that has imploded."&lt;ref name="beattie"/&gt;

The city has often been used as a stop for foreign VIPs, ranging from the Soviet foreign minister [[Alexei Kosygin]] in June 1976&lt;ref&gt;"Syrians offered Soviet support by Mr Kosygin". ''The Times'', 4 June 1976, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Pope John Paul II]] in May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1315453.stm Pope visits Golan Heights]". BBC News, 7 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Only a handful of families now live in the town, making a living by providing services for the United Nations troops patrolling the demilitarized zone.&lt;ref&gt;"Pope prays for peace in war-torn Syrian town", ''News Letter'' (Belfast); 8 May 2001; p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Times'', "the carefully preserved ruined city has become a pilgrimage site for a generation of Syrians."&lt;ref&gt;"Silence of Syria's forgotten siege", ''The Times''; 8 May 2001; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The city can be visited by tourists, but a permit from the [[Ministry of Interior (Syria)|Syrian Ministry of the Interior]] is required, and sight-seeing is supervised by a military guide. The principal sights on the standard tour are the remains of Quneitra's hospital, mosque and [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Greek Orthodox]] church. A "Liberated Quneitra Museum", displaying artifacts from the city's ancient and medieval past, is housed in the former Ottoman Turkish [[caravanserai]] in the city centre. The western edge of the city marks the start of "no-man's land" beyond which lies Israeli-controlled territory. It is not possible to visit Quneitra directly from Israel.&lt;ref name="mannheim"&gt;Ivan Mannheim, ''Syria &amp; Lebanon Handbook'', p. 142. 2001, Footprint Travel Guides. {{ISBN|1-900949-90-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/SyrianArabRepublic.html|title=Syria: Entry, Exit and Visa Requirements|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=February 20, 2018|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syrian Civil War===

On 13 November 2012, during the ongoing [[Syrian Civil War]], which had begun in March 2011, Syria′s president [[Bashar al-Assad]] issued a decreed establishment of a branch of the [[University of Damascus]] in Quneitra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=President Bashar al-Assad Decrees on Establishing Branch for Damascus University in Quneitra |url=http://sana.sy/eng/21/2012/11/13/452229.htm |last1=Nassr |first1=M. |last2=Ghossoun |first2= |agency=[[Syrian Arab News Agency]] |date=13 November 2012 |accessdate=13 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116232744/http://sana.sy/eng/21/2012/11/13/452229.htm |archivedate=16 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 6 June 2013, the nearby [[Quneitra Crossing|Quneitra border crossing]] was attacked by rebel forces and temporarily occupied, with Syrian army later retaking the crossing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.528105 |title=Syrian rebels and Assad forces battle for control of key town on Israel border|date=6 June 2013|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, opposition forces attacked a military checkpoint in Quneitra,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/syriahroe/posts/377856595656018 al-Quneitira Province 1].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1494">The '''RallyCar Rallycross Championship''' is a [[rallycross]] championship held in the [[United States]]. Founded in 2010, it is the first series in America for European-style rallycross competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://rally-america.com/news/latest/732/&lt;/ref&gt; The series is run by RallyCar, which also runs the [[Rally America]] stage rallying series.

RallyCar Rallycross is different from [[SCCA RallyCross]], which is similar to [[Autocross]] but contested on an unpaved surface. Cars run one at-a-time, unlike rallycross, where competitors race wheel-to-wheel.&lt;ref&gt;http://rally-america.com/news/754/&lt;/ref&gt; The first event attracted names such as [[Travis Pastrana]], [[Dave Mirra]] and [[Tanner Foust]].

==History==
Rallycross made its US debut at [[X Games 16]] in 2010, under the name SuperRally, organised by RallyCar. The championship is aimed to make rallycross grow at a national level in the United States.

Three events were held at the end of 2010 at [[New Jersey Motorsports Park]]. The first full season will be run in 2011, with three races being also valid for the [[Global Rallycross Championship]] in the West Coast and three in the Midwest as a supporting event to the [[Traxxas TORC Series]].

The '''Siege of [[Kerak]]''' took place in 1183, with [[Saladin]]'s forces attacking and being repelled from the [[Crusades|Crusader]] stronghold.

== Prelude ==
[[Kerak]] was the stronghold of [[Raynald of Châtillon]], [[Lord of Oultrejordain]], 124&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Amman]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kerak, Jordan|url = http://www.atlastours.net/jordan/kerak.html|website = www.atlastours.net|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortress was built in 1142 by [[Pagan the Butler]], Lord of [[Montreal (Crusader castle)|Montreal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While Raynald ruled, several truces existed between the [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] states in the [[Holy Land]], none of which he made any qualms about breaking. The last straw came in 1183 when he organized an expedition around the [[Red Sea]]. He captured the town of [[Aqaba]], giving him a base of operations against Islam's holiest city, [[Mecca]]. [[Saladin]], the leader of the Muslim forces, could not tolerate this and moved against Raynald's stronghold.

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}

==Siege and relief==
The Muslims had sought to take Kerak for several years, but now they stretched its defenses to the breaking point. At one point, nine catapults were bombarding the walls and inhabitants within.

Inside the walls, a royal marriage was taking place. [[Humphrey IV of Toron]], Raynald's stepson and heir, was to take the hand of [[Isabella of Jerusalem]], the King's half sister. As the wedding ceremonies continued, Saladin instructed his troops to avoid bombarding the young couple's quarters, but pressure on Kerak continued. Messengers managed to escape the town and take word to the King, [[Baldwin IV]].

Baldwin immediately marched with a relief force, accompanied by his regent, [[Raymond III of Tripoli]]. Although suffering from [[leprosy]] since childhood, Baldwin's determination to frustrate Saladin's attempt was such that he led personally, although he had to be carried on a stretcher. The Christian forces arrived while Saladin was still struggling against the heavy fortifications. Knowing he risked being crushed between the royal army and the walls of Kerak, he lifted the siege.

==Aftermath==
Saladin returned to Kerak again in 1184, with the same result. Kerak remained a [[Crusade]]r stronghold and a symbol of the West's grip in the region until falling to Muslim control in 1188.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The next time the Crusaders had to contend with a major siege, it was at the walls of [[Jerusalem]] itself.

==In fiction==
The motion picture ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' contains a fictional portrayal of the siege. In the film, knights under the command of Balian engaged the Ayyubids as they approached Kerak, so that defenseless citizens could retreat to Raynald's castle. The film also showed the siege not taking place, but King Baldwin IV and Saladin negotiating a settlement.  Baldwin then punished Raynald for breaking the truce (with Saladin) by attacking a Muslim caravan.

'''The Big Wu Family Reunion''' ('''BWFR''') is an annual [[music festival]] hosted by the [[Rock and Roll]] [[jam band]] [[The Big Wu]].  It is currently held during an August weekend at the Camp Maiden Rock West in Morristown, [[Minnesota]], and features multiple bands on one or two stages as well as on-site [[camping]].

==History==
On July 17, 1998, the Big Wu created a tradition by throwing the first ever Big Wu Family Reunion at Latch Lake Studios in [[Eagan, Minnesota|Eagan]], [[Minnesota]] (the very place where their first CD, ''[[Tracking Buffalo Through the Bathtub]]'' had been recorded the year before). The next year the Family Reunion was held at Harmony Park Music Garden in Geneva, Minnesota. Over the past years, it has been held at either Harmony Park or the Jamboree Campground in [[Black River Falls, Wisconsin|Black River Falls]], [[Wisconsin]].  2006 marked the ninth annual year that the festival has taken place. The Festival in now held annually at Camp Maiden Rock West in Morristown MN.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3839">{{dablink|For a description of a Cymanfa Ganu and the events that take place during the festival see [[Cymanfa Ganu]].}}

The '''Welsh National Gymanfa Ganu Association''', also known as '''WNGGA''', was founded in 1929, after the first [[Cymanfa Ganu]] in [[North America]] was held on a field on [[Goat Island (New York)|Goat Island]], located in the [[Niagara Reservation State Park]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York]].  The Welsh National Gymanfa Ganu Association is responsible for overseeing the Cymanfaoedd Ganu held in North America.  
==History==
The Gymanfa Ganu at Niagara Falls was the first National Gymanfa Ganu (Guh-mahn'-va Gahn'-ee) to be held in the United States.  Although exact estimates are unknown, it is believed that 3,000 were in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;History of North American Gymanfa Ganus, [http://www.wngga.org/wngga/wngga_history.html History]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Welsh American]]s of [[Youngstown, Ohio]] are generally given the majority of credit for helping to perpetuate this movement. However, there were many others involved in the planning for the event. [[Delegation]]s from [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Michigan]], traveling by train and auto to Niagara Falls, were joined there by equally enthusiastic Welsh from [[Ontario]].
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Welsh dragon.gif|right|thumb|The Welsh dragon]] --&gt;
After the success of the first Gymanfa Ganu, plans were already being made for another Gymanfa at Niagara Falls the following year.  An organizational structure was put into place with Will Lewis (Youngstown, Ohio) as [[President]]; Ellis Hughes (Niagara Falls, New York) as [[Vice President]]; Dave Lewis (Youngstown, Ohio) as [[Secretary]]; and W. B. Jones ([[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]) as [[Treasurer]].  This was the beginning of what has been known as the "Welsh National Gymanfa Ganu Association", renamed in 2011 to "Welsh North American Association" or WNAA.

This change was adopted at the September 3, 2011, Annual General Meeting of The Welsh National Gymanfa Ganu Association, in Cleveland, Ohio, in recognition of the broadened mission of the organization.  This mission is stated as "to preserve, develop and promote our Welsh cultural heritage including, but not limited to, the Gymanfa Ganu, literature, cultural traditions..." (see Official Website link below) 

With the exception of three years during [[World War II]] (1943-1945), a Gymanfa Ganu (commonly just referred to as a ''National'') has been held in North America every year since 1929.  In 1969 the Gymanfa was held in [[Cardiff]], and in 1974 in [[Swansea]], both in [[Wales]] (there were two Nationals held in North America in each of those two years, but both are not included in the official count).
{{cquote|The [[Board of Trustees]] of the WNGGA is the unifying force that provides the institutional memory, selects sites for the annual cymanfaoedd, provides general guidance and supervision, and assures that desired cultural and religious standards are maintained.  Following suspension of the national cymanfaoedd during the war years of 1943-45, it was the Board of the WNGGA that made sure the national Gymanfa Ganu was reactivated and has continued since as the preeminent expression of Welsh culture, heritage, and the Welsh language in the United States and Canada.}}

In the next scene, [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] plays [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s "[[Moonlight Sonata]]" and [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] sings along. She tries to tell him that they should get married. Schroeder ignores her, then Lucy says, "My aunt Marian was right; never try to discuss marriage with a musician."

Charlie Brown hopes for the first time to be able to keep a [[kite]] but he once again fails. Sally writes a letter to Ann Flanders about the [[Valentine's Day]] card she gets.

Charlie Brown gives Lucy a Valentine's Day card and mistakenly says, "This is for you, Lucy. Merry [[Christmas]]!" Charlie Brown sees [[Marcie (Peanuts)|Marcie]] and thinks that she is going to give him a Valentine's Day card but she does not. Lucy comes up to Schroeder again and talks about saucepans, and, again, Schroeder cannot stand it.

Snoopy imagines that he is a wild animal. Charlie Brown, Schroeder, Linus, and Lucy work on their book reports on [[Peter Rabbit]] ("Book Report"). Lucy teaches Linus about nature in her own way while Charlie Brown tries to correct her, to no avail ("Little Known Facts").

Charlie Brown writes a letter to his [[penpal|pencil pal]] about his downfall at his [[baseball]] game.  Charlie Brown pleads his baseball team to win the game by chanting "T-E-A-M" but fails. Lucy dreams of becoming a queen but gives up dreaming. Charlie Brown tries to get the Little Red-Haired Girl to know him better but fails.

Schroeder's Sing Along has songs for the play in "The Concert" by singing "Home On the Range" with his friends. And the five friends sing while Lucy, Linus, and Sally argue.  Lucy wanting her pencil back from Linus, and threatening to tell Sally what he said about her if he didn't give back the pencil (Linus called Sally an [[wikt:enigma|Enigma]]).  Snoopy sings a song devoted to "Suppertime" when he sees Charlie Brown serving him his supper.

In the end, Charlie Brown and all of his gang learn all about "Happiness" and why it's all around them; the special ends with Lucy telling Charlie Brown that he is a good man.

==DVD release==
Warner Home Video released ''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' on DVD for the first time on January 26, 2010, as a part of their Charlie Brown "Remastered Deluxe Edition" line. The DVD, for once in the line, did not include a bonus special on the disc (likely{{According to whom|date=November 2018}} because this animated feature is twice as long as the majority of them.) It did, however, include a featurette entitled "Animating a Charlie Brown Musical".
