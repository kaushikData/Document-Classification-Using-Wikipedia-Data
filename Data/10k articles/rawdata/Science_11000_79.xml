'''/r/science''', formally dubbed the '''New Reddit Journal of Science''', is an [[Internet forum]] on [[Reddit]] where the community of participants discuss science topics.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owens|first1=Simon|title=The World’s Largest 2-Way Dialogue between Scientists and the Public|journal=[[Scientific American]]|date=7 October 2014|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-world-s-largest-2-way-dialogue-between-scientists-and-the-public/|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular feature of the forum is "Ask me Anything" (AMA) public discussions.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt; As of 2014, /r/science attracted 30,000-100,000 visitors per day, making it the largest community-managed science forum and an attractive place to host discussions.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:American Chemical Society - What Chemists Do - Nathan Allen.webm||thumbtime=15|thumb|right|Nathan Allen speaks about /r/science to the [[American Chemical Society]]]]
===Nathan Allen===
Nathan Allen is an American chemist. While working as a chemist at [[Dow Chemical Company]], Allen began to imagine that scientists could use [[Reddit]]'s "ask me anything" (AMA) interview format to create discussions between scientists and the public.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt; Allen became a forum moderator there and has since been prominent in guiding the culture of the community there and as a spokesperson for the forum.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt;

===Establishment of AMA series===

As of 2014, /r/science attracted 30,000–100,000 visitors per day, making it the largest community-managed science forum and an attractive place to host discussions.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt; In January 2014 Allen began the /r/science AMA series with the goal of raising the visibility of scientists who are producing groundbreaking work in their fields but who are not well known outside of their fields.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Nathan|title=Announcing the /r/science AMA Series|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1vqimu/announcing_the_rscience_ama_series/|website=Reddit.com|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outgoing links posted in the forum must go to peer-reviewed science articles published within the last six months.&lt;ref name="Owens April 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owens|first1=Simons|title=Should Reddit’s powerful mods be reined in?|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/reddit-moderator-crisis/|website=[[The Daily Dot]]|accessdate=9 May 2016|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion series was instantly a success, and established the world's largest two-way discussion between scientists and the public.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt; Allen does most of the organization for the talks, including soliciting scientists to participate and training them to communicate in reddit's discussion format.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt;

==Featured content==
/r/science has an ongoing content partnership with [[PLOS]].&lt;ref name="Costello April 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costello|first1=Victoria|title=Ask our authors anything: new PLOS ‘AMA’ series debuts on redditscience|url=http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/04/plos/|website=PLOS|accessdate=11 May 2016|date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an academic journal, PLOS invites authors who are publishing scientific papers to publicly present their work in /r/science and to participate in community "ask me anything" discussions in the forum at scheduled times.&lt;ref name="Costello April 2015"/&gt;

==Editorial decisions==
Editorial decisions in /r/science are made by the moderators who themselves follow rules that they present for the forum.&lt;ref name="Owens April 2015"/&gt; If new rules are introduced then those are discussed with the community of readers.&lt;ref name="Owens April 2015"/&gt; Rules for /r/science include guidance that contributors keep discussion on-topic and thoughtful.&lt;ref name="Owens April 2015"/&gt;

Allen led the decision to ban discussion in /r/science which gives credibility to [[climate change denial]] as a scientific concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Nathan|title=Reddit’s science forum banned climate deniers.

'''Alice Bolingbroke Woodward''' (1862–1951), an [[England|English]] [[illustrator]], was born on 3 October 1862 in [[Chelsea, London]]. She was one of the most prolific illustrators of the turn of the 20th century&lt;ref name=ForgottenWomen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=S.|last2=Burek|first2=C. V.|last3=Moody|first3=R. T. J.|chapter=Forgotten women in an extinct saurian (man's) world|date=2010|volume=343|pages=111–153|title=Dinosaurs and Other Extinct Saurians: A Historical Perspective|editor=Moody, Richard|series=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|doi=10.1144/SP343.7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym2ei7Ey0PwC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is known mainly for her work in children's literature, and secondarily for her scientific illustrations. Her father [[Henry Woodward (geologist)|Henry Woodward]], was an eminent scientist and the Keeper of Geology at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London.

As a child, Alice was educated at home by governesses, along with her four sisters and two brothers (she was the fourth of seven). From a young age the children were encouraged to draw, with all of the sisters eventually becoming artists and all of the brothers becoming scientists. By her late teens, Alice was skilled enough to illustrate for her father's lectures and for the papers of his colleagues.  

This allowed her to earn enough money to begin her studies at [[South Kensington School of Art]], and later at the [[Westminster School of Art]] followed thereafter by the [[Académie Julian]] in [[Paris]]. She took lessons in illustration from [[Joseph Pennell]] and [[Maurice Greiffenhagen]] and her connection with Pennell led to commissions from [[J. M. Dent]] and [[Macmillan and Company]] to illustrate children's books. She also continued to illustrate for scientific work throughout her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/art-nature-imaging/collections/art-themes/drawingconclusions/more/shells_more_info.htm|title=

Her sister, [[Gertrude Mary Woodward]], also worked in anatomical lithography, and was a lifelong friend of [[Beatrix Potter]].&lt;ref name=ForgottenWomen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/library/archives/catalogue/DServe.exe?dsqServer=placid&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqSearch=Code==%27PX195%27&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl| title=Woodward; Gertrude Mary (1861-1939); Artist |website=Museum archives, www.nhm.ac.uk|publisher=Natural History Museum, London|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Story of the Mikado - Frontispiece.png|thumb|160px|right|"Alas, my poor little bride that was to be!" from ''[[The Story of the Mikado]]'' (1921) by W. S. Gilbert.]]
Between 1896 and 1900, she worked for the Glasgow publishing house [[Blackie and Son Limited]], illustrating a series of children's books including ''To Tell the King the Sky is Falling'', ''Adventures in Toyland'', and ''Red Apple and Silver Bells'', as well as contributing to annuals and school primers through the 1920s.  She succeeded [[Aubrey Beardsley]] as illustrator of W.C. Jerrold's ''Bon-Mots of the Eighteenth Century'', and then his ''Bon-Mots of the Nineteenth Century''. From 1907 on her main publisher was [[George Bell &amp; Sons]] for whom she illustrated ''The [[Peter Pan (fictional character)|Peter Pan]] Picture Book'' written by Daniel O'Connor, creating 28 coloured plates.

She illustrated the stories of two [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas, [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and [[Anna Sewell]]'s classic ''[[Black Beauty]]''. Amongst the last of her books was a volume of ''Myths and Legends of the Australian Aboriginals'' which she illustrated in 1930 at the age of 68. Woodward also exhibited paintings (of scenes in [[Normandy]] and [[Norfolk]]) and designs for process reproduction at the 91 Art Club, a Chelsea club for women artists. Her work has appeared in over 80 publications including dinosaur reconstructions for the ''[[Illustrated London News]]''.

To differentiate between her two different kinds of work, she signed all of her illustrations with a butterfly [[monogram]], while in her scientific work she simply wrote her name. 

Her scientific work was known for its accuracy and precision, a necessity in [[technical illustration]]. Her drawings were also always lifelike, whether it was a drawing of a specimen or a reconstruction of a prehistoric animal.

'''Anatomy''' (Greek anatomē, "dissection") is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things. It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booktionary.com.ng/index_files/Page1935.htm|title=Anatomy|last=Rotimi|first=Booktionary|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomy is inherently tied to [[developmental biology]], [[embryology]], [[comparative anatomy]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[phylogeny]],&lt;ref name="intro HGray"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| title= Introduction page, "Anatomy of the Human Body". Henry Gray. 20th edition. 1918| accessdate =19 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070316005206/http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html| archivedate= 16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales. Anatomy and [[physiology]], which study (respectively) the structure and [[function (biology)|function]] of organisms and their parts, make a natural pair of [[multidisciplinary approach|related disciplines]], and they are often studied together. [[Human body|Human anatomy]] is one of the essential [[basic sciences]] that are [[Applied science|applied]] in [[medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;Arráez-Aybar et al. (2010). Relevance of human anatomy in daily clinical practice. Annals of Anatomy-Anatomischer Anzeiger, 192(6), 341–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of anatomy is divided into [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] and [[microscopic scale|microscopic anatomy]]. Macroscopic anatomy, or [[gross anatomy]], is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided [[eyesight]]. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of [[superficial anatomy]]. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of various structures, known as [[histology]], and also in the study of [[cell biology|cells]].

The [[history of anatomy]] is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and structures of the [[human body]]. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and [[cadaver]]s (corpses) to 20th century [[medical imaging]] techniques including [[Radiography|X-ray]], [[Ultrasound imaging|ultrasound]], and [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging]].

Derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνατομή}} ''anatomē'' "dissection" (from {{lang|grc|ἀνατέμνω}} ''anatémnō'' "I cut up, cut open" from ἀνά ''aná'' "up", and τέμνω ''témnō'' "I cut"),&lt;ref&gt;O.D.E. 2nd edition 2005&lt;/ref&gt; anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of [[organism]]s including their systems, organs and [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]], which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of [[bile]], the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions.&lt;ref name=Everyman&gt;{{cite book |title=Everyman's Encyclopedia: Anatomy |editor-last=Bozman |editor-first=E. F.|year=1967 |publisher=J. M. Dent &amp; Sons |asin=B0066E44EC |page=272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] anatomy and [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]] anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/microscopic+anatomy |title=Anatomy |year=2007 |work=The Free Dictionary |publisher=Farlex |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gross anatomy]] is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes [[superficial anatomy]] or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features. [[Microscopic anatomy]] is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, along with [[histology]] (the study of tissues), and [[embryology]] (the study of an organism in its immature condition).&lt;ref name="intro HGray" /&gt;

Anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non-invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems.&lt;ref name="intro HGray" /&gt; Methods used include [[dissection]], in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and [[endoscopy]], in which a [[video camera]]-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. [[Angiography]] using [[X-ray]]s or [[magnetic resonance angiography]] are methods to visualize blood vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Use of Angiography to Outline the Cardiovascular Anatomy of the Sand Crab Portunus pelagicus Linnaeus |vauthors=Gribble N, Reynolds K | journal=Journal of Crustacean Biology | year=1993 | volume=13 | issue=4 | pages=627–637 | doi=10.1163/193724093x00192 | jstor=1549093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Characterization of the Renal Portal System of the Common Green Iguana (Iguana iguana) by Digital Subtraction Imaging |vauthors=Benson KG, Forrest L | journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine | year=1999 | volume=30 | issue=2 | pages=235–241|pmid=10484138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/cardiovascular/magnetic_resonance_angiography_mra_135,14/ |title=Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) |publisher=Johns Hopkins Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angiography/Pages/Introduction.aspx | title=Angiography | publisher=National Health Service | accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "anatomy" is commonly taken to refer to [[human anatomy]]. However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals. The term ''zootomy'' is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non-human animals. The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in [[plant anatomy]].&lt;ref name=Everyman/&gt;

== Animal tissues ==
[[File:Anima cell notext.svg|right|thumb|Stylized cutaway diagram of an animal cell (with flagella)]]
The [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] [[Animalia]] contains [[multicellular organism]]s that are [[heterotroph]]ic and [[Motility|motile]] (although some have secondarily adopted a [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and these animals are also known as [[eumetazoa]]ns. They have an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber, with one or two openings; the [[gamete]]s are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the [[zygote]]s include a [[blastula]] stage in their [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. Metazoans do not include the [[sponge]]s, which have undifferentiated cells.&lt;ref name=Dorit549&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=547–549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[plant cell]]s, [[animal cells]] have neither a cell wall nor [[chloroplast]]s. Vacuoles, when present, are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell. The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell, including those found in [[muscle]]s, [[nerve]]s and [[skin]]. Each typically has a cell membrane formed of [[phospholipid]]s, [[cytoplasm]] and a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].  All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic [[germ layer]]s. Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called [[diploblasty|diploblastic]] and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called [[triploblasty|triploblastic]].&lt;ref name=Ruppert60&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=59–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]].

Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: [[connective tissue|connective]], [[epithelium|epithelial]], [[muscle tissue|muscle]] and [[nervous tissue]].
[[File:Cartilage polarised.jpg|thumb|Hyaline cartilage at high magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]

===Connective tissue===
[[Connective tissue]]s are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the [[extracellular matrix]]. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, [[adipose tissue]], fibrous connective tissue, [[cartilage]] and [[bone]]. The extracellular matrix contains [[protein]]s, the chief and most abundant of which is [[collagen]]. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a [[skeleton]] to support or protect the body. An [[exoskeleton]] is a thickened, rigid [[cuticle]] which is stiffened by [[mineralisation (biology)|mineralization]], as in [[crustacean]]s or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in [[insect]]s. An [[endoskeleton]] is internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed.&lt;ref name="Ruppert60" /&gt;

===Epithelium===
[[File:Normal gastric mucosa low mag.jpg|thumb|right|Gastric mucosa at low magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]
[[Epithelial tissue]] is composed of closely packed cells, bound to each other by [[cell adhesion molecule]]s, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be [[Squamous epithelial cell|squamous]] (flat), [[Simple cuboidal epithelium|cuboidal]] or [[Columnar epithelial cell|columnar]] and rest on a [[basal lamina]], the upper layer of the [[basement membrane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorland's|title=Illustrated Medical Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorland's|title=Illustrated Medical Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|isbn=978-1-4160-6257-8|page=1002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the [[respiratory tract]] there is a type of [[pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium|ciliated]] epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are [[Microvillus|microvilli]] on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are [[Intestinal villus|intestinal villi]]. [[Skin]] consists of an outer layer of [[keratin]]ized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. [[Keratinocyte]]s make up to 95% of the cells in the [[epidermis (skin)|skin]].&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, J.A.; Eady, R.A.; Pope, F.M. (2004). Rook's Textbook of Dermatology (7th ed.). Blackwell Publishing. pp. 3.1–3.6. {{ISBN|978-0-632-06429-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a [[cuticle]]. In simple animals this may just be a coat of [[glycoproteins]].&lt;ref name="Ruppert60" /&gt; In more advanced animals, many [[gland]]s are formed of epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/BerndCV/Lab/EpithelialInfoWeb/Glandular%20Epithelium.html |title=Glandular epithelium |author=Bernt, Karen |year=2010 |work=Epithelial Cells |publisher=Davidson College |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscle tissue===
[[File:Skeletal muscle - cross section, nerve bundle.jpg|right|thumb|Cross section through [[skeletal muscle]] and a small [[nerve]] at high magnification ([[H&amp;E stain]])]]
[[Myocyte|Muscle cells]] (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. [[Muscle tissue]] functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile [[Myofibril|filaments]] and is separated into three main types; [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]], [[Skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]] and [[cardiac muscle]]. Smooth muscle has no [[Striated muscle tissue|striations]] when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as [[sea anemone]] tentacles and the body wall of [[sea cucumber]]s. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in [[earthworm]]s that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions.&lt;ref name=Ruppert103&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the [[uterus]], [[bladder]], [[intestines]], [[stomach]], o[[esophagus]], [[respiratory airways]], and [[blood vessel]]s. [[Cardiac muscle]] is found only in the [[heart]], allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.

===Nervous tissue===
[[Nervous tissue]] is composed of many nerve cells known as [[neuron]]s which transmit information. In some slow-moving [[Symmetry in biology#Radial symmetry|radially symmetrical]] marine animals such as [[ctenophore]]s and [[cnidarian]]s (including [[sea anemone]]s and [[jellyfish]]), the nerves form a [[nerve net]], but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as [[chemoreceptor]]s and [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] are found in groups and send messages along [[biological neural network|neural networks]] to other parts of the organism. Neurons can be connected together in [[Ganglion|ganglia]].&lt;ref name=Ruppert104&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a [[central nervous system]] (brain and spinal cord) and a [[peripheral nervous system]]. The latter consists of [[Sensory neuron|sensory nerves]] that transmit information from sense organs and [[Motor neuron|motor nerves]] that influence target organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grey's Anatomy: Descriptive and Applied |year=1944 |edition=28 |page=1038 |publisher=Langmans |editor1-last=Johnston | editor1-first= T.B |editor2-last=Whillis | editor2-first=J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruppert107&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=105–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral nervous system is divided into the [[somatic nervous system]] which conveys sensation and controls [[voluntary muscle]], and the [[autonomic nervous system]] which involuntarily controls [[smooth muscle]], certain glands and internal organs, including the [[stomach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.inkling.com/read/essential-clinical-anatomy-keith-moore-4th/introduction-to-clinical-anatomy/nervous-system | title=Essesntial Clinical Anatomy | publisher=Inkling | work=Nervous System | date=2010 |edition=4th | accessdate=30 April 2014 |author1=Moore, K. |author2=Agur, A. |author3=Dalley, A.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
{{see also|Comparative anatomy}}
[[File:VolRenderShearWarp.gif|thumb|upright|[[Mouse]] skull]]
All [[vertebrate]]s have a similar basic [[body plan]] and at some point in their lives, mostly in the [[embryogenesis|embryonic]] stage, share the major [[chordate]] characteristics; a stiffening rod, the [[notochord]]; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the [[neural tube]]; [[pharyngeal arch]]es; and a tail posterior to the anus. The [[spinal cord]] is protected by the [[vertebral column]] and is above the notochord and the [[Gut (anatomy)|gastrointestinal tract]] is below it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |title=Vertebrates: More on Morphology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/vertebrates/vertmm.html |publisher=UCMP |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nervous tissue is derived from the [[ectoderm]], connective tissues are derived from [[mesoderm]], and gut is derived from the [[endoderm]]. At the posterior end is a [[tail]] which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the [[anus]] at the base of the tail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Vertebrate Body |last=Romer |first=Alfred Sherwood |year=1985 |publisher=Holt Rinehart &amp; Winston |isbn=978-0-03-058446-6 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the [[vertebral column]], formed in the development of the segmented series of [[vertebra]]e. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the [[nucleus pulposus]] of the [[intervertebral disc]]s. However, a few vertebrates, such as the [[sturgeon]] and the [[coelacanth]] retain the notochord into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Functional anatomy of the vertebrates: an evolutionary perspective|year=2001|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|isbn=978-0-03-022369-3|author=Liem, Karel F.|author2=Warren Franklin Walker|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gnathostomata|Jawed vertebrates]] are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by [[Charles Darwin]] to support his theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/evolution/science/what-is-homology |title=What is Homology? |date=17 October 2008 |publisher=National Center for Science Education |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish anatomy ===
{{main|Fish anatomy}}
[[File:Internal anatomy of a fish (cutaway diagram).jpg|thumb|left|Cutaway diagram showing various organs of a fish]]
The body of a fish is divided into a head, trunk and tail, although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in [[cartilaginous fish]], or bone in [[bony fish]]. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating [[vertebra]]e which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the [[fish fin|fins]], are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the [[caudal fin]]s, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.&lt;ref name=Dorit818/&gt; The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the [[gill]]s and on round the body in a single circulatory loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003758/Development/fish.htm |title=The fish heart |work=ThinkQuest |publisher=Oracle |accessdate=27 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428001536/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003758/Development/fish.htm |archivedate=28 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or [[middle ear]]. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the [[lateral line]] system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.&lt;ref name=Dorit818&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

Sharks and rays are [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] fish with numerous [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal [[Fish scale#Placoid scales|placoid scales]]. They have a [[cloaca]] into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a [[swim bladder]]. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, [[Egg yolk|yolky]] eggs. Some species are [[ovoviviparous]] and the young develop internally but others are [[oviparous]] and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.&lt;ref name=Kotpal&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Vertebrates |last=Kotpal |first=R.

The bony fish lineage shows more [[Derived trait|derived]] anatomical traits, often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]], and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping [[Fish scale|scales]]. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.&lt;ref name=Kotpal/&gt;

=== Amphibian anatomy ===
{{main|Amphibian anatomy}}
[[File:Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton front.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Frog skeleton|Skeleton of [[Surinam horned frog]] (''Ceratophrys cornuta'')]]
[[File:Frog anatomy tags.PNG|thumb|upright|Plastic model of a frog]]
[[Amphibian]]s are a [[Class (biology)|class]] of animals comprising [[frog]]s, [[salamander]]s and [[caecilian]]s. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, but contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and [[metabolic waste#nitrogen wastes|nitrogenous waste products]] are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Amphibians breathe by means of [[buccal pumping]], a pump action in which air is first drawn into the [[Buccopharyngeal membrane|buccopharyngeal]] region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=Robert C. Stebbins|last2=Cohen |first2=Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03281-5 |pages=24–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They supplement this with [[gas exchange]] through the skin which needs to be kept moist.&lt;ref name=Dorit859&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

In frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble [[earthworm]]s and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last1=Stebbins |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=Robert C.

=== Reptile anatomy ===
{{main|Reptile anatomy}}
[[File:Crotalus atrox -Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA-29Aug2012.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton of a [[diamondback rattlesnake]]]]
'''[[Reptile]]s''' are a class of animals comprising [[turtle]]s, [[tuatara]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s and [[crocodile]]s. They are [[tetrapod]]s, but the snakes and a few species of [[lizard]] either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their [[lung]]s by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a [[Sex organ|copulatory organ]] present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by [[Amniote|amniotic membranes]] which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or [[Ovoviviparity|develop internally]] in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as [[uric acid]].&lt;ref name=Dorit865&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=861–865 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turtles''' are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny [[carapace]] above and a [[plastron]] below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.&lt;ref name=Dorit868&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=865–868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tuataras''' superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the [[Triassic]] period. There is one living species, ''[[Sphenodon punctatus]]''. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. The tuatara has a well-developed [[parietal eye]] on its forehead.&lt;ref name=Dorit868/&gt;

'''Lizards''' have skulls with only one [[Skull#Fenestrae|fenestra]] on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.&lt;ref name=Dorit868/&gt;

'''Snakes''' are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the [[Cretaceous]] period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of [[pelvic spur]]s. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent "spectacle" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.&lt;ref name=Dorit870&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |page=870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crocodilians''' are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.&lt;ref name=Dorit874&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R.

=== Bird anatomy ===
{{main|Bird anatomy}}
[[File:Duerer wing of a blue roller.jpg|thumb|Part of a wing. [[Albrecht Dürer]], c.&amp;nbsp;1500–1512]]
Birds are [[tetrapod]]s but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping, their front limbs are [[wing]]s covered with [[feather]]s and adapted for flight. Birds are [[endotherm]]ic, have a high [[metabolic rate]], a light [[Skeleton|skeletal system]] and powerful [[muscle]]s. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.&lt;ref name=Dorit895&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing |isbn=978-0-03-030504-7 |pages=881–895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feathers are outgrowths of the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single [[uropygial gland]] near the base of the tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird [[personal grooming|preens]]. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes.&lt;ref name=Dorit895/&gt;

=== Mammal anatomy ===
{{Main|Mammal anatomy}}
[[Mammal]]s are a diverse class of animals, mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of [[Tooth enamel|prismatic enamel]]. The teeth are shed once ([[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]]) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in [[cetacea]]ns. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a [[cochlea]] in the [[inner ear]]. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete [[sweat gland|sweat]]. Some of these glands are specialized as [[mammary gland]]s, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with [[lung]]s and have a muscular [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.&lt;ref name=Dorit914&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R.

Mammals are [[amniote]]s, and most are [[Viviparity|viviparous]], giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying [[monotreme]]s, the [[platypus]] and the [[echidna]]s of Australia. Most other mammals have a [[placenta]] through which the developing [[foetus]] obtains nourishment, but in [[marsupial]]s, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]] where it latches on to a [[nipple]] and completes its development.&lt;ref name=Dorit914/&gt;

Humans have the overall body plan of a mammal. Humans have a [[human head|head]], [[neck]], [[Trunk (anatomy)|trunk]] (which includes the [[thorax]] and [[abdomen]]), two [[arm]]s and [[hand]]s, and two [[human leg|legs]] and [[foot|feet]].

Generally, students of certain [[biology|biological sciences]], [[paramedic]]s, prosthetists and orthotists, [[physical therapy|physiotherapists]], [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], [[nursing|nurses]], [[podiatry|podiatrists]], and [[medical school|medical students]] learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of [[dissection]] and inspection of [[cadaver]]s. The study of microscopic anatomy (or [[histology]]) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a [[microscope]].

Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school. Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems.&lt;ref name="intro HGray" /&gt; The major anatomy textbook, [[Gray's Anatomy]], has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intl.elsevierhealth.com/catalogue/title.cfm?ISBN=0443071683 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205184205/http://intl.elsevierhealth.com/catalogue/title.cfm?ISBN=0443071683 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 December 2004 |title=Publisher's page for Gray's Anatomy. 39th edition (UK). 2004 |isbn=0-443-07168-3 |accessdate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/product.jsp?isbn=0443071683 |title=Publisher's page for Gray's Anatomy. 39th edition (US). 2004 |isbn=0-443-07168-3 |accessdate=19 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070209134753/http://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/product.jsp?isbn=0443071683 |archivedate=9 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially [[surgery|surgeons]] and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as [[histopathology]] and [[radiology]].

Academic anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.&lt;ref name=AAA/&gt;

== Invertebrate anatomy ==
[[File:Chirocephalus diaphanus male head.png|thumb|Head of a male ''[[Daphnia]]'', a [[planktonic]] crustacean]]
[[Invertebrate]]s constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular [[eukaryote]]s such as ''[[Paramecium]]'' to such complex multicellular animals as the [[octopus]], [[lobster]] and [[dragonfly]]. They constitute about 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell [[protozoa]]ns have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by [[Cilium|cilia]] or [[Flagellum|flagella]] or may proceed via the advance of [[pseudopodia]], food may be gathered by [[phagocytosis]], energy needs may be supplied by [[photosynthesis]] and the cell may be supported by an [[endoskeleton]] or an [[exoskeleton]]. Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology, 7th edition |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=81-315-0104-3 |pages=23–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metazoa]]ns are multicellular organism, different groups of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an [[extracellular matrix]] which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the [[mesoderm]] is present in [[echinoderm]]s, [[sponge]]s and some [[cephalopod]]s. [[Exoskeleton]]s are derived from the epidermis and is composed of [[chitin]] in [[arthropod]]s (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). [[Calcium carbonate]] constitutes the shells of [[Mollusca|molluscs]], [[brachiopod]]s and some tube-building [[Polychaete|polychaete worms]] and [[silica]] forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic [[diatom]]s and [[radiolaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/198292/exoskeleton |title=Exoskeleton |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the [[pinacoderm]] of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians ([[polyp]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, [[jellyfish]]) and the [[collagen]]ous cuticle of [[annelid]]s. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as [[Microvillus|microvilli]], cilia, bristles, [[Spine (zoology)|spines]] and [[tubercle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289723/integument |title=Integument |author= Ebling, F.

[[Marcello Malpighi]], the father of microscopical anatomy, discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being captured above the ring.&lt;ref name="ArberAgnes"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arber, Agnes|title= Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694): an essay in comparison|journal= Isis |volume =34|issue=1| pages =7–16|jstor=225992|doi=10.1086/347742|year= 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Insect]]s possess [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering, the [[exoskeleton]], made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] and an [[abdomen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O.

[[Spider]]s a class of [[arachnid]]s have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a [[cephalothorax]] and an [[abdomen]]. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called [[chelicerae]] which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called [[pedipalp]]s attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the [[palpal bulb|copulatory organ]].

[[File:Foetal positions in uterus, pregnant female Wellcome L0000845.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Image of early rendition of anatomy findings]]

In 1600 BCE, the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], an [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Ancient Egyptian]] [[Medical manual|medical text]], described the [[heart]], its vessels, [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[kidneys]], [[hypothalamus]], [[uterus]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], and showed the [[blood vessel]]s diverging from the heart.

Ancient Greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world.  Over time, this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. Phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made, which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and the nervous system.

The [[Hellenistic Egypt]]ian city of [[Alexandria]] was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology. Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the Greeks, but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the [[Ptolemy]] rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states.&lt;ref name=Longrigg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Longrigg|first1=James|title=Anatomy in Alexandria in the Third Century B.C|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|date=December 1988|volume=21|issue=4|pages=455–488|jstor=4026964|doi=10.1017/s000708740002536x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria.&lt;ref name=Longrigg /&gt; Two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were [[Herophilus]] and [[Erasistratus]]. These two physicians helped pioneer human [[dissection]] for medical research.

In England, anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science; these were given by the [[Barber surgeon|Company of Barbers and Surgeons]] in the 16th century, joined in 1583 by the Lumleian lectures in surgery at the [[Royal College of Physicians]].&lt;ref name=Boas229&gt;{{cite book | title=The Scientific Renaissance 1450–1630 | publisher=Fontana | author=Boas, Marie | year=1970 |origyear=first published by Collins, 1962 | page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century. Classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain. Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York were all renowned for [[body snatching]] activity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins.&lt;ref name=trafficdead&gt;{{cite book |author=Sappol, Michael |title=A traffic of dead bodies: anatomy and embodied social identity in nineteenth-century America |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |year=2002 |isbn=0-691-05925-X |url=https://books.google.com/books/princeton?id=-9cKRzEx6ywC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Traffic+of+Dead+Bodies}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even [[anatomy murder]] were practised to obtain cadavers.&lt;ref name="Rosner, Lisa. 2010"&gt;Rosner, Lisa. 2010.

Forbes]] of [[Jefferson Medical College]] was found guilty in 1882 of "complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in Lebanon Cemetery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jefferson.edu/about/eakins/forbes.html |title=Reproduction of Portrait of Professor William S.

The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]], [[Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen)|Regius Professor of Anatomy]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] from 1863 to 1889. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of "pre-clinical" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of [[comparative anatomy]], published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the [[Tay Whale]].&lt;ref name=pmid1717373426&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterston SW, Laing MR, Hutchison JD | title = Nineteenth century medical education for tomorrow's doctors | journal = Scottish Medical Journal | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–49 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17373426 | doi=10.1258/rsmsmj.52.1.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15712576"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waterston SW, Hutchison JD | title = Sir John Struthers MD FRCS Edin LLD Glasg: Anatomist, zoologist and pioneer in medical education | journal = The Surgeon : Journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 347–351 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15712576 | doi=10.1016/s1479-666x(04)80035-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools.&lt;ref name="McLachlan, J. 2006. p.243-53"&gt;McLachlan, J. &amp; Patten, D. 2006.

He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/534198/Ignaz-Philipp-Semmelweis |title=Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis |work=Encyclopædia Britannica  |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siemens-electron-microscope.jpg|upright|right|thumb|An electron microscope from 1973]]
Before the modern medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were [[dissection]] of the dead and [[inspection]], [[palpation]] and [[auscultation]] of the living. It was the advent of [[microscopy]] that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of [[achromatic lens]]es increased the [[Angular resolution|resolving power]] of the microscope and around 1839, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]] identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the [[microtome]] was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of [[histology]] and [[Cell biology|cytology]] began in the late 19th century&lt;ref name=BritMicro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/22980/anatomy/283/Microscopic-anatomy |title=Microscopic anatomy |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of [[biopsy]] specimens. The invention of the [[electron microscope]] brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the [[ultrastructure]] of cells and the [[organelle]]s and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of [[X-ray diffraction]] for studying the crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of [[molecular anatomy]].&lt;ref name=BritMicro/&gt;
[[File:Acta Eruditorum - III medicina, 1691 – BEIC 13350590.jpg|thumb|Illustration from [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1691]]
Equally important advances have occurred in  ''non-invasive'' techniques for examining the interior structures of the body. [[X-ray]]s can be passed through the body and used in medical [[radiography]] and [[fluoroscopy]] to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]], [[X-ray computed tomography|computed tomography]], and [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound imaging]] have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/ap/foxhumphys/student/olc/h-reading1.html | title=Anatomical Imaging | publisher=McGraw Hill Higher Education | year=1998 | accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basic Formal Ontology''' ('''BFO''') is a top level ontology developed by [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]] and his associates for the purposes of promoting interoperability among domain ontologies that are built in its terms through a process of downward population.&lt;ref name="BFO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://basic-formal-ontology.org/ |title=Home |website=Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) |accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of BFO is based on a division of entities into two disjoint categories of '''continuant''' and '''occurrent''', the former comprehending for example objects and spatial regions, the latter comprehending processes conceived as extended through (or as spanning) time. BFO thereby seeks to incorporate both three-dimensionalist and four-dimensionalist perspectives on reality within a single framework.

==Applications==

BFO has been adopted as a foundational ontology by over 300 ontology projects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Users |url=http://basic-formal-ontology.org/users.html |website=Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, principally in the areas of biomedical ontology and security and defense (intelligence) ontology.&lt;ref name="BFO"/&gt; An example application of BFO can be seen in the [[Ontology for Biomedical Investigations]] (OBI) and in the [[Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry]]

'''Bloom''' is a test to measure the strength of a [[gel]] or [[gelatin]]. The test was originally developed and patented in 1925 by Oscar T. Bloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US1540979 Machine for testing jelly strength of glues, gelatins, and the like|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US1540979|website=Google Patents|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test determines the weight in grams needed by a specified plunger (normally with a diameter of 0.5 inch) to depress the surface of the gel by 4&amp;nbsp;mm without breaking it at a specified temperature.&lt;ref name="GelatineHandbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schrieber|first1=Reinhard|last2=Gareis|first2=Herbert|title=Gelatine Handbook: Theory and Industrial Practice|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-3-527-61097-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of grams is called the Bloom value, and most gelatins are between 30 and 300&amp;nbsp;g Bloom. The higher a Bloom value, the higher the melting and gelling points of a gel, and the shorter its gelling times.&lt;ref name="GelatineHandbook"/&gt;  This method is most often used on soft gels. To perform the Bloom test on gelatin, a 6.67% gelatin solution is kept for 17–18 hours at 10&amp;nbsp;°C prior to being tested.

Various gelatins are categorized as "low Bloom", "medium Bloom", or "high Bloom", but there are not universally defined specific values for these subranges.&lt;!-- compare Phillips &amp; Williams to Sigma-Aldrich refs --&gt; Gelatin is a [[biopolymer]] material composed of [[polypeptide]] chains of varying length. The longer the chain, the higher the Bloom number:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Product_Information_Sheet/2/g9382pis.pdf |publisher= Sigma-Aldrich |title= Gelatins—product information sheet |accessdate= 2017-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:lichfieldclose.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|[[Cathedral Close, Lichfield|Lichfield Cathedral Close]]]]
A '''cathedral close''' is the area immediately around a [[cathedral]], sometimes extending for a hundred metres or more from the main cathedral building. In Europe in the Middle Ages, and often later, it was usually all the property of the cathedral and under the bishop or cathedral's legal jurisdiction rather than that of the city. It normally had gates which were locked at night or when there were disturbances in the city, hence the name. It usually included buildings housing diocesan offices, schools, free-standing chapels associated with the cathedral, and the palace of the [[bishop]] and other [[clergy]] houses associated with the cathedral. They sometimes but not necessarily are arranged in a sort of square around a courtyard, as in the close at [[Salisbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/file/map-salisbury-cathedral-closejpg-3 map of the close at [[Salisbury Cathedral]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The German term is [[Domfreiheit]].

Today there are often residences of non-clerics, which may include official or prominent persons such as judges' houses. Until recent local government reforms many cathedral closes still functioned as separate administrative unit: [[St. David's]] cathedral close, in [[Pembrokeshire]], counted as a separate civil parish from that of the adjacent village-city for some 50 years after the [[disestablishment]] in Wales. Others still have the secularised former residences of canons but no resident senior clergy. In other cities, such as [[Trier]], property close to the cathedral is occupied by clergy.

==In literature==

The Barchester novels ([[Chronicles of Barsetshire]]) of [[Anthony Trollope]] are set largely in the cathedral close of the fictional town of Barchester.

A '''crash simulation''' is a [[Virtuality|virtual]] recreation of a destructive [[crash test]] of a [[car]] or a highway [[Traffic barrier|guard rail system]] using a [[computer simulation]] in order to examine the level of safety of the car and its occupants. Crash [[simulation]]s are used by [[automaker]]s during [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) analysis for [[crashworthiness]] in the [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) process of modelling new cars. During a crash simulation, the [[kinetic energy]], or energy of motion, that a [[vehicle]] has before the impact is transformed into [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] [[energy]], mostly by [[plastic deformation]] ([[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]) of the car body material ([[Body in White]]), at the end of the impact.

Data obtained from a crash simulation indicate the capability of the car body or guard rail structure to protect the vehicle occupants during a [[collision]] (and also [[pedestrian]]s hit by a car) against [[injury]]. Important results are the deformations (for example, [[steering wheel]] intrusions) of the occupant space (driver, [[passenger]]s) and the [[deceleration]]s (for example, head acceleration) felt by them, which must fall below threshold values fixed in legal [[car safety]] [[regulations]]. To model real crash tests, today's crash simulations include virtual models of [[crash test dummy|crash test dummies]] and of passive safety devices ([[seat belts]], [[airbags]], shock absorbing [[dash boards]], etc.). Guide rail tests evaluate vehicle deceleration and rollover potential, as well as penetration of the barrier by vehicles.

== Origin ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PLANE CRASH1a.JPG|thumb|right|Simulation of an aircraft impact on a nuclear power plant (program HEMP-ESI)]] --&gt;
In the years 1970 attempts were made to simulate car crash events with [[non-linear]] spring-mass systems after [[calibration]], which require as an input the results of physical destructive laboratory tests, needed to determine the mechanical crushing behavior of each spring component of the modeled system.  "[[First principle]]" simulations like more elaborate finite element models, however, need only the definition of the structural geometry and the basic material properties ([[rheology]] of car body steel, glass, plastic parts, etc.) as an input to generate the numerical model.

The origins of industrial first principle computerized car crash simulation lie in [[military defense]], [[outer space]] and civil [[nuclear power plant]] applications. Upon presentation of a simulation of the accidental crash of a military [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] plane into a nuclear power plant on May 30, 1978 by [http://www.esi-group.com ESI Group] in a meeting organized by the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure]] (VDI) in [[Stuttgart]], car makers became alerted to the possibility of using this technology for the simulation of destructive car crash tests (Haug 1981).

[[Image:POLO1a.JPG|thumb|left|The first successful frontal full car crash simulation: a Volkswagen Polo collided with a rigid concrete barrier at 50 km/h (ESI 1986).]]
In the following years, German car makers produced more complex crash simulation studies, simulating the crash behavior of individual car body components, component assemblies, and quarter and half car bodies in white ([[Body in White|BIW]]). These experiments culminated in a joint project by the Forschungsgemeinschaft Automobil-Technik (FAT), a conglomeration of all seven German car makers ([[Audi]], [[BMW]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Opel]], [[Porsche]], and [[Volkswagen]]), which tested the applicability of two emerging commercial crash simulation codes. These simulation codes recreated a frontal impact of a full passenger car structure (Haug 1986) and they ran to completion on a computer overnight. Now that turn-around time between two consecutive job-submissions (computer runs) did not exceed one day, engineers were able to make efficient and progressive improvements of the crash behavior of the analyzed car body structure.

== Application ==
Crash simulations are used to investigate the [[safety]] of the car occupants during impacts on the front end structure of the car in a "[[head-on collision]]" or "frontal impact", the lateral structure of the car in a “[[side collision]]” or “side impact”, the rear end structure of a car in a "[[rear-end collision]]" or “rear impact”, and the roof structure of the car when it overturns during a "[[rollover]]". Crash simulations can also be used to assess injury to [[pedestrians]] hit by a car.

== Benefits ==
A crash simulation produces results without actual [[destructive testing]] of a new car model. This way, tests can be performed quickly and inexpensively in a computer, which permits optimization of the design before a real prototype of the car has been manufactured. Using a simulation, problems can be solved before spending time and money on an actual crash test. The great flexibility of [[Printing|printed]] output and [[graphical display]] enables designers to solve some problems that would have been nearly impossible without the help of a computer.

== Analysis ==
[[Image:Thin Shell FE.JPG|thumb|right|340px|A subdivision of the metal exterior of the car, called a finite element, is connected to nodes at each vertex.]] 
Large number of crash simulations use a method of analysis called the [[Finite Element Method]]. The complex problems are solved by dividing a surface into a large but still finite number of elements and determining the motion of these elements over very small periods of time. Another approach to crash simulations is performed by application of [[Macro Element Method]]. The difference between two mentioned above methodologies is that the structure in case of Macro Element Method consists of smaller number of elements. The calculation algorithm of structure deformation is based on experimental data rather than calculated from partial differential equations.
 
Pam-Crash started crash simulation and together with [[LS-DYNA]] is a software package which is widely used for application of Finite Element Method. This method allows detailed modeling of a structure, but the disadvantage lies in high processing unit requirements and calculation time. 
The Visual Crash Studio uses Macro Element Methodology. In comparison with FEM it has some modeling and boundary condition limitations but its application does not require advanced computers and the calculation time is incomparably smaller. Two presented methods complement each other. Macro Element Method is useful at early stage of the structure design process while Finite Element Method performs well at its final stages.

=== Structural analysis ===
In a typical crash simulation, the car body structure is analyzed using spatial [[discretization]], that is,  breaking up the continuous movement of the body in real time into smaller changes in position over small, discrete time steps. The discretization involves subdividing the surface of the constituent, thin, [[sheet metal]] parts into a large number (approaching one million in 2006) of [[quadrilateral]] or triangular regions, each of which spans the area between "nodes" to which its corners are fixed. Each element has mass, which is distributed as concentrated masses and as [[moment of inertia|mass moments of inertia]] to its connecting nodes. Each node has 6 kinematic [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]], that is,  one node can move in three linear directions under [[translation (physics)|translation]] and can [[rotation|rotate]] about three independent axes. The spatial [[coordinates]] (''x''), [[displacement (distance)|displacement]] (''u''), [[velocity]] (''v''), and [[acceleration]] (''a'') of each node is mostly expressed in a three-dimensional rectangular [[Cartesian coordinate system]] with axes ''X'',''Y'', and ''Z''.

If the nodes move during a crash simulation, the connected elements move, stretch, and bend with their nodes, which causes them to impart forces and [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] to their nodal connections. The forces and moments at the nodes correspond to the inertia forces and moments, caused by their translational (linear) and [[angular acceleration]]s and to the forces and moments transmitted by the [[strength of materials|resistance]] of the structural material of the connected elements as they deform. Sometimes, additional external [[structural loads]] are applied, like gravity loads from the self weight of the parts, or added loads from external masses.

The forces and moments of all nodes are collected into a [[column vector]] (or column matrix), and the time dependent [[equation of motion|equations of motion]] (in dynamic equilibrium) can be written as follows.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ma} = \mathbf{F}_{ext} - \mathbf{F}_{int}&lt;/math&gt; 
where vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Ma}&lt;/math&gt;  (mass times acceleration vector) collects the inertia forces at the nodes, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{ext}&lt;/math&gt; collects the external nodal loads, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{int}&lt;/math&gt; collects the internal resisting forces from the deformation of the material. ''M'' is a [[diagonal matrix]] of the nodal masses.  Each vector (''u'', ''v'', ''a'', ''F'', etc.) has [[dimension]] 6 times the total number of nodes in the crash model (about 6 million “[[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]]” for every 1 million "nodes" in 3-D thin shell finite element models).

=== Time analysis ===
A crash simulation uses time discretization as well to separate the continuous changes in time into very small, usable segments. The dynamic [[equations of motion]] hold at all times during a crash simulation and must be integrated in time, ''t'', starting from an [[initial condition]] at time zero, which is just prior to the crash. According to the explicit [[finite difference]] [[time integration method]] used by most crash codes, the accelerations, velocities, and displacements of the body are related by the following equations.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{n} = \mathbf{M}^{-1}(\mathbf{F}_{ext} - \mathbf{F}_{int})_n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2} = \mathbf{v}_{n-1/2} + \mathbf{a}_{n}\Delta t_n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_{n+1} = \mathbf{u}_n + \mathbf{v}_{n+1/2}\Delta t_{n+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
In these equations the subscripts ''n''±1/2, ''n'', ''n''+1 denote past, present, and future times, ''t'', at half and full-time intervals with time steps &lt;math&gt;\Delta t_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta t_{n+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

=== Solution ===
The above [[system of linear equations]] is solved for the accelerations, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_{n}&lt;/math&gt;, the velocities, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{n+1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, and the displacements, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, at each discrete point in time, ''t'', during the crash [[interval (time)|duration]]. This solution is trivial, since the mass matrix is diagonal. The computer time is proportional to the number of finite elements and the number of solution time steps. The stable solution time step, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, is limited for [[numerical stability]], as expressed by the [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition]] (CFL), which states that “in any time-marching computer simulation, the time step must be less than the time for some significant action to occur, and preferably considerably less." In a crash simulation, the fastest significant actions are the acoustic signals that travel inside the structural material.

The solid elastic stress wave speed amounts to
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{E_0/\rho}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial elastic modulus (before [[plastic deformation]]) of the material and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density. The largest stable time step for a given material is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = d_{min}\sqrt{\rho/E_0}&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;d_{min}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest distance between any two nodes of the numerical crash simulation model.

Since this distance can change during a simulation, the stable time step changes and must be updated continually as the solution proceeds in time. When using [[steel]], the typical value of the stable time step is about one [[microsecond]] when the smallest discrete node distance in the mesh of the finite element model is about 5 millimeters. It needs then more than 100,000 time intervals to solve a crash event that lasts for one tenth of a second. This figure is exceeded in many industrial crash models demanding optimized crash solvers with High-Performance Computing ([[High-performance computing|HPC]]) features, such as [[Array programming|vectorization]] and [[parallel computing]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1248">In [[physics]], '''deconfinement''' (in contrast to [[confinement (physics)|confinement]]) is the property of a [[Phase of matter|phase]] in which certain particles are allowed to exist as free [[Excited state|excitations]], rather than only within [[bound state]]s.

'''Degas''' is a [[ray system|rayed]] [[Impact crater|crater]] on [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] at latitude 37.5 N, longitude 127 W. It is 54&amp;nbsp;km (27&amp;nbsp;mi) wide and was named after the French impressionist painter [[Edgar Degas]]. Its name was adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in 1979. The rays consist of light colored material blasted out during the crater's formation. Craters older than Degas are covered by the ray material, while younger craters are seen superimposed on the rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=16 December 2000 |title=Degas Ray Crater on Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Degas merc mar10 big.gif|thumb|left|100px|Degas Crater and rays, in a 1974 ''[[Mariner 10]]'' image.]]
Degas forms a crater pair with [[Brontë (Mercurian crater)|Brontë]] to the north and is surrounded by [[Sobkou Planitia]]. Almost south is [[Heine (crater)|Heine]] and further east are [[Damer (crater)|Damer]] and [[Gibran (crater)|Gibran]].

The crater's floor contains cracks that formed as the pool of [[impact melt]] cooled and shrank. The high-reflectance material on the walls and in the central portion of the crater probably has a composition distinct from that of the crater floor and surroundings. The illumination conditions and down-slope movement of eroded material exposing fresh rock also contribute to the bright appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=547  Degas Crater] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914010753/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=1&amp;gallery_id=2&amp;image_id=547 |date=2014-09-14 }} at NASA Messenger website.

'''Design-based research''' (DBR) is a type of [[research methodology]] used by researchers in the [[Learning Sciences|learning sciences]], which is a sub-field of education.  The basic process of DBR involves developing solutions (called "interventions") to problems. Then, the interventions are put to use to test the how well they work. The iterations may then be adapted and re-tested to gather more data. The purpose of this approach is to generate new theories and frameworks for conceptualizing learning, instruction,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, C., Hill, L., Lock, J., Altowairiki, N., Ostrowski, C., da Rosa dos Santos, L., &amp; Liu, Y. (2017). Using design-based research to develop meaningful online discussions in undergraduate field experience courses. ''International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 18''(6). Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2901/4373&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; design processes, and educational reform. Data analysis often takes the form of iterative comparisons.

== Role of design-based research within the learning sciences ==

Methodologically, the [[Learning Sciences|learning sciences]] differs from other fields in educational research. It focuses on the study of learners, their localities, and their communities.  The design-based research methodology is often used by learning scientists in their inquiries because this [[methodological framework]] considers the subject of study to be a [[complex system]] involving [[emergent properties]] that arise from the interaction of more variables than are initially known to researchers, including variables stemming from the researchers themselves (Brown, 1992). Rather than attempting to isolate all the various factors that impact learning as in traditional research, the learning sciences employ design based research methodologies which appeal to an approach to the study of learning – in particular human learning both inside and outside of school – that embraces the [[complex system]] nature of learning systems.  Learning scientists often look at the interactions amongst variables as key components to study, yet acknowledge that within learning environments the interactions are often too complex to study all or completely understand.  This stance has been validated by the findings of [[Lee Cronbach|Cronbach]] and [[Richard E. Snow|Snow]] (1977) which suggest that Aptitude-Treatment Interactions, where variables are isolated in an effort to determine what factors "most" influence learning, will not be informative but rather inaccurate and potentially misleading if used as a ground for educational decisions or educational research of complex learning situations such as those characteristic of human beings in their lived experiences.

== History and controversy ==

The method was first proposed as design-experiments by Allan Collins in 1990 and Ann Brown in 1992. Collins originally proposed design-experiments as contributing to a 'design science', like aeronautics or artificial intelligence, rather than analytic science that seeks to explain natural phenomena. In the mid-1990s, a group called the National Design Experiment Consortium was founded by the late Jan Hawkins, then of Educational Development Corporation, to refine the method. In 1999, Christopher Hoadley founded the Design-Based Research Collective, funded by the Spencer Foundation, and coined the modern term for the method.

Design-based research methodologies are often viewed as non-scientific by traditional experimental psychologists because design-based research does not follow formal definitions of scientific method.  In 2000, Charles Desforges famously called design experiments 'neither designed, nor experiments'. Design-based research is viewed as an outgrowth of product development processes rather than scientific research. Critics see "design science" as an application of science to develop products or instructional interventions rather than scientific research. Some researchers question whether design-based research is primarily useful as an exploratory research method geared towards producing designed artifacts, or whether it can validly test robust theories that are contingent on designed artifacts or interventions.

==Varieties and forms of design-based research methodologies==

As mentioned in the conclusion to the 2008 ICLS keynote([http://www.isls.org/icls/2008/]), there are several forms of design based research now in use in education research.  These are associated with papers from:
*[[Ann Brown|Brown]] and [[Allan Collins (education)|Collins]]
*Cobb
*Hmelo-Silver
*Kelly &amp; [[Richard Lesh|Lesh]]

'''Didier Queloz''' (born February 23, 1966) is an astronomer with a prolific record in finding [[extrasolar planets]] in the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|Astrophysics Group]] of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], Cambridge, and also at the [[University of Geneva]].

In 1995 Queloz was a [[Ph.D.]] student at the [[University of Geneva]] when he and [[Michel Mayor]], his doctoral advisor, discovered the first exoplanet around a [[main sequence]] [[star]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20140512"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Finder of New Worlds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/science/finder-of-new-worlds.html |date=12 May 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=13 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queloz performed an analysis on [[51 Pegasi]] using radial velocity measurements ([[Doppler spectroscopy]]), and was astonished to find a planet with an orbital period of 4.2 days. He had been performing the analysis as an exercise to hone his skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url= |author1=Mayor, Michael |author2=Queloz, Didier | title=A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=378 |issue=6555 |year=1995 | pages=355–359| doi=10.1038/378355a0| format= | bibcode=1995Natur.378..355M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planet, [[51 Pegasi b]], challenged the then accepted views of planetary formation, being a [[hot Jupiter]] or roaster.
He has received the 2011 [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards|BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] of Basic Sciences (co-winner with [[Michel Mayor]]) for developing new astronomical instruments and experimental techniques that led to the first observation of planets outside the solar system.
In 2017 he received the [[Wolf Prize in Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Wolf-Prize-to-be-awarded-to-eight-laureates-from-US-UK-and-Switzerland-477364 Jerusalempost Wolf Prizes 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fertilisation of Orchids''''' is a book by English naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] published on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title ''On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing''.&lt;ref name=freeman&gt;{{citation |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_FertilisationofOrchids.html |title=Fertilisation of Orchids |publisher= Darwin Online |accessdate=2 February 2009}}&amp;nbsp;– Bibliographical introduction from: Freeman, R. B. (1977) ''The Works of Charles Darwin: An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist''. 2nd edn. Dawson: Folkstone.&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's previous book, ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', had briefly mentioned [[evolution]]ary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin—a relief from the drudgery of writing—developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.

The book was his first detailed demonstration of the power of [[natural selection]], and explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the [[coevolution]] of [[Orchidaceae|orchid]]s and insects. The view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on coevolution and the evolution of extreme specialisation. It influenced [[botany|botanist]]s, and revived interest in the neglected idea that insects played a part in [[pollination|pollinating]] flowers. It opened up the new study areas of pollination research and reproductive ecology, directly related to Darwin's ideas on evolution, and supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by [[Allogamy|cross-fertilisation]]. Although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low, it established Darwin as a leading botanist. ''Orchids'' was the first in a series of books on his innovative investigations into plants.

The book describes how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which [[natural theology]] attributed to a [[Deism|grand designer]]. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a [[Creator deity|Creator]]. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of ''[[Catasetum]]'', which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long [[nectar]]y of ''[[Angraecum sesquipedale]]'' meant that there must be a moth with an equally long [[proboscis]]. This was confirmed in 1903 when ''[[Xanthopan morganii|Xanthopan morganii praedicta]]'' was found in [[Madagascar]].

==Background==
[[Charles Darwin]] grew up with an interest in [[natural history]], and as a student at the [[University of Cambridge]] he became a pupil and close friend of [[botany]] professor [[John Stevens Henslow]]. The year he graduated, Darwin was given a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] position as a gentleman naturalist and geologist on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of HMS ''Beagle'']], a trip that lasted five years. By the time he returned in October 1836, he had doubts about the doctrine that [[species]] were fixed and unchanging. Within months, experts informed him that specimens he had collected were separate species, not just [[Variety (botany)|varieties]], and the patterns he saw inspired the [[inception of Darwin's theory|inception of his theory]] of [[natural selection]] in 1838. Darwin began editing and publishing the expert reports, collected in the ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]'', at the same time as writing a series of books on geology, the first of which was ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]''. His "species work" was his "prime hobby", a background to this writing, but it evolved into an extensive research programme during the twenty years before he [[publication of Darwin's theory|published his theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008|pp=14–16, 31, 44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insect fertilisation of plants===
Darwin's speculations on the origin of species convinced him that [[Allogamy|cross-fertilisation]] played an important role in keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from [[animal husbandry]] that [[inbreeding]] could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural [[Heterosis|outbreeding]] through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an [[Fitness (biology)|evolutionary advantage]] by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of [[Entomophily|insect pollination]] to the [[allogamy|cross-pollination]] of flowers.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=133 127–128]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vogel56&gt;{{harvnb|Vogel|1996|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herminium monorchis (plant).jpg|thumb|left|alt=spires of small flowers among grass|Musk orchids (''Herminium monorchis'') in grassland]]
In the summer of 1841 Charles and [[Emma Darwin]] moved from the turmoil of London to the countryside, to [[Down House]], a quiet former [[parson]]age in the village of [[Downe]]. He wrote, "The flowers are here very beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|Seward|1903|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1548.1&amp;pageseq=68 31–33]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin followed the recommendation of his friend, the leading botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]], and read ''[[Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen]]'' (''The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilisation of Flowers Discovered''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vogel|1996|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; The little known book, published in 1793 by [[Christian Konrad Sprengel]] but never translated into English, introduced the idea that flowers were created by God to fulfill a [[teleology|teleological purpose]]: insects would act as "living brushes" to cross-fertilise plants in a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship. This functional view was rejected and mostly forgotten, as it contradicted the common belief that flowers had been created for beauty, and were generally self-fertilising. For Darwin, the concept of [[evolution]] gave new meaning to Sprengel's research into the mechanisms for cross-fertilisation. He welcomed its support for his supposition that cross-fertilisation in flowering plants tended to allow their offspring to avoid possible disadvantages resulting from self-fertilisation,&lt;ref name=v44&gt;{{harvnb|Vogel|1996|pp=44–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1845 he had verified many of Sprengel's observations.&lt;ref name=Letter889&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-889.xml |title=Letter 889&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C. R. to Hooker, J. D., (11–12 July 1845) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A favourite walk took the Darwin family to a spot above the quiet [[Cudham]] valley, teeming with orchids including ''[[Cephalanthera]]'', ''[[Neottia nidus-avis|Neottia]]'', [[Fly Orchid]]s and [[Musk Orchid]]s. They called this place "Orchis Bank", and the whole family became involved in Darwin's researches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.1&amp;pageseq=134 116]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin observed orchids every summer, but in twenty years, only on two occasions (when he noticed butterflies "sucking [[Pyramidal orchid|''O. pyramidalis'']] and ''[[Gymnadenia]]''") did he see insects visiting flowers.&lt;ref name=orchids58&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=49 34–39]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1854, Darwin began to work full-time on the origin of species.&lt;ref name=vw45&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008|pp=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; He examined orchids and counted how often one or both [[Pollinium|pollinia]] (pollen masses) had been removed from their flowers, indicating that they had been visited by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=72 57–60]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He experimented with insect pollination to investigate whether, by cross-fertilising field crops such as [[Fabaceae]], they would yield more vigorous offspring, and published letters about his inconclusive results in ''The Gardeners' Chronicle'' in 1857 and 1858. He next applied Sprengel's methods to [[empirical research]] on orchids.&lt;ref name=vogel56/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1857|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1697&amp;pageseq=1 725]}},&lt;br /&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1858|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1701&amp;pageseq=1 828–829]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite delays caused by [[Charles Darwin's illness|recurring illness]], he made progress on writing his planned "Big Book" on evolution, but when [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s letter prompted joint publication of both of their theories of [[natural selection]] in 1858, Darwin quickly wrote ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' as an abstract of his theory, published on 22 November 1859.&lt;ref name=vw45/&gt; In this book, he gave credence to Sprengel's ideas on the advantages of "intercrossing",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=113 98–99], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=163 145–146]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and noted: "Many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=88 73–74]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced his new concept, the process of [[coevolution]], describing the co-adaptation of [[bumblebee]]s and [[Trifolium pratense|red clover]], and speculating "how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure". This was a theme he developed in his orchid book.&lt;ref name=t24&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1994|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=109 94–95]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botany as recreation ==
[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|alt=a light purple flower, with a bulging lower petal coloured black and yellow|The [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] does not have [[nectar]], but its [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]], imitating a female bee, attracts male bees. Darwin found that in northern Europe, it is mostly self-fertilising.]]
After ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published, Darwin became involved in producing revised editions as well as working on ''[[Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication]]'' as the first part of his planned "Big Book".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=100–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 1860 he had tired of the grind of writing, and needed something fresh and interesting to study. During a family visit to relatives at [[Hartfield]], he was searching for orchids when he noticed a [[Drosera|sundew]]. He collected it and tried to feed it insects, thus beginning a long-term study of [[Carnivorous plant|insectivorous plants]]. He investigated other [[botany|botanical]] questions raised by his ideas of [[natural selection]], including the advantages of [[sexual dimorphism]] in [[primula]]s, and the [[Adaptation|adaptive mechanisms]] that ensure cross-pollination in orchids.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=volume8&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-8 |title=Introduction |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=3 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605110536/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-8 |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}, from ''The [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin]], Volume 8: 1860'' (pub 1993) {{ISBN|0-521-44241-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an enthusiastic practical scientist, such investigations gave him a strong sense of personal enjoyment. He relished pitting his wits against nature, and following [[Serendipity|lucky hunches]]. His theory was a way of looking at the world, enabling him to find creative solutions to problems that traditional approaches could not solve. He later wrote, "I am like a gambler, &amp; love a wild experiment."&lt;ref name=b166&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter4061&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-4061.xml |title=Letter 4061&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

Around the end of April 1860, Darwin discussed insect pollination with his friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]],&lt;ref name=Letter2770&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-2770.xml |title=Letter 2770&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

His letter described the mechanisms for insect fertilisation he had discovered in common British orchids, and reported his experimental observations that pollen masses were removed from ''[[Green-winged Orchid|Orchis morio]]'' and ''[[Orchis mascula]]'' plants in the open, but left in their pouches in adjacent plants under a glass [[bell jar]].&lt;ref name=Letter2826&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-2826.xml |title=Darwin, C.

Darwin became engrossed in meticulous microscopic examination, tracing the complicated mechanisms of flowers that attracted insects by their nectar so that the insects transported pollen to cross-pollinate other plants, and on 19 July he told Hooker, "I am intensely interested on subject, just as at a game of chess."&lt;ref name=volume8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter2871&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-2871.xml |title=Letter 2871&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

During 1861, botany became a preoccupation for Darwin, and his projects became serious scientific pursuits. He continued his study of orchids throughout the summer, writing to anyone who might be able to supply specimens he had not yet examined.&lt;ref name=volume9&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-9-1861 |title=Introduction |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=29 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710075648/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-9-1861 |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}, from ''The [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin]], volume 9: 1861'' (pub 1994) {{ISBN|0-521-45156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field naturalists, botanists, and country [[gentry]] sent specimens from across the British Isles. Darwin also tramped around the countryside with tin cans and biscuit boxes, collecting specimens which his gardeners potted up for him. His family joined in, and neighbours contributed to the research. As he had only a cold [[greenhouse]], a friend on the other side of the village who had a hot-house allowed him to use that, and offered the services of his gardener to look after the delicate specimens. Darwin's aim was to show how the complex structures and life cycles of the plants could be explained by natural selection rather than by the handiwork of God; he saw the huge variety of flowers as a collection of ''ad hoc'' evolutionary adaptations.&lt;ref name=b170&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=170–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June he described his examination of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchids]] as a passion,&lt;ref name=Letter3174&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3174.xml |title= Letter 3174&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

There were several replies to Darwin's enquiry in ''[[The Gardeners' Chronicle]]'' seeking evidence to support his idea that pollen masses attached themselves to a convenient place on an insect's back or head, usually its [[proboscis]], to transport the pollen to another flower. One envelope appeared to be empty when it arrived at Down House, but when he looked further before discarding it he found several insect mouthparts with pollen masses attached.&lt;ref name=b174&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help their daughter [[Etty Darwin|Henrietta]] convalesce from illness, the Darwins arranged to spend two months in [[Torquay]]. Darwin wrote:
{{quote|I have, owing to many interruptions, not been going on much with my regular work (though I have done the very heavy jobs of variation of Pigeons, Fowls, Ducks, Rabbits Dogs &amp;c) but have been amusing myself with miscellaneous work.—I have been very lucky &amp; have now examined almost every British Orchid fresh, &amp; when at sea-side shall draw up rather long paper on the means of their fertilisation for Linn. Socy  &amp; I cannot fancy anything more perfect than the many curious contrivances.&lt;ref name=Letter3190/&gt; }}

He sought advice on obtaining the exotic South American ''[[Catasetum]]'', to see it eject pollen masses, as "I am got intensely interested on subject &amp; think I understand pretty well all the British species."&lt;ref name=Letter3190&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3190.xml |title=Letter 3190&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

[[File:Catasetum macrocarpum-01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=dark purple flowers|''[[Catasetum macrocarpum]]'' from [[Suriname]] ejects its pollen masses at insects.]]
The family returned to Downe on 27 August,&lt;ref name=journal/&gt; and Darwin again wrote to the ''Gardeners' Chronicle'' appealing for assistance as he was "very anxious to examine a few exotic forms".&lt;ref name=Letter3252&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3252.xml |title=Letter 3252&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C. R. to Gardeners' Chronicle, (before 14 Sept 1861) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens. These would be a test of his theory: previously aspects such as coloration of plants and animals had often been regarded as having no adaptive function. For example, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was strongly influenced by German [[idealism]] and in 1856 had asked if it was "to be supposed for a moment that the beauty of colour and outline&amp;nbsp;... are any ''good'' to the animals?&amp;nbsp;... Who has ever dreamed of finding an utilitarian purpose in the forms and colours of flowers&amp;nbsp;... ?" Darwin had, and in the orchids he tackled the most difficult case. His ideas would transform the way naturalists thought about coloration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=509–510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cronin|1993|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completed Orchis paper came to 140 folio pages, and Darwin decided against presenting it at the [[Linnean Society of London]], thinking of publishing a pamphlet instead. He offered the draft to [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] who agreed to publish it as a book.&lt;ref name=Letter3263&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3263.xml |title=Letter 3263&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

As a popular and acceptable activity, botany had been taken up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence. On the recommendation of [[John Lindley]], Darwin wrote to [[Lady Dorothy Nevill]], who responded generously by sending numerous exotic orchids, and requested a signed photograph of him to hang in her sitting room next to portraits of her other notable friends, including Hooker.&lt;ref name=b170/&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter3402&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3402.xml |title=Letter 3402&amp;nbsp;– Nevill, D.F. to Darwin, C.

The orchid book was delayed because of illness, but Darwin continued to "look at it as a hobby-horse, which has given me great pleasure to ride".&lt;ref name=Letter3404&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3404.xml |title=Letter 3404&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

By November, a specimen of the exotic South American ''[[Catasetum]]'' orchid Hooker had given to Darwin had shown its "truly marvellous" mechanism, by which it shot out a [[pollinium]] at any insect touching a part of the flower "with sticky gland always foremost".&lt;ref name=Letter3305&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3305.xml |title=Letter 3305&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

[[John Lindley]] had remarked that "such cases shake to the foundation all our ideas of the stability of genera and species." One of Darwin's correspondents told of delight at growing a beautiful specimen of ''Myanthus barbatus'' imported from [[Demerara]], then dismay when the plant flowered the next year as a simple ''Catasetum''.&lt;ref name="Letter 3340"&gt;{{Citation | title =  Letter 3340&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C.

In view of this interest, Darwin prepared a paper on ''Catasetum'' as an extract from his forthcoming book, which was read to the [[Linnean Society of London]] on 3 April 1862.&lt;ref name=paper&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin solved the puzzle by showing that the three flowers were the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of a single species, but as they differed so much from each other, they had been classified as different genera.&lt;ref name=volume10&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-10 |title=Introduction |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=7 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605110829/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/correspondence-volume-10 |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}, from  ''The [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin]], volume 10: 1862'' (pub 1997) {{ISBN|0-521-59032-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication===
Darwin sent the incomplete manuscript to his publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] on 9 February 1862, while he was still working on the last chapter. Although anxious that the book might not sell, he could "say with confidence that the M.S. contains many new &amp; very curious facts &amp;  conclusions".&lt;ref name=Letter3442&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3442.xml |title=Letter 3442&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C. R. to Murray, John (b), 9 (Feb 1862) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the book was printed, he sent out presentation copies to all the individuals and societies who had helped him with his investigations, and to eminent botanists in Britain and abroad for review.&lt;ref name=volume10/&gt;

On 15 May 1862 the book was published under the full title of ''On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing''.&lt;ref name=freeman/&gt; In August, Darwin was "well contented with the sale of 768 copies; I shd. hope &amp; expect that the remainder will ultimately be sold",&lt;ref name=Letter3699&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3699.xml |title=Letter 3699&amp;nbsp;– Darwin, C. R. to Murray, John (b), 24 Aug (1862) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the book sold slowly and less than 2,000&amp;nbsp;copies of the first edition were printed. An expanded edition translated into French was published in Paris in 1870, and in 1877 Murray brought out a revised and expanded second edition, with the shortened title ''The various contrivances by which orchids are fertilised by insects''. This was also published by [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] of New York in 1877, and a German translation was published in the same year. Despite being well praised by botanists, only about 6,000&amp;nbsp;copies of the English editions had been sold by 1900.&lt;ref name=freeman/&gt;

==Content==
Darwin set out a detailed study of [[common descent|common descent with modifications]] by expanding on the theme of [[coevolution]] between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[anatomy]] of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to [[natural selection]] to demonstrate how slight variations in [[Homology (biology)|similar structures]] of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.&lt;ref name=t24/&gt;

In the introduction, Darwin explained his aim of meeting complaints that detailed support for his theory was lacking in ''On the Origin of Species''. He chose orchids for his subject as "amongst the most singular and most modified forms in the vegetable kingdom" in the hope of inspiring work on other species, and felt that "the study of organic beings may be as interesting to an observer who is fully convinced that the structure of each is due to secondary laws, as to one who views every trifling detail of structure as the result of the direct interposition of the Creator." He gave due credit to previous authors who had described the agency of insects in fertilising orchids, and all who had helped him.&lt;ref name=orchids1&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=12 1–4]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British orchids ===
[[File:Fertilisation of Orchids figure 1R.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|alt=photograph of a spire of purple flowers, and drawing showing the working parts of the flower|The pollination mechanism of ''[[Orchis mascula]]'' is given as an example of a mechanism for transferring pollen to insects: the diagram from the book shows all the petals cut away except the lowest petal, the [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]], which extends back to form a tubular [[nectar]]y below the [[column (botany)|column]].]]

In the first chapter Darwin described the British orchids he had studied, giving detailed explanations of their various mechanisms for transferring pollen to insects.&lt;ref name=orchids9&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=20 9–19]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mechanism described is that of ''[[Orchis mascula]]'', which serves as an introduction to the explanation of other [[Orchidaceae]]. In the upper part of the flower a petal shelters the [[Stamen|male organ]] which has two packages of pollen grains, held together by thin elastic threads. These [[Pollinium|pollen masses]] stand side by side and have stalks down to adhesive balls in a cup which keeps them moist and sticky. When an insect lands on the large projecting lower petal, the [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]], and pushes its head and [[proboscis]] into the centre of the flower and down to the [[nectar]]y, it breaks the cup and the adhesive balls attach the pollen masses to the front of the insect. As the insect flies off, each stalk rotates the pollen mass downwards and forwards so that when the insect lands on another flower the pollen masses attached to the insect pass under the male organ and leave pollen on the [[Gynoecium|female organ]], achieving cross fertilisation.&lt;ref name=orchids9/&gt; Darwin envisaged:
{{quote|A poet might imagine, that whilst the pollinia are borne from flower to flower through the air, adhering to a moth's body, they voluntarily and eagerly place themselves, in each case, in that exact position in which alone they can hope to gain their wish and perpetuate their race.&lt;ref name=orchids91&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=106 91–93]}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This is followed by descriptions of the differences in the mechanisms of several other orchids. In ''[[Pyramidal orchid|Orchis pyramidalis]]'', the adhesive balls are combined together into a strap or saddle shape, which curls round the thin [[proboscis]] of a moth or butterfly to attach to it the pair of pollen masses, illustrated in the book by [[:image:Fertilisation of Orchids figure 4.jpg|figure 4]] showing a moth's head with seven pairs of pollen masses attached to its proboscis.&lt;ref name=orchids24&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=35 20–24], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=52 37]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fertilisation of Orchids figure 2c.jpg|thumb|left|alt=a pencil with a pollen mass attached by its stalk and sticky ball, shown before and after the stalk bends down and forwards.|When an ''Orchis mascula'' pollen mass attaches itself to a probe, its stalk slowly rotates downwards.]]
While the [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] showed [[adaptation]] for self-fertilisation, its mechanism also enabled occasional cross-fertilisation, creating the [[biodiversity|biological diversity]] that Darwin felt was needed for vigorous survival, which could not be provided by self-fertilisation.&lt;ref name=orchids63&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=78 63–72]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of "how beautifully everything is contrived", Darwin described how he had found that in ''[[Spiranthes]]'' flowers the pollen is ready for collection before access is open for the female organ to receive pollen. At [[Torquay]] he had watched bees visiting spires of these flowers, starting at the bottom of the spire and working their way up to the topmost flowers. He speculated that if bees moved from top to top of the spires, the pollen clusters they collected from the most recently opened flowers would be wasted as the topmost flowers on the next spike would not be ready to receive pollen. A bee starting at the lowest flowers on the first spire it visited would continue up until it reached flowers that still had their pollen masses to attach to the bee, then would fly to the mature lower flowers on another plant, and fertilise them. By this co-ordinated process, the bee would add "to her store of honey" while perpetuating the flowers "which will yield honey to future generations of bees".&lt;ref name=orchids127&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=139 124–129]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exotic orchids===

The book moves on to the various foreign orchids Darwin had received from others. His experiments showed that the "astonishing length" of the 11{{fraction|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inch (290&amp;nbsp;mm) long [[nectar]]y hanging from ''[[Angraecum sesquipedale]]'' flowers implied the need for an as yet unknown moth with a [[proboscis]] 10–11&amp;nbsp;inches (250–275&amp;nbsp;mm) long to pollinate these flowers in [[Madagascar]]. He viewed this as the outcome of a coevolutionary race, writing that "there has been a race in gaining length between the nectary of the Angræcum and the proboscis of certain moths".&lt;ref name=t26&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1994|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orchids197&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=212 197–203]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This wastefulness is familiar in modern terms as the idea of an [[evolutionary arms race]], but was disturbing to biologists of the time who believed that adaptations were the outcome of benevolent [[teleological argument|divine purpose]].&lt;ref name=Darwinecology&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/was-darwin-an-ecologist |title=Was Darwin an ecologist? |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=29 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423064023/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/was-darwin-an-ecologist |archivedate=23 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin described "the most remarkable of all Orchids", ''[[Catasetum]]'', and showed how in these flowers, "as throughout nature, pre-existing structures and capacities [had been] utilised for new purposes". He explained the mechanism in which the pollen masses of the [[pollinium]] were connected by a bent stalk or [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] to a sticky disc kept moist at the back of the flower. When an insect touched an "antenna" projecting from the back of the flower, this released the bent pedicel which sprang straight and fired the pollinium, sticky disc first, at the insect. In experiments, Darwin had imitated this action using a whalebone spring. He vividly illustrated how the flower ejected the pollinium with considerable force: "I touched the antennæ of C. callosum whilst holding the flower at about a yard's distance from the window, and the pollinium hit the pane of glass, and adhered to the smooth vertical surface by its adhesive disc."&lt;ref name=orchids211&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=226 211–214], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=237 222–224]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final chapter===
Darwin noted that the essential nectar, [[Secretion|secreted]] to attract insects, seemed also in some cases to act as an [[excretion]]: "It is in perfect accordance with the scheme of nature, as worked out by natural selection, that matter excreted to free the system from superfluous or injuring substances should be utilised for purposes of the highest importance."&lt;ref name=orchids278&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=293 278–279]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homology (biology)|Homologies]] of the flowers of orchids showed them all to be based on "fifteen groups of vessels, arranged three within three, in alternating order". He disparaged the idea that this was an "ideal type" fixed by the Omnipotent Creator, but attributed it instead to its "descent from some [[monocotyledon]]ous plant, which, like so many other plants of the same division, possessed fifteen organs, arranged alternately three within three in five whorls; and that the now wonderfully changed structure of the flower is due to a long course of slow modification,—each modification having been preserved which was useful to each plant, during the incessant changes to which the organic and the inorganic world has been exposed".&lt;ref name=t25&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1994|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orchids305&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=320 305–307]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the final end state of the whole flower cycle as the production of seed, he set out a simple experiment in which he took a ripe seed capsule and arranged the seeds in a line, then counted the seeds in one-tenth of an inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;mm). By multiplication he found that each plant produced enough seeds to plant {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} of ground, and the great grandchildren of a single plant could "carpet the entire surface of the land throughout the globe" if unchecked.&lt;ref name=orchids343&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=358 343–346]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conclusion, he felt that the book had "shown that Orchids exhibit an almost endless diversity of beautiful adaptations. When this or that part has been spoken of as contrived for some special purpose, it must not be supposed that it was originally always formed for this sole purpose. The regular course of events seems to be, that a part which originally served for one purpose, by slow changes becomes adapted for widely different purposes."&lt;ref name=orchids346&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=361 346]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was almost exasperated by the inventiveness of forms in nature; "In my examination of Orchids, hardly any fact has so much struck me as the endless diversity of structure,—the prodigality of resources,—for gaining the very same end, namely, the fertilisation of one flower by the pollen of another."&lt;ref name=reviewDI&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/31/evolution-darwin-books |title=Review: Darwin's Island by Steve Jones and Darwin's Sacred Cause by Adrian Desmond and James Moore &amp;#124; Books |last=Beer |first=Gillian |author-link =Gillian Beer |date=31 January 2009 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=30 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=363 348–349]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His focus on detail was justified, as "The use of each trifling detail of structure is far from a barren search to those who believe in natural selection."&lt;ref name=t25/&gt; The "contrivances and beautiful adaptations"  slowly acquired through slight variations, subjected to natural selection "under the complex and ever-varying conditions of life", far transcended the most fertile imagination. The mechanisms to transport the pollen of one flower or of one plant to another flower or plant underlined the importance of cross-fertilisation: "For may we not further infer as probable, in accordance with the belief of the vast majority of the breeders of our domestic productions, that marriage between near relatives is likewise in some way injurious,—that some unknown great good is derived from the union of individuals which have been kept distinct for many generations?"&lt;ref name=orchids351&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1862|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F800&amp;pageseq=366 351–360]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanists responded favourably to the book immediately on its publication. Hooker told Darwin that the book showed him to be "out of sight the best Physiological observer &amp;  experimenter that Botany ever saw",&lt;ref name=Letter3624&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3624.xml |title=Letter 3624 – Hooker, J. D. to Darwin, C. R., 28 June 1862 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was glad to note that two leading traditional botanists had accepted the concept of evolution; "Bentham &amp; Oliver are quite struck up in a heap with your book &amp;  delighted beyond expression".&lt;ref name=b194&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter3527&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3527.xml |title= Letter 3527 – Hooker, J. D. to Darwin, C. R., (17 May 1862) |publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate= 25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Oliver]] thought it "very extraordinary", and even Darwin's old beetle-hunting rival [[Cardale Babington|Charles Babington]], by then professor of botany at the [[University of Cambridge]] and inclined to oppose natural selection, called it "exceedingly interesting and valuable&amp;nbsp;... highly satisfactory in all respects. The results are most curious and the skill shown in discovering them equally so."&lt;ref name=b193&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter3566&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3566.xml |title=Letter 3566 – Babington, C.

R., 22 May 1862 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bentham]] praised its value in opening "a new field for observing the wonderful provisions of Nature&amp;nbsp;... a new and unexpected track to guide us in the explanation of phenomena which had before that appeared so irreconcilable with the ordinary prevision and method shown in the organised world."&lt;ref name=b194/&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter3554&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3554.xml |title=Letter 3554 – Bentham, George to Darwin, C.

The book's success in botanical circles was enhanced following Bentham's public endorsement. In his presidential address to the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] on 24 May 1862, Bentham praised the book as exemplifying the biological method, and said that it had nearly overcome his opposition to the  ''Origin''.&lt;ref name=volume10/&gt; In his address in 1863 he stated that "Mr Darwin has shown how changes ''may'' take place", and described it as "an unimpeachable example of a legitimate hypothesis" in compliance with [[John Stuart Mill]]'s [[scientific method]]. This endorsement favourably influenced [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]], [[Charles Victor Naudin]], [[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle]], [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Bréau|Jean Louis Quatrefages]], and [[Charles Daubeny]].&lt;ref name=b194/&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter4217&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-4217.xml |title=Letter 4217 – Darwin, C. R. to Bentham, George, 19 June (1863) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1862, Darwin welcomed favourable reviews in the press and wrote to Hooker; "Well my orchis-book is a success (but I do not know whether it sells) after cursing my folly in writing it".&lt;ref name=Letter3628&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3628.xml |title= Letter 3628 – Darwin, C. R. to Hooker, J. D., 30 (June 1862) |publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate= 7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told his publisher, "The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies", and to [[Asa Gray]] he said, "I am fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists."  Darwin's geologist friend [[Charles Lyell]] gave it enthusiastic praise: "next to the ''Origin'', as the most valuable of all Darwin's works." However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin [[William Darwin Fox|Fox]], "Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it."&lt;ref name=reviews&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=282 270–276]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen. There were some reviews in gardening magazines, but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book, and hardly any learned appraisals appeared.&lt;ref name=b193/&gt;

===Theological responses===
[[File:Wallacesesquipedale.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Moth hovering with its long thin proboscis, or feeding tube, touching the centre of a white flower before being pushed down its long tube to the nectar |In 1867, zoological artist Thomas William Wood drew a speculative illustration of a then unknown moth pollinating ''[[Angraecum sesquipedale]]'', based on [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]'s descriptions.&lt;ref name=kritsky/&gt;]]
Although the book contradicted the prevailing [[natural theology]] and its [[teleological argument|teleological]] approach to design in nature, the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' thought that it would avoid the angry polemics aroused by ''On the Origin of Species''. The ''Literary Churchman'' welcomed "Mr. Darwin's expression of admiration at the contrivances in orchids", only complaining that it was too indirect a way of saying "O Lord, how manifold are Thy works!" ([[Psalms|Psalm]] [[Psalm 104|104:24]])&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt; Darwin regarded these theological views as irritating misunderstandings, but wrote to [[Asa Gray]] describing his approach as a "flank movement on the enemy". By showing that the "wonderful contrivances" of the orchid have discoverable evolutionary histories, Darwin was countering claims by natural theologians that the organisms were examples of the perfect work of the Creator.&lt;ref name=b193/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3662.xml#mark-3662.f16 |title=Letter 3662 – Darwin, C. R. to Gray, Asa, 23(−4) July (1862) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=9 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable controversy surrounding Darwin's prediction that a moth would be found in [[Madagascar]] with a long proboscis matching the [[nectar]]y of ''[[Angraecum sesquipedale]]''. An anonymous article in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' of October 1862 by [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll]], argued that Darwin's wording implied purpose, and concluded that "We know, too, that these purposes and ideas are not our own, but the ideas and purposes of Another." He considered Darwin's explanations the "most unsatisfactory conjectures", and raised obscure metaphysical objections while supporting a kind of creative evolutionism. Emma Darwin thought that although Argyll was "quite opposed" to Darwin's views, "he praises the ''Orchids'' in such an enthusiastic way that he will do it a good turn". Darwin was delighted to find that a well written article "smashing" Argyll's review was by one of Darwin's own nephews.&lt;ref name=b195&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=194–195}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=286 274–275]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argyll went on in his 1867 book ''The Reign of Law'' to cleverly ridicule Darwin's ideas, particularly the prediction of a moth in Madagascar with a proboscis 10–11&amp;nbsp;inches (250–275&amp;nbsp;mm) long.&lt;ref name=b195/&gt; He believed that adaptations showed divine purpose, not a mindless [[evolutionary arms race]].&lt;ref name=Darwinecology/&gt; In his response ''Creation by Law'' later that year, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] produced a detailed explanation of how the nectary could have evolved through natural selection, and stated that he had carefully measured moths in the [[British Museum]], finding that the proboscis of  ''[[Neococytius cluentius|Macrosila cluentius]]'' from South America was 9{{fraction|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;inches (235&amp;nbsp;mm) long, and the proboscis of ''Macrosila morganii'' from tropical Africa (since renamed  ''[[Xanthopan morganii]]'') was 7{{fraction|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inches (190&amp;nbsp;mm) long. An enquiry raised in 1873 was answered by Darwin's friend [[Hermann Müller (botanist)|Hermann Müller]], who stated that his brother [[Fritz Müller]] had caught a [[sphinx moth]] in Brazil with a proboscis nearly {{convert|10|in|mm}} long. Darwin's anticipation was fully met in 1903, when a subspecies of ''Xanthopan morganii'' was found in Madagascar with a proboscis about 12&amp;nbsp;inches (300&amp;nbsp;mm) long, and was named ''Xanthopan morganii praedicta'' to celebrate this verification of a testable prediction made by Darwin on the basis of his theory of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=kritsky&gt;{{harvnb|Kritsky|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallace|1867}}&lt;br&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-5637.xml#mark-5637.f5 |title=Letter 5637 – Wallace, A.

==Influence==
[[Michael Ghiselin]] has expressed the view that all studies of [[coevolution]] follow directly or indirectly from Darwin's orchid book, which was also the origin of all work on the evolution of extreme specialisation. Its publication led almost immediately to research by many other naturalists into specialisation and coevolution, in some cases analysing other [[taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref name=t27&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1994|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|his autobiography]], Darwin modestly recalled how this work had revived interest in [[Christian Konrad Sprengel]]'s neglected ideas:&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;
{{quote|For some years before 1862 I had specially attended to the fertilisation of our British orchids; and it seemed to me the best plan to prepare as complete a treatise on this group of plants as well as I could, rather than to utilise the great mass of matter which I had slowly collected with respect to other plants. My resolve proved a wise one; for since the appearance of my book, a surprising number of papers and separate works on the fertilisation of all kinds of flowers have appeared; and these are far better done than I could possibly have effected. The merits of poor old Sprengel, so long overlooked, are now fully recognised many years after his death.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; }}

Among the many prominent biologists who began research on coevolution, [[Hermann Müller (botanist)|Hermann Müller]] was particularly interested in the evolutionary sequence in which insects and flowers became adapted to each other. Like Darwin, he began with the premise that flowers were adapted to ensure cross-fertilisation, and added his own premise that most insects were not "limited by hereditary instinct to particular flowers". On this basis, he developed the view that specialisation develops from the need for flowers to attract pollinating insects (without making access too easy for non-pollinators), and from the evolution of pollinators to adapt to changes in the location of rewards such as nectar. He found that [[Alpine plant|Alpine flowers]] tended to be visited by bees at lower altitudes, and by butterflies at higher altitudes, beginning research on the idea that plants at different altitudes were specialised for different pollinators. By comparing related plant species that he thought had diverged in form from a common ancestor, and testing whether they were visited by butterflies or bees, he was the first to use a combination of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and ecological approaches to understand patterns in the evolution of interactions and specialisation. His brother [[Fritz Müller]] used similar methods when studying [[mimicry]] in Brazil.&lt;ref name=t27/&gt; The early development of ideas on specialisation and coevolution became increasingly focused on the problem of mimicry; [[Henry Walter Bates]] had initially raised this issue in a paper read to the [[Linnean Society of London]] in December 1861 in Darwin's presence, and published in November 1862.&lt;ref name=t29&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1994|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Letter3816&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3816.xml |title=Letter 3816 – Darwin, C. R. to Bates, H. W., 20 Nov (1862) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others basing their studies of reproductive ecology on Darwin's evolutionary approach included Friedrich Hildebrand and Severin Axell in Europe, [[Asa Gray]] and Charles Robertson in North America. In Italy, Federigo Delpino adopted the theory of descent but like Sprengel had a [[teleology|teleological]] approach and explained the mechanisms of flowers by the intervention of a "psychovitalistic intelligence". Delpino classified flowers on the basis of the pollinators they attracted, and coined many of the terms still in use such as [[pollination syndrome]] and [[ornithophily]]. There was an enormous increase in knowledge during this period.&lt;ref name=bl57&gt;{{harvnb|Vogel|1996|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, Asa Gray paid tribute to Darwin's work on orchids for explaining "all these and other extraordinary structures, as well as of the arrangement of blossoms in general, and even the very meaning and need of sexual propagation". He credited Darwin with establishing the understanding that "Nature abhors close fertilization".&lt;ref name=vw51&gt;{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1874|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A230&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=4 478]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, there were so many uncritical and unproven speculations about floral mechanisms that floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers [[Frederic Clements]], [[Karl von Frisch]] and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have [[ultraviolet]] vision, and findings involving [[bee learning and communication]]. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.&lt;ref name=bl57/&gt;

==Further research by Darwin==
[[File:Darwin's greenhouse.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Lean-to greenhouses against a brick wall, with an entrance door and water butt at the nearest end and trees in the background|Darwin's greenhouse at [[Down House]] was extended to provide hothouses where he spent an hour or so every morning and afternoon, examining plants and planning future experiments.&lt;ref name=b211/&gt;]]
Darwin had "found the study of orchids eminently useful in showing me how nearly all parts of the flower are coadapted for fertilisation by insects, &amp; therefore the result of n. selection,—even most trifling details of structure".&lt;ref name=Letter3472&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3472.xml |title=Letter 3472 – Darwin, C. R. to Hooker, J. D., 14 Mar (1862) |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own interest in orchids and in fertilisation of plants by insects continued. Darwin had been given the use of a hot-house at The Rookery on the other side of the village,&lt;ref name=b170/&gt; and at the end of 1862 he was persuaded by this neighbour's helpful gardener to have his own built at Down House as an extension to the existing cold lean-to [[greenhouse]]. The gardener drew up plans, and Darwin investigated stoves and ventilation devices. When it was completed in February 1863 he asked Hooker for some plants from [[Kew Gardens]], writing "I long to stock it, just like a school-boy", and sent his butler with a cart. When over 160 different plants were delivered, Darwin made apologetic remarks about depleting the national collection. He told Hooker "You cannot imagine what pleasure your plants give me&amp;nbsp;... Henrietta &amp; I go &amp; gloat over them." Darwin's life was changed by having a warm hothouse to spend time in before his walk round the Sandwalk, and in the 1870s he had several more hothouses built.&lt;ref name=b211&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=513}}&lt;br&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-3875.xml |title=Letter 3875 – Darwin, C.

A chance observation "thoroughly aroused" Darwin's attention to a surprising decrease in vigour of the offspring of ''[[Linaria vulgaris]]'' following only one instance of self-fertilisation, and after eleven years of experimental work he published ''[[The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom]]'' in 1876 as "a complement to the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,' because it shows how important are the results of cross-fertilisation which are ensured by the mechanisms described in that book."&lt;ref name=fd288/&gt; He told a friend "I cannot endure doing nothing", and resumed his work on orchids, assisted in his research by his son [[Francis Darwin]]. He corresponded about orchids with [[Fritz Müller]], and almost completely rewrote the book with a considerable amount of new material, much of which was contributed by Müller. The revised edition was published in 1877.&lt;ref name=b412&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=412–417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=298 286]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis Darwin described it as characteristic that his father delighted in the observations that preceded the publication of ''Fertilisation of Orchids'', not the applause which followed it. He quoted one of his father's last letters about orchids, written in 1880:
{{quote|They are wonderful creatures, these Orchids, and I sometimes think with a glow of pleasure, when I remember making out some little point in their method of fertilisation.&lt;ref name=fd288&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1452.3&amp;pageseq=300 288–290]}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Commemoration of Darwin's work on orchids==
[[Kent Wildlife Trust]] manages [[Downe Bank]], which is near Down House and was a favourite place of the Darwin family, who called it 'Orchis Bank' because of the many wild orchids which grew there.&lt;ref name ="DaDDBank"/&gt; It is now part of the 'Downe Bank and [[High Elms Country Park|High Elms]]' [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]. Darwin's observations of local orchids and their insect pollinators gave him the evidence for co-evolution which provided the basis for the ''Fertilisation of Orchids''."&lt;ref name="DaDDBank"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bromley.org/ciswebpl/darwin2/downebank.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725102340/http://www.bromley.org/ciswebpl/darwin2/downebank.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 July 2011 |title=Darwin at Downe – Downe Bank |accessdate=28 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have identified "Orchis Bank" as the species-rich setting encapsulated in the closing paragraph of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'',&lt;ref name=DowneBank&gt;{{citation |url=http://darwinslandscape.co.uk/topic.asp?navid=57&amp;tid=203 |title=Downe Bank |publisher= Darwin's Landscape Laboratory|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Darwin wrote:
{{quote|It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=507 489]}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Darwin's home and its surroundings, including specifically "Orchis Bank", have been called his landscape laboratory, and together were nominated in January 2009 for designation as a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jan/30/charles-darwin-world-heritage-site |title=Darwin's home nominated as world heritage site &amp;#124; Science  |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=12 February 2009 | location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy | date=30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bid was made by a partnership led by the [[London Borough of Bromley]], which now includes [[Downe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.charlesdarwintrust.org/about-us/darwin-s-landscape-laboratory-bid-for-world-heritage-site |title=Darwin's Landscape Laboratory bid for World Heritage Site |publisher=Charles Darwin Trust |accessdate=31 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913061829/http://www.charlesdarwintrust.org/about-us/darwin-s-landscape-laboratory-bid-for-world-heritage-site |archivedate=13 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was included in the 39 proposed properties, but was not in the 21 new sites selected for the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/634 |title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre – Thirty-nine properties to be considered for inscription on UNESCO's World Heritage List |format= |work= |accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/647 |title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre – World Heritage Committee inscribes a total of 21 new sites on UNESCO World Heritage List |format= |work= |accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flatness''' refers to the shape of a [[liquid]]'s [[free surface]].  On planet Earth, the flatness of a liquid is a function of the [[curvature]] of the Earth, and from [[trigonometry]], can be found to deviate from true flatness by approximately 19.6 [[nanometer]]s over an area of 1 [[square meter]], a deviation which is dominated by the effects of [[surface tension]].  This calculation using the [[Earth radius|Earth's mean radius]] at sea level, however a liquid will be slightly flatter at the [[geographical pole|poles]].

'''''From Beirut to Jerusalem: A Woman Surgeon With the Palestinians''''' &lt;ref&gt;Swee Chai Ang. From Beirut to Jerusalem: A Woman Surgeon With the Palestinians. Grafton House. London 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by [[Swee Chai Ang]], an [[orthopaedic]] [[surgery|surgeon]] who worked with civilians during the [[Lebanese Civil War]].  The book details her eye-witness account of the [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]]. Dr. Ang, a graduate of the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Britain, testified before the [[Kahan Commission]]. The commission was responsible for investigating the nature of the Israeli involvement in the massacre of perhaps 800 to 1000 Palestinians. Dr. Ang established a British charity following her first hand account of the massacres known as the Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) which she discusses in her work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15743">In [[physics]], a '''Galilean transformation''' is used to transform between the coordinates of two [[reference frames]] which differ only by constant relative motion within the constructs of [[Newtonian physics]]. These transformations together with spatial rotations and translations in space and time form the '''inhomogeneous Galilean group''' (assumed throughout below). Without the translations in space and time the group is the '''homogeneous Galilean group'''. The Galilean group is the [[group of motions]] of [[Galilean relativity]] acting on the four dimensions of space and time, forming the '''Galilean geometry'''. This is the [[active and passive transformation|passive transformation]] point of view. The equations below, although apparently obvious, are valid only at speeds much less than the [[speed of light]]. In [[special relativity]] the Galilean transformations are replaced by [[Poincaré transformation]]s; conversely, the [[group contraction]] in the [[classical limit]] {{nowrap|''c'' → ∞}} of Poincaré transformations yields Galilean transformations.

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] formulated these concepts in his description of ''uniform motion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Galilei|1638I|loc=191&amp;ndash;196 (in Italian)}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Galilei|1638E|loc=(in English)}}&lt;br&gt;{{harvnb|Copernicus|Kepler|Galilei|Newton|2002|pp=515&amp;ndash;520}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The topic was motivated by his description of the motion of a [[ball]] rolling down a [[Inclined plane|ramp]], by which he measured the numerical value for the [[acceleration]] of [[gravity]] near the surface of the [[Earth]].

==Translation==
[[Image:Standard conf.png|right|thumb|300px|Standard configuration of coordinate systems for Galilean transformations.]]
Though the transformations are named for Galileo, it is [[absolute time and space]] as conceived by [[Isaac Newton]] that provides their domain of definition. In essence, the Galilean transformations embody the intuitive notion of addition and subtraction of velocities as [[vector space|vectors]].

This assumption is abandoned in the [[Poincaré transformation]]s. These [[special relativity|relativistic]] transformations are applicable to all velocities, while the Galilean transformation can be regarded as a low-velocity approximation to the Poincaré transformation.

The notation below describes the relationship under the Galilean transformation between the coordinates {{nowrap|1=(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''t'')}} and {{nowrap|1=(''x''′, ''y''′, ''z''′, ''t''′)}} of a single arbitrary event, as measured in two coordinate systems S and S', in uniform relative motion ([[velocity]] ''v'') in their common ''x'' and ''x''′ directions, with their spatial origins coinciding at time {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''t''′ = 0}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mould|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lfGE-wyJYIUC&amp;pg=PA42 Chapter 2 §2.6, p. 42]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lerner|2996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B8K_ym9rS6UC&amp;pg=PA1047 Chapter 38 §38.2, p. 1046,1047]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serway|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1DZz341Pp50C&amp;pg=PA261 Chapter 9 §9.1, p. 261]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoffmann|1983|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JokgnS1JtmMC&amp;pg=PA83 Chapter 5, p. 83]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x' = x - v t &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = y &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z' = z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t' = t .&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the last equation expresses the assumption of a universal time independent of the relative motion of different observers.

In the language of [[linear algebra]], this transformation is considered a [[shear mapping]], and is described with a matrix acting on a vector. With motion parallel to the ''x''-axis, the transformation acts on only two components:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x' \\t' \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; -v \\0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} x \\t \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
Though matrix representations are not strictly necessary for Galilean transformation, they provide the means for direct comparison to transformation methods in special relativity.

==Galilean transformations==
The Galilean symmetries can be uniquely written as the [[Function composition|composition]] of a ''rotation'', a ''translation'' and a ''uniform motion'' of spacetime.&lt;ref name="mmcm"&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1989|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let {{math|'''x'''}} represent a point in three-dimensional space, and {{math|''t''}} a point in one-dimensional time. A general point in spacetime is given by an ordered pair {{math|('''x''', ''t'')}}.

A uniform motion, with velocity {{math|'''v'''}}, is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x},t) \mapsto (\mathbf{x}+t\mathbf{v},t),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''v''' ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A translation is given by
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x},t) \mapsto (\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{a},t+s),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|'''a''' ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''s'' ∈ ℝ}}. A rotation is given by
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x},t) \mapsto (G\mathbf{x},t),&lt;/math&gt; 
where {{math|1=''G'' : ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is an [[orthogonal transformation]].&lt;ref name="mmcm"/&gt;

As a [[Lie group]], the Galilean transformations span 10 dimensions,&lt;ref name="mmcm"/&gt; i.e.,  comprise 10 generators.

==Galilean group==
Two Galilean transformations {{math| ''G''(''R'', '''v''', '''a''', ''s'')}} [[composition of functions|compose]] to form a third Galilean transformation,  {{math| ''G''(''R' '', '''v' ''', '''a' ''', ''s' '') ''G''(''R'', '''v''', '''a''', ''s'') {{=}} ''G''(''R' R'', ''R' '' '''v'''+'''v' ''', ''R' '' '''a'''+'''a' '''+'''v' ''' ''s'', ''s' ''+''s'')}}. 
The set of all Galilean transformations {{math|Gal(3)}} on [[space]] forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] with composition as the group operation.

The group is sometimes represented as a matrix group with spacetime events {{math|( '''x''', ''t'', 1)}} as vectors where {{math|''t''}} is real and {{math|'''x''' ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a position in space. The action is given by&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emis.de/journals/APPS/v11/A11-na.pdf]{{harvnb|Nadjafikhah|Forough|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}R &amp; v &amp; a \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; s \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}  x\\ t\\ 1\end{pmatrix}   = \begin{pmatrix}  R x+vt  +a\\ t+s\\   1\end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''s''}} is real and {{math|''v'', ''x'', ''a'' ∈ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''R''}} is a [[rotation matrix]].

The composition of transformations is then accomplished through [[matrix multiplication]]. {{math|Gal(3)}} has named subgroups. The identity component is denoted {{math|SGal(3)}}.

Let {{math|''m''}} represent the transformation matrix with parameters {{math|''v'', ''R'', ''s'', ''a''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;G_1 = \{ m : s = 0, a = 0 \} , &lt;/math&gt; uniformly special transformations.
:&lt;math&gt;G_2= \{ m :  v = 0,  R = I_3  \} \cong (\mathbb{R}^4 , +) ,&lt;/math&gt; shifts of origin.
:&lt;math&gt;G_3 = \{ m : s = 0, a = 0, v = 0 \} \cong \mathrm{SO}(3) ,&lt;/math&gt; rotations of reference frame (see [[SO(3)]]). 
:&lt;math&gt;G_4= \{ m : s = 0, a = 0, R = I_3 \} \cong (\mathbb{R}^3, +) ,&lt;/math&gt; uniform frame motions.

The parameters {{math|''s'', ''v'', ''R'', ''a''}} span ten dimensions. Since the transformations depend continuously on {{math|''s'', ''v'', ''R'', ''a''}}, {{math|Gal(3)}} is a [[continuous group]], also called a topological group.

The structure of {{math|Gal(3)}} can be understood by reconstruction from subgroups. The [[semidirect product]] combination (&lt;math&gt;A \rtimes B &lt;/math&gt;) of groups is required. 
#&lt;math&gt;G_2 \triangleleft \mathrm{SGal}(3)&lt;/math&gt; (G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[normal subgroup]])
#&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SGal}(3) \cong G_2 \rtimes G_1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;G_4 \trianglelefteq   G_1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;G_1 \cong G_4 \rtimes G_3&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SGal}(3) \cong \mathbb{R}^4 \rtimes (\mathbb{R}^3 \rtimes \mathrm{SO}(3)) .&lt;/math&gt;

==Origin in group contraction==
Here, we only look at the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Representation theory of the Galilean group|Galilean group]]; it is then easy to extend the results to the [[Lie group]].

The relevant Lie algebra is [[linear span|spanned]] by {{math|''H'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (an [[antisymmetric tensor]]), subject to [[commutator|commutation relations]], where
:&lt;math&gt;[H,P_i]=0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[P_i,P_j]=0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[L_{ij},H]=0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[C_i,C_j]=0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[L_{ij},L_{kl}]=i [\delta_{ik}L_{jl}-\delta_{il}L_{jk}-\delta_{jk}L_{il}+\delta_{jl}L_{ik}] &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[L_{ij},P_k]=i[\delta_{ik}P_j-\delta_{jk}P_i] &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[L_{ij},C_k]=i[\delta_{ik}C_j-\delta_{jk}C_i] &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[C_i,H]=i P_i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[C_i,P_j]=0 ~.&lt;/math&gt;
{{mvar|H}} is the generator of time translations ([[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]), ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the generator of translations ([[momentum operator]]), ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the generator of Galileian boosts, and ''L&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' stands for a generator of rotations ([[angular momentum operator]]).

This Lie Algebra is seen to be a special [[classical limit]] of the algebra of the [[Poincaré group#Technical explanation|Poincaré group]], in the limit {{math|''c'' → ∞}}. Technically, the Galilean group is a celebrated [[group contraction]] of the Poincaré group (which, in turn, is a [[group contraction]] of the de Sitter group ''SO''(1,4)).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilmore|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renaming the generators of the latter as {{math| ''ϵ&lt;sub&gt;imn&lt;/sub&gt; J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ↦ ''L&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;'' ; ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ↦ ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ; ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''H''/''c'' ; ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ↦ ''cC&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, where {{math|''c''}}  is the speed of light, or any function thereof diverging as {{math|''c'' → ∞}}, the commutation relations (structure constants) of the latter limit to that of the former.

Note the group invariants  {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;mn&lt;/sup&gt;''}},  {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}}.

In matrix form, for ''d''=3, one may consider the ''regular representation'' (embedded in ''GL''(5;ℝ), from which it could be derived by a single group contraction, bypassing the Poincaré group), 
:
&lt;math&gt;
 iH=   \left( {\begin{array}{ccccc}
   0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp; 0 &amp;  0\\
 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0\\
 0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0\\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  \end{array} } \right)    , \qquad            
   &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
  i\vec{a}\cdot\vec{P}= 
  \left( {\begin{array}{ccccc}
    0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 &amp; a_1\\
   0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0  &amp; a_2\\
   0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0  &amp; a_3\\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0&amp; 0\\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  \end{array} } \right), \qquad
  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
  i\vec{v}\cdot\vec{C}= 
  \left( {\begin{array}{ccccc}
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; v_1 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; v_2 &amp; 0\\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; v_3 &amp; 0\\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  \end{array} } \right), \qquad
  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
i \theta_i \epsilon^{ijk} L_{jk} = 
  \left( {\begin{array}{ccccc}
   0&amp; \theta_3 &amp; -\theta_2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
   -\theta_3 &amp; 0 &amp;  \theta_1&amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
   \theta_2 &amp; -\theta_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
  \end{array} } \right )  ~.  &lt;/math&gt;

The infinitesimal group element is then 
::&lt;math&gt;
G(R,\vec{v},\vec{a},s)=1\!\!1_5   +       \left( {\begin{array}{ccccc}
   0&amp; \theta_3 &amp; -\theta_2 &amp; v_1&amp; a_1\\      -\theta_3 &amp; 0 &amp;  \theta_1&amp; v_1 &amp; a_2\\
   \theta_2 &amp; -\theta_1 &amp; 0 &amp; v_1 &amp; a_3\\      0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; s\\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\     \end{array} } \right )  + ... ~.  &lt;/math&gt;

== Central extension of the Galilean group ==
One could, instead,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bargmann|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; augment the Galilean group by a [[Lie algebra extension#Central|central extension]] of the Lie algebra spanned by {{math|''H''′, ''P''′&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''′&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''′&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''}}, such that {{math|''M''}} [[Commutative operation|commute]]s with everything (i.e. lies in the [[center (algebra)|center]]),  and
:&lt;math&gt;[H',P'_i]=0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[P'_i,P'_j]=0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[L'_{ij},H']=0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[C'_i,C'_j]=0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[L'_{ij},L'_{kl}]=i [\delta_{ik}L'_{jl}-\delta_{il}L'_{jk}-\delta_{jk}L'_{il}+\delta_{jl}L'_{ik}] \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[L'_{ij},P'_k]=i[\delta_{ik}P'_j-\delta_{jk}P'_i] \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[L'_{ij},C'_k]=i[\delta_{ik}C'_j-\delta_{jk}C'_i] \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[C'_i,H']=i P'_i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[C'_i,P'_j]=i M\delta_{ij} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

This algebra is often referred to as the '''Bargmann algebra'''.

"'''Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute'''", (formerly Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute) ([http://www.jntbgri.res.in/]) renamed in the fond memory of visionary Prime Minister of India Shri Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru is an autonomous Institute established by the Government of Kerala on 17 November 1979 at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], the capital city of Kerala. It functions under the umbrella of the [[Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment]] (KSCSTE), Government of Kerala. The [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens]] (RBG), Kew played an exemplary and significant role in shaping and designing the lay out of the JNTBGRI garden in its formative stages.

The Institute undertakes research in conservation biology, [[Biotechnology]], plant taxonomy, microbiology, phytochemistry, ethnomedicine and ethnophamacology, which are the main areas considered to have immediate relevance to the development of the garden. While taxonomists prepared a flora of the garden documenting the native plant wealth before mass introduction and face lift which subsequently followed, the bio-technologists mass multiplied plants of commercial importance, especially orchids for cultivation and distribution to the public.

JNTBGRI makes a comprehensive survey of the economic plant wealth of Kerala, to conserve, preserve and sustainably utilize the plant wealth. The institute carries out botanical, horticultural and chemical research for plant improvement and utilization; and offers facilities for the improvement of ornamental plants and propagation in the larger context of the establishment of nursery and flower trade. The cultivation and culturing of plants of India/other countries with comparable climatic condition for the economic benefit of Kerala/India is also taken care. Activities to help botanical teaching and to create public understanding of the value of plant research is initiated by JNTBGRI.  JNTBGRI gardens medicinal plants, ornamental plants and various introduced plants of economic or aesthetic value. JNTBGRI also serves as a source of supply of improved plants which are not readily available from other agencies.

'''Scientific researches on plant wealth are pursued through the following Divisions:'''

1. Garden Management, Education, Information and Training

2. Plant Genetic Resources

3. Biotechnology and Bioinformatics

4. Conservation Biology

5. Ethnomedicine and Ethnopharmacology

6. Phytochemistry and Phytopharmacology

7. Plant Systematics and Evolutionary Sciences

8. Microbiology

'''Johan Fredrik Eykman''' or '''Johann Frederik Eijkman''' (19 January 1851 &amp;ndash; 7 January 1915) was a Dutch chemist.

== Family background ==
He is one of the eight children of Christiaan Eijkman, the headmaster of a local school, and Johanna Alida Pool. His brother [[Christiaan Eijkman]] (1858–1930) was a physician and professor of physiology whose demonstration that beriberi is caused by poor diet led to the discovery of vitamins. Together with Sir Frederick Hopkins, his brother received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

== Life in Japan ==
He was hired during the [[Meiji period]], a Japanese era which extended from September 1868 through July 1912. During his stay in Japan, he was the first to isolate [[shikimic acid]] in 1885  from the Japanese flower shikimi (シキミ, the [[Japanese star anise]], ''Illicium anisatum'').&lt;ref&gt;The Botanical Relations of Illicium Religiosum, Sieb., Illicium Anisatum, Lour.

He is the co-founder and co-CEO of [[BASE Productions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks|title=Stocks|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[production company]] that specializes in creating [[reality television]] programs for channels such as [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]], [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic]] and [[ESPN]]. His company's most popular programs include [[Fight Science]] and [[Sport Science (TV series)|Sport Science]], the latter of which he hosts. He also currently hosts his own podcast, ''The Brink of Midnight.''&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=iTunes|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-brink-of-midnight-podcast-with-john-brenkus/id1234410068?mt=2|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Brenkus grew up in [[Vienna, Virginia]], and attended James Madison High School where he played a variety of sports including [[football]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], and [[track and field|track]] and [[cross-country running]] from the time he was young; but was never amazing at any of it. In an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' he said knowing "his place" set the tone for his appreciation of greatness.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/14/AR2011011405348.html|title=The 'Science' of Success: John Brenkus's hit sports show is part of a locally grown media franchise|date=2011-01-23|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of his ability, he wanted to leave a legacy. He knew from a young age he wanted to be in entertainment. As school secretary in 1989, he created "Mr. Madison," a pageant-dance that necessitated coming up with a cast, props and lights. The dance was still being held as of 2011.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

He attended the [[University of Virginia]], creating his own major, Film Rhetoric Communication Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/101592/20151102/interview-espn-sport-science-host-john-brenkus|title=Interview With ESPN 'Sport Science' Host John Brenkus|last=Times|first=Tech|date=2015-11-02|work=Tech Times|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and graduated with honors in three years. Before graduating, he told his mother, Rose, he wanted to do two of the hardest things he could think of: write a novel and make a movie.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

He has stated in interviews that sports and science are his "two greatest passions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theamemagazine.com/magazine/2017/05/29/interview-with-john-brenkus-of-espns-sport-science/|title=Interview with John Brenkus of ESPN’s Sport Science|date=30 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding BASE Productions ==
{{main article|BASE Productions}}

During the early years of his career, Brenkus produced numerous short films and music video projects before launching full-time into film and television writing, production and direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/14/AR2011011405348.html?sid=ST2011012100168|title=The 'Science' of Success: John Brenkus's hit sports show is part of a locally grown media franchise|first=Buzz|last=McClain|date=23 January 2011|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brenkus serves as the co-CEO of [[BASE Productions]] alongside Michael Stern, as well as the host of [[Sport Science]]. As a producer of reality, documentary, and unscripted infotainment programming,  BASE Productions uses a trademark motion-capture and CGI technology. The company has produced programming for a variety of channels, such as [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]], [[Animal Planet]], the [[Discovery Channel]] networks, [[Fox Sports Net]],  [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]], [[ESPN]], [[HBO]], [[MTV]], [[National Geographic Channel]] and [[Spike TV]]. BASE Productions is located in Los Angeles and Washington DC.

== Sport Science/ESPN ==

{{main article|Sport Science (TV series)}}

''Sport Science'', created and hosted by Brenkus, was originally an hour-long show on [[Fox Sports Network]]. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2009/04/kevin-love-looks-to-go-the-distance-on-fsns-sport-science.html|title=Kevin Love looks to go the distance on FSN's Sport Science|date=2009-04-10|website=LA Times Blogs - Sports Now|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Sport Science first started on FSN in 2008. It's even considered educational; the show had a deal with Cable in the Classroom. Filmed inside a Los Angeles airport hangar or on location using a mobile laboratory, each episode of series 1 focused on testing certain aspects of athletics (such as human flight and reaction time). Series 2 either poses more questions from previous episodes, or tries to re-analyze sporting moments — like 2015's "[[deflategate]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.espnfrontrow.com/2015/01/deflategate-gets-sport-science-treatment/|title=Deflategate gets Sport Science treatment - ESPN Front Row|date=2015-01-22|work=ESPN Front Row|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; — or trials and tribulations and puts man against animals or machines. Since Sport Science moved to ESPN in 2010 for series 3, it has become a segmented show, featuring clips of all types of professional athletes. Brenkus makes a point of bringing them into the lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/sportscience/index?topId=13887622|title=ESPN SPORT SCIENCE|last=|first=|date=|website=ESPN SPORT SCIENCE|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often testing the limits of the human body. Brenkus&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=SportsFan314|title=Sport Science Season 2 John Brenkus (Sundays at 9pm on FSN)|date=2009-03-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-Kbc1m8sd0|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; also participated in experiments himself in cases where an "average Joe" was required.

Sport Science is actually a spin off that comes from the 2006 series "Fight Science: Calculating the Ultimate Warrior,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/14/AR2011011405348.html|title=The 'Science' of Success: John Brenkus's hit sports show is part of a locally grown media franchise|last=McClain|first=Buzz|date=2011-01-23|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized more of the science than the fighting, on the National Geographic channel. After it did well on Nat Geo and sister network Fox, Micheal Stern says they immediately "pitched the spinoff, applying the same visual style and scientific approach to all mainstream sports." When speaking to [[NPR]] in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/01/133407074/writer-explains-the-science-of-sport|title=Writer Explains The Science Of Sport|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the creativity that goes into creating Sport Science Brenkus says that it's a collaborative effort between the network, staff, athletes, and audience.He is always looking forward to learning something new, which is why he says in an interview with ''Tech Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/101592/20151102/interview-espn-sport-science-host-john-brenkus.htm|title=Interview With ESPN 'Sport Science' Host John Brenkus|last=Times|first=Tech|date=2015-11-02|work=Tech Times|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the latest episode of Sport Science is always his favorite.

Sport Science, which is produced by Brenkus' production company BASE Productions, was nominated for four [[Sports Emmy Awards]] in 2008 for Series 1, winning for Outstanding Graphic Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emmy Online|url=http://cdn.emmyonline.org/sports_29th_winners.pdf.|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series 2 received even more accolades in 2009, being nominated for five Emmys and receiving two awards - again for Outstanding Graphic Design and also for Outstanding New Approaches in Sports Programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emmy Online|url=http://cdn.emmyonline.org/sports_30th_winners.pdf|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other projects ==

In 2010, Brenkus wrote ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestselling book ''The Perfection Point''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2010/09/19/hardcover-nonfiction/?module=DropDownNav&amp;action=click&amp;region=navbar&amp;contentCollection=Books&amp;version=Nonfiction&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;pgtype=Reference|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Brenkus sets out to discover exactly what those limits are for nine athletic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-brenkus/is-there-such-a-thing-as-_1_b_720060.html|title=Is There Such a Thing As Perfection in Athletic Performance?|last=Brenkus|first=John|date=2010-09-16|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book details Brenkus's analysis of a wide variety of athletes to provide an in-depth look at the absolute limits of human performance. Brenkus finds the "perfection point" (the highest point physiologically possible for a human to attain based on physics and applied mathematics) for many aspects of human athleticism, focusing on the speeds, heights, distances, and times that humans will get closer to but never exceed. Combining scientific methodology with the fundamentals of each sport, Brenkus uncovers a variety of so-called perfection points, including the fastest mile and the heaviest [[bench press]]. In a 2013 interview with [[Mashable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2013/09/11/sport-science-john-brenkus-interview/#EMcnmOIW1aqx|title=6 Questions With 'Sport Science' Creator John Brenkus|last=Laird|first=Sam|work=Mashable|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brenkus was asked whether or not humans will continue to keep accomplishing new levels of athletic achievement, or if there is a limit to what people are capable of athletically. He answers specifically from his book stating "there obviously has to be a limit when you factor in what it means to be human, the rules of sports and what the human body is capable of. There are absolutely limits to how fast we can run, how high we can jump, how long we can hold our breath." When asked by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2019498,00.html|title=How Fast Will Humans Ever Run?|last=Sanburn|first=Josh|date=2010-09-17|work=Time|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; what he wanted people to take away from his book, Brenkus said "It's not about the destination but the journey. The Perfection Point is really about what are we as a species going to do as we try to achieve perfection."
 
In May 2017, Brenkus launched ''The Brink of Midnight'' [[podcast]]. The podcast consists of discussions with professional athletes and other celebrities about what they consider to be the most important moments of their career, which Brenkus refers to as "Brink of Midnight moments." Notable guests of the podcast include [[Ray Lewis]], [[Sharon Stone]], [[Tony Hale]], [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Bill Engvall]], [[Larry Fitzgerald]], [[Rob Riggle]], [[Santonio Holmes]], [[Marshawn Lynch]], and [[Randy Couture]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Brink of Midnight is also the name of a band which Brenkus created with his wife, Lizzie. They wrote a Christmas song&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2014/12/03/why-espns-sport-science-host-john-brenkus-released-a-christmas-music-video/|title=Why ESPN’s ‘Sport Science’ host John Brenkus released a Christmas music video|last=Allen|first=Scott|date=2014-12-03|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; that went viral, raised money for unite4:Good,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/espns-john-brenkus-and-wife-lizzie-brenkus-co-write-and-perform-the-holiday-song-christmas-is-my-favorite-time-of-year-featuring-some-of-todays-most-iconic-sports-professionals-proceeds-of-the-downloads-to-benefit-unite4good-300012619.html|title=ESPN's John Brenkus And Wife Lizzie Brenkus Co-Write And Perform The Holiday Song "Christmas Is My Favorite Time Of Year" Featuring Some Of Today's Most Iconic Sports Professionals; Proceeds Of The Downloads To Benefit Unite4: Good .org|last=Foundation|first=Unite4:good|date=|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is still played on Sirius XM.

'''Julianna Lisziewicz''' (born 1959) is a Hungarian immunologist. She is currently the President and CEO of TREOS Bio. Lisziewicz has headed many research teams that have discovered and produced [[Immunotherapy|immunotheraputic]] drugs to treat diseases like [[cancer]] and chronic infections like [[HIV/AIDS]]. Some of these drugs have been successfully used in [[clinical trial]]s.

== Education ==
Lisziewicz graduated from [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Budapest University of Technology]] in [[Budapest, Hungary]] with an MSc in [[Chemistry]] and [[Biology]] in 1982. She went on to earn her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Molecular biology|Molecular Biology]] at the [[Max Planck Society|Max-Planck Institute]] in [[Germany]]. Lisziewicz did post doctoral research at the Max-Planck Institute of Experimental Medicine from 1985-1989.

== Career ==

=== National Institutes of Health ===

Lisziewicz worked at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) from 1989-1995. During her time working at the [[National Cancer Institute]] she was the Head of the Antiviral Unit at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology.

=== Research Institute for Genetic and Human Therapy (RIGHT) ===

In 1995, Lisziewicz and her colleague Franco Lori founded the Research Institute for Genetic and Human Therapy (RIGHT), where Lisziewicz worked as the Director. RIGHT is a non-profit organization based in the [[United States]] and [[Italy]] that funds research to develop immunologic technologies, create new therapies, and research [[vaccine]]s for many chronic diseases like [[HIV/AIDS]]. RIGHT strives to quickly put their discoveries to use in patient treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rightinstitute.net/history.html|title=hiv and cancer therapies, RIGHT - RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR GENETIC AND HUMAN THERAPY History|website=www.rightinstitute.net|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic Immunity, Inc. ===

Lisziewicz founded Genetic Immunity, Inc., and worked as the President and the CEO of the company. Genetic Immunity is a private clinical-stage biotechnology company in the [[United States]] and [[Hungary]]. Genetic Immunity works to create and commercialize immunotherapeutic biologics to treat chronic viral infections, [[Allergy|allergies]], and [[cancer]]s to prolong the life of the patient and improve their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geneticimmunity.com/products.html|title=Genetic Immunity, Inc.|last=PWRV|website=www.geneticimmunity.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

=== Antisense oligonucleotides ===

While working at the [[National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Health]], Lisziewicz worked to find a [[gene therapy]] approach to treat [[HIV/AIDS]]. She based her research on discovering if small portions of gene-stopping [[DNA]] (called antisense [[oligonucleotide]]s) could be created to bind up the viral [[RNA]] in [[retrovirus]]es like HIV so that the virus could not make more copies of itself to continue the infection. Small pieces of [[messenger RNA]] (or mRNA) carry a copy of the cell’s DNA to the [[ribosome]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s where the mRNA directs the ribosomes to create the [[protein]]s that the cells need. [[Virus]]es (like HIV) have their own set of mRNA, and they use the ribosomes of the cell they infected to make new viruses to propagate the infection throughout the body. Lisziewicz’s idea was to create antisense oligonucleotides that are complementary to the HIV’s viral mRNA. These [[complementary DNA]] pieces can bind to the HIV viral mRNA and prevent the HIV virus from replicating itself. The use of antisense oligonucleotides worked very well in [[cell culture]]s, and was quickly transferred to [[clinical trial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cured : How the Berlin Patients Defeated HIV and Forever Changed Medical Science|last=Holt|first=Nathalia|publisher=Dutton|year=2014|isbn=9780525953920|location=New York, New York|pages=112–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lisziewicz|first=J.|last2=Sun|first2=D.|last3=Metelev|first3=V.|last4=Zamecnik|first4=P.|last5=Gallo|first5=R.

=== DermaVir ===

DermaVir immunotherapy was created during Lisziewicz’s research at the [[National Cancer Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. She worked to produce gene and antisense therapies to treat [[HIV/AIDS]], and researched how the [[immune system]] controls HIV in tissue culture and in monkey models. She applied these results to the treatment of HIV patients in clinical trials. Lisziewicz discovered and headed the preclinical and clinical development of DermaVir HIV immunotherapy. Under Lisziewicz’s direction, DermaVir successfully completed a [[Phases of clinical research|Phase 2 clinical trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geneticimmunity.com/dermavir.html|title=Genetic Immunity, Inc.|last=PWRV|website=www.geneticimmunity.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DermaVir is a [[Topical medication|topical]] vaccine that is applied with a patch to the skin. It is a new [[immunization]] strategy that uses [[dendritic cell]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to increase viral [[antigen]] production. DermaVir contains a [[plasmid]] that expresses all of the HIV [[Protein|protiens]] except [[integrase]]. This stimulates an [[immune response]] to attack the cells infected with HIV.

DermaVir has been proven safe and immunogenic in several clinical trials, one of which was in collaboration with the Division of AIDS (DAIDS). In one trial, Lisziewicz’s research team compared the [[immunogenicity]] of topical-based and [[ex vivo]] dendritic cell-based DermaVir in [[rhesus macaque]]s. As a result it was discovered that both vaccinations induced [[T helper cell|CD4 helper T cells]] and [[T cell|CD8 memory T cells]] that are specific to [[simian immunodeficiency virus]]. The [[T helper cell|CD4 helper T cells]] and [[T cells|CD8 memory T cells]] were identified using an [[in vivo]] skin test and an [[in vitro]] intracellular cytokine-based assay. The topical DermaVir vaccine is an improvement upon the [[ex vivo]] dendritic cell- based immunization that could offer a new alternative therapy for patients with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lisziewicz|first=Julianna|last2=Trocio|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Whitman|first3=Lucia|last4=Varga|first4=Georg|last5=Xu|first5=Jianqing|last6=Bakare|first6=Nyasha|last7=Erbacher|first7=Patrick|last8=Fox|first8=Cecil|last9=Woodward|first9=Ruth|date=2005-01-01|title=DermaVir: A Novel Topical Vaccine for HIV/AIDS|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X15321126|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=124|issue=1|pages=160–169|doi=10.1111/j.0022-202X.2004.23535.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PolyPEPI™ ===

Another investigation Lisziewicz is involved with is how [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) genes regulate immune responses. This research led to the development of computational [[Cancer immunotherapy|immune-oncology]] technology that can determine a patient’s natural [[T cell]] response to tumor [[antigen]]s. This technology is the first of its kind. As a result, Lisciewicz and her team found there was a correlation between a patient’s HLA gene sequence and how well their [[Immunotherapy|immunotherapies]] worked. PolyPEPI™ immunotherapies to treat [[lung cancer]], [[breast cancer]], and [[colorectal cancer]] were created using the computational [[Cancer immunotherapy|immune-oncology]]. The technology was also used to find other types of [[cancer]] that would likely respond to these treatments. The company TREOS Bio, that Lisziewicz founded, is clinically developing these [[Immunotherapy|immunotherapies]] to cure cancers by using these personalized treatments to cure each patient’s specific disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://treosbio.com/index.php/product-new/#OPICVF|title=Treos Bio Limited {{!}}   Products|website=treosbio.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Langerhans cell-targeting DNA vaccines ===

[[Langerhans cell]]s are a natural agent of [[antigen]] release. They are the precursors of [[dendritic cell]]s in the [[skin]] and [[mucosa]]. Lisziewicz and her team developed synthetic nanoparticles that act like [[pathogen]]s and specially target [[Langerhans cell]]s in [[Epidermis|epidermal]] cell cultures. When these nanoparticles are applied topically to human subjects, a strong [[immune response]] was observed. This [[vaccine]] has been clinically proven, and it opens the door for more new dendritic cell-targeting vaccines to be created for the treatment of cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tőke|first=E R|last2=Lőrincz|first2=O|last3=Csiszovszki|first3=Z|last4=Somogyi|first4=E|last5=Felföldi|first5=G|last6=Molnár|first6=L|last7=Szipőcs|first7=R|last8=Kolonics|first8=A|last9=Malissen|first9=B|date=2014-04-03|title=Exploitation of Langerhans cells for in vivo DNA vaccine delivery into the lymph nodes|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201429|journal=Gene Therapy|language=En|volume=21|issue=6|pages=566–574|doi=10.1038/gt.2014.29|issn=1476-5462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jungle Animals''''' was [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]]’s eighth book, written with [[Ferrin Fraser]], describing some of the animals, birds, and reptiles of the jungle, which Buck had come in contact with in his years of travel around the world. The lavishly illustrated book was intended for schoolchildren grades five to eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A children’s book illustrator, Roger Vernam (1912–1992), was the artist.

==Critical reception==
"Large and beautifully illustrated by Roger Vernam, this book is authoritative and fascinating...Best for the pre-high school age, but would interest all." &lt;ref&gt;M. L. Goodwin. Library Journal 71:185, February 1, 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arizona, Lake Powell 03.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lake Powell]], impounded by [[Glen Canyon Dam]], is the second-largest reservoir in the U.S.]]
This is a '''list of largest [[reservoir]]s in the [[United States]]''', including all artificial lakes with a capacity greater than or equal to {{convert|1000000|acre feet|km3|lk=in}}. Figures given are for maximum storage capacity (flood pool) of reservoirs, not regular storage volume (conservation pool). This difference is significant in reservoirs such as [[Kentucky Lake]], whose full capacity is nearly three times that of its conservation pool.

Due to [[sedimentation]] and other factors that affect a reservoir's storage capacity over time, some data listed might not accurately reflect actual current conditions in certain reservoirs. For example, [[Lake Mead]] – the largest reservoir in the U.S. – could store more than 32.4 million [[acre foot|acre-feet]] (40.1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) when first filled, but sediment accumulation has reduced this to 28.9 million acre-feet (35.7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8179">'''Loaded language''' (also known as '''loaded terms''', '''emotive language''', '''high-inference language''' and '''language-persuasive techniques''') is [[rhetoric]] used to influence an audience by using words and phrases with strong [[connotations]] associated with them in order to [[Pathos|invoke an emotional response]] and/or exploit [[stereotypes]].{{sfn|Weston|2000|p=6}}{{sfn|Murray|Kujundzic|2005|p=90}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dancers Human Kinetics |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-87322-667-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Loaded words and phrases have significant emotional implications and involve strongly positive or negative reactions beyond their [[literal meaning]]. For example, the phrase ''[[tax cut|tax relief]]'' refers literally to changes that reduce the amount of tax citizens must pay. However, use of the emotive word ''[[relief]]'' implies that taxation is an inherently unreasonable [[wikt:Burden#English|burden]]. Another example of loaded language is the question "Do you really want to associate with those people?", which implies a sense of disapproval from the speaker.{{Original research inline|date=July 2018}}{{clarify|date=July 2018}}

==Definition==

Loaded terms, also called emotive or ethical words, were clearly described by [[Charles Stevenson]].{{sfn|Stevenson|1937|}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1938|}} He noticed that there are words that do not merely describe a possible state of affairs. "[[wikt:terrorist|Terrorist]]" is not used only to refer to a person who commits specific actions with a specific intent. Words such as "[[wikt:torture|torture]]" or "[[wikt:freedom|freedom]]" carry with them something more than a simple description of a concept or an action.{{sfn|Stevenson|1944|p=210}} They have a "magnetic" effect, an imperative force, a tendency to influence the interlocutor's decisions.{{sfn|Stevenson|1937|pp=18–19}} They are strictly bound to moral values leading to value judgments and potentially triggering specific emotions. For this reason, they have an emotive dimension. In the modern psychological terminology, we can say that these terms carry "emotional valence",{{sfn|Frijda|Mesquita|2000|p=49}} as they presuppose and generate a value judgment that can lead to an emotion.{{sfn|Macagno|Walton|2014|p={{page needed|date=March 2017}} }}

The appeal to emotion is often seen{{By whom|date=October 2018}} as being in contrast to an appeal to [[logic]] and [[reason]]. Authors [[R. Malcolm Murray]] and [[Nebojša Kujundžić]] distinguish "''[[prima facie]]'' reasons" from "considered reasons" when discussing this.  An emotion, elicited via emotive language, may form a ''prima facie'' reason for action, but further work is required before one can obtain a ''considered'' reason.{{sfn|Murray|Kujundzic|2005|p=90}}

Emotive arguments and loaded language are particularly{{Clarify|reason=Particularly among...?|date=October 2018}} persuasive because they exploit the human weakness{{What|reason=Why is it a weakness, if even|date=October 2018}} for acting immediately based upon an emotional response, ''without'' such further considered judgment.  Due to such potential for emotional complication, it is generally advised{{By whom|date=October 2018}} to avoid loaded language in argument or speech when fairness and impartiality is one of the goals.  [[Anthony Weston]], for example, admonishes students and writers: "In general, avoid language whose only function is to sway the emotions".{{sfn|Weston|2000|p=6}}{{sfn|Murray|Kujundzic|2005|p=90}}

==Examples==

[[Politician]]s cultivate loaded language, and often{{How often|date=October 2018}} study how to use it effectively: which words to use or avoid using to gain political advantage or disparage an opponent. Heller{{Who|date=October 2018}} gives the example that it is common for a politician to advocate "investment in public services"{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, because it has a more favorable connotation than "[[Government spending|public spending]]".{{sfn|Heller|2002|p=54}}

One aspect of loaded language is that loaded words and phrases occur in pairs, sometimes as [[political framing]] techniques by individuals with opposing agendas. Heller calls these "a Boo! version and a Hooray! version" to differentiate those with negative and positive emotional connotations. Examples include ''bureaucrat'' versus ''public servant'', ''anti-choice'' versus ''pro-life'', ''regime'' versus ''government'', and ''elitist'' versus ''expert''.{{sfn|Heller|2002|p=54}}

In the 1946 essay "[[Politics and the English Language]]", [[George Orwell]] discussed the use of loaded language in political discourse.
 	
{{quote|The word ''[[Fascism]]'' has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies "something not desirable." The words ''democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice'' have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like ''democracy'', not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning.{{sfn|Orwell|1946}}

In [[theoretical physics]], a '''local reference frame''' ('''local frame''') refers to a [[coordinate system]] or [[frame of reference]] that is only expected to function over a small region or a restricted region of space or [[spacetime]]. 

The term is most often used in the context of the application of '''local inertial frames''' to small regions of a [[gravitational field]]. Although gravitational [[tidal forces]] will cause the background geometry to become noticeably [[non-Euclidean]] over larger regions, if we restrict ourselves to a sufficiently small region containing a cluster of objects falling together in an ''effectively'' uniform gravitational field, their physics can be described as the physics of that cluster in a space free from explicit background gravitational effects.

==Equivalence principle==
{{main|Equivalence principle}}

When constructing his [[general theory of relativity]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] made the following observation: a freely falling object in a gravitational field will not be able to detect the existence of the field by making local measurements ("a falling man feels no gravity"). Einstein was then able to complete his general theory by arguing that the physics of curved spacetime must reduce over small regions to the physics of simple inertial mechanics (in this case [[special relativity]]) for small freefalling regions.
  
Einstein referred to this as "the happiest idea of my life".

{{Nihongo|'''Mamoru “Mark” Mohri'''|毛利 衛|Mōri Mamoru|extra=born 29 January 1948}}, [[Honorary Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] is a Japanese scientist, a former [[National Space Development Agency of Japan|NASDA]] astronaut, and a veteran of two [[NASA]] [[space shuttle]] missions.

==Biography==

Born in [[Yoichi, Hokkaidō]], Japan, Mohri earned degrees in chemistry from [[Hokkaido University]] and a Doctorate from [[Flinders University]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], in 1976.

Most of Mohri's work has been in the field of [[Materials science|materials]] and [[vacuum]] [[science]]s. From 1975 to 1985, Mohri was a member of the [[nuclear engineering]] [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] of Hokkaido University, where he worked on [[nuclear fusion]]-related projects.

Mohri was selected by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|National Space Development Agency of Japan]] (now [[JAXA]]) to train as a [[Payload Specialist|payload specialist]] for a Japanese materials science payload. He flew his first space mission aboard [[STS-47]] in 1992 as chief payload specialist for [[Spacelab#Spacelab missions|Spacelab-J]]. Mohri subsequently made another trip into space as part of mission [[STS-99]] in 2000.

As of 2007, Mohri is the Executive Director for the [[Miraikan]], the [[National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation]] in Tokyo.

==Honours==
On 16 March 2006 Mohri was appointed an Honorary Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM), “for service to Australia-Japan education and science relations.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1129458&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true It's an Honour].

'''Matvei Petrovich Bronstein''' ({{lang-ru|Матвей Петрович Бронштейн}}, {{OldStyleDate|December 2|1906|November 19}}, [[Vinnytsia]] – February 18, 1938) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] theoretical [[physicist]], a pioneer of [[quantum gravity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10714-011-1285-4 |title=Republication of: Quantum theory of weak gravitational fields |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=44 |pages=267 |year=2011 |last1=Bronstein |first1=Matvei|bibcode=2012GReGr..44..267B }}&lt;/ref&gt;, author of works in [[astrophysics]], [[semiconductor]]s, [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[cosmology]], as well as of a number of books in [[popular science]] for children.

He introduced the [[cGh physics|cGh]] scheme for classifying physical theories. "After the relativistic quantum theory is created, the task will be to develop the next part of our scheme, that is to unify quantum theory (with its constant h), special relativity (with constant c), and the theory of gravitation (with its G) into a single theory."&lt;ref&gt;Bronstein, M. P. "K voprosu o vozmozhnoy teorii mira kak tselogo" ("On the Question of a Possible Theory of the World as a Whole"), in Uspekhiastronomitcheskihnauk. Sbornik, No. 3 (Moscow: ONTI, 1933) p. 3-30, as quoted and translated in Gorelik (2005) loc. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to [[Lydia Chukovskaya]], a writer, prominent human rights activist, and a friend of [[Andrei Sakharov]].

During the [[Great Purge]], in August 1937 Bronstein was arrested. He was convicted by a [[Purge Trials|list trial]] ("по списку") in February 1938 and executed the same day in a [[Leningrad]] prison. His wife was told that he was sentenced to 10 years of [[Gulag|labor camp]]s [[without the right of correspondence]].

Bronstein's  books for children "Solar matter" (Солнечное вещество), "X Rays" (Лучи X), "Inventors of Radio" (Изобретатели радио) were republished after he had been rehabilitated in 1957.

The "Bronstein Prize in [[Loop quantum gravity|Loop Quantum Gravity]]" is offered to  Post-doctoral scholars in the field,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bronsteinprize.org/|title=Bronstein Prize|website=bronsteinprize.org|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the inaugural winner of which was [[Eugenio Bianchi]] in 2013.

'''Ole Aanderud Larsen''' (December 18, 1884 &amp;ndash; October 6, 1964) was a ship designer and businessman from [[Norway]].

Larsen was born in [[Tønsberg]] and died in [[Sandefjord]], in the county of [[Vestfold]]. Larsen is best known for designing the ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]],'' the three-masted [[barquentine]] in which Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]] sailed for the [[Antarctic]] on the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/antarctic_ships/endurance.php

Larsen was the first chairman and one of the founders of [[Jotun (company)|Jotun Group Private Ltd.]], a company started by [[Odd Gleditsch]] to sell specialized paints and coatings to the shipping industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://snl.no/Jotun_A%2FS|title=     Jotun A/S|publisher =Store norske leksikon|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    https://snl.no/Odd_Gleditsch|title=     Odd Gleditsch|publisher =Store norske leksikon|accessdate= January 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20410">'''Open science data''' is a type of [[open data]] focused on publishing observations and results of scientific activities available for anyone to analyze and reuse. A major purpose of the drive for open data is to allow the verification of scientific claims, by allowing others to look at the reprodubility of results,&lt;ref name=spiegelhalter&gt;Spiegelhalter, D. [http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/01/15/open-data-and-trust-in-the-literature/ Open data and trust in the literature.] The Scholarly Kitchen. Retrieved 7 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and to allow data from many sources to be integrated to give new knowledge.&lt;ref name=FAIR/&gt; While the ''idea'' of open science data has been actively promoted since the 1950s, the rise of the [[Internet]] has significantly lowered the cost and time required to publish or obtain data.

==History==
The concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established with the formation of the [[World Data Center]] system (now the [[World Data System]]), in preparation for the [[International Geophysical Year]] of 1957–1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Committee on Scientific Accomplishments of Earth Observations from Space, National Research Council|title=Earth Observations from Space: The First 50 Years of Scientific Achievements|year=2008|publisher=The National Academies Press|isbn=0-309-11095-5|page=6|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11991&amp;page=6 |accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Council of Scientific Unions (now the [[International Council for Science]]) established several World Data Centers to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility, further recommending in 1955 that data be made available in machine-readable form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Data Center System|title=About the World Data Center System|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/wdc/about.shtml|publisher=NOAA, National Geophysical Data Center|accessdate=2010-11-24|date=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first initiative to create a database of electronic bibliography of open access data was the [[Education Resources Information Center|Educational Resources Information Center]] (ERIC) in 1966. In the same year, [[MEDLINE]] was created – a free access online database managed by the [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] and the [[National Institute of Health]] (USA) with bibliographical citations from journals in the biomedical area, which later would be called [[PubMed]], currently with over 14 million complete articles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/download/38678263/Open_Science_open_issues_Digital.pdf#page=190 Machado, Jorge. "Open data and open science". ''In'' Albagli, Maciel, Abdo. "Open Science, Open Questions", 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 GCDIS (US) put its position clearly in 
''On the Full and Open Exchange of Scientific Data'' (A publication of the Committee on Geophysical and Environmental Data - National Research Council):

{{quote|text="The Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere form an integrated system that transcends national boundaries. To understand the elements of the system, the way they interact, and how they have changed with time, it is necessary to collect and analyze environmental data from all parts of the world. Studies of the global environment require international collaboration for many reasons:
* to address global issues, it is essential to have global data sets and products derived from these data sets;
* it is more efficient and cost-effective for each nation to share its data and information than to collect everything it needs independently; and
* the implementation of effective policies addressing issues of the global environment requires the involvement from the outset of nearly all nations of the world.
International programs for global change research and environmental monitoring crucially depend on the principle of full and open data exchange (i.e., data and information are made available without restriction, on a non-discriminatory basis, for no more than the cost of reproduction and distribution)."
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18769/on-the-full-and-open-exchange-of-scientific-data|title=On the Full and Open Exchange of Scientific Data|last=National Research Council|first=|publisher=The National Academies Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=|language=en|doi=10.17226/18769}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The last phrase highlights the traditional cost of disseminating information by print and post. It is the removal of this cost through the Internet which has made data vastly easier to disseminate technically. It is correspondingly cheaper to create, sell and control many data resources and this has led to the current concerns over non-open data.

In 2004, the Science Ministers of all nations of the [[OECD]] (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), which includes most developed countries of the world, signed a declaration which essentially states that all publicly funded archive data should be made publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/0,2340,en_2649_34487_25998799_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Declaration on Open Access to publicly funded data]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420102950/http://www.oecd.org/document/0%2C2340%2Cen_2649_34487_25998799_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |date=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a request and an intense discussion with data-producing institutions in member states, the OECD published in 2007 the ''OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding'' as a ''soft-law'' recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/55/0,3343,en_2649_201185_38500791_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Edd Dumbill introduced an “Open Data” theme in XTech, including:
* [[Open government]]
* Public web services
* Grassroots data
* Scientific and academic publishing
* [[Intellectual property]]
* Blogging and personal content
* [[Semantic Web]]

In 2006 Science Commons&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spatial.maine.edu/icfs/ Science Commons in Washington 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; ran a 2-day conference in Washington where the primary topic could be described as Open Data. It was reported that the amount of micro-protection of data (e.g. by license) in areas such as biotechnology was creating a [[Tragedy of the anticommons]]. In this the costs of obtaining licenses from a large number of owners made it uneconomic to do research in the area.

In 2007 SPARC and Science Commons announced a consolidation and enhancement of their author addenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mx2.arl.org/Lists/SPARC-OAForum/Message/3767.html SPARC-OAF forum]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the [[OECD]] (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) published the Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding|url=http://www.oecd.org/sti/sci-tech/oecdprinciplesandguidelinesforaccesstoresearchdatafrompublicfunding.htm|website=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Principles state that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Access to research data increases the returns from public investment in this area; reinforces open scientific inquiry; encourages diversity of studies and opinion; promotes new areas of work and enables the exploration of topics not envisioned by the initial investigators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010 the [[Panton Principles]] launched,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.okfn.org/2010/02/19/launch-of-the-panton-principles-for-open-data-in-science/ Launch of the Panton Principles for Open Data in Science and 'Is It Open Data?' Web Service]&lt;/ref&gt; advocating  Open Data in science and setting out for principles to which providers must comply to have their data Open.

In 2011 [http://linkedscience.org LinkedScience.org] was launched to realize the approach of the Linked Open Science&lt;ref name="kauppinen"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kauppinen | first1 = T. | last2 = Espindola | first2 = G. M. D. | doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2011.04.076 | title = Linked Open Science-Communicating, Sharing and Evaluating Data, Methods and Results for Executable Papers | journal = Procedia Computer Science | volume = 4 | pages = 726 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to openly share and interconnect scientific assets like datasets, methods, tools and vocabularies.

In 2012, the [[Royal Society]] published a major report, "Science as an Open Enterprise"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/|title=Final report - Science as an open enterprise|website=royalsociety.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, advocating open scientific data and considering its benefits and requirements.

In 2013 the G8 Science Ministers released a Statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=G8 Science Ministers Statement|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/g8-science-ministers-statement|publisher=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting a set of principles for open scientific research data

In 2015 the [[World Data System]] of the [[International Council for Science]] adopted a new set of Data Sharing Principles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Data Organization Adopts Open Data Sharing Principles|url=http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=159210&amp;CultureCode=en|accessdate=8 January 2016|publisher=AlphaGalileo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Data System (WDS) Data Sharing Principles|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.34354|website=ZENODO|accessdate=8 January 2016|doi=10.5281/zenodo.34354}}&lt;/ref&gt; to embody the spirit of 'open science'. These Principles are in line with data policies of national and international initiatives and they express core ethical commitments operationalized in the WDS Certification of trusted data repositories and service.

==Relation to open access==
Much data is made available through scholarly publication, which now attracts intense debate under "[[Open access (publishing)|Open Access]]" and [[Semantic Web|semantically open formats]] &amp;ndash; like to offer the [[Scientific literature|scientific articles]] in [[Journal Article Tag Suite|JATS]] format. The [[Budapest Open Access Initiative]] (2001) coined this term:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By "open access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The logic of the declaration permits re-use of the data although the term "literature" has connotations of human-readable text and can imply a scholarly publication process. In Open Access discourse the term "full-text" is often used which does not emphasize the data contained within or accompanying the publication.

Some Open Access publishers do not require the authors to assign copyright and the data associated with these publications can normally be regarded as Open Data. Some publishers have Open Access strategies where the publisher requires assignment of the copyright and where it is unclear that the data in publications can be truly regarded as Open Data.

The ALPSP and STM publishers have issued a statement about the desirability of making data freely available:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpsp.org/Ebusiness/AboutALPSP/ALPSPStatements/Statementdetails.aspx?ID=55 A statement by the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP) and the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM)], [[Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Publishers recognise that in many disciplines data itself, in various forms, is now a key output of research. Data searching and mining tools permit increasingly sophisticated use of raw data. Of course, journal articles provide one ‘view’ of the significance and interpretation of that data – and conference presentations and informal exchanges may provide other ‘views’ – but data itself is an increasingly important community resource. Science is best advanced by allowing as many scientists as possible to have access to as much prior data as possible; this avoids costly repetition of work, and allows creative new integration and reworking of existing data.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We believe that, as a general principle, data sets, the raw data outputs of research, and sets or sub-sets of that data which are submitted with a paper to a journal, should wherever possible be made freely accessible to other scholars. We believe that the best practice for scholarly journal publishers is to separate supporting data from the article itself, and not to require any transfer of or ownership in such data or data sets as a condition of publication of the article in question.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Even though this statement was without any effect on the open availability of primary data related to publications in journals of the ALPSP and STM members. Data tables provided by the authors as supplement with a paper are still available to subscribers only.

==Relation to peer review==
In an effort to address issues with the reproducibility of research results, some scholars are asking that authors agree to share their raw data as part of the [[scholarly peer review]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The PRO Initiative for Open Science |url=https://opennessinitiative.org/ |website=Peer Reviewers' Openness Initiative |accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far back as 1962, for example, a number of psychologists have attempted to obtain raw data sets from other researchers, with mixed results, in order to reanalyze them. A recent attempt resulted in only seven data sets out of fifty requests. The notion of obtaining, let alone requiring, open data as a condition of peer review remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witkowski |first1=Tomasz |authorlink1=Tomasz Witkowski |title=A Scientist Pushes Psychology Journals toward Open Data |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=6-7 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915205014/https://forbiddenpsychology.wordpress.com/2017/07/29/a-scientist-pushes-psychology-journals-toward-open-data/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open research computation ==

{{main article|Open research computation}}

To make sense of scientific data they must be analysed. In all but the simplest cases, this is done by software. The extensive use of software poses problems for the [[reproducibility]] of research. To keep research reproducible, it is necessary to publish not only all data, but also the source code of all software used, and all the parametrization used in running this software. Presently, these requests are rarely ever met. Ways to come closer to reproducible scientific computation are discussed under the catchword "[[open research computation]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3202">'''Otto Garlepp''' (20 August 1864, [[Cörmigk]]&amp;nbsp;– 25 November 1959, [[Köthen]]), was a [[Germany|German]] [[naturalist]] and with his brother  '''Gustav Garlepp''' (1862–1907) a professional collector.

The brothers Otto Garlepp and Gustav Garlepp  are honoured in the butterfly name ''[[Papilio garleppi]]'', the bird name ''[[Cochabamba mountain finch|Compsospiza garleppi]]'' the mammal name [[Garlepp's mouse]], a subspecies of the [[Pampas cat]] and another of  [[Darwin's rhea]] amongst many others. They were professional collectors in South America from 1883. At first Gustav worked alone, arriving in Brazil where there were many people of German descent ([[German Brazilian|"Deutschbrasilianer"]]) to collect insects for [[State Museum of Zoology, Dresden|Dresden Zoological Museum]]. Gustav returned to Germany in 1892 following 4 years in Peru, a short trip to Germany and then an expedition to Bolivia. He returned to Bolivia in 1893 with his wife and Otto. He visited Germany for the last time in 1900 when he demonstrated 600 Neotropical bird species at a meeting of the  [[Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft]] in Leipzig.Gustav Garlepp settled in Paraguay in 1901. He was murdered there in 1907. Otto returned to Germany in 1911. He married Elise Ida Schulz in Germany and the couple returned to South America. Otto's collecting ceased in 1913.

The Garlepp [[zoological specimen]]s are from  [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]]  [[Paraguay]], [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].Many are [[holotype]]s.

4,000 Garlepp [[Bird collections|bird skins]] were purchased by  [[Hans von Berlepsch]] who had trained Otto and who [[Alpha taxonomy|described]] the new species.The specimens are now in [[Naturmuseum Senckenberg]]  and [[Naturhistorisches Museum (Braunschweig)|Naturhistorisches Museum Braunschweig]].Further specimens are in Naumann Museum, Köthener Schloss ([https://web.archive.org/web/20140212135453/http://www.bachstadt-koethen.de/kunst-und-kultur/naumann-museum.html Website]).[[Oology]] specimens are held by the [[State Museum of Zoology, Dresden|Staatliches Museum für Tierkunde]] in Dresden (from the collection of [[Maximilian Kuschel]]), and by  [[Naturhistorisches Museum]] in Vienna (from the collection of  [[Josef Seilern]]  (1883–1939)). Mammal specimens are in [[Museum für Naturkunde]] in Berlin. Butterflies went to the dealership [[Otto Staudinger]]. These are now widely dispersed as are insects of other orders.

'''Peenemünde''' ({{IPA-de|peːnəˈmʏndə}}, {{lang-en|"[[Peene]] [River] Mouth"}}) is a municipality on the [[Baltic Sea]] island of [[Usedom]] in the [[Vorpommern-Greifswald]] district in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Germany]]. It is part of the ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' (municipal confederation) of [[Usedom-Nord]]. The community is known for the [[Peenemünde Army Research Center]], where the world's first functional large-scale [[liquid-propellant rocket]], the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]], was developed.

==Geography==
[[File:Peenemuende, UBB-Bahnhof.JPG|thumb|left|Peenemünde railway station for service to [[Zinnowitz]]]]
[[File:V2 rocket.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[V-2 rocket]]]]
The village with its seaport is located on the westernmost extremity of a long sand-spit, where the Peene empties into the Baltic Sea, in the northwestern part of Usedom Island. To the southeast it borders on the sea resort of [[Karlshagen]].

Peenemünde harbour can be reached by ferry boat across the Peene from [[Kröslin]], liners also run along the Baltic coast to [[Rügen]] Island. The local railway station is the northern terminus of the ''[[Usedomer Bäderbahn]]'' line to [[Zinnowitz]]. Air service for the village is available at the [[Peenemünde Airfield]].

==History==
During the 10th and 11th centuries, Peenemünde was part of the region of [[Circipania]], an area settled by the Circipanes, a [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribe constituent of the [[Lutici federation]]. Circipania was incorporated into the [[Billung March]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 936, but the Empire's influence in the region decayed by the end of that century after a successful Slavic uprising. During the late 12th century, in the aftermath of the [[Wendish Crusade]], the region fell under the rule of the [[Duchy of Pomerania]]. After the [[Treaty of Kremmen]] in 1236, most of Circipania was transferred to the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Buchholz (historian)|Bucholz, Werner]] (1999). Pommern. Deutsche Geschichte im Osten Europas. Siedler, pp. 23ff. {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[World War II]], the area was highly involved in the development and production of the V-2 rocket, until the production's relocation to [[Nordhausen]]. The village's docks were used for the ships which recovered [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] wreckage from test launches over the [[Baltic Sea]]. German scientists such as [[Wernher von Braun]], who worked at the V-2 facility, were known as "Peenemünders".  The entire island was captured by the [[Soviet Red Army]] on 5 May 1945.  The gas plant for the production of [[liquid oxygen]] still lies in ruins at the entrance to Peenemünde.

The [[post-war]] port was a Soviet [[naval base]] until turned over to the armed forces of [[East Germany]] in 1952. The seaport facilities were used at first by the East German ''Seepolizei'' (sea police) after new facilities for police [[motorboat]]s had been built. On 1 December 1956 the headquarters of the First Fleet of the East German [[Volksmarine|People's Navy]] was established at Peenemünde.

The birthplace of modern rocket science is today displayed at the [[Historical Technical Museum, Peenemünde|Peenemünde Historical Technical Museum]], a [[World War II]] museum on the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] opened in 1992 in the power station of the former Army Testing Site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Peenemünde Historical Technical Museum|url=http://www.peenemuende.de/index.php?id=40&amp;L=1|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the area of the World War II [[power station]] (now part of the village) – exhibits include a [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]] and a V-2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9304">'''Photoanalysis''' (or photo analysis) refers to the study of [[pictures]] to compile various types of data, for example, to measure the size distribution of virtually anything that can be captured by photo.  Photoanalysis technology has changed the way mines and mills quantify fragmented material.

Images are a good way to document conditions before, after, and even during blasting activities.   The technology is advancing at a high rate, and lenses, storage media memory, light sensitivity and [[image resolution|resolution]] have been improving steadily.  Today's digital cameras and camcorders include high-resolution optics, compact size, automatic time and date stamps, good battery life, shutters to freeze motion, and computers to [[autofocus]] and eliminate jitter using [[image stabilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Palangio, Tom C. in the article "Digital Image Analysis" Featured in ''The Journal of Explosives Engineering'' Volume 26, Number 1&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

== Mining ==



Photoanalysis in [[mining]] operations can provide an automated system that forewarns a company of potential problems with materials, leading to economies and reduced damage caused from over-sized materials.  It can also help determine the effectiveness of blasts.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, John &amp; Katsabanis, Takis. ''Measurement of Blast Fragmentation.'' Page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

A company can use this technology to monitor materials moving on a [[conveyor belt]] in an underground environment, to measure piles left over from a blast, and even measure the amount of material being carried by dump trucks or vessels to a destination.

Photoanalysis is being used on [[mill (grinding)#SAG mill|SAG mills]] worldwide to control the size of rock being crushed.&lt;ref&gt;Fragmentation for Maximising the Sag Mill Throughput at Porgera Gold Mine. Authors are Cam Grundstrom, Porgera joint venture, Sarma S. Kanchibotla, DynoConsult - Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific, Alex Jankovich, Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre, Darren Thornton, Julium Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies are using this technology to determine the size of particles being processed in the SAG Mill.[http://www.dynonobel.com/dynonobelcom/en/global/consulting/technicallibrary/sagmillthroughput.htm]  Having oversize material entering the SAG mill makes an operation less efficient, costing companies money in electrical and maintenance costs.  Photoanalysis technology can eliminate unwanted material before it enters the mill, keeping [[rock crushing]] costs low.&lt;ref&gt;''Optimising Your SAG Mill Operation'' International Mining Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{-}}

==Forestry==

[[File:Photoanalysis 70.JPG|right|250px]]

[[woodchips|Wood chip]] size can affect the overall quality of a product.  With automated photoanalysis systems, companies can remove any unwanted wrong-size particles without stopping their mill process.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, John &amp; Katsabanis, Takis. ''Measurement of Blast Fragmentation.'' Page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Photoanalysis can affect how efficiently forestry companies operate. In mills worldwide, photoanalysis technology is improving the use of lumber products, cutting back on the amount of trees being used to operate, and saving companies money through [[quality control]] optimization.[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mining,+forestry+suppliers+unite+to+offer+industry+%22packaged...-a0123583683]

With the current downturn in the North American forestry industry, operators are looking at making their mills more efficient and effective when processing materials.  Photoanalysis technology helps identify any weaknesses in the process by continuously monitoring different sections of an operation.
{{-}}

==Agriculture==

[[Image:Corn measured.JPG|right|250px|Woodchip Analyzer]]

[[Agricultural]] companies can, using photoanalysis, monitor conveyor belts of food without contaminating the product by touching it.  Other benefits of photoanalysis systems include:

*Automated removal of any unwanted material on food conveyor
*Improved quality control for the most important parts of the agricultural process
*Pinpoint accuracy that helps the efficiency and effectiveness of product handling techniques

The importance of photoanalysis technology is being noticed by the agricultural industry as it identifies any unwanted materials going through the process.  In an example, if a mouse is on a conveyor of corn, photoanalysis technology would be able to identify the unwanted object and remove it before it contaminates the whole process.
{{-}}

==Origins of photoanalysis technology==

Photoanalysis technology was created by using the Waterloo Image Enhancement Process in the 1980s.  After further development of the imaging process with explosives producer DuPont, engineers Tom Palangio and Takis Katsabanis began selling photoanalysis software commercially.  They later renamed the process WipFrag, standing for '''W'''aterloo '''I'''mage '''P'''rocess '''Frag'''mentation

Today, photoanalysis technology has evolved into stabilized and portable systems that can automatically capture and analyze results instantly.  Thousands of these products are currently being used around the world to measure fragmented material.

==Fragmentation analysis==

'''Fragmentation analysis''' is becoming a popular term in mining, agricultural and forestry industries. With the majority of money in these industries directed towards the proper sizing of materials, companies are using fragmentation analysis to determine various factors within an operation.[http://www.isee.org/2008%20Abstracts/08v127g.pdf]

The two main ways a company keeps track of fragmented material are through manual and automated [[Sieve analysis|sieving]] procedures. Manual sieving involves extracting a sample of material to analyze the size distribution. The results can be tabulated within two days.  Automated sieving is an advanced way of sieving materials running through a process.  Without having to extract the material, photoanalysis can take place, allowing for immediate results with pinpoint accuracy.
{{-}}

==Blast Fragmentation Software==
Operators are using fragmentation analysis to determine the effectiveness of various [[Rock blasting|blasts]]. With automated sieving technology, workers can track the success of these blasts and receive instant results. Companies are using these results to determine what blasting method yielded the best results for their specific operation.  The common variables associated with blast optimization are the provided Particle Size Distribution (PSD) from a shovel fragmentation system, geology including rock type and fracturing, and energy factor.

By using photoanalysis the fragmented materials can be monitored, offering pinpoint accuracy and allowing mine operators to make adjustments to future blasting procedures. See [[Optical Granulometry]] to view the automated sieving process.
{{-}}

==Pre-crushing analysis==

[[Image:WipFrag Momentum.png|right|150px]]
Maintenance costs can be significantly reduced if an operation focuses on the fragmentation of the particles passing through their process.  Automated sieving systems can detect and help remove any oversize material before it enters the crusher and causes maintenance problems. It also helps determine the effectiveness of the mining process prior to crushing; the sizing of material is always a critical part of operations in the mining, forestry and agricultural industries.

Having an analysis taking place at every major point in an operation allows for the proper tracking of material being processed. Engineers can then determine what part of the process needs improving based solely on the size of material.

==Post-crushing analysis==

[[Image:Graph of SAG Mill vs. Household.png|250px|right]]

Measuring how effective industrial crushers are can help save a company millions of dollars in energy costs on an annual basis. There are two components that affect a typical crusher: the size of the material inputted, and the speed at which the crusher is moving. If the user can find a perfect balance between these two components, the materials will be crushed to the right size in the shortest time possible.

Meeting the material standards set by governments and large companies can be hard. Having a post-crushing analysis taking place ensures that no oversize material gets shipped; eliminating the chance of getting fined for not meeting industry specifications.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.abb.com/GLOBAL/SCOT/SCOT216.nsf/VerityDisplay/B050FB158019A610C1256F320027AA54/$File/Agnico%20CS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10389">'''Rancidity''' is the complete or incomplete oxidation or hydrolysis of fats and oils when exposed to air, light, moisture or by bacterial action, resulting in unpleasant taste and odor. Specifically, it is the [[hydrolysis]] or [[autoxidation]] of [[fat]]s into short-chain [[aldehydes]] and [[ketones]], which are objectionable in taste and odor.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Erich Lück and Gert-Wolfhard von Rymon Lipinski "Foods, 3. Food Additives" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a11_561}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these processes occur in food, undesirable odors and flavors can result. In certain cases, however, the flavors can be desirable (as in [[aged cheese]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Thomas, "Fats and Fatty Oils" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In processed meats, these flavors are collectively known as [[warmed-over flavor]]. Rancidification can also detract from the nutritional value of food, as some [[vitamin]]s are sensitive to oxidation.&lt;ref name="german"&gt;{{cite book|title=Naturwissenschaftliche Grundlagen der Lebensmittelzubereitung|first=Waldemar|last=Termes|publisher=Behr's Verlag|pages=50–37|isbn=9783925673849|year=1990|place=Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to rancidification, oxidative degradation also occurs in other hydrocarbons, such as [[lubricating oil]]s, [[fuel]]s, and mechanical [[cutting fluid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter P. Klemchuk "Antioxidants" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a03_091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathways==
Three pathways for rancidification are recognized:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Freeman | first1 = I. P. | chapter = Margarines and Shortenings | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a16_145 | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2000 | isbn = 3527306730 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrolytic===
[[Hydrolysis|Hydrolytic]] rancidity refers to the odor that develops when [[triglyceride]]s are hydrolyzed and free fatty acids are released. This reaction of lipid with water may require a [[catalyst]], leading to the formation of free [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. In particular, [[short-chain fatty acid]]s, such as [[butyric acid]], are [[odor|malodorous]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/862091138|title=Chemistry : course companion|last=Sergey,|first=Bylikin,|others=Horner, Gary,, Murphy, Brian,, Tarcy, David,|isbn=9780198392125|edition= 2014 |location=Oxford|oclc=862091138}}&lt;/ref&gt; When short-chain fatty acids are produced, they serve as catalysts themselves, further accelerating the reaction, a form of [[autocatalysis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Oxidative===
[[Organic redox reaction|Oxidative]] rancidity is associated with the degradation by oxygen in the air. The [[double bond]]s of an [[Fatty acid#Unsaturated fatty acids|unsaturated fatty acid]] can be cleaved by [[Radical (chemistry)|free-radical]] reactions involving molecular oxygen. This reaction causes the release of malodorous and highly [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s. Because of the nature of free-radical reactions, the reaction is catalyzed by sunlight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Oxidation primarily occurs with unsaturated fats. For example, even though meat is held under refrigeration or in a frozen state, the poly-unsaturated fat will continue to oxidize and slowly become rancid. The fat oxidation process, potentially resulting in rancidity, begins immediately after the animal is slaughtered and the muscle, intra-muscular, inter-muscular and surface fat becomes exposed to oxygen of the air. This chemical process continues during frozen storage, though more slowly at lower temperature. Oxidative rancidity can be prevented by light-proof packaging, oxygen-free atmosphere (air-tight containers) and by the addition of [[antioxidant]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Microbial===
[[Microorganism|Microbial]] rancidity refers to a process in which microorganisms, such as bacteria or [[mold]]s, use their enzymes such as [[lipase]]s to break down fat.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/regulatory/understanding-rancidity-nutritional-lipids&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilization can reduce this process.

==Health effects==
Consuming rancid food products is unlikely to cause immediate illness or harm, although rancidification can reduce the nutritional value of food by degradation of [[nutrient]]s.&lt;ref name="german" /&gt;

==Prevention==
[[Image:Lipid peroxidation.svg|thumb|right|The [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]] pathway for the first phase of the oxidative rancidification of fats.]]
[[Antioxidant]]s are often used as [[preservative]]s in fat-containing foods to delay the onset or slow the development of rancidity due to oxidation. Natural antioxidants include [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) and [[tocopherol]]s (vitamin E). Synthetic antioxidants include [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA), [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT), [[TBHQ]], [[propyl gallate]] and [[ethoxyquin]]. The natural antioxidants tend to be short-lived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rahmawati S, Bundjali B |title=Kinetics of the oxidation of vitamin C|journal=Prosiding Seminar Kimia Bersama UKM-ITB|volume=VIII|issue=9-11|pages= 535–46 |year=2009|pmid=|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228484005_KINETICS_OF_THE_OXIDATION_OF_VITAMIN_C}}&lt;/ref&gt; so synthetic antioxidants are used when a longer shelf-life is preferred. The effectiveness of water-soluble antioxidants is limited in preventing direct oxidation within fats, but is valuable in intercepting free [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]]s that travel through the aqueous parts of foods. A combination of water-soluble and fat-soluble antioxidants is ideal, usually in the ratio of fat to water.

In addition, rancidification can be decreased by storing fats and oils in a cool, dark place with little exposure to oxygen or free radicals, since heat and light accelerate the rate of reaction of fats with oxygen. Antimicrobial agents can also delay or prevent rancidification by inhibiting the growth of bacteria or other micro-organisms that affect the process.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;
&lt;!--seems highly tangential for an article on rancidification:
The body reduces lipid radicals with fat-soluble [[vitamin E]], reducing oxidized vitamin E with water soluble [[vitamin C]], and recycling vitamin C. The propagation reaction:
:lipid and lipid peroxyl radical and oxygen —→ lipid peroxide and lipid peroxyl radical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1042/BST0290358 |vauthors=Young IS, McEneny J |title=Lipoprotein oxidation and atherosclerosis|journal=Biochem Soc Trans|volume=29|issue=Pt 2|pages= 358–62|year=2001|pmid=11356183|url=http://www.biochemsoctrans.org/bst/029/0358/bst0290358.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and the antioxidant reaction, act together:

:reduced antioxidant and radical —→ oxidized antioxidant and reduced radical.

giving an overall exponential reaction under oxygen, modulated by the antioxidant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Innovative Food Science &amp; Emerging Technologies|volume=1|issue=4|date=December 2000|pages=239–243|doi=10.1016/S1466-8564(00)00018-7|title= Occurrence and activity of natural antioxidants in herbal spirits|first=Christian|last=Imark|first2=Markus|last2=Kneubühl|first3= Stefan|last3=Bodmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

[[oxygen scavenger|Oxygen scavenging]] technology can be used to remove oxygen from food packaging and therefore prevent oxidative rancidification.

==Oxidative stability measurement==
Oxidative stability is a measure of oil or fat resistance to oxidation. Because the process takes place through a [[chain reaction]], the oxidation reaction has a period when it is relatively slow, before it suddenly speeds up. The time for this to happen is called the "induction time", and it is repeatable under identical conditions (temperature, air flow, etc.). There are a number of ways to measure the progress of the oxidation reaction. One of the most popular methods currently in use is the Rancimat method.

The Rancimat method is carried out using an air current at temperatures between 50 and 220&amp;nbsp;°C. The volatile oxidation products (largely [[formic acid]]&lt;ref name=Allen94&gt;{{cite book|title=Rancidity in Foods|author1=Allen, J.C.  |author2=Hamilton, R.J. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1994 |publisher=Springer-Verlag GmbH|isbn=978-0-8342-1287-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lcMgZHWIRUsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;47&lt;/sup&gt;) are carried by the air current into the measuring vessel, where they are absorbed (dissolve) in the measuring fluid ([[distilled water]]). By continuous measurement of the conductivity of this solution, oxidation curves can be generated. The [[Cusp (singularity)|cusp point]] of the oxidation curve (the point where a rapid rise in the conductivity starts) gives the induction time of the rancidification reaction,&lt;ref name=nut&gt;{{cite book|title=Tree nut oils: chemical characteristics, oxidation and antioxidants|author=Miraliakbari, H.|year=2007|publisher=Library and Archives Canada = Bibliothèque et Archives Canada|isbn= 978-0-494-19381-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Elz09NWHTBcC|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be taken as an indication of the oxidative stability of the sample.

The Rancimat method, the oxidative stability instrument (OSI) and the oxidograph were all developed as automatic versions of the more complicated AOM (active oxygen method), which is based on measuring peroxide values,&lt;ref name=nut/&gt; for determining the induction time of fats and oils. Over time, the Rancimat method has become established, and it has been accepted into a number of national and international standards, for example [[American Oil Chemists' Society|AOCS]] Cd 12b-92 and ISO 6886.

'''Robert Damon''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FGS}}  (1814 – 4 May 1889) was an [[England|English]] [[conchologist]] and [[geologist]].

Damon was at first a [[Hosiery|hosier]] and [[glove]]r but with his son Robert Ferris Damon (1845–1929) he established a dealership in natural history specimens in [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]]. The company supplied museums throughout North and South America, Australia and Europe with much Dorset geological material from the late 1840s to 1914. In 1860 Damon wrote ''Geology of Weymouth and the Isles of Portland; with Notes on the Natural History of the Coast and Neighbourhood'' which includes a map of the district, geological sections, plates of fossils, and coast views, in 1884 a second edition with archaeological notes was published. He also wrote (and published himself in 1857) ''A catalogue of the shells of Great Britain and Ireland with their synonyms and authorities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/creator/8562 |title=By 'Damon, Robert, 1814–1889' |publisher=[[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] |accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damon died aged 75 at his museum in Weymouth from heart disease.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

The species ''[[Amoria damonii]]'' Gray, and ''[[Paramelania damoni]]'' were named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.britishshellclub.org/pages/pallid-past/200610_pallidula.pdf |title=Robert Damon's Shell Collection |last=Dance |first=S.

"'''She Blinded Me with Science'''" is a song by the English musician [[Thomas Dolby]], released in 1982. It was first released as a single in the UK in October 1982 and was subsequently included on the EP ''[[Blinded by Science]]'' and the second edition of Dolby's debut album ''[[The Golden Age of Wireless]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Although viewed as a success in the United States, peaking at No. 5 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and 2 weeks at No. 1 in Canada's [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine]], the song barely managed to score among the Top 50 in Dolby's native United Kingdom, peaking at No. 49 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Dolby is often considered a [[one-hit wonder]] in the United States on the basis of the song's chart success there. In 2002, US cable television network [[VH1]] named "She Blinded Me with Science" No. 20 on its list of the "100 Greatest One-hit Wonders".&lt;ref name="onehit"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/the_greatest/one_hit_wonders/list_20-1.jhtml |title=Greatest One Hit Wonders List &gt; Hour 5: #20 – 1 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040831035624/http://www.vh1.com/shows/series/the_greatest/one_hit_wonders/list_20-1.jhtml |archivedate= 31 August 2004}}. [[VH1]].&lt;/ref&gt; While the song is Dolby's only Top 40 single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, he has had other songs that scored on the music charts.

==Song structure==
The song features interjections from the British scientist and TV presenter [[Magnus Pyke]],&lt;ref name="onehit"/&gt; who repeatedly interjects "Science!" and delivers other lines in a deliberately over-the-top [[mad scientist]] voice, such as, "Good heavens, Miss Sakamoto, you're beautiful!"

==Music video==
In the music video, directed and shot entirely by Dolby, Dolby commits himself to the Home for Deranged Scientists. Various mad scientist types operate fanciful inventions on the grounds of the home and act insane with normal scientific items. Throughout the course of the video, [[Magnus Pyke]] (as the Home Doctor) tries to diagnose his ailment, all the while being seduced by Miss Sakamoto, a secretary in the home.

Dolby saw music videos with story lines as "short silent films with a soundtrack". The video for "She Blinded Me with Science" was conceived and storyboarded before the song was written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Dan |last= MacIntosh |title= Thomas Dolby : Songwriter Interviews |website= Songfacts |date= 16 March 2011 |access-date= 24 April 2017 |url= http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/thomas_dolby/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolby added the song title and then wrote the song to fit the planned video. He then directed the music video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Thomas |last= Dolby |date= 11 October 2016 |title= The Speed of Sound: Breaking the Barriers Between Music and Technology: A Memoir |publisher= Flatiron Books |isbn= 1250071844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samples==
The song was used in the video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'', as a collectible. The song was also sampled by [[Mobb Deep]] in their song "Got It Twisted". Thomas Dolby approved the sample to be used by [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], who produced the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Insanul |last= Ahmed |title= The Alchemist Tells All: The Stories Behind His Classic Records (Part 1) &gt; Mobb Deep "Got It Twisted" (2004) |date= 30 September 2012 |magazine= [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |url= http://uk.complex.com/music/2012/09/the-alchemist-tells-all-the-stories-behind-his-classic-records-part-1/mobb-deep-got-it-twisted |accessdate= 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social exchange theory''' is a [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychological]] and [[sociological perspective]] that explains social change and stability as a process of negotiated exchanges between parties. Social exchange theory posits that human [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s are formed by the use of a subjective cost-benefit analysis and the comparison of alternatives.  The theory has roots in [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. Social exchange theory features many of the main assumptions found in [[rational choice theory]] and [[structuralism]].
It is also used quite frequently in the business world to imply a two-sided, mutually contingent and rewarding process involving transactions or simply exchange.

==History==

Social exchange theory goes back to Thibaut and Kelley (1959), Kelley and Thibaut (1978), Homans (1961) and Rusbult (1983). Sociologist [[George Homans]] published a work "Social Behavior as Exchange".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Karen S. Cook and Erick R. W.Rice. Department of Sociology, Stanford University, Stanford California 94305. Handbook of Sociological Theory, edited by Jonathan H. Turner. kluwer Academic/ Plenum Publishers, New York.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined social exchange as the exchange of activity, tangible or intangible, and more or less rewarding or costly, between at least two persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Homans|first=George|title=Social Behavior: Its Elementary Forms.|year=1961|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Homans founded the theory, other theorists continued to write about it, particularly Peter M. Blau and Richard M. Emerson, who in addition to Homans are generally thought of as the major developers of the exchange perspective within sociology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Homans' work emphasized the individual behavior of actors in interaction with one another. Although there are various modes of exchange, Homans centered his studies on dyadic exchange.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Karen S. |first2=Eric |last2=Rice |year= |chapter=Social Exchange Theory |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnVAuljbRcQC&amp;pg=PA53 |pages=53–76 |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=DeLamater|editor-link1=John DeLamater |title=The Handbook of Social Psychology |isbn=978-0-387-36921-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Thibaut and Harold Kelley are recognized for focusing their studies within the theory on the psychological concepts, the dyad and small group.&lt;ref name=Emerson&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.so.02.080176.002003|title=Social Exchange Theory|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=2|pages=335–362|year=1976|last1=Emerson|first1=R M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lévi-Strauss]] is recognized for contributing to the emergence of this theoretical perspective from his work on anthropology focused on systems of generalized exchange, such as kinship systems and gift exchange.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;

Homans summarizes the system in three propositions: success, stimulus, and deprivation–satiation proposition.&lt;ref name=Emerson /&gt;
#Success proposition: When one finds they are rewarded for their actions, they tend to repeat the action.
#Stimulus proposition: The more often a particular stimulus has resulted in a reward in the past, the more likely it is that a person will respond to it.
#Deprivation–satiation proposition: The more often in the recent past a person has received a particular reward, the less valuable any further unit of that reward becomes.

[[Peter Blau]] focused his early writings on social exchange theory more towards the economic and utilitarian perspective, whereas Homans focused on reinforcement principles which presuppose individuals base their next social move on past experiences. Blau's utilitarian focus encouraged the theorist to look forward, as in what they anticipated the reward would be in regards to their next social interaction.&lt;ref name = Cook /&gt; Blau felt that if individuals focused too much on the psychological concepts within the theory, they would refrain from learning the developing aspects of social exchange.&lt;ref name=Emerson /&gt; Blau emphasized technical economic analysis whereas Homans concentrated more on the psychology of instrumental behavior.&lt;ref name=Emerson/&gt;

Richard Emerson's early work on the theory intertwined with both Homans and Blau's ideas. Homans believed that social exchange theory was based on reinforcement principles. According to Emerson, Exchange is not a theory, but a framework from which other theories can converge and be compared to structural functionalism.&lt;ref name=Emerson /&gt;  Emerson's perspective was similar to Blau's since they both focused on the relationship power had with the exchange process.&lt;ref name = Cook/&gt; Emerson says that social exchange theory is an approach in sociology that is described for simplicity as an economic analysis of noneconomic social situations.&lt;ref name=Emerson /&gt; Exchange theory brings a quasi-economic form of analysis into those situations.&lt;ref name=Emerson /&gt;

==Self-interest and interdependence==
[[Self-interest]] and [[interdependence]] are central properties of social exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=223504 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.217|title=Bringing Emotions into Social Exchange Theory|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=25|pages=217–244|year=1999|last1=Lawler|first1=Edward J.|last2=Thye|first2=Shane R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the basic forms of interaction when two or more actors have something of value to each other, and they have to decide whether to exchange and in what amounts.&lt;ref name=Lawler /&gt; Homans uses the concepts of [[individualism]] to explain exchange processes. To him, the meaning of individual self-interest is a combination of economic and psychological needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ekeh |first1=Peter P. |title=Social exchange theory: the two traditions |location=Cambridge, Mass |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1974}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulfilling self-interest is often common within the economic realm of the social exchange theory where competition and greed can be common.&lt;ref name="McDonell, J 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McDonell |first1=J. |last2=Strom-Gottfried |first2=K.

 | title=Interpersonal communication: The social exchange approach
 | publisher=Beverly Hills}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thibaut and Kelley see the mutual interdependence of persons as the central problem for the study of social behavior. They developed a [[Interdependence theory|theoretical framework]] based on the interdependence of actors. They also highlighted social implications of different forms of interdependence such as reciprocal control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=J. K. |title=Social exchange theory: its structure and influence in social psychology |location=London |publisher=Academic Press |year=1976 |oclc=163977277}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their interdependence definition, outcomes are based on a combination of parties' efforts and mutual and complementary arrangements.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;

==Basic concepts==
Social exchange theory views exchange as a social behavior that may result both in economic and social outcomes.&lt;ref name="Lambe, C. Jay 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1300/J033v08n03_01|title=Social Exchange Theory and Research on Business-to-Business Relational Exchange|journal=Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing|volume=8|issue=3|pages=1–36|year=2001|last1=Lambe|first1=C. Jay|last2=Wittmann|first2=C. Michael|last3=Spekman|first3=Robert E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social exchange theory has been generally analyzed by comparing human interactions with the marketplace. The study of the theory from the microeconomics perspective is attributed to Blau.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; Under his perspective every individual is trying to maximize his wins. Blau stated that once this concept is understood, it is possible to observe social exchanges everywhere, not only in market relations, but also in other social relations like friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=4193943 |doi=10.1177/000169937301600303 |title=A Structural Theory of Social Exchange |journal=Acta Sociologica |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=188–208 |year=1973 |last1=Burns |first1=T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social exchange process brings satisfaction when people receive fair returns for their expenditures. The major difference between social and economic exchange is the nature of the exchange between parties. Neoclassic economic theory views the actor as dealing not with another actor but with a market and environmental parameters, such as market price.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Karen S., and Richard Marc Emerson. Social exchange theory. Beverly Hills, Calif.: SAGE Publications, 1987. Print.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike economic exchange, the elements of social exchange are quite varied and cannot be reduced to a single quantitative exchange rate.&lt;ref name="georgetown2005"&gt;"SOCIAL EXCHANGE THEORY."

Web. 2 Nov. 2013. &lt;http://www.credoreference.com/entry/sagepr/social_exchange_theory&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stafford, social exchanges involve a connection with another person; involve trust and not legal obligations; are more flexible; and rarely involve explicit bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | publisher=Thousand Oaks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost and rewards===
Simple social exchange models assume that rewards and costs drive relationship decisions.&lt;ref name="georgetown2005"/&gt; Both parties in a social exchange take responsibility for one another and depend on each other. The elements of relational life include:

'''Costs''' are the elements of relational life that have negative value to a person, such as the effort put into a relationship and the negatives of a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=West | first=Richard
 | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn
 | year=2007
 | title=Introducing Communication Theory
 | pages=186–7
 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Costs can be time, money, effort etc.)

'''Rewards''' are the elements of a relationship that have positive value. (Rewards can be sense of acceptance, support, and companionship etc.)

As with everything dealing with the social exchange theory, it has as its outcome satisfaction and dependence of relationships. The social-exchange perspective argues that people calculate the overall worth of a particular relationship by subtracting its costs from the rewards it provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:{{math|Worth {{=}} Rewards − Costs}}

If worth is a positive number, it is a positive relationship. On the contrary, a negative number indicates a negative relationship. The worth of a relationship influences its outcome, or whether people will continue with a relationship or terminate it. Positive relationships are expected to endure, whereas negative relationships will probably terminate. In a mutually beneficial exchange, each party supplies the wants of the other party at lower cost to self than the value of the resources the other party provides. In such a model, mutual relationship satisfaction ensures relationship stability.&lt;ref name="georgetown2005"/&gt;

:{{math|Outcome {{=}} Rewards − Costs}}
Homans based his theory on [[behaviorism]] to conclude that people pursue rewards to minimize costs.  The "satisfactory-ness" of the rewards that a party gains from an exchange relationship is judged relative to some standard, which may vary from party to party.&lt;ref name="Lambe, C. Jay 2001"/&gt;

== Aging ==
The basis of social exchange theory is to explain social change and stability as a process of negotiate exchanges between parties. These changes can occur over a person's life course through the various relationships, opportunities and means of support. An example of this is the convoy model of support, this model uses concentric circles to describe relationships around an individual with the strongest relationships in the closet circle. As a person ages these relationships form a convoy that moves along with the person and exchanges in support and assistance through different circumstances that occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antonucci|first=T.

S.|date=2014-02-01|title=The Convoy Model: Explaining Social Relations From a Multidisciplinary Perspective|url=https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/54/1/82/561993|journal=The Gerontologist|language=en|volume=54|issue=1|pages=82–92|doi=10.1093/geront/gnt118|issn=0016-9013|pmc=3894851}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also changes through the directionality of support given to and by the individual with the people within their support network. Within this model there are different types of support ([[Social support]]) a person can receive, those being intangible, tangible, instrumental, and informational. Intangible support can either be social or emotional and can be love, friendship and appreciation that comes with valuable relationships. Tangible support are physical gifts given to someone such as land, gifts, money, transportation, food, and completing chores. Instrumental support are services given to someone in a relationship. Finally, informational support is the delivering of information that is helpful to an individual. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/hbhe4/part3-ch9-key-constructs-social-support.shtml|title=Health Behavior and Health Education {{!}} Part Three, Chapter Nine: Key Constructs Social Support|website=www.med.upenn.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical propositions==

Ivan Nye came up with twelve theoretical propositions that aid in understanding the exchange theory.&lt;ref name="McDonell, J 2006"/&gt;

# Individuals choose those alternatives from which they expect the most profit.
# Cost being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the greatest rewards.
# Rewards being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the fewest costs.
# Immediate outcomes being equal, they choose those alternatives that promise better long-  term outcomes.
# Long-term outcomes being perceived as equal, they choose alternatives providing better immediate outcomes.
# Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose the alternatives that supply or can be expected to supply the most social approval (or those that promise the least social disapproval).
# Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose statuses and relationships that provide the most autonomy.
# Other rewards and costs equal, individuals choose alternatives characterized by the least ambiguity in terms of expected future events and outcomes.
# Other costs and rewards equal, they choose alternatives that offer the most security for them.
# Other rewards and costs equal, they choose to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with those whose values and opinions generally are in agreement with their own and reject or avoid those with whom they chronically disagree.
# Other rewards and costs equal, they are more likely to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with their equals, than those above or below them. (Equality here is viewed as the sum of abilities, performances, characteristics, and statuses that determine one's desirability in the social marketplace.)
# In industrial societies, other costs and rewards equal, individuals choose alternatives that promise the greatest financial gains for the least financial expenditures.

In his article published in 1978, Nye originally proposed seven propositions that were common in all types of relationship, A few years later he would expand the propositions to a total of twelve. The first five propositions listed are classified as general propositions and are substance free-meaning, the propositions themselves can stand alone within the theory. Proposition number six has been identified by scholars as a notion that there is a general assumption of a need for social approval as a reward and can therefor act as a drive force behind actions. Proposition seven will only work if the individual has the freedom to be excluded from outside factors while in a social exchange relationship. The twelfth and final proposition is directed towards the way our society has a heightened value placed on monetary funds. &lt;ref&gt;Nye, F. I. (1978). Is Choice and Exchange Theory the Key?. ''Journal Of Marriage &amp; Family'', ''40''(2), 219-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homans's theoretical propositions===
Even though Homans took an [[individualistic]] approach, a major goal of his work was to explicate the micro-foundations of social structures and social exchange.  By studying such forms of behavior he hoped to illuminate the informal sub-institutional bases of more complex social behavior, typically more formal and often institutionalized.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; According to Homans, [[social structures]] emerge from elementary forms of behavior. His vision of the underpinnings of social structure and institutional forms is linked to the actions of individuals, for example to their responses to rewarding and punishment circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2083448 |doi=10.1146/annurev.so.18.080192.000545|title=Two Approaches to Social Structure: Exchange Theory and Network Analysis|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=18|pages=109–127|year=1992|last1=Cook|first1=K. S.|last2=Whitmeyer|first2=J. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homans developed five key propositions that assist in structuring individuals' behaviors based on rewards and costs. This set of theoretical ideas represents the core of Homans's version of social exchange theory.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;
*The first proposition: the Success Proposition states that behavior that creates positive outcomes is likely to be repeated.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;
* The second proposition: the Stimulus Proposition believes that if an individual's behavior is rewarded in the past, the individual will continue the previous behavior.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;
*The third proposition: the Value proposition believes that if the result of a behavioral action is considered valuable to the individual, it is more likely for that behavior to occur.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;
*The fourth proposition: the Deprivation-satiation proposition believes that if an individual has received the same reward several times, the value of that reward will diminish.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;
*The fifth proposition discusses when emotions occur due to different reward situations.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; Those who receive more than they expect or do not receive anticipated punishment will be happy and will behave approvingly.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;

==Assumptions==
Social exchange theory is not one theory but a frame of reference within which many theories can speak to another, whether in argument or mutual support.&lt;ref name=Emerson/&gt; All these theories are built upon several assumptions about human nature and the nature of relationships. Thibaut and Kelley have based their theory on two conceptualizations: one that focuses on the nature of individuals and one that describes the relationships between two people. Thus, the assumptions they make also fall into these categories.
The assumptions that social exchange theory makes about human nature include the following:&lt;ref name="West 2007 188"&gt;{{cite book
 | last=West | first=Richard
 | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn
 | year=2007
 | title=Introducing Communication Theory
 | page=188
 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Humans seek rewards and avoid punishments.
*Humans are rational beings.
*The standards that humans use to evaluate costs and rewards vary over time and from person to person.

The assumptions social exchange theory makes about the nature of relationships include the following:&lt;ref name="West 2007 188"/&gt;

*Relationships are interdependent.
*Relational life is a process.

The [[prisoner's dilemma]] is a widely used example in game theory that attempts to illustrate why or how two individuals may not cooperate with each other, even if it is in their best interest to do so. It demonstrates that while cooperation would give the best outcome, people might nevertheless act selfishly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

All relationships involve exchanges although the balance of this exchange is not always equal. We cannot achieve our goals alone so as humans sometimes we have to become actors. In the world today we see actors as unemotional people but that is not the case once we reach our goals in the end.

==Comparison levels==
Social exchange includes "both a notion of a relationship, and some notion of a shared obligation in which both parties perceive responsibilities to each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0149206307307635|title=Taking a Multifoci Approach to the Study of Justice, Social Exchange, and Citizenship Behavior: The Target Similarity Model |journal=Journal of Management|volume=33|issue=6|pages=841–866|year=2007|last1=Lavelle|first1=J. J.|last2=Rupp|first2=D. E.|last3=Brockner|first3=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Thibaut]] and [[Harold Kelley]] proposed two comparison standards to differentiate between relationship satisfaction and relationship stability. This evaluation rests on two types of comparisons: '''Comparison Level''' and '''Comparison Level for Alternative'''. According to Thibaut and Kelley, the Comparison Level (CL) is a standard representing what people feel they should receive in the way of rewards and costs from a particular relationship. An individual's comparison level can be considered the standard by which an outcome seems to satisfy the individual.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Griffin |editor1-first=Em |title=A First Look at Communication Theory |first1=John |last1=Thibaut |first2=Harold |last2=Kelley |chapter=Social Exchange Theory |pages=196–205 |chapterurl=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073385026/228359/socialexchange.pdf |publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn=978-0-07-338502-0 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Comparison Level for Alternative (CLalt) refers to "the lowest level of relational rewards a person is willing to accept given available rewards from alternative relationships or being alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Roloff| first=Michael
 | year=1981
 | title=Interpersonal communication: The social exchange approach
 | page=48
 | publisher=Beverly Hills}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, when using this evaluation tool, an individual will consider other alternative payoffs or rewards outside of the current relationship or exchange.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt; CLalt provides a measure of stability rather than satisfaction. If people see no alternative and fear being alone more than being in the relationship, social exchange theory predicts they will stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=West | first=Richard | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn | year=2007 | title=Introducing Communication Theory | page=191 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes of exchange==
According to Kelley and Thibaut, people engage in Behavioral Sequence, or a series of actions designed to achieve their goal. This is congruent with their assumption that human beings are [[rational]].&lt;ref name="West 2007 193"&gt;{{cite book
 | last=West | first=Richard
 | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn
 | year=2007
 | title=Introducing Communication Theory
 | page=193
 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people engage in these behavioral sequences, they are dependent to some extent on their relational partner. In order for behavioral sequences to lead to social exchange, two conditions must be achieved: "It must be oriented towards ends that can only be achieved through interaction with other persons, and it must seek to adapt means to further the achievement of these ends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blau|first=Peter M.|title=Exchange &amp; Power in Social Life|year=1964|publisher=Transaction| isbn = 9780887386282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of reciprocity also derives from this pattern. The reciprocity principle refers to the mutual reinforcement by two parties of each other's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Ekeh, Peter P.. Social exchange theory: the two traditions. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1974.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process begins when at least one participant makes a "move", and if the other reciprocates, new rounds of exchange initiate. Once the process is in motion, each consequence can create a self-reinforcing cycle. Even though the norm of reciprocity may be a universally accepted principle, the degree to which people and cultures apply this concept varies.&lt;ref name=Zafirovski /&gt;

===Power dependence relations===
Several definitions of power have been offered by exchange theorists. For instance, some theorists view power as distinct from exchanges, some view it as a kind of exchange and others believe power is a medium of exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=David|title=Power and Social Exchange|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=72|issue=4|pages=1229–1242|jstor=1954536|doi=10.2307/1954536}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most useful definition of power is that proposed by Emerson,&lt;ref name="Befu1977"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Befu |first=H. |year=1977 |title=Social Exchange |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=6 |issue= |pages=255–81 |jstor=2949333 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.06.100177.001351}}&lt;/ref&gt; who developed a theory of power-dependence relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Auld |first=C. |last2=Case |first2=A. |title=Social exchange processes in leisure and non-leisure settings: A review and exploratory investigation |journal=Journal of Leisure Research |year=1997 |volume=29 |issue=2 |page=183 |doi= |url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr/article/view/810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the dependence a person has on another brings up the concept of power.&lt;ref name="West 2007 188" /&gt; Power differentiation affects social structures by causing inequalities between members of different groups, such as an individual having superiority over another.&lt;ref name=Zafirovski&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zafirovski |first=Milan |title=Social Exchange Theory Under Scrutiny: A Positive Critique of its Economic-Behaviorist Formulations |journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology |year=2005 |url=http://www.sociology.org/content/2005/tier2/SETheory.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103311/http://www.sociology.org/content/2005/tier2/SETheory.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Power within the theory is governed by two variables : the structure of power in exchange networks and strategic use.&lt;ref name="Zafirovski" /&gt; Experimental data show that the position an actor occupies in a social exchange network determines relative dependence and therefore power.&lt;ref&gt;(Stolte and Emerson, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thibaut and Kelley, there are two types of power: fate control and behavior control. Fate control is the ability to affect a partner's outcomes.&lt;ref name="West 2007 188"/&gt; Behavior control is the power to cause another's behavior to change by changing one's own behavior.&lt;ref name="West 2007 188"/&gt;

===Matrices===
People develop patterns of exchange to cope with power differentials and to deal with the costs associated with exercising power.&lt;ref name="West 2007 188"/&gt; These patterns describe behavioral rules or norms that indicate how people trade resources in an attempt to maximize rewards and minimize costs. Three different matrices have been described by Thibaut and Kelley to illustrate the patterns people develop. These are given matrix, the effective matrix and the dispositional matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=West | first=Richard
 | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn

*The given matrix represents the behavioral choices and outcomes that are determined by a combination of external factors (environment) and internal factors(the specific skills each interactant possesses).&lt;ref name="West 2007 193"/&gt;
*The effective matrix "which represents an expansion of alternative behaviors and/or outcomes which ultimately determines the behavioral choices in social exchange"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There are three forms within these matrices: [[Norm of reciprocity|Reciprocity]], Generalized Exchange, and Productive Exchange. In a direct exchange, reciprocation is confined to the two actors. One social actor provides value to another one and the other reciprocates. There are three different types of reciprocity:&lt;ref name = Cropanzano&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0149206305279602|title=Social Exchange Theory: An Interdisciplinary Review|journal=Journal of Management|volume=31|issue=6|pages=874–900|year=2005|last1=Cropanzano|first1=R.|last2=Mitchell|first2=M. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Reciprocity as a transactional pattern of interdependent exchanges
#Reciprocity as a folk belief
#Reciprocity as a moral norm

A generalized exchange involves indirect reciprocity between three or more individuals.&lt;ref name="Trust and Transitions"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0190272509359616|year=2010|title=The Contentious Social Interactionism of Charles Tilly|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|last1=Collins|first1=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one person gives to another and the recipient responds by giving to another person other than the first person. Productive exchange means that both actors have to contribute for either one of them to benefit. Both people incur benefits and costs simultaneously.

Another common form of exchange is negotiated exchange which focuses on the negotiation of rules in order for both parties to reach a beneficial agreement.&lt;ref name=Cropanzano /&gt; Reciprocal exchanges and negotiated exchanges are often analyzed and compared to discover their essential differences. One major difference between the two exchanges is the level of risks associated with the exchange and the uncertainty these risks create (ref). Negotiated exchange can consist of binding and non-binding negotiations. When comparing the levels of risk within these exchanges, reciprocal exchange has the highest level of risk which in result produces the most uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Trust and Transitions"/&gt; An example of a risk that could occur during the reciprocal exchange is the factor that the second party could end up not returning the favor and completing the reciprocal exchange. Binding negotiated exchanges involve the least amount of risks which will result the individuals feeling low levels of uncertainty. Whereas non-binding negotiated exchanges and their level of risks and uncertainty fall in between the amount of risks associated with reciprocal and binding negotiated exchanges.&lt;ref name="Trust and Transitions"/&gt; Since there is not a binding agreement involved, one party involved in the exchange could decide to not cooperate with the agreement.

==Critiques==

Katherine Miller outlines several major objections to or problems with the social exchange theory as developed from early seminal works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Katherine| first=Miller
 | year=2005
 | title=Communication Theories

 | location= New York }}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The theory reduces human interaction to a purely rational process that arises from economic theory.
*The theory favors openness as it was developed in the 1970s when ideas of freedom and openness were preferred, but there may be times when openness isn’t the best option in a relationship.
*The theory assumes that the ultimate goal of a relationship is intimacy when this might not always be the case.
*The theory places relationships in a linear structure, when some relationships might skip steps or go backwards in terms of intimacy.

Russell Cropanzano and Marie S. Mitchell discuss how one of the major issues within the social exchange theory is the lack of information within studies on the various exchange rules.&lt;ref name = Cropanzano/&gt; Reciprocity is a major exchange rule discussed but, Cropanzano and Mitchell write that the theory would be better understood if more research programs discussed a variety of exchange rules such as [[altruism]], group gain, status consistency and competition.&lt;ref name = Cropanzano/&gt; Meeker points out that within the exchange process, each unit takes into account at least the following elements: reciprocity, rationality, altruism (social responsibility), group gain, status, consistency, and competition (rivalry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walczak | first1 = D | year = 2015 | title = The process of exchange, solidarity and sustainable development in building a community of responsibility | url = | journal = Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 1S1 | page = 507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meeker | first1 = B.

Rosenfeld (2005) has noted significant limitations to Social Exchange Theory and its application in the selection of mates/partners. Specifically, Rosenfeld looked at the limitations of interracial couples and the application of social exchange theory. His analysis suggest that in modern society, there is less of a gap between interracial partners education level, socioeconomic status, and social class level which in turn, makes the previously understood application of social exchange mute.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, M. J. (2005). A Critique of Exchange Theory in Mate Selection. ''American Journal Of Sociology'', ''110''(5), 1284-1325. doi:10.1086/428441&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2010}}

The most extensive application of social exchange has been in the area of interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="georgetown2005"/&gt; However, social exchange theory materializes in many different situations with the same idea of the exchange of resources.  Self-Interest can encourage individuals to make decisions that will benefit themselves overall. Homans once summarized the theory by stating:

:Social behavior is an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige. Persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them. This process of influence tends to work out at equilibrium to a balance in the exchanges. For a person in an exchange, what he gives may be a cost to him, just as what he gets may be a reward, and his behavior changes less as the difference of the two, profit, tends to a maximum ("Theories Used in Research").

===Anthropology===
Other applications that developed the idea of exchange include field of [[anthropology]] as evidenced in an article by Harumi Befu, which discusses cultural ideas and [[social norm|norms]].  Lévi-Strauss is considered as one of the major contributors to the anthropology of exchange. Within this field, self-interest, human sentiment and motivational process are not considered.&lt;ref name="Befu1977" /&gt; Lévi–Strauss uses a [[collectivist]] approach to explain exchanges. To Lévi-Strauss, a social exchange is defined as a regulated form of behavior in the context of societal rules and norms.  This contrasts with psychological studies of exchange in which behaviors are studied ignoring the culture. Social exchanges from the anthropological perspective have been analyzed using the gift-giving phenomena. The concept of reciprocity under this perspective states that individuals can directly reward his benefactor or another person in the social exchange process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=256704 |doi=10.2307/256704|pmid=10134637|title=Citizenship Behavior and Social Exchange|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=37|issue=3|pages=656–69|year=1994|last1=Konovsky|first1=M. A.|last2=Pugh|first2=S. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lévi-Strauss developed the theory of cousin marriage based on the pervasiveness of gift-giving in primitive societies. The basis of this theory is the distinction between restricted exchanges, which is only capable of connecting pairs of social groups, and generalize exchange, which integrates indefinite numbers of groups.&lt;ref name="Befu1977" /&gt;

===Relationships===
Throughout the theory, one can also end up losing relationships that were already established because the feeling of no longer being beneficial. One feels as if there is not longer a need for a relationship or communication due to lack of rewards. Once this happens, the process of looking for new partners and resources occurs. This allows a continuation of networking. One may go through this process quite frequently. A study titled, Factors Related to Initiating Interpersonal Contacts on Internet Dating Sites: A View From the social exchange theory applied this theory to new media (online dating). The study discovers the different factors involved when an individual decides to establish an online relationship.&lt;ref name="online dating"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5964/ijpr.v3isupp2.74|title=Factors Related to Initiating Interpersonal Contacts on Internet Dating Sites: A View from the Social Exchange Theory|journal=Interpersona: an International Journal on Personal Relationships|volume=3|pages=19–37|year=2009|last1=Shtatfeld|first1=Rivka|last2=Barak|first2=Azy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall the study followed the social exchange theory's idea, "people are attracted to those who grant them rewards".&lt;ref name="online dating"/&gt;

Another example is Berg's study about development of friendship between roommates. The research found how social exchange processes changed during the year by measuring [[Self-disclosure|self disclosure]]. According to the study, the amount one person rewards another and the comparison levels for alternatives become the most important factors in determining liking and satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Auld, C. J. 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Christopher J. |last1=Auld |first2=Alan J. |last2=Case |year=1997 |title=Social Exchange Processes in Leisure and Non-leisure Settings: A Review and Exploratory Investigation |url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr/article/view/810 |journal=Journal of Leisure Research |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auld, C. and Alan C. conducted a study to discover what processes occur and what is experienced during social leisure relationships. They use the concept of reciprocity to understand their findings. The study concluded that meeting new people is often given as a major reason for participation in leisure activities, and meeting new people may be conceptualized as an exercise of reciprocity. In this case, reciprocity is perceived as a starting mechanism for new social relationships because people are willing to be helped by others, expecting that the help will eventually be returned.&lt;ref name="Auld, C. J. 1997"/&gt; A study conducted by Paul, G., called Exchange and access in field work tries to understand the relationships between the researchers and subjects. This study concludes that [[Bargaining]] helps to satisfy the more specific needs of the parties because greater risks are taken to obtain more information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=Paul S. |year=1980 |title=Exchange and Access in Field Work |journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=309–331 |doi=10.1177/089124168000900303}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also introduces the concept of [[trust (social sciences)]] to determine the duration of relationships.

===Interracial marriage===
Patterns of [[interracial marriage]] have been explained using social exchange theory. Kalmijn &lt;ref name="Kalmijn"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2580162 |doi=10.1093/sf/72.1.119|title=Trends in Black/White Intermarriage|journal=Social Forces|volume=72|pages=119–146|year=1993|last1=Kalmijn|first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that ethnic status is offset against educational or financial resources. This process has been used to explain why there are more marriages between black men and white women than between white men and black women. This asymmetry in marriage patterns has been used to support the idea of a racial hierarchy. Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22347504 |pmc=3276508|bibcode=2012PLoSO...731703L|title=A Facial Attractiveness Account of Gender Asymmetries in Interracial Marriage|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=2|pages=31703|last1=Lewis|first1=Michael B.|year=2012|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031703}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, explains that the same patterns of marriage can be accounted for in terms of simple facial attractiveness patterns of the different gender by race groupings. Recent changes have seen an increase in black females marrying white men and a decrease in raw prevalence of interracial marriages when it comes to black females. There has also been a shift in the concentration of interracial marriage from mostly being between those with low education levels to those with higher levels of education.   &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fryer|first=Roland G|date=Spring 2007|title=Guess Who's Been Coming to Dinner?

===Business===
Social exchange theory has served as a theoretical foundation to explain different situations in business practices. It has contributed to the study of organization-stakeholder relationships and [[relationship marketing]]. The investment model proposed by [[Caryl Rusbult]] is a useful version of social exchange theory. According to this model, investments serve to stabilize relationships. The greater the nontransferable investments a person has in a given relationship, the more stable the relationship is likely to be. The same investment concept is applied in relationship marketing. Databases are the major instrument to build differentiated relationships between organizations and customers. Through the information process, companies identify the customer's own individual needs. From this perspective, a client becomes an investment. If a customer decides to choose another competitor, the investment will be lost.&lt;ref name="georgetown2005"/&gt; When people find they have invested too much to quit a relationship or enterprise, they pour additional resources into the relationship to salvage their initial investment. Exchange has been a central research thrust in business-to-business relational exchange.&lt;ref name="Lambe, C. Jay 2001"/&gt; According to the study conducted by Lambe, C. Jay, C. Michael Wittmann, and Robert E. Spekman firms evaluate economic and social outcomes from each transaction and compare them to what they feel they deserve. Firms also look for additional benefits provided by other potential exchange partners. The initial transaction between companies is crucial to determine if their relationship will expand, remain the same or will dissolve.&lt;ref name="Lambe, C. Jay 2001"/&gt;

===Work settings===
A study conducted by A. Saks serves as an example to explain engagement of employees in organizations. This study uses one of the tenets of social exchange theory to explain that obligations are generated through a series of interactions between parties who are in a state of reciprocal interdependence. The research identified that when individuals receive economic and socioemotional resources from their organization, they feel obliged to respond in kind and repay the organization. This is a description of engagement as a two-way relationship between the employer and employee. One way for individuals to repay their organization is through their level of engagement. The more engaged the employee are to their work, the greater amounts of cognitive, emotional, and physical resources they will devote to perform their job duties. When the organization fails to provide economic or emotional resources, the employees are more likely to withdraw and disengage themselves from their roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = 'Antecedents and consequences of employee engagement'|last = Saks|first = A.M.|date = 2006|journal = Journal of Managerial Psychology  |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=600–19 |doi=10.1108/02683940610690169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Citizenship behavior===
Social exchange theory is a theoretical explanation for [[organizational citizenship behavior]].This study examines a model of clear leadership and relational building between head and teachers as antecedents, and organizational citizenship behavior as a consequence of teacher–school exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13603124.2010.524250|title=Social exchange theory as an explanation of organizational citizenship behaviour among teachers|journal=International Journal of Leadership in Education|volume=14|issue=4|pages=405–421|year=2011|last1=Elstad|first1=Eyvind|last2=Christophersen|first2=Knut Andreas|last3=Turmo|first3=Are}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizenship behavior can also be shown with employees and their employers.This is shown through organizational identification which plays an important role in organizational citizenship behavior. An employees identification with their employer plays a significant role in supporting and promoting organized citizenship behavior, serving as a mediating mechanism with citizenship behaviors, perceived organizational justice, and organizational support based on both the social exchange and social identity theory. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=a3cc9152-d3aa-47c0-b0ac-93649c113f1e@sessionmgr4007&amp;bdata=#AN=126015861&amp;db=bft|title=Help yourself by helping others: The joint impact of group member organizat...: Discover @ Georgia Southern|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tinti|first=Joel Adame|last2=Venelli-Costa|first2=Luciano|last3=Vieira|first3=Almir Martins|last4=Cappellozza|first4=Alexandre|last5=Tinti|first5=Joel Adame|last6=Venelli-Costa|first6=Luciano|last7=Vieira|first7=Almir Martins|last8=Cappellozza|first8=Alexandre|date=December 2017|title=The impact of human resources policies and practices on organizational citizenship behaviors|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1808-23862017000600636&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=BBR.

===Online social networking and self-disclosure===
Understanding interpersonal disclosure in online social networking is an ideal application of social networking theory. Researchers have leveraged SET to explain self-disclosure in a cross-cultural context of French and British working professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posey | first1 = Clay | last2 = Benjamin Lowry | first2 = Paul | last3 = Roberts | first3 = Tom L. | last4 = Ellis | first4 = Selwyn | year = 2010 | title = Proposing the online community self-disclosure model: The case of working professionals in France and the UK who use online communities | ssrn = 1501447 | journal = European Journal of Information Systems | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 181–195 | doi = 10.1057/ejis.2010.15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They discover that reciprocation is the primary benefit of self-disclosure, whereas risk is the foundational cost of self-disclosure. They find that positive social influence to use an online community increases online community self-disclosure; reciprocity increases self-disclosure; online community trust increases self-disclosure; and privacy risk beliefs decrease self-disclosure. Meanwhile, a tendency toward collectivism increases self-disclosure. Similar research also leveraged SET to examine privacy concerns versus desire for interpersonal awareness in driving the use of self-disclosure technologies in the context of instant messaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benjamin Lowry | first1 = Paul | last2 = Cao | first2 = Jinwei | last3 = Everard | first3 = Andrea | year = 2011 | title = Privacy concerns versus desire for interpersonal awareness in driving the use of self-disclosure technologies: The case of instant messaging in two cultures | ssrn = 1668113 | journal = Journal of Management Information Systems | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 163–200 | doi = 10.2753/MIS0742-1222270406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was also a cross-cultural study, but instead compared US and Chinese participants.

==Affect theory==

The actors in social exchange are normally viewed as unemotional beings who have information, cognitively process it, and make decisions concerning the pattern and nature of exchange with others.&lt;ref name=Lawler /&gt; Affect theory of social exchange complements social exchange theory by incorporating [[emotion]] as part of the exchange process. Formalized by Lawler (2001), the affect theory examines the structural conditions of exchange that produce emotions and feelings and then identifies how individuals attribute these emotions to different social units (exchange partners, groups, or networks).&lt;ref name="Lawler"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=10.1086/324071 |doi=10.1086/324071|title=An Affect Theory of Social Exchange|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=107|issue=2|pages=321–352|year=2001|last1=Lawler|first1=Edward J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attributions of emotion, in turn, dictate how strongly individuals feel attached to their partners or groups, which drives collectively oriented behavior and commitment to the relationship.

===Assumptions===

Most social exchange models have three basic assumptions in common: behavior in a social sense is based on exchanges, if an individual allows someone to receives a reward the person then feels the need to reciprocate due to social pressure and individuals will try to minimize their cost while gaining the most from the reward.&lt;ref&gt;Sprecher, S., (1998). Social exchange theories and sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 35(1), 32–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The affect theory of social exchange is based on assumptions that stem from social exchange theory and [[affect theory]]:

*There are three or more individuals who have the opportunity to make exchanges with one another. These actors are able to make decisions about whether to exchange, with whom to exchange, and under what terms to execute an exchange.
*Social exchange produces emotions that are positive to negative
*Emotions can be construed as reward or punishment (i.e. feeling good has a positive value and feeling bad has a negative value).
*Individuals try to avoid negative emotions and to reproduce positive emotions in social exchange.
*Individuals will try to understand the source or cause of feelings produced by social exchange. In this way, emotions become attributed to the object that caused them.
*Individuals interpret and exchange their feelings with respect to social relationships (e.g. partners, groups, networks). Positive emotions produced by exchange will increase solidarity in these relationships, while negative emotions will decrease solidarity.

===Theoretical propositions===

Affect theory of social exchange shows how the conditions of exchanges promote interpersonal and group relationships through emotions and affective processes. The theoretical arguments center on the following five claims:

'''Emotions produced by exchange are involuntary, internal responses'''

Individuals experience emotions (general feelings of pleasantness or unpleasantness) depending on whether their exchange is successful.  These emotions are construed as a reward (or punishment) and individuals strive to repeat actions that reproduce positive emotions or avoid negative emotions.

'''Individuals attempt to understand what in a social exchange situation produces emotions'''

Individuals will use the exchange task to understand the source (partners, groups, or networks) of their emotions. Individuals are more likely to attribute their emotions to their exchange partners or groups when the task can only be completed with one or more partners, when the task requires interdependent (nonseparable) contributions, and when there is a shared sense of responsibility for the success or failure of the exchange.

'''The mode of exchange determines the features of the exchange task and influences the attribution of the emotion produced'''

The [[Social exchange theory#Comparison levels|mode of exchange]] (productive, negotiated, reciprocal, or generalized) provides a description of the exchange task. The task features are defined by the degree of interdependence (separability of tasks) and shared responsibility between partners to complete the task. These features influence the strength of the emotion felt. Productive exchanges are interdependent and this high degree of nonseparability generates the strongest emotions. Reciprocal exchanges are separable which reduces the perceptions of shared responsibility. The exchange produces little emotional response, but individuals instead express emotions in response to the asymmetrical transaction. Generalized exchanges do not occur directly, but interdependence is still high and coordination between partners is difficult. Because there is no direct emotional foundation, emotions produced are low. Negotiated exchanges may produce conflicting emotions due to the mixed-motive nature of negotiations; even when transactions are successful, individuals may feel like they had the ability to do better, creating emotional ambivalence. Overall, productive exchanges produce the strongest attributions of emotions, generalized (indirect) exchange the weakest, with negotiated and reciprocal exchanges in between.

'''The attribution of emotions resulting from different exchange modes impact the solidarity felt with partners or groups'''

The different types of exchange (productive, reciprocal, and generalized) also impact the solidarity or identification that an individual will feel with their exchange partners or group. The different exchange types help dictate the target of felt emotions and influences an individual’s attachment. Affective attachment occurs when a social unit (partner or group) is the target of positive feelings from exchange; affective detachment (alienation) occurs when a social unit is the target of negative feelings from failure to exchange.&lt;ref name="Lawler" /&gt; Affective attachment increases solidarity. Similar to the attribution of emotion, productive exchange produces the strongest affective attachments, generalized exchange the weakest, and negotiated and reciprocal exchange are in between.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

One condition for how social (partner or group) attributions can increase solidarity is by reducing self-serving attributions of credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange. When individuals have group attributions for positive emotions stemming from success, this eliminates any [[self-serving bias]]es and enhances both pride in the self and gratitude to the partner. However, group attributions for negative emotions stemming from failure do not eliminate self-serving biases, resulting in more anger toward the partner or group than shame in the self.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Lawler also proposes that the persistence (stability) and ability to control acts by the exchange partner (controllability) provide conditions for affective attachment by attributing credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange.&lt;ref name="Lawler" /&gt; Following Weiner (1985)&lt;ref name="Weiner"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.92.4.548|pmid=3903815|title=An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion|journal=Psychological Review|volume=92|issue=4|pages=548–73|year=1985|last1=Weiner|first1=Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt; affect theory of social exchange extrapolates that the combinations of stability and uncontrollability elicit different emotions. In social exchange, social connections can be sources of stability and controllability. For example, if an exchange partner is perceived as a stable source of positive feelings, and the exchange partner has control in the acts that elicit those positive feelings, this will strengthen affective attachment. Therefore, affect theory of social exchange proposes that stable and controllable sources of positive feelings (i.e. pleasantness, pride, gratitude) will elicit affective attachments while stable and uncontrollable sources of negative feelings (i.e. unpleasantness, shame, anger) will elicit affective detachment.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''Through these emotional processes, networks can develop group properties'''

Repeated exchanges allow a network to evolve into a group. Affect theory highlights the contributions of emotions in producing group properties. Successful interactions generate positive feelings for the involved individuals, which motivates them to interact with the same partners in the future. As exchanges repeat, the strong relationships become visible to other parties, making salient their role as a group and helping to generate a group identity that continues to bind the partners together in a network. Affect theory predicts that networks of negotiated and reciprocal exchange will tend to promote stronger relational ties within partners; productive or generalized exchange will promote stronger network or group-level ties.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

'''''The Day of the Dinosaur''''' is a [[science book]] by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Catherine Crook de Camp]], illustrated with plates. It was first published in hardcover by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 1968, and in paperback by [[Curtis Books]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb title|id=854646|title=The Day of the Dinosaur}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Laughlin | first=Charlotte |author2=Daniel J. H. Levack  | title=De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography | location=San Francisco | publisher=Underwood/Miller | year=1983 | page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second hardcover edition was issued by [[Bonanza Books]] in 1985. The first chapter was reprinted as "One Day in the Cretaceous" in the de Camps's collection ''[[Footprints on Sand]]'' ([[Advent:Publishers|Advent]], 1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Laughlin | first=Charlotte |author2=Daniel J.

==Summary==
As stated on the dust cover of the Doubleday edition, the work is a survey of "the exciting story of the lost world of the great reptiles and of the fossil hunters who discovered them millions of years later."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=De Camp | first=L. Sprague |author2=Catherine Crook de Camp  | title=The Day of the Dinosaur | location=Garden City, NY | publisher=Doubleday | year=1968 | page=front dust cover}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues, among other things, that the [[theory]] of [[evolution]] took hold after [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] because of interest spurred by recently popularized [[dinosaur]] remains, corresponding to [[legend]]s of [[dragons]].

==Reception==
''[[Publishers Weekly|Publishers' Weekly]]'' called the book "clear, comprehensive, [and] well-researched," noting that it "begins as a vivid and scientifically sound depiction of the age of the giant dinosaurs [and] develops into an impressive tribute to the science of paleontology. Awesome and sometimes spine-chilling as some of the de Camps' descriptions are ... the human story of the first discovery of fossils and the realization of their implications communicates a drama of its own." Summing up, he noted that "[r]eaders who are for the first time being introduced to the wonders of paleontology will be engrossed."&lt;ref&gt;Untitled review in ''Publishers' Weekly'', v. 194, no. 17, October 21, 1968, page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary L. Blackwell, writing in ''[[Library Journal]]'' called it "an accurate and vivid description of the great creatures who roamed the earth more than 100 million years ago and also a fascinating account of the earth itself that makes the reality of its antiquity comprehensible." She felt the authors' "carefully organized, practical approach" resulted in "a book that will appeal not only to students of paleontology but to everyone interested in this remote world." She rated it "[r]ecommended for any public or school library."&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Mary L. "The Book Review: Science &amp; Technology," in ''Library Journal'', v. 93, no. 22, December 15, 1968, page 4659.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' [[Isaac Asimov]], noting that "few people ... can speak more charmingly and enlightenedly about scientific subjects than L. Sprague de Camp," felt "[t]he book reads ... like a pleasant and informal lecture, given at their ease, by a pair of enormously rational and urbane individuals" with which he found it "virtually impossible to find fault." He singled out the way the de Camps "make the dinosaurs come alive by picturing them in action" and the "most remarkable first chapter ... which ... is an evocation (the best I know) of a typical day in the Mesozoic." He felt that "[t]he book deals, satisfactorily, with the paleontologists and their discoveries, too, especially with the Cope-Marsh feud [and] with the effects on contemporary man of the great discoveries of paleontology; the impetus given to the search for giant living creatures--and to romancing about them--and the ferocious object lesson given on the subject of mass extinctions." He also notes that the de Camps point out "[w]e are in the midst of [another] great dying now, ... brought on by man himself."&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. "The Day of the Dinosaur" [review] in ''Natural History'', v. 78, no. 1, February 1969, pages 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Booklist|The Booklist]]'' characterized the book as "[a]n informative, comprehensible, often lively survey of the Age of Reptiles and the careers of some of the scientists who found and studied dinosaur fossils."&lt;ref&gt;''The Booklist'', v. 65, no. 14, March 15, 1969, pages 792-793.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Science Books'' rated it "[a] very comprehensive book about Mesozoic reptiles, [with] [t]the text ... quite free of inaccuracies and... accompanied by many good illustrations," and "[t]he writing style [as] fluctuat[ing] between ... humorous whimsy and scientific exposition, which may limit its popularity." It called "[t]he section [on] the history of the early fossil hunters and development of the great natural history museums ... a real contribution, since this information is collected from many disparate sources."&lt;ref&gt;''Science Books'', v. 4, no. 4, March 1969, page 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Morrison|Philip]] and Phylis Morrison, writing for ''[[Scientific American]]'', found it "excellent and fresh, ... lively and intelligent," "a savory mixture of biology and history, ... cover[ing] a wide range of lore and logic, from genetics and the problem of extinction to the scaling of beasts." "Skeptical and yet imaginative," they wrote, "the text lives up to the De Camp reputation." They found the book's "final imaginary safari in the Jurassic ... logically planned: for the big flesh-eaters one had best carry a real elephant gun, the Continental .600 or perhaps the Holland &amp; Holland double express .500."&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Philip and Phylis. "Books: Children's books about science: an annual Christmas selection," in ''Scientific American'', v. 221, no. 6, December 1968, pages 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Fleury, in a retrospective more than twenty years after the book's initial publication, noted that it "precede[d] the 'dinosaur renaissance' but remain[ed a] valuable and readable introduction to the subject" and "[l]ike De Camp's many other popular works on scientific topics, ... well written and ... highly recommended."&lt;ref&gt;Fleury, Bruce E. "Bibliographic Essay: Dinosaurs," in ''Choice'', v. 26, no. 4, December 1988, pages 616-618.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Quest for Power''''' is  book on the history of [[engineering]] written by [[Hugh Pembroke Vowles]] and [[Margaret Winifred Vowles]].  It was published in 1931 by [[Chapman and Hall]] of [[London]], England.

==Content==
The book contains over 150 illustrations and has 370 pages.  It begins with a picture of [[Michael Faraday]].  The book is divided into three parts. The first is "The apprenticeship of toil", which deals with stone tools, early use of metal, control of water, early structural achievements, transport and measurement. The second is "The age of Power".  This deals with steam power, internal combustion engines and electrical power.  Finally, the third part is entitled "The materials of power". This looks at coal, oil, alcohol, metals and other products. The last section deals with the future.

==Dedication==
''The Quest for Power'' is dedicated to [[Hubert Cecil Booth]], inventor of the [[vacuum cleaner]].  The dedication reads:  "In friendship's name to Hubert Cecil Booth, F.C.G.I., M. Inst. C.E. who by the invention and subsequent development of the vacuum cleaner has created a new industry, lightened the burden of human toil, and increased the health and happiness of innumberable homes".

==Reception==

'''USS ''Whippoorwill'' (AM-35)''' was a [[Lapwing class minesweeper|''Lapwing''-class]] [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] acquired by the [[United States Navy]] for the dangerous task of removing mines from minefields laid in the water to prevent ships from passing.

The first ''Whippoorwill'' to be so named by the Navy, ''Minesweeper No. 35'' was laid down on 12 December 1917 at [[Mobile, Alabama]], by the [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]]; launched on 4 July 1918; sponsored by Miss M. I. Evans; and commissioned on 1 April 1919, Lt. Birney O. Halliwill in command.

{{TOClimit|2}}

==World War I mine clearance==

After fitting out, ''Whippoorwill'' departed [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on 3 July 1919, bound for Scotland. Operating subsequently from the port of [[Kirkwall]], the minesweeper participated in the clearing of the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]] as part of Division 3, [[Minesweeping Squadron]], Atlantic Fleet. Hair-trigger mines and frequent foul weather made sweeping the barrage a difficult and dangerous mission; but, by late in the autumn of 1919, the task was completed by a miscellaneous group of new minesweepers, chartered [[naval trawler]]s, and [[submarine chaser]]s.

==Post-war transfer to the Pacific Fleet==

Returning to the United States in November 1919, ''Whipporwill'' was later assigned to the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]]. Having been classified as AM-35 on 17 July 1920, the minesweeper arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]], her new home port, on 1 March 1921. She would operate out of that base for the next 20 years, with brief periods spent as station ship at [[Pago Pago]], Samoa, between 1931 and 1934.
 
''Whippoorwill's'' prime duty was service to the Fleet. Besides filling the role for which she was designed—sweeping and laying mines—upon occasion she towed targets and plane-guarded.

==Performing surveys in the Pacific==

Noteworthy highlights of her Pearl Harbor-based deployment came in the early 1920s, when she participated in surveys of various and sundry Pacific islands. In July 1923, for example, ''Whippoorwill''—together with her sister-ship [[USS Tanager (AM-5)|''Tanager'' (AM-5)]]—accomplished the first survey of [[Johnston Island]] in modern times. During that cruise, she carried members of the [[Tanager Expedition]], a joint expedition sponsored by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] and the [[Bishop Museum]] of [[Hawaii]]. She also carried a [[Douglas DT]]-2 [[floatplane]] on her fantail, hoisting it into the water so that it could take off for aerial survey and mapping flights over Johnston. A little over a year later, in September 1925, the plane's pilot, Lt. Comdr. John Rodgers, would win fame as a member of the crew of the [[Naval Aircraft Factory PN-9|PN-9 flying boat]].
 
''Whippoorwill'' made other cruises, carrying members of ornithological surveys to islands such as [[Kingman Reef]], [[Palmyra Atoll|Palmyra]], [[Christmas Island]], [[Jarvis Island]], [[Howland Island]], and [[Baker Island]]. The islands would later assume importance as [[transpacific]] air commerce spread its wings toward the [[Far East]] and South [[Pacific Ocean]].

==''Whippoorwill'' modernized in 1941==

Ultimately, however, ''Whippoorwill's'' Hawaiian idyll ended. Refitted and modernized, the minesweeper departed [[Pearl Harbor]] on 5 May 1941, bound for the [[Asiatic Fleet]], as war clouds gathered over the Pacific and Far East. En route, the minecraft plane-guarded at prearranged stations, serving as a [[Radio direction finder|direction-finding station]] for patrol planes winging their way to the [[Philippines]] to reinforce the Asiatic Fleet's air wing—Patrol Wing 10.
 
After touching briefly at [[Guam]], in the [[Marianas]], on 23 May, ''Whippoorwill'' reached ''Manila'' on the 30th. There, she became part of [[Mine Division]] 9, [[Mine Squadron]] 3, Asiatic Fleet. In the ensuing months, ''Whippoorwill'' performed a variety of service tasks. She towed targets for the cruisers and destroyers of the Fleet to fire at during battle practices and gunnery shoots, assisted in unmooring and mooring the Fleet's [[submarine]] and [[destroyer tender]]s from [[buoy]]s, and conducted similar activities.

==Philippine operations==

That spring, ''Whippoorwill'' operated with [[USS Canopus (AS-9)|''Canopus'' (AS-9)]] during maneuvers in the southern Philippines, touching at [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] and steaming in the [[Sulu Sea]], before returning to [[Cavite]] and anchoring in Canacao Bay. Soon thereafter, she commenced operations with the Inshore Patrol which carried out a busy slate of operations as the Philippines feverishly prepared for the impending war with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. ''Whippoorwill'' operated on patrol duties and laid mines—laying the field near [[Caballo Island]], near [[Corregidor]], at the entrance to [[Manila Bay]]. She and ''Tanager'' also laid the mine field at [[Subic Bay]] while operating out of the section base at [[Olongapo]].
 
After an overhaul at [[Cavite]] and at the [[Verdadero]] Dockyard across [[Canacao Bay]] from Cavite, ''Whippoorwill'' took up patrol duties in the late autumn, frequently alternating with the gunboats [[USS Asheville (PG-21)|''Asheville'' (PG-21)]] and [[USS Tulsa (PG-22)|''Tulsa'' (PG-22)]]. That duty was not without its share of interesting moments. On 22 November, while on patrol station "Cast," she fired four shots across the bow of the sailing vessel ''Remedio VIII'' before the vessel hove to. She later prevented the Army tug ''Harrison'' from entering the area and warned off other vessels on the 26th and 28th.

==Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor==

Relieved by ''Tulsa'' on station on 30 November, ''Whippoorwill'' returned to Canacao Bay before she got underway on 3 December for sweeping operations out of Cavite. Five days later, on 8 December 1941 (7 December east of the [[International Date Line]]), the Japanese unleashed their onslaught against American, British, and Dutch possessions in the [[Far East]] and in the Pacific.
 
At 0415 on the 8th, ''Whippoorwill'' received the news of the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]. Lt. Comdr. Charles A. Ferriter, the ship's [[commanding officer]], soon called his crew to quarters and announced the news. Now, after months of escalating tension and feverish preparations for war, the blow had fallen. Within hours, ''Whippoorwill'' was underway, commencing her first wartime sweeping operations in [[Manila Bay]].

===Under air attack in the Philippines===

On the following day, 9 December, Japanese bombers caught General Douglas MacArthur's Far Eastern Air Force on the ground at its principal fields of [[Nichols Field|Nichols]] and [[Clark Field]]s, destroying it as a viable retaliatory force. Thus, with little in the way of air cover, [[Cavite]]—the small, crowded base of operations for the Asiatic Fleet—lay naked to an attack from the sky.
 
The Japanese did not wait long to exploit their advantage—at 1230 on 10 December, the air raid alert was broadcast at Cavite. At 1250, ''Whippoorwill'' weighed anchor and stood out to maneuver in [[Manila Bay]], away from the confining waters near Cavite itself. Soon the enemy's high-level bombers were droning overhead, above the effective range of the navy yard's 3-inch batteries; every ship in the harbor opened up with their [[antiaircraft]] batteries. In the ensuing action, ''Whippoorwill'' claimed assists in splashing two bombers and sending another one crashing on shore nearby. However, the planes that did get through wreaked havoc. Stick after stick of bombs blasted the navy yard—its buildings and docks—explosions reverberated like thunderclaps.

===''Peary'' struck by Japanese bombs===

[[USS Peary (DD-226)|''Peary'' (DD-226)]]—alongside Central Wharf for an overhaul—was hit by a bomb that struck the foremast, snapping it off above the searchlight platform and sending shards of metal down onto the bridge and fire-control platform, killing or wounding nearly every man there—including the commander and his [[executive officer]]. Meanwhile, bombs blasted and set afire the [[torpedo]] warehouse across the wharf; warheads exploded and burned.
 
Comdr. Ferriter saw ''Peary's'' predicament and moved his ship through the burning navy yard and eased ''Whippoorwill'' near the [[destroyer]]'s stern and passed a towline. Braving the burning firebrands from the blazing warehouse, the destroyermen made fast the line, and the minesweeper commenced backing. The towline stretched taut—only to part! Twice more Ferriter's command closed the immobile destroyer, both ships endangered by warheads detonating nearby. Finally, on the third try, the line held; and, with debris showering upon the minesweeper and her crippled charge, ''Whippoorwill'' pulled ''Peary'' free.

===''Whippoorwill'' pulls ''Peary'' out of danger===

Soon thereafter, ''Whippoorwill'' moored ''Peary'' to a buoy in [[Manila Bay]] and took the destroyer's wounded to the hospital at [[Sangley Point]] in her motor launch. Later that evening, the minesweeper unmoored from the [[destroyer]] and stood out, anchoring for the night farther out in Manila Bay.

===''Whippoorwill'' escapes to Borneo===

With Philippine waters vulnerable for surface ships, those ships of the Asiatic Fleet that could do so sailed for points south. ''Whippoorwill'' headed for [[Borneo]] on 12 December and arrived at [[Balikpapan]] on the 15th. Four days later, the minecraft—in company with ''Tulsa'', ''Asheville'', and [[USS Lark (AM-21)|''Lark'' (AM-21)]]—joined [[Task Force]] (TF) 7 and withdrew further south to the [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], arriving the next day. Later, ''Whippoorwill'' screened ''Tulsa'' as the two ships proceeded for [[Java]].
 
Arriving at [[Surabaya]], three days before [[Christmas]] of 1941, Comdr. Ferriter went ashore and reported for orders to the Dutch naval commander there. Three days later, the minesweeper commenced local patrols and sweeps out of Surabaya and continued that duty into February 1942, often operating in company with Dutch units, before she received orders to move to [[Tjilatjap]], a port on [[Java]]'s south coast.

===Searching for ''Langley’s'' survivors===

Arriving early on 26 February, ''Whippoorwill'' and ''Lark'' put to sea at 1400 the next day to search for survivors of the [[seaplane tender]] [[USS Langley (AV-3)|''Langley'' (AV-3)]], reportedly sunk south of Java. Three hours out of Tjilatjap, the minesweeper's lookouts sighted a strange vessel and altered course to close and identify her. The mysterious ship turned out to be ''Tulsa'', also searching for ''Langley'' survivors.
 
The trio of ships continued their search, the minesweepers steaming independently of the gunboat. At 2229, ''Whippoorwill'' and ''Lark'' arrived in the area in which ''Langley'' had been reported lost, passed a large oil slick, and smelled a strong odor of gasoline and oil—mute testimony to the tragedy that had gone before.

===Rescuing survivors of the ''SS City of Manchester''===

On the following day, the last day of February, the minesweepers abandoned their search and were about to put about to return to Tjilatjap. At 0507, however, lookouts noted a pulsating fire on the horizon; and the minesweepers closed cautiously. The burning vessel turned out to be the British merchantman ''City of Manchester''—of the Ellerman Line—that had been torpedoed and gunned by the [[Japanese submarine I-153]]. ''Whippoorwill'' lowered a boat at 0550 and rescued the British sailors from their rafts and life boats. Ten injured men were transferred to ''Tulsa'', which had providentially shown up on the scene of the rescue—the gunboat having a well-equipped sick bay that the minesweepers lacked.
 
Following that rescue mission, ''Whippoorwill'' returned to [[Tjilatjap]], arriving on 1 March, only to stand out later that day as Java, too, was becoming more untenable with each passing hour. Retiring in the face of a ruthless enemy drawing tight the noose around Java, ''Whippoorwill'' crept southward towards Australia. As she proceeded on her anxious voyage, other retiring Asiatic Fleet ships met their doom at the hands of the marauding Japanese -- ''Asheville'', [[USS Pecos (AO-6)|''Pecos'' (AO-6)]], and the [[destroyers]] [[USS Edsall (DD-219)|Edsall (DD-219)]] and [[USS Pillsbury (DD-227)|''Pillsbury'' (DD-227)]].

===''Whippoorwill'' makes it to Australia===

''Whippoorwill'' dropped anchor at [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] on 9 March and operated out of Fremantle into May before she shifted to [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]. The minesweeper conducted local patrols and guardship operations in the shipping channels and harbors there from mid-May to late August when she returned to Fremantle. For the remainder of 1942, ''Whippoorwill'' operated alternatively at [[Exmouth, Western Australia|Exmouth Bay]], Albany, or Fremantle, patrolling locally and towing targets. On occasion, she acted as reference vessel for [[submarines]] of the Southwest Pacific forces on their training cruises. The beginning of 1943 found ''Whippoorwill'' engaged in local patrol operations out of [[Exmouth Gulf]], and she continued that duty until February, when she made another brief visit to Fremantle. On 18 and 19 February 1943, she engaged in night exercises with American [[submarines]] on maneuvers. Six days later, while underway off the coast, she encountered a [[cyclone]] which wrenched two 300-pound [[depth charges]] from their tracks.

===Antisubmarine action===

After returning to Exmouth Gulf, she remained there through March 1943 before sailing for Fremantle and a six-day [[drydock]]ing period. Upon completion of this brief refit, she returned to Exmouth Gulf on 24 April and conducted minesweeping operations in the area. On 15 May, while en route to Fremantle, she picked up an echo with her [[sonar]] gear and came to [[general quarters]]. She dropped [[depth charges]] but lost the contact. Arriving at Fremantle two days later, 17 May, she commenced a series of [[antisubmarine]] patrols which lasted into November.

===Reclassified as an ocean-going tug===

On 1 December, she began an extensive refit. During the yard work, she was reclassified an ocean-going tug and redesignated AT-169 on 1 March 1944. The long overhaul was completed on 5 March, and the ship proceeded to [[Brisbane]].
 
Coming under the operational control of [[Commander, Service Force, 7th Fleet]], ''Whippoorwill'' arrived at Brisbane on 20 March. For the next 10 days, 21 to 31 March 1944, she underwent final conversion to an ocean-going tug. This involved the removal of her minesweeping gear and the addition of a heavy-duty towing engine which had once been fitted on board [[USS Dobbin (AD-3)|''Dobbin'' (AD-3)]].

===New Guinea operations===

On 8 April, the newly refitted ''Whippoorwill'' with ''LST-385'' under tow, got underway for [[New Guinea]], and arrived at [[Milne Bay]] with her charge on 15 April. The tug then served [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] and at [[Mios Woendi]]; also receiving orders to [[Seeadler Harbor]], in the [[Admiralty Islands]], to serve on "battle-damage standby" duty—prepared to take any battle-damaged ships under tow and out of the front lines.

===Philippine Islands operations===

''Whippoorwill'' was reclassified an ocean-going tug, old, on 15 May 1944 and designated ATO-169. She then continued operations off [[New Guinea]] and in the backwater areas of the war in the Pacific until receiving orders to head north for [[Leyte]] in February 1945. Later operating at [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] and [[Ulithi]], ''Whippoorwill'' resumed operations in the [[Philippine Islands]] on 15 June 1945 and served as a harbor tug in the [[Manila Bay]] area through the end of the war.
 
Touching at [[Leyte Gulf]], [[Manila Bay]], [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], and [[Samar]], ''Whippoorwill'' finally rounded out her tour in the Philippine Islands on 20 December, when she departed Samar, bound for the [[Marshall Islands]]. Arriving at [[Eniwetok]] in company with [[USS Vireo (ATO-144)|''Vireo'' (ATO-144)]] and [[USS Rail (ATO-139)|''Rail'' (ATO-139)]], she departed that island on 4 January 1946, bound for [[Pearl Harbor]], arriving at the Pacific base that had once long served as her home port on the 15th. After a 10-day stay, ''Whippoorwill'' in company with ''Rail'', got underway again on 25 January, and headed for [[San Francisco, California]].

==Post-war inactivation and decommissioning==

Arriving there on 5 February 1946, ''Whippoorwill'' soon began preparation for inactivation and, on 17 April 1946, the stalwart ship was decommissioned at [[San Francisco, California]]. Struck from the [[Navy list]] on 10 June 1946, she was turned over to the [[Maritime Commission]] for disposal on 6 November 1946.

==Military awards and honors==

''Whippoorwill'' was awarded one [[battle star]] for her [[World War II]] service.
