The '''1941 constitution of Sarawak''' is the first known written constitution in the [[Kingdom of Sarawak]] Borneo. The objective of this constitution was to approve and fulfill the promise upheld by the third [[White Rajahs|white rajah]] of Sarawak, [[Charles Vyner Brooke]] — to give self-governance of Sarawak to the locals. However, his constitution was not implemented due to the [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Japanese Occupation]]. With the devastation and financial struggle of Sarawak, Charles Brooke without the discussion and approval of the local [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Iban people|Dayaks]] leaders decided to submit Sarawak to the [[United Kingdom|British]]. This caused huge dissatisfaction among the locals, who would later form a [[anti-cession movement of Sarawak|protest]] about the cession of Sarawak to the United Kingdom.

Among the contents are:

1. [[Charles Vyner Brooke]] handing absolute power to the Supreme Council and the Council of State &lt;br&gt;
2. Sarawak kings ruled with the advice of the Supreme Council &lt;br&gt;
3. The State Council is authorised to approve laws and financial management &lt;br&gt;
4. The King has the power to overturn legislation passed by the State Council &lt;br&gt;
5. The King appoints most of the members of the Supreme Council and the Council of State

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29412">The '''African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child''' (also called the '''ACRWC''' or '''Children's Charter''') was adopted by the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) in 1990 (in 2001, the [[OAU]] legally became the [[African Union]]) and was entered into force in 1999. Like the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC), the Children's Charter is a comprehensive instrument that sets out rights and defines universal principles and norms for the status of children. The ACRWC and the CRC are the only [[international human rights law|international and regional human rights treaties]] that cover the whole spectrum of [[civil and political rights|civil, political]], [[economic, social and cultural rights]].

It calls for the creation of an '''[[African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child]]''' (Committee of Experts). Its mission is to promote and protect the rights established by the ACRWC, to practice applying these rights, and to interpret the disposition of the ACRWC as required of party states, [[African Union]] (AU) institutions, or all other institutions recognized by AU or by a member state.

== Focus on Children's Right in Africa ==
Children in Africa are affected by many different types of [[Child abuse|abuse]], including economic and sexual exploitation, gender discrimination in education and access to health, and their involvement in armed conflict. Other factors affecting African children include migration, early marriage, differences between urban and rural areas, child-headed households, street children and poverty. Furthermore, child workers in [[Sub-Saharan]] Africa account for about 80 million children or 4 out of every 10 children under 14 years old which is the highest child labour rate in the world.

The ACRWC defines a "child" as a human being below the age of 18 years. It recognises the child's unique and privileged place in African society and that African children need protection and special care. It also acknowledges that children are entitled to the enjoyment of freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, thought, religion, and conscience. It aims to protect the private life of the child and safeguard the child against all forms of economic exploitation and against work that is hazardous, interferes with the child's education, or compromises his or her health or physical, social, mental, spiritual, and moral development. It calls for protection against abuse and bad treatment, negative social and cultural practices, all forms of exploitation or sexual abuse, including [[commercial sexual exploitation of children|commercial sexual exploitation]], and illegal drug use. It aims to prevent the [[sale of children|sale]] and [[trafficking of children]], kidnapping, and begging of children.

== Children's Charter VS. Convention on the Rights of the Child ==
The Children's Charter originated because the member states of the [[African Union|AU]] believed that the CRC missed important socio-cultural and economic realities particular to Africa. It emphasises the need to include African cultural values and experiences when dealing with the rights of the child in such as:

• Challenging traditional African views which often conflict with children's rights such as child marriage, parental rights and obligations towards their children, and children born out of wedlock;

• Expressly saying that the Children's Charter is higher than any custom, tradition, cultural or religious practice that doesn’t fit with the rights, duties and obligations in the Charter;

• The Children's Charter has a clearer definition of the child as a person aged under 18 years old;

• Outright prohibition on the recruitment of children (i.e. under 18 years old) in armed conflict and deals with conscription of children into the armed forces;

• Prohibiting marriages or betrothals involving children;

• Prohibiting the use of children as beggars;

• Granting girls the right to return to school after pregnancy;

• Promoting affirmative action for [[girls' education]];

• Tackling specific African issues that affect children. For example, it called for the confrontation and abolishment of apartheid and similar systems; and although, apartheid is now over, this provision is still applicable to children living under regimes practicing ethnic, religious or other forms of discrimination;

• Protecting internally displaced and refugee children;

• Protecting imprisoned expectant mothers and mothers of infants and young children;

• Providing a way for children themselves to petition the Children's Charter's Committee of Experts regarding infringements of their rights;

• Including special reference to care of the child by extended families;

• Encouraging the state to provide support for parents "in times of need";

• Protecting handicapped children.

'''The fundamental principles guiding implementation of these rights include:'''

• Non-discrimination;

• The [[best interests of the child]];

• The life, survival and development of the child;

• Child participation;

• Providing for the responsibilities that every child has with regard to their and society, the state and the international community.

== Ratification of the Children's Charter ==
As of 2016, the ACRWC has been ratified by 47 of the 54 states of the African Union, and signed but not ratified by the remaining seven states. [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Somalia]], [[South Sudan]], and [[Tunisia]] have signed but not ratified the Charter. [[Morocco]], a non-AU member state, has also not ratified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achpr.org/instruments/child/ratification/]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Shortcoming and Criticism ==
• It doesn’t protect children from life imprisonment without the possibility of release;

• When dealing with criminal activities, there is no provision for alternative measures such as community rehabilitation;

• No mention of the rights such as to remain silent, to be protected from retroactive legislation, to challenge detention, or to be compensated for miscarriages of justice;

• Article 20 can be construed as supporting physical punishment by parents as it is unclear regarding the meaning of "domestic discipline;"

• There is some confusion regarding Article 31 that deals with children's responsibilities. Children are required to respect parents, superiors and elders at all times which could conflict with the child's right to participate in decisions that affect them;

• The omission of a provision which requires countries to fully commit and use their resources means that the Children's Charter has no way to ensure or force states to provide resources to ensure the realisation of children's rights;

• Although the Children's Charter makes provision for special protection measures for the disabled, it fails to expressly include disability as a prohibited ground of discrimination;

• Unlike the CRC, which specifically ascribes rights to children of minorities, there is no similar provision in the African Charter, despite many countries in the region having significant populations of minority and indigenous groups.

== African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (Committee of Experts) ==
The Committee was formed in July 2001, one and half years after the Children's Charter came into force. The members are elected by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union. The criteria for the selection of members are:

• Members must be nationals of a State Party to the Children's Charter;

• They must be individuals of high moral standing, integrity, impartiality and competence in matters of the rights and welfare of the child;

• Members are nominated by signatory countries and elected by the Assembly of Heads of State of the African Union;

• Members are elected for a term of five years and serve voluntarily in their individual capacity. They may not be re-elected.

The Committee of Experts meets twice each year, usually in May and November in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The exact dates depend on other items on the AU agenda around these times. They are empowered to receive and examine the country ("state") reports on the measures they have adopted to implement the provisions of the Children's Charter as well as the progress achieved regarding how the rights are being protected. The final protective function of the Committee of Experts is related to the investigations procedure. They are empowered to resort to any appropriate method of investigation in respect of any issue covered in the Children's Charter.

== Members of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child ==
The current members of the ACERWC are (name, country, position):

• Mr. Benyam Dawit Mezmur, [[Ethiopia]], Chairperson;

== Challenges Faced by the Committee of Experts ==
• Functional secretariat: K.F. Malindi Jr, Founder of The Rights Club and a human and child rights activist notes that the Committee of Experts have yet to establish a fully functional secretariat which means that it cannot carry out its activities or deal with communications as well as country reports. It suffers from a serious lack of resources;

• Attitude of member states: Many member states are unenthusiastic about the Children's Charter and are often unwilling to nominate suitable people to sit on the Committee of Experts. Often, the committee members resign midway through their term;

• Non-state reporting: A look at states’ reporting history to the Committee of Experts also shows non-commitment by countries to fulfil their treaty obligations in respect of the Children's Charter. The responsibility for preparing and submitting country reports differ from country to country, which makes it difficult for the Committee of Experts to follow up with defaulting states;

• The rule of pendency &amp; appropriate bodies: Cases cannot be tried or investigated at the same time in two or more human rights bodies. Thus once a case has been brought before the Committee of Experts, it has to remain there until the legal process has been exhausted. The problem is that it takes an average of two and a half years for cases to be decided by the Committee of Experts;

• Other problems: Other important setback identified are the constant lack of legal counsel present at sessions of the Committee to give legal guidance on decisions being taken by the Committee; lack of coordinated cooperation and communication between the African Commission and the Committee and the non- prioritising by the AU of the work of the Committee resulting in delays and cancellation of sessions.

== State Party Reporting ==
Countries which have ratified the Children's Charter must submit initial reports within two years of ratification or the entry into force of the Charter and every three years thereafter. In 2008, the Committee of Experts started the process of reviewing the first four state reports that had been received from [[Egypt]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Rwanda]] in May 2008.

The state party report must contain specific information pertaining to children in their country. This includes political, legal, administrative issues that are linked to the requirements of the structure supplied by the Committee of Experts.

Ideally it should be a comprehensive report that includes input from the state, civil society and other recognised bodies at the regional, continental, international levels. But usually, the state report doesn’t include much information from civil society. So Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) can submit a second or "alternative" report that contains the information that they have gathered.

Until very recently, this "alternative" report could only be accepted after the state had submitted their report. But now a process has been put into place whereby the state is given 18 months to submit their report, failing that, the "alternative," civil society report will be accepted as that state's report.

Once received, the report then becomes available as a public document and it undergoes a process of:

• Elaboration: The elaboration process is the first process that occurs. The Committee of Experts determines the report's completeness, representativeness, its conformity to the guidelines, etc. and specific information is extracted regarding the children's rights;

• Consideration: The consideration process examines the reports to determine if the information supplied reflects the true situation in the country as a kind "photocopy" or "clear picture" at that point in time. This includes determining if there are any gaps or inconsistencies in the information supplied in both the official and the alternative reports;

• Follow-up: The follow-up process is where the state and civil society are contacted again to explain and complete any discrepancies or missing information. Further information and interviews may be required before the Committee is satisfied;

• Submission to the [[African Union|AU]].

Once the State Party and Alternative reports have been finalised, they are submitted to AU Secretariat for translation into the other working languages (English, French, Portuguese and Arabic). Then different Committee of Expert members review the report in a pre-sessional working group in order to identify issues for further discussion with the state and request for any other information that may help when considering the report. Other organisations, CSOs, UN groups, who have contributed alternative reports or who are considered relevant may be invited to attend the session on an informal basis. This is where CSOs can bring information to the process. A pre-sessional report is produced after this meeting.

After the pre-sessional report has been produced, the members who have been appointed to review the State Party / Alternative Report meet to discuss an in-depth review of the report. Their findings are submitted to the respective state concerned and discussed with high level government representatives. There is no Non Governmental Organisation (NGO)or civil society input at this level.

As a result of the in depth discussion, the Committee of Experts will identify problems, progress and differences in implementation of the Children's Charter by the State Party. These recommendations are called "concluding observations" and may include the following:

• The steps that need to be taken;

• Agree on recommendations;

• Suggest unique decisions suitable for each country;

• Changes in the country since the report was prepared;

• Follow-ups by the Committee of Experts to obtain more information or clarity.

After the initial State Party / Alternative report has been accepted, the state will then have to submit additional reports every 3 years. These reports are called "periodic reports." This will allow for comparison with the previous report to determine whether there has been progress or if the situation has worsened.

There may also be follow-ups and country visits. The State Party / Alternative Report and recommendations are sent to the Summit of the Heads of States and Government. Civil society is also able to intervene every 3 years to encourage the state to make improvements ahead of the preparation of additional reports.

== Observer Status for Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) ==
CSOs and international institutions have played a significant role in the work of the Committee of Experts and they have served as the backbone of the committee's work since inception. International NGOs have been particularly involved in the work of the committee, providing different kinds of expertise and financial support to most of the work.

Although CSO involvement was minimal in the beginning, over the intervening years they have since taken a pivotal role in ensuring that the committee fulfils its mandate and in providing the necessary support needed to facilitate its work. The adoption of the guidelines for granting observer status will now also ensure that more CSOs are able to formally participate and contribute in the process.

According to the proposed guidelines for observer status, some of the ways CSOs and associations will be allowed to participate will include:

• Attending opening and closing ceremonies of the Committee of Experts sessions;

• Participating in the committee's meetings;

• Accessing documents that are not confidential and do not deal with issues concerning the observers;

• Being invited to participate in closed sessions dealing with issues that concern them;

• Making statements on issues that concern them, provided the statement has been sent to the committee in advance;

• Responding to questions they may be asked in meetings.

The guidelines encourage the formation of coalitions by CSOs with similar objectives. The following are the requirements for the participation of CSOs for observer status are:

• They must be registered in a member state with the mandate to carry out regional and international activities;

• Must have been registered for a minimum of three years;

• Must have done work in the defence of children's rights;

• They must have a recognised headquarters, democratically adopted statutes and a representative structure;

• They must submit a list of documentation to aid their application at least three months before a session of the Committee of Experts.

Once the organisation has obtained observer status, it may request the Committee of Experts to include issues of interest on their agenda and to make oral statements at the sessions. They are entitled to receive information on the time, location and agenda of the sessions of the committee. The committee can invite a CSO to participate in the deliberations of the meetings of the Committee without a voting right.

The CSOs are also under an obligation to establish close relations with the committee and to hold regular consultations on all issues of common interest. CSOs are required to submit reports on their activities every two years. When CSOs default on their obligations, the committee may suspend or withdraw the observer status.

== Communications to the Committee of Experts ==
A communication is a complaint submitted to the Committee of Experts regarding a violation of the rights of children under the Children's Charter. The following are some guidelines for those wanting to submit a communication to the Committee of Experts:

• A communication may be submitted by individuals, groups, associations, NGOs, etc.;

• These individuals or groups MUST be recognised by the state, AU or international body;

• The state is excluded from the complaints process;

• Any violation of child rights may be considered;

• The country where the violation has occurred must be a signatory of the Children's Charter.

== Specific Requirements of a Communication ==
A communication must meet the following criteria:

• It cannot not be anonymous;

• It must be written;

• It must be submitted within a reasonable deadline or timeframe, depending on the nature of the complaint;

• It must be written in a reasonable and non-defamatory tone;

• It must be compatible with the AU rules and laws or the Children's Charter;

• It must not be exclusively based on information in the media;

• Issues must not have been already decided by another investigation, procedure or international regulation;

• It must only be submitted when all local / domestic remedies have been exhausted or when the author of the communication is not satisfied with the solution provided at the local / domestic level;

• The Committee of Experts can also review its own decision in a communication where the complainant can provide additional information to support his/her case;

• The Committee of Experts can receive a communication from a non-State Party (e.g. CSO, individual, group of people) if it is in the best interest of the child.

If the communication meets the above requirements, then it may be considered by the Committee of Experts. When a complaint reaches the committee, a group will be assigned to work on it to decide if it is acceptable. If it is acceptable then they will give feedback both to the country where the problem is located. If there are gaps, then the committee will ask the country to take measures to protect the complainant while it is being investigated further.

The work on the complaint is confidential and is held in closed session debates. Once a decision has been taken, a communication is sent to the country's state department. A member on the Committee of Experts is designated to follow up and coordinate the process. Once the process has been completed, a report is sent to the Committee of the Heads of State and Government.

Children who are the authors or who are the victims in the communication process now have an opportunity to express their opinions to the Committee of Experts. This provision guarantees the cardinal principle of child participation in issues concerning them.

== Investigations ==
Investigations may be initiated because the Committee of Experts has received a communication indicating a serious violation. Investigation missions can be initiated either by a state referring a matter to the Committee of Experts, or the committee can undertake its own investigations, although the Committee may only visit a State Party if invited to do so by the government.

To ensure the investigative mission team has background knowledge of the situation, a preliminary report according to certain guidelines and based on available information is prepared before each investigation. The mission will meet with available state and non-state organisations and people in the country where they will be investigating.

Once the mission has finished its investigation, it has to release a preliminary result to the government and the media in the country of investigation. A final report is then prepared which incorporates the mission's recommendations. This mission report must be attached to the progress report of the Committee to the African Heads of State and Government.

The country that has been investigated has up to 6 months after the adoption of a decision by the Committee of Experts to submit a written reply on what they have done regarding the requirements or measures in the mission report.

The country's response should also include information on any measures in reaction to the recommendations made by the Committee after the mission. CSOs and ‘specialised institutions’ like children's CSOs could also be requested to provide information on the situation of children in that state.

A '''four-question referendum''' was held in [[Belarus]] on 14 May 1995, alongside [[Belarusian parliamentary election, 1995|parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p252 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four issues were the possibility of giving the [[Russian language]] equal status with [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], whether new national symbols should be adopted, whether there should be economic integration with [[Russia]] and changes to the [[Constitution of Belarus|constitution]] that would allow early elections if Parliament systematically violated the constitution.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, pp255-256&lt;/ref&gt; According to official results, all four were approved by at least three-quarters of voters, with a turnout of 64.8%.&lt;ref name=NS/&gt;

The [[OSCE Parliamentary Assembly]] stated that the referendum violated international standards. Members of the Belarusian democratic opposition underline that the organisation of the referendum has involved several serious violations of the acting legislation, including the Constitution of Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bielarus.net/archives/2009/06/04/1615 |title=› Беларуская Салідарнасьць » Сяргей Навумчык: Парушэньні ў часе рэфэрэндуму - 1995 |website=Bielarus.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] had tried to hold a similar referendum on state symbols in 1993, but had failed to obtain parliamentary support. Two months before the May 1995 referendum, Lukashenko proposed a flag design that consisted of two small bars of green and one wide bar of red. While it is not known what became of this suggestion, new designs (called "projects" in Belarus) were suggested a few days later, which were then put up to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vexillographia.ru/belarus/ The national flag of the Republic of Belarus] Vexillographia {{ru icon}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

On 11 April 1995 Parliament considered the questions for the referendum, approved the date, but approved only the question regarding economic integration with Russia. Lukashenko declared that he would not change his decision and would accept personal responsibility for the referendum, and left the Parliament, announcing that it would be his last discussions with Parliament in its current form. Nineteen MPs from the [[Belarusian Popular Front]], including [[Zyanon Paznyak|Zenon Paznyak]], [[Piatro Sadoǔski]] and others, decided to carry out a [[hunger strike]] within Parliament, protesting against the president organizing the referendum despite the parliament's decision. They were beaten and forcibly removed by [[OMON]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svaboda.org/content/article/794453.html 10 years agomembers of the opposition Belarusian Popular Front, who were holding a hunger strike in Parliament House, were beaten] Radio Liberty12 April 2005 {{be icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentarians sued the special forces for [[battery (crime)|battery]] but were unsuccessful.

A conciliatory commission was called upon to resolve the conflict between the President and Parliament, which was eventually decided in favour of the President.

==Reaction==

===Opposition criticism===

The opposition questions the validity of the 1995 referendum itself. According to [[Siarhei Navumchyk]], former parliament member, the referendum was illegal and thus its results have no legal power:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bielarus.net/archives/2009/06/04/1615 Analysis by former parliament member Siarhiej Navumchyk]&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the 1995 Law on national referendums (Закон аб усенародным галасаваньні (рэфэрэндуме)), the national symbols and official language were not allowed to be questioned on a referendum at all;
*Formalities of approval of the referendum by the Parliament have not been carried out;
*The opposition had limited access to media, observers from the opposition have reported fraud in vote counts.

Besides that, the opposition raised several other issues related to organisation of the referendum:

*The referendum was preceded by a heavy campaign in the overwhelmingly state-owned media that stressed the fact that the then current emblem was used by Nazi collaborators ([[Belarusian Central Rada]]) during the [[Great Patriotic War]]. For example, the first leader of the post-Soviet Belarus, [[Stanislav Shushkevich]], in his interview mentioned that [[Pahonia]] was called a "fascist symbol".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/nn/show/34/40738/ Interview with Shushkevich] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050330185902/http://www.zerkalo-nedeli.com/nn/show/34/40738/ |date=2005-03-30 }} Zerkalo Nedeli, 27 May 1995 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Before the final announcement of the results of the referendum, Lukashenko's Chief of Administration [[Ivan Titenkov (politician)|Ivan Titenkov]] personally hoisted down the old flag from the Palace of Government and shredded it in public.
*The referendum question was formulated in a vague way: a number of people claimed to have voted in the belief that the "new" symbols were the ones already introduced in 1992
*The number of voters who approved the symbols, as only 48.6% of the total electorate approved of the new emblem, since over a third of the eligible voters did not express an opinion. Some claim that this failure to win a majority is a violation of the [[Constitution of Belarus|Constitution]], but the imperfection and incompleteness of the Belarusian Law did not resolve the issue (in particular, the Constitution does not define the acceptance threshold).
*Finally, the [[Partyja BNF]] and other influential opposition parties state that the referendum, followed by mass closing of [[Belarusian language]] schools and minimizing of Belarusian language programmes on national TV and radio, has had a harmful effect on the Belarusian language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbnf.org/2005/05/14/old_683.html The Referendum of 1995 as an Attack on Belarusian Language and Belarusian HIstorical Memory]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Partyja BNF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svaboda.org/content/transcript/795766.html 1995-2005: Decade since the referendum on the status of Russian language] Radio Liberty&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reaction===
The Russian [[State Duma]] issued a statement supporting the official results of the referendum that promoted the status of [[Russian language]] in Belarus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoteka.ru/pst/166/82507.html In connection with the results of a referendum May 14, 1995 in the Republic of Belarus] State Duma of the Russian Federation&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OSCE Parliamentary Assembly]] stated that the referendum has violated international standards and noted concerns over governmental control over the media, interference with the voting process, obstacles to the opposition's activities. The US Department of State also criticized the Belarusian government for this referendum.&lt;ref&gt;"Parliamentary elections in Belarus, the U.S. State Department Statement on the elections and referendum in the Republic of Belarus",''Belarusian Business Newspaper, 22 May 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The decrees about the new state flag and new [[coat of arms]] were signed by President on 7 July 1995.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2098">The '''Canadian Agreement''' was an 1894 agreement between the United States and signatory transportation companies that prohibited transportation companies from landing in Canadian ports immigrants who were barred from entry in the U.S.

==Background==
During the 1880s and 1890s, the U.S. began tightening its [[immigration]] laws by barring certain ethnic groups from entering, for example [[Chinese Exclusion Act|the Chinese]].  Transportation companies that brought these barred individuals to the U.S. would be responsible for their return to their country of origin.  Transportation companies, however, got around this restriction by landing barred people at Canadian ports.  The immigrants would then come into the United States through the [[Canada–United States border]]. During the mid-to-late nineteenth century, the Canadian immigration route was preferred for [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavians]], [[Russians|Russian]]s, and other northern Europeans immigrating to [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], or other states on the Upper Great Plains.  By 1892, Canadian carriers were advertising in Europe that entry at Canadian ports was a hassle-free way to enter the U.S.&lt;ref name=Smith_2000&gt;Marina L. Smith, "The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) at the U.S.-Canadian Border, 1893-1993: An Overview of Issues and Topics," ''Michigan Historical Review'' 26, No. 2 (Fall 2000), 127-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Policy==
The agreement was signed September 7, 1893.&lt;ref name=Smith_2000 /&gt;

The 1894 agreement allowed U.S. immigration inspectors to monitor immigration at Canadian seaports and deny entry into Canada of any immigrant deemed excludable under [[U.S. immigration law]].  The U.S. placed inspectors at [[Quebec City|Quebec]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].  The U.S. spent approximately twenty years attempting to perfect implementation of the law and the inspection system in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=Smith_2000 /&gt;

'''C-Bus''' is a home-automation product range from the [[Clipsal]] brand owned by [[Schneider Electric]].  Since 1994&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.clipsal.com/cis/technical/technical_support/training2/cbus_control_and_management_system&lt;/ref&gt; it has grown to include approximately 400 products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clipsal.com/Trade/Products/Catalogue/Integrated-Systems?c=2#top&lt;/ref&gt;  It is primarily used as a [[Lighting control system]] but also supports other automation functions such as irrigation and security.

The initial products were labelled as 'C-Bus'.  The branding became 'C-Bus 2' in 2001 with the introduction of a feature called Learn Mode, however products of either branding are compatible and can be used together.

C-Bus products communicate using an open protocol of the [[C-Bus (protocol)|same name]], relayed via a pink cable that carries both power and data.  Some products require an additional mains supply.

A single bus segment, referred to as a 'C-Bus network', can address 255 individual devices.  Commercial installations can comprise a number of interconnected networks which are linked together by the use of bridges.

'''Copyright for Creativity - A Declaration for Europe'''  issued on 5 May 2010, is intended as a statement of how [[copyright]] [[policy]] could be constructed in the Internet Age. It comes against the background of political debate within Europe to rethink [[copyright]] in an era where the use of digital content without paying fees to the creators is part of the business model for some of the largest global internet platforms. Interests of content creators and online platform providers collide. The declaration has been written by a group from political party "[[European People's Party|European People's Party (EPP)]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc10/EDOC12101.htm] Rethinking Creative Rights for the Internet age.

The Declaration is influenced by the [[Adelphi Charter]], which resulted from a project commissioned by the [[Royal Society of Arts|Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce]], London, UK.

The Declaration reads:{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

'''Copyright for Creativity – A Declaration for Europe'''

''"Humanity's capacity to generate new ideas and knowledge is its greatest asset. It is the source of art, science, innovation and economic development."''
Adelphi Charter

The development of new technologies underpinning the [[knowledge economy]] calls for a review of the copyright aquis. Together, we need to create greater incentives to maximise creativity, innovation, education and access to culture, and secure Europe's competitiveness.

Exclusive rights stimulate investment and the production of cultural and knowledge based goods. Simultaneously, exceptions* to those rights create a balanced system that allow for the use of creative works to support innovation, creation, competition and the public interest. Well-crafted exceptions can serve both goals: preserving rewards and incentives for creators while also encouraging innovative re-uses that benefit the public.

While exclusive rights have been adapted and harmonised to meet the challenges of the knowledge economy, copyright's exceptions are radically out of line with the needs of the modern information society. The lack of harmonisation of exceptions hinders the circulation of knowledge based goods and services across Europe. The lack of flexibility within the current European exceptions regime also prevents us from adapting to a constantly changing technological environment.

Europe requires a balanced, flexible and harmonised system of exceptions that is in step with the 21st Century knowledge economy. The European Commission took a first step with the publication of the Green Paper, "Copyright in the Knowledge Economy." The signatories of this declaration call upon the European Commission, the European Parliament and Member States to take this Declaration into account and engage in policy and norm-setting on copyright exceptions to:

* '''Harmonise Exceptions Across Europe.''' Copyright regulates the flow of consumer as well as knowledge goods in the single market. For European citizens and industry alike, the harmonisation of exceptions is a necessary step to facilitate cross-border trade, and create equality and clarity before the law.
* '''Act as a Spur to Innovation:''' New technologies make it possible to expand users' access to vast quantities of relevant knowledge and content. Copyright exceptions must support the development and usage of these innovative services, improving European users' access to content.
*'''Support User Creativity and Wider Participation:''' The Internet has facilitated an unprecedented shift for citizens, from being passive consumers of "broadcast" culture to active creators and participants. Individual users are increasingly involved in content and knowledge creation. The European copyright framework needs to reflect this new interactivity which encourages creativity, cultural diversity and self-expression.
*''' Ensure Accessibility by all Europeans:''' Exceptions must balance the protection of the creators' rights with the public interest and must fully support improving access to knowledge and content for people with disabilities – most notably through the use of new technologies.
*''' Support for Education and Research:''' Information and communication technologies offer new collaborative ways to develop and share educational and research materials.Copyright exceptions that facilitate new technology-based research and education will propel science and learning, and therefore the knowledge economy, exponentially forward.
*'''Facilitate Preservation and Archiving:''' Digitisation of content is offering new opportunities not only to preserve but also extend the accessibility of Europe's knowledge and cultural heritage with wide-reaching and long-term benefits for society as a whole. The copyright framework must support this.
*'''Ensure Monopoly Rights are Regulated in the Online Environment:''' Limitations and exceptions act to counterbalance the lack of competition that is created by the granting of monopoly rights in copyright law. In order to protect creativity and innovation we must ensure that these monopoly rights are also regulated in the online environment.
*'''Promote these Principles in International Discussions.''' The principles and objectives we endorse should not apply only to Europeans – they should be at the centre of the EU's contributions in any discussions in multilateral and bilateral fora it participates in.

''* Copyright law enable an exclusive right to creators to regulate and control the use of their work as they wish. Limitations and exceptions balance the monopoly right of the creator, in the public interest. For example to promote education and learning, support a free press, deal with market failure etc.''{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Basic Information ==

The '''Cyprus Safer Internet Hotline''' is a service provided by the [[Cyprus Safer Internet Center]] project, coordinated by the [[Cyprus Neuroscience and Technology Institute]] (CNTI). The Hotline promotes the safe use of the [[Internet]] in [[Cyprus]]. It serves the needs of all people that live on the island but also abroad and addresses issues of [[child pornography]], [[child erotica]], [[child nudity]], [[child grooming]] activities, [[child trafficking]], [[child sex tourism]], but also [[racism]] (currently on the rise in Cyprus), [[gender discrimination]] and inappropriate use of peoples’ images.

The Hotline provides assistance to the [[Cyber Crime]] unit of the [[Cyprus Police]] by filtering reports to determine which reports concern content that is  probably illegal and is also located in [[Cyprus]] or has a Cypriot dimension. This assists the Police to dedicate their specialist resources to pursuing investigations within their jurisdiction by not having to deal with the majority of reports that do not contain illegal content or relate to material held in other jurisdictions.

The Hotline is a member of the [[INHOPE]] International Association of Internet Hotlines, founded in 1999 under the EC Safer Internet Action Plan.
[[INHOPE]] facilitates and co-ordinates the work of hotlines internationally in responding to illegal use and content on the Internet. It facilitates good working relationships between hotlines and the exchange of reports by ensuring trust built on a rigorous hotline approval process. When illegal content which is not hosted in [[Cyprus]] is reported to SafenetCY the report is forwarded via [[INHOPE]] to the hotline that operates in the hosting country. If there is no [[INHOPE]] hotline in operation in the hosting country, the report is forwarded to the Cyprus Police which can decide based on the nature of the content to pursue an investigation in liaison with [[Interpol]].

== History ==

The service was first established in 2005 as '''Safeweb'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safeweb.org.cy safeweb.org.cy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804022327/http://www.safeweb.org.cy/ |date=2010-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a partnership between the [[University of Cyprus]] and the [[Foundation for Research &amp; Technology – Hellas |FORTH Institute in Greece]]. It was re-launched as '''SafenetCY''' in March 2007 (Grant Number SIP-2005-AN-038265), when the [[Cyprus Neuroscience and Technology Institute]]  secured an EU grant together with [[CYTA]] with the initiatives of Elia Petridou and [[Yiannis Laouris]]. In 2008 it was integrated with the '''CyberEthics Safer Internet Awareness Center''' also co-funded by the Safer Internet Plus Program of the European Commission, under Grant Number SIP-2008-CNH-143-802.

The Safer Internet Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/sip/index_en.htm|title=Self-regulation for a Better Internet for Kids|date=10 July 2015|work=Digital Agenda for Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[European Commission]] (EC) has been instrumental in developing the Hotline network in Europe.

== Visibility ==

SafenetCY has run visibility events to promote Internet safety issues and the importance of making reports to combat the prevalence of illegal content on the Internet. The Hotline has participated and contributed to various forums  with the view to developing safer internet initiatives. It has also provided support and speakers for events run by educational organisations, industry associations and child welfare organisations.  Interviews regarding the working of the Hotline are regularly given on TV, radio and the written press. It is vital that all relevant agencies work together to promote Internet safety and provide a safer Internet environment for all. SafenetCY is also an active participant in the organisation of various events and activities to raise awareness in the context of the annual celebration of the International [[Safer Internet Day]].

== Related Projects ==

In addition to the Hotline, the  [[Cyprus Safer Internet Center]] also operates the [[Cyprus Safer Internet Helpline]].

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Republic of Dahomey]] on 31 March 1968. As with the [[Dahomeyan constitutional referendum, 1964|1964 referendum]], the main issues were changing the system of government to a [[presidential system]], scrapping term limits for the president, and having a [[Unicameralism|unicameral parliament]]. The referendum passed with 92.2% of voters approving the changes. Turnout was 81.8% of the 1,126,155 registered voters.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M &amp; Thibaut, B (1999) ''Elections in Africa: A data handbook'', p89 {{ISBN|0-19-829645-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Regi-orszaggyules.jpg|thumb|Diet of Hungary of 1830]]
The  '''Diet of Hungary''' or originally: '''Parlamentum Publicum''' / '''Parlamentum Generale'''&lt;ref&gt;András Gergely, Gábor Máthé: The Hungarian state: thousand years in Europe (published in 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-hu|Országgyűlés}}) became the supreme legislative institution in the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|medieval kingdom of Hungary]] from the 1290s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Elemér Hantos]]: The Magna Carta Of The English And Of The Hungarian Constitution (1904)&lt;/ref&gt; and in its successor states, [[Royal Hungary]] and the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Habsburg kingdom of Hungary]] throughout the [[Early Modern period]]. The name of the legislative body was originally "Parlamentum" during the Middle Ages, the "Diet" expression gained mostly in the Early Modern period.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Marcus Knatchbull-Hugessen Brabourne (4th Baron): The political evolution of the Hungarian nation: (Volume I. in 1908)&lt;/ref&gt; It convened at regular intervals with interruptions during the period of 1527 to 1918, and again until 1946.

The articles of the 1790 diet set out that the diet should meet at least once every 3 years, but, since the diet was called by the [[Habsburg monarchy]], this promise was not kept on several occasions thereafter. As a result of the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]], it was reconstituted in 1867.

The Latin term ''Natio Hungarica'' ("Hungarian nation") was used to designate the political elite which had participation in the medieval and early modern era Parliaments, consisting of the 1/ Roman Catholic Clergy, 2/ the [[Hungarian nobility|nobility]], 3/ the envoys of cities who were elected by the people of the [[Royal free city|Royal Free Cities]]&lt;ref&gt;John M.

==Development==
{{further|Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1526)}}

Some researchers have traced the roots of the Hungarian institution of national assemblies as far back as the 11th century. This based on documentary evidence that, on certain  occasions under the reigns of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|King Ladislaus I]] and [[Coloman of Hungary|King Coloman]] “the Book lover”, assemblies were held on a national scale where both ecclesiastic and secular dignitaries made appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Zoltán SZENTE: The Historic Origins of the National Assembly in Hungary| [http://www.historiaconstitucional.com/index.php/historiaconstitucional/article/viewFile/37/28]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first written mention of Hungarian Parliament originated under [[Andrew II of Hungary|King Andrew II]] with the [[Golden Bull of 1222]], which reaffirmed the rights of the smaller nobles of the old and new classes of royal servants (servientes regis) against both the crown and the magnates, and to defend the rights of the whole nation against the crown by restricting the powers of the latter in certain fields and legalizing refusal to obey its unlawful/unconstitutional commands (the "''ius resistendi''").
The lesser nobles also began to present Andrew with grievances, a practice that evolved into the institution of the Hungarian Diet.

An institutionalized Hungarian parliament emerged during the 14th and 15th centuries. Beginning under [[Charles I of Hungary|King Charles I]], continuing under subsequent kings through into the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus|King Matthias I]], the Diet was essentially convened by the king to announce his decisions, and had no significant power of its own.

In 1492 the Diet limited all serfs' freedom of movement and greatly expanded their obligations while at the same time only a few peasant families were prospering because of increased cattle exports to the West. Rural discontent boiled over in 1514 when well-armed peasants preparing for a crusade against Turks rose up under [[György Dózsa]]. Shocked by the peasant revolt, the Diet of 1514 passed laws that condemned the serfs to eternal bondage and increased their work obligations still further.

When [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|King Vladislaus II]] died in 1516, a royal council appointed by the Diet ruled the country in the name of his ten-year-old son, [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|King Louis II]] (1516–26).

== Re-establishment 1867 ==
In the course of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] a diet was called at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] that was dismissed by decree of Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria]] in October; the next year a Hungarian assembly met at the [[Protestant Great Church of Debrecen]], which declared the new Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] deposed and elected [[Lajos Kossuth]] regent-president. The revolution was finally suppressed by Austrian troops under General [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]] and the assembly dissolved.
[[File:Budapest Parlament1.jpg|thumb|Since 1902 the diet has been assembling in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] in Budapest]]
The Habsburgs again approached toward the Hungarian estates after the disastrous defeat at the 1859 [[Battle of Solferino]] and the loss of [[Lombardy]]. In 1860 Emperor Franz Joseph issued the [[October Diploma]], which provided a national [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]] assembly formed by delegates deputed by the ''[[Landtag]]e'' diets of the Austrian crown lands, followed by the [[February Patent]] of 1861, promising the implementation of a bicameral legislature. The Hungarian [[magnate]]s however rejected to be governed from Vienna and insisted on an own parliamentary assembly with comprehensive autonomy in Hungarian affairs. The negotiations failed, predominantly due to the tough stance of Austrian Minister-President [[Anton von Schmerling]].

Finally in the course of the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the emperor appointed [[Gyula Andrássy]] Hungarian minister-president and the re-established national assembly convened on 27 February.

The legislative power was vested in this parliament, consisting of two houses: an [[upper house]] titled the Főrendiház ({{convertIPA-hu|f|ő|r|e|n|d|i|h|á|z}}, ''House of Magnates''), and a [[lower house]] titled the Képviselőház ({{IPAc-hu|'|k|é|p|v|i|s|e|l|ő|h|á|z}}, ''House of Representatives''). From 1902 on parliament assembles in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] on the [[Danube]] in [[Budapest]].

=== House of Magnates ===
[[File:Budapest parlament interior 14.jpg|thumb|Assembly hall of the House of Magnates]]
{{main|House of Magnates}}
The House of Magnates (''Főrendiház'') was, like the current [[British House of Lords]], composed of hereditaries, ecclesiastics, and, unlike the House of Lords, deputized representatives from autonomous regions (similar to [[Resident Commissioner]]s of [[United States territories]]&lt;!-- Yes, I know that's not the best example, if you can find the better one, please change it--&gt;). The House had no fixed membership size, as anyone who met the qualifications could sit in it. The official list:
* Princes of the royal house who have attained their majority (16 in 1904)
* Hereditary peers who paid at least 3000 florins a year land tax (237 in 1904) (at its 1896 exchange rate, £1 was worth 12 florins, so this comes to £250)
* High dignitaries of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es (42 in 1904)
* Representatives of the Protestant confessions (13 in 1904)
* Life peers appointed by the Crown, not exceeding 50 in number, and life peers elected by the house itself (73 altogether in 1904)
* Various state dignitaries and high judges (19 in 1904)
* Three delegates of [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]]

See also [[List of Speakers of the House of Magnates of Hungary]]

=== House of Representatives ===
[[File:Budapest Parliament conference hall.jpg|thumb|Assembly hall of the House of Representatives]]
The House of Representatives (''Képviselőház '') consisted of members elected, under the Electoral Law of 1874, by a complicated franchise based upon property, taxation, profession or official position, and ancestral privileges. The House consisted of 453 members, of which 413 were deputies elected in Hungary and 40 delegates of Croatia-Slavonia sent by the parliament of that Kingdom. Their terms were for five years and were remunerated.

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] considered the franchise "probably the most illiberal in Europe". The working classes were wholly unrepresented in the parliament, only 6% of them, and 13% of the small trading class, possessing the franchise, which was only enjoyed by 6% of the entire population.

The parliament was summoned annually by the king in Budapest. While the official language was [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the delegates of [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]] were allowed to use the [[Croatian language]] in the proceedings. The Hungarian parliament had the power to legislate on all matters concerning Hungary, but for Croatia-Slavonia only on matters which it shared with Hungary. Executive power was vested in a cabinet responsible to it, consisting of ten ministers, including: the president of the council, the minister for Croatia-Slavonia, a minister ''ad latum'', and the ministers of the interior, of national defence, of education and public worship, of finance, of agriculture, of industry and commerce, and of justice. The King had the power to veto all legislation passed by the Diet and also to dissolve it and call new elections. Additionally, before any bill could be presented to the Diet, the Emperor-King had to give his Royal Assent. All this shows that the Head of State still had huge power, which however he chose not to use in order to give the Hungarians more control over their own affairs.

== Post-1989 ==
The democratic character of the Hungarian parliament was reestablished with [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the end of communist dictatorship. Today's parliament is still called ''Országgyűlés'' just like in royal times, but in order to differentiate between the two phases is referred to as [[National Assembly of Hungary]] now, as opposed to the historical royal diet.

A '''division bell''' is a bell rung in or around a parliament to signal a [[Division of the assembly|division]] and thus call all members of the chamber so affected to vote in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/division-bell/ UK Parliament glossary - division bell]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United Kingdom ==
[[File:Division-bell.jpg|thumb|Houses of Parliament Division bell]]
The bell is used in the immediate neighbourhood of the [[Palace of Westminster]] (which houses [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]) to signal that a division is occurring and that [[Member of Parliament|members of the House of Commons]] or of the [[House of Lords]] have eight minutes to get to their chosen [[Division of the assembly|Division lobby]] to vote for or against the resolution. The call for a division is also displayed on the [[Annunciator panel|Annunciator]] screens throughout the Palace of Westminster. The division bells are also sounded at the point when the house sits (at the start of its day); at the end of the two-minute prayers that start each day and when the house rises.&lt;ref name="SN06041"&gt;Divisions in the House of Commons: House of Commons Background Paper. Document ref:SN/PC/06401  (Last updated: 2 August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately five hundred bells in and around the Palace of Westminster. 

As some Members may be in nearby offices, restaurants, pubs or shops, some of these have their own division bells connected to those in the Houses of Parliament; others will use a system of [[pager]]s co-ordinated by the [[Whip (politics)|Whip]]'s office of each party.

The headquarters of the major parties are all within reach of the division bell, and this area roughly defines the geographical limits of the [[Westminster Bubble]].

Though the Commons and Lords share division bells, they are driven from separate ringing generator systems which means that the bells make a noticeably different sound for a division of the House of Commons and a division of the House of Lords.

The generator for the House of Commons simultaneously sounds all the division bells with a 2&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz]] signal for exactly eight minutes. As soon as the bells stop, the door keepers manning the entrances to the two division lobbies close and lock the doors. Any MP who has failed to enter the lobby in time has lost the ability to vote in that division.

A broadcast of the BBC's ''Antiques Roadshow'' in October 2007 from the Banqueting House in Whitehall featured the original Ringing Generator System Number 1 from the House of Commons. The programme's expert, Paul Atterbury, with the help of former House of Commons Speaker Baroness [[Betty Boothroyd]], demonstrated the apparatus in use with one of the original Division Bells. The show valued the transmitter at £15,000.

Three Ringing Generator Systems were made at the end of the 19th century by the [[General Post Office|GPO]] at the request of the Government. They were numbered 1, 2 and 3. Numbers 2 and 3 were destroyed by a bomb in 1941 and replaced with copies bearing the numbers 4 and 5. Number 5 generator exists, but the whereabouts of number 4 is not known. The current generator is entirely electronic.

===External division bells===

Besides the Palace of Westminster, division bells are fitted in the following establishments:&lt;ref name="SN06041" /&gt;

*Hispaniola Restaurant, Victoria Embankment
*St. Ermin's Hotel, Caxton St.
*St. James Court Hotel, Buckingham Gate.
*National Liberal Club, Whitehall Place.
*Green's Restaurant, Marsham St.
*St. Stephens Club, 34 Queen Anne's Gate. (Though still listed in the Parliamentary paper on division bells, the club closed in 2013)
*Red Lion Public House, Parliament St.
*St. Germain Restaurant, Royal Westminster Hotel, Buckingham Palace Road.
*The Cinnamon Club, 30 Great Smith St.
*Royal Horseguard Hotel, Whitehall Place.
*Quilon Restaurant, 41 Buckingham Gate. (The parliamentary paper on division bells incorrectly spells the name as 'Quillon)
*Pomegranate Restaurant, 94 Grosvenor Rd.  (Though still listed in the Parliamentary paper on division bells, the restaurant closed in 2009)
*Kyms Restaurant, 70-71 Wilton Rd.
*Quirinale Restaurant, 1 Great Peter St.
*Marquis of Granby public house, 41 Romney St.
*Vitello Dor Restaurant, Church House.

The proprietors of these establishments are responsible for the maintenance of the bells.&lt;ref name="SN06041" /&gt;

== In Australia ==

Both State and Federal Parliament buildings use electronic division bells. In states with [[bicameral parliament]]s, and in the federal Parliament, red and green lights near the division bells flash to indicate which house is being called. Queensland and the Territories, which have [[unicameral parliament]]s, do not require the red light which indicates the Upper House. The bells are rung at the beginning of a sitting, because a member has challenged a vote (called a division), or because there are not enough members in the chamber to constitute [[quorum]].

In the [[New South Wales|NSW]] Parliament, the division bell is electronic and rings differently for divisions in the Assembly and the Council.

== In Canada ==

The electronic bell of the House of Commons sounds to call members of the House for a sitting, a vote, or to announce the lack of a quorum. In the case of a vote, it is referred to as the division bell.

'''Earthjustice''' (originally '''Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund''') is a non-profit public interest organization based in the [[United States]] dedicated to litigating environmental issues. It is headquartered in [[San Francisco]], has 14 regional offices across the United States, an International Program, a communications team, and a Policy &amp;amp; Legislation team in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthjustice.org/about/contact]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
The organization was founded in 1971 as the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, though it was fully independent from the [[Sierra Club]]. It changed its name to Earthjustice in 1997 to better reflect its role as a legal advocate representing hundreds of regional, national and international organizations. As of September 2018, the group had provided free legal representation to more than 1,000 clients ranging from the Sierra Club, [[World Wildlife Fund]], and the [[American Lung Association]] to smaller state and community groups, such as the Maine Lobstermen’s Association and the [[Friends of the Everglades]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthjustice.org/about/clients_coalitions/ Earthjustice Clients and Coalitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthjustice is a nonprofit and does not charge any of its clients for its services. Funding for the organization comes from individual donations and foundations. It does not receive any funding from corporations or governments. As of 2017, Earthjustice had $94 million in total revenue&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthjustice.org/financial-statements/ Earthjustice Financial Statements]&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2018, Earthjustice has full-time staff of about 130 attorneys&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthjustice.org/about/staff?taxonomy_vocabulary_8_tid=78#view-results Earthjustice litigation staff]&lt;/ref&gt; in 14 offices across the United States, and 14 public-interest lobbyists&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthjustice.org/about/staff?taxonomy_vocabulary_8_tid=79#view-results Earthjustice Policy &amp; Legislation staff]&lt;/ref&gt; based in Washington, D.C.

== Programs ==
Earthjustice’s work is divided into three key goal areas:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthjustice.org/our_work/ Earthjustice: Our Work]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Wild'''&amp;nbsp;– focuses on cases in [[The Arctic]] to preserve the ecosystem from climate change and fossil fuel drilling; in the [[ocean]] ecosystem to protect from overfishing, pollution, and habitat loss; in the wild to preserve wild places and support [[biodiversity]]; and cases related to saving wildlife from extinction that are threatened by clear cutting, oil drilling, dams, dewatering streams, and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthjustice.org/the-wild]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Healthy Communities'''&amp;nbsp;– focuses on cases at the regional and national level that protect against pollution and toxic chemicals. Earthjustice uses litigation to apply and enforce the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] and the [[Clean Water Act]], and reform the toxics regulatory system. &lt;ref&gt;[https://earthjustice.org/healthy-communities]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Clean Energy and a Stable Climate'''&amp;nbsp;– focuses on cases that reduce the utilization of fossil fuels, eliminate barriers to and create incentives for the use of renewable energy sources, and cases that promote ecological resiliency to withstand warming global temperatures. Through litigation, Earthjustice establishes and enforces national regulation for coal ash waste, retires old coal-fired power plants, prevents coal exports, and stops coal mining. Cases in this key area also focus on preventing fracking, preventing oil and gas drilling on public lands, strengthening environmental and health protections, and preventing fossil fuel infrastructure investments. 


Earthjustice also partners with organizations from other regions, including Latin America, Russia, Japan, and China to promote the development of environmental law in their respective countries. Every year, Earthjustice submits a country-by-country report on Human Rights and the Environment to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthjustice.org/news/press/007/earthjustice-presents-2007-environmental-rights-report-to-un.html Earthjustice International Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on U.S. environmental law ==
Earthjustice has been a critical player in a number of important, precedent-setting cases regarding [[environmental protection]] in the United States.

In the 1972 Supreme Court case ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'', Earthjustice (then known as the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund) helped establish the right of citizens to sue for environmental damages. The case ultimately forced the [[Walt Disney Corporation]] to drop its plans to develop an enormous ski resort in the [[Mineral King]] valley in California’s [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] Range. The lawsuit blocked any further development or private use of the land which has since been incorporated into the [[Sequoia National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthjustice.org/features/ourwork/finally-the-valley-of-mineral-king-becomes-wilderness Finally -- The Valley of Mineral King Becomes Wilderness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815103235/http://www.earthjustice.org/features/ourwork/finally-the-valley-of-mineral-king-becomes-wilderness |date=2010-08-15 }}, EarthJustice&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Earthjustice (then known as the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund) filed a lawsuit to block the development of the [[New World Mining District|New World gold-silver-copper mine]] that was planned to be sited about four miles from the northeast entrance to [[Yellowstone National Park]].  The lawsuit was a victory in that the district judge ruled that not only could the subsidiary mining company (in this case Crown Butte Mines, Inc., a Montana company) who holds the mining claims and is developing the mine plan, but even the parent corporation (in this case Noranda Corporation, a Canadian company), could be held liable for violations of the Federal [[Clean Water Act]] (Ekey, 1997). &lt;ref&gt;https://scholarship.law.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1207&amp;context=plrlr, Accessed 04 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Earthjustice helped local community groups convince the [[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] to withdraw an approval to construct a [[uranium enrichment]] plant between two low-income, predominantly African-American communities near [[Homer, Louisiana]]. It was the first time a government agency had formally embraced the principle of 'environmental justice" in its decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthjustice.org/about_us/our_stories/louisiana-town-thwarts-nuclear-lynching.html Earthjustice: Uranium Enrichment Plant Stopped] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212084547/http://www.earthjustice.org/about_us/our_stories/louisiana-town-thwarts-nuclear-lynching.html |date=2008-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006 Supreme Court case, ''[[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]]'', Earthjustice attorneys helped a coalition of state governments and [[Conservation movement|conservation]] groups force the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to [[Climate change mitigation|fight global warming]] by limiting [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. It was the first Supreme Court case to ever address the issue of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthjustice.org/news/press/006/groups-states-file-opening-brief-in-supreme-court-global-warming-case.html Earthjustice: Massachusetts v. EPA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other suits have been less successful. In 2008 the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the US Navy in a suit brought in part by Earthjustice, which ordered Navy personnel to stop the use of certain types of [[sonar]] if a marine mammal such as a [[dolphin]] or [[whale]] was sighted within 2,200 yards. Among other details, the court noted that in 40 years of such sonar training there had not been a documented case of injury or death to a marine mammal that could be directly attributed to the sonar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-1239.pdf Winter vs. National Resources Defense Council] No. 07–1239., October term, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] rejected a suit against the EPA with the goal of banning the pesticide [[Chlorpyrifos]]. The court ruled that an environmental coalition, including Earthjustice, failed to follow procedure by filing the suit with the court before filing their appeal of a 2007 EPA ruling allowing the pesticide.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Cama (2017) [http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/342504-court-rejects-greens-appeal-of-epas-decision-not-to-ban-pesticide Court rejects greens’ appeal of EPA decision not to ban pesticide], TheHill.com; accessed 08 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Domel [http://texasfarmbureau.org/judge-denies-petition-ban-chlorpyrifos-pesticide/ Judge denies petition to ban chlorpyrifos pesticide], Texas Farm Bureau, 19 July 2017; accessed 08 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; But on August 9, 2018 the court ruled that chlorpyrifos must be banned within 60 days from that date&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/08/chlorpyrifos-insecticides-pesticides-epa-organophosphates/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
In 2010, Earthjustice launched a fundraising campaign using the location-based social networking app [[Foursquare]]. The ad campaign, which ran in billboards in San Francisco's [[BART]] system, gained national recognition as one of the first successful nonprofit uses of Foursquare, and was featured in media outlets such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Mashable]], and ''[[MacLife]]'' magazine, as well as books such as Carmine Gallo's ''The Power of Foursquare''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Todd | last = Woody | title = With Foursquare, Ads Let You Check In at Your Favorite Billboard | date = 19 October 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/business/media/20adco.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | accessdate = 28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van |first=Jennifer |url=http://mashable.com/2010/05/27/earthjustice-foursquare-posters/ |title=Non-Profit Uses Foursquare to Raise Environmental Awareness |publisher=Mashable.com |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delio, Michelle (January 2011).

==Recognition==
In 2001, ''[[Worth (magazine)|Worth]]'' magazine, aimed at high-income Americans, named Earthjustice as one of America’s 100 best charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FEATURE%2FWORTH+Magazine+Names+America's+100+Best+Charities+-+and...-a080391126 |title=WORTH Magazine Names America's 100 Best Charities - and Highlights 12 Worth Avoidng|publisher=Business Wire|date=29 November 2001|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2017|11}}, Earthjustice has a 4-star rating from [[Charity Navigator]], the oversight group's highest rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3638 |title=Earthjustice |publisher=Charity Navigator |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the organization was recognized for its tagline "Because the earth needs a good lawyer",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonprofit.about.com/od/nonprofitbranding/a/taglinesmissions.htm |title=Nonprofit Taglines and Mission Statements |author= Fritz, Joanne |publisher=Nonprofit.about.com |date= 6 December 2014 |accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was chosen in a 2009 online contest as one of the best nonprofit taglines out of 1,702 entries.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Earthjustice has come under criticism for actions that are described as radical or counterproductive. Kevin Mooney of the right-leaning [[Capital Research Center]] writes that Earthjustice has represented a wide range of clients and causes, ranging from those well within the political and scientific mainstream to "radical fringe groups with a reputation for outrageous claims and uncompromising positions."&lt;ref name=Mooney2009&gt;Kevin Mooney (2009). [https://capitalresearch.org/article/earthjustice-legal-defense-fund-how-environmentalism-weakens-u-s-national-security/  EarthJustice Legal Defense Fund: How Environmentalism Weakens U.S. National Security]; accessed 08 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Fargo, North Dakota]] columnist Rob Port has described Earthjustice as fundamentally "obstructionist" in their strategy against the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] during 2016.&lt;ref&gt;"Earthjustice isn’t out to promote safe, responsible oil and gas development, goals all reasonable people share. They don’t want a safe pipeline, ''per se''. Rather, they’re out to choke oil and gas development to death by obstructing [[energy infrastructure]] with legal maneuvering." Port, Rob (2016).

'''Francis Wharton''' ([[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], March 7, 1820 – February 21, 1889) was an [[United States|American]] legal writer and educationalist.
==Life==
He graduated at [[Yale]] in 1839, was admitted to the bar in 1843, became prominent in Pennsylvania politics as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], served as assistant attorney-general in 1845. In Philadelphia, he edited the ''North American and United States Gazette''. He was professor of English history and literature at [[Kenyon College]], [[Gambier, Ohio]], in 1856-1863.

He took orders in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Protestant Episcopal Church]] in 1862 and in 1863-1869 was rector of St. Paul's Church, [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. In 1871-1881 he taught ecclesiastical polity and canon law in the Protestant Episcopal Theological School at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and at this time he lectured on the conflict of laws at [[Boston University]].

For two years he traveled in Europe, and after two years in Philadelphia he went to [[Washington, DC]], where he was lecturer on criminal law (1885–1886) and then professor of [[criminal law]] (1886–1888) at [[George Washington University|Columbian (now George Washington) University]]; in 1885-1888 he was solicitor (or examiner of claims) of the [[Department of State]], and from 1888 until his death was employed on an edition (authorized by Congress) of the ''Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States'' (6 vols, 1889, ed. by [[John Bassett Moore]]), which superseded [[Jared Sparks]]'s compilation.

Wharton was a "[[broad church]]man" and was deeply interested in the [[hymnology]] of his church. Wharton was also interested in [[Christian apologetics]], and he wrote an essay on the relationship between apologetics and jurisprudence that was published in ''[[The Princeton Theological Review|The Princeton Review]]'' in 1878.  He received the degree of LL.D. from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1883, and was the foremost American authority on [[international law]]. He authored the doctrine in [[criminal law]] (Wharton's Rule of Concert of Action) that to form a [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] takes one more person than is necessary to commit the crime. (It takes two people to gamble. Therefore, two people gambling cannot be guilty of conspiracy to gamble. Three  can.)

The '''German Parliamentary Committee investigation of the NSA spying scandal''' (official title: ''1. Untersuchungsausschuss „NSA“'') was started on March 20, 2014, by the [[German Parliament]] in order to investigate the extent and background of foreign secret services spying in Germany in the light of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)]].
The Committee is also in search of strategies on how to protect telecommunication with technical means.&lt;ref&gt;http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/008/1800843.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Deutscher Bundestag]]: [http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/ausschuesse18/ua/1untersuchungsausschuss 1. Untersuchungsausschuss („NSA“)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The committee is formed by eight members of the German Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/ausschuesse18/ua/1untersuchungsausschuss/mitglieder/262992 Mitglieder des NSA-Untersuchungsausschusses], bundestag.de, accessed July 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentarian of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union (CDU)]] [[Clemens Binninger]] was head of the committee but stepped down after six days. In a statement, Binninger clarified that the other committee members had insisted on inviting Edward Snowden to testify; Binninger objected to this and resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2014/50515028_kw15_binninger/216908|title=Deutscher Bundestag - NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss: Binninger tritt vom Ausschussvorsitz zurück|author=Karl Otto Sattler|date=9 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-04/nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-binninger-ruecktritt NSA-Ausschussvorsitzender geht im Streit], Zeit.de, April 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Sensburg]] (CDU) succeeded him.

== Witnesses ==

=== Discussion about the witness Snowden ===
On May 8, 2014, the committee unanimously decided to let US whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] testify as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2014-05/sensburg-schlaegt-snowden-befragung-in-schweizer-botschaft-vor NSA-Ausschusschef will Snowden in Schweizer Botschaft befragen], zeit.de, May 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2014, the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]] and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] filed a constitutional complaint against the Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democrats and the NSA Parliamentary Committee because of the Christian Democrats' and the Social Democrats' refusal to let the witness Edward Snowden testify in Berlin. The accused proposed a video conference from Moscow which Snowden had refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/abhoer-affaere-opposition-klagt-wegen-snowden-vernehmung-in-krlsruhe-13175658.html ''Grüne und Linke klagen gegen NSA-Untersuchungsauss'', September 26, 2014].

On September 28, 2014, the Green Party and The Left filed a constitutional complaint against German chancellor Merkel. According to them, she refuses to comply with her duty according to Chapter 44 of the German constitution to ensure a real investigation; especially by refusing to ensure the legal requirements to allow the witness Edward Snowden to testify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-spaehaffaere-opposition-verklagt-merkel-wegen-snowden-a-994029.html|title=NSA Sphaffre: Opposition verklagt Merkel wegen Snowden  - SPIEGEL ONLINE|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=28 September 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testimony of Binney and Drake ===
On July 3, 2014, the former Technical Director of the NSA,  [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], who had become a whistleblower after the [[9/11|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], testified to the committee. He said that the NSA has a totalitarian approach that has previously only been known from dictatorships and that there is no longer such a thing as privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-9-11-hat-alles-veraendert.aeedf44b-6825-4583-a740-0c20c0bd723a.html|title=NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss: 9/11  hat alles verändert - Politik - Stuttgarter Zeitung|author=Stuttgarter Zeitung|location=Stuttgart, Germany|date=3 July 2014|work=stuttgarter-zeitung.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/william-binney-als-zeuge-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-a-979062.html Untersuchungsausschuss im Bundestag: US-Informant vergleicht NSA mit einer Diktatur], Der Spiegel, July 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Former NSA employee [[Thomas Andrews Drake]] described the close cooperation between the NSA and the German foreign intelligence service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst|BND]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/thomas-drake-im-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss-13027055.html Bundesnachrichtendienst „ein Wurmfortsatz der NSA“], FAZ July 4, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/ex-nsa-mitarbeiter-drake-bnd-unterstuetzte-drohnenkrieg-der-usa-a-979130.html|title=Ex-NSA-Mitarbeiter Drake: BND untersttzte Drohnenkrieg der USA|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=4 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failed testimony of Greenwald ===
The US journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] was asked to testify in September, 2014. On August 1, 2014, he wrote in a letter that he was willing to support the Parliament's investigation on the espionage in Germany by the NSA. By their refusal to let the crucial witness Edward Snowden testify, German politicians had however shown that it is more important to them not to annoy the US than to really investigate and he was not willing to take part in a "ritual" that "shall seem like an investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/glenn-greenwald-sagt-zeugenvernehmung-vor-nsa-ausschuss-ab-a-984030.html|title=Glenn Greenwald sagt Zeugenvernehmung vor NSA-Ausschuss ab|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=1 August 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://netzpolitik.org/2014/glenn-greenwald-sagt-untersuchungsausschuss-ab-ritual-das-die-illusion-einer-untersuchung-erwecken-soll|title=Glenn Greenwald sagt Untersuchungsausschuss ab: "Ritual, das die Illusion einer Untersuchung erwecken soll"|work=netzpolitik.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Eikonal selectors==
In [[Operation Eikonal]] German [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] agents received "Selector Lists" from the NSA − search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets.&lt;ref name=spiegel1&gt;{{cite web|title=Spying Close to Home: German Intelligence Under Fire for NSA Cooperation - SPIEGEL ONLINE - International|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-intelligence-agency-bnd-under-fire-for-nsa-cooperation-a-1030593.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the [[European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company]] (EADS), the [[Eurocopter]] project&lt;ref name="ts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/bnd-und-nsa-die-chronologie-des-spionageskandals/11722810.html|title=BND und NSA: Die Chronologie des Spionageskandals – Politik – Tagesspiegel|work=tagesspiegel.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as French administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/die-neue-bnd-affaere-ein-foul-mit-folgen-1.2448810|title=Wie die NSA europäische Unternehmen ausspionierte|work=Süddeutsche.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005.&lt;ref name="ts1" /&gt; Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/nsa-spitzelei-bnd-soll-12-000-suchbegriffe-geloescht-haben-13569002.html|title=NSA-Spitzelei: BND soll 12.000 Suchbegriffe gelöscht haben|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=1 May 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terror attacks]].&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt; After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]] and the [[Greens (Germany)|Greens]] filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht - BVerfG, Beschluss des Zweiten Senats vom 13. n|url=https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/DE/2016/10/es20161013_2bve000215.html|website=bundesverfassungsgericht.de|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigative Parliamentary Committee was set up in spring 2014 and reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated [[economic espionage]] directly under the Germans' noses.&lt;ref name=spiegel1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denkler|first1=Thorsten|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: NSA jubelte BND deutsche Spähziele unter|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/geheimdienst-affaere-nsa-jubelte-bnd-deutsche-spaehziele-unter-1.2715253|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, [[Kurt Graulich]], as a "person of trust" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German Constitutional Court rules out access to NSA's 'selectors' list|url=http://www.dw.com/en/german-constitutional-court-rules-out-access-to-nsas-selectors-list/a-36396385|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designierter NSA-Sonderermittler: Ein Mann, 40.000 brisante Daten|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-sonderermittler-kurt-graulich-ein-mann-40-000-datensaetze-a-1040661.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his almost 300-paged report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Graulich-Abschlussbericht|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/graulich-abschlussbericht-101.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz)]] − including numerous enterprises based in Germany − were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstaffäre: Sonderermittler spricht von klarem Vertragsbruch der NSA|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/nsa-selektorenliste-kurt-graulich-spricht-von-klarem-vertragsbruch-a-1060280.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the magnitude differs there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geheimdienstkontrolleure: BND hat gegen Recht und Auftrag verstoßen|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Geheimdienstkontrolleure-BND-hat-gegen-Recht-und-Auftrag-verstossen-3045627.html|publisher=Heise Online|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BND hat jahrelang unter Freunden spioniert|url=http://www.dw.com/de/bnd-hat-jahrelang-unter-freunden-spioniert/a-19393446|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Markus|title=Geheimdienst-Affäre: BND spitzelte mit eigenen Selektoren|url=http://www.fr-online.de/datenschutz/geheimdienst-affaere-bnd-spitzelte-mit-eigenen-selektoren,1472644,32163156.html|publisher=Frankfurter Rundschau|accessdate=4 January 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Klaus Landefeld]], member of the board at the Internet industry association Eco International, has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somaskanda|first1=Sumi|title=Is Big Brother coming to Germany?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/12/big-brother-coming-germany-161213062129779.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spying on the committee ==
On July 4, 2014, it was revealed to the public that BND agent Markus R. had been arrested on July 2, 2014, for apparently having spied. The 31-year-old German is accused of having worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].&lt;ref name="SZ_2032849"&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/neue-medienberichte-festgenommener-bnd-mann-spionierte-auch-fuer-die-cia-1.2032849 Medien: Festgenommener BND-Mann spionierte für CIA], Süddeutsche.de, July 6, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrest, the US ambassador [[John B.

It was revealed that the BND-agent had saved 218 secret BND documents on USB sticks since 2012 and sold them to US agents for a sum of 25,000 Euro in Salzburg, Austria. At least three of the documents were about the NSA Parliamentary Committee.&lt;ref name="SZ_2032849" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Festnahme-BND-Mitarbeiter-soll-NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss-ausspioniert-haben-2249652.html|title=Festnahme: BND-Mitarbeiter soll NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss ausspioniert haben|date=4 July 2014|work=heise online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] had mistaken him for a Russian spy and asked US colleagues to help uncover him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bnd-verfassungsschutz-wollte-agenten-mit-us-hilfe-enttarnen-a-979416.html|title=BND: Verfassungsschutz wollte Agenten mit US-Hilfe enttarnen|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=5 July 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2014, a second US spy was discovered, who worked for the Secretary of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/nsa-spionageaffaere-razzia-100.html|title=Durchsuchung in Berlin: Weiterer US-Spion enttarnt?|date=9 July 2014|work=tagesschau.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/ausweitung-der-geheimdienstaffaere-ermittlungen-gegen-us-spion-im-verteidigungsministerium-1.2038151|title=Zweiter US-Spion im Verteidigungsministerium|work=Süddeutsche.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 a Parliament technician found out that the mobile phone of [[Roderich Kiesewetter]], representative of the Christian Democratic Union in the committee, was spied on. Kiesewetter said there is evidence that all four Party representatives in the committee have been spied on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swr.de/landesschau-aktuell/bw/ulm/kiesewetter-offenbar-abgehoert/-/id=1612/did=13735756/nid=1612/1hqz7ou/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Document leaks ==
In the months following May 2015, [[Peter Pilz]], a member of the Austrian parliament for the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Green Party]], disclosed several documents and transcripts related to [[operation Eikonal]], in which NSA and BND cooperated for tapping transit cables at a facility of [[Deutsche Telekom]] in Frankfurt. These documents were highly sensitive and handed over to the committee for investigating the Eikonal operation. Therefore, it seems likely someone from the committee leaked these documents to Pilz. Among them are lists of communication channels from many European countries, including most of Germany's neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Electrospaces.net: [http://electrospaces.blogspot.nl/2015/11/unnoticed-leak-answers-and-raises.html Unnoticed leak answers and raises questions about operation Eikonal], November 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Pilz also discovered NSA spying facilities in Austria, and therefore wants a parliamentary committee on the NSA spying in his own country too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.format.at/articles/1430/930/376970/spionage-peter-pilz-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss|title=Spionage: Peter Pilz fordert einen NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss|author=news networld Internetservice GmbH|work=format.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2016, [[WikiLeaks]] released over 2,400 documents which it claims are from the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Uchill |first=Joe |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/308407-wikileaks-drops-docs-on-inquiry-into-nsa-german-cooperation |title=WikiLeaks publishes docs on inquiry into German cooperation with NSA |work=The Hill |date=December 1, 2016 |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gramercy Pictures''' is an American [[Production company|film production]] label of [[Universal Studios]]' [[Focus Features]] division, both of which are owned by [[NBCUniversal]] which is ultimately owned by [[Comcast]]. It was founded in May 1992 as a [[joint venture]] between [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] and [[Universal Pictures]]. Gramercy was the distributor of PolyGram films in the United States and Canada and also served as Universal's art-house division. After Seagram's buyout of PolyGram, Gramercy along with [[October Films]] were merged by [[Barry Diller]] to form [[USA Films]] in 1999. In 2015, Focus Features (the current art-house division for Universal) revived the name as a label for action, horror and sci-fi genre films.

==History==
Gramercy Pictures was formed in 1992 as a joint venture between PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Universal Pictures.&lt;ref name=dl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=Focus Features Revives Gramercy Pictures Label For Genre Films|url=http://deadline.com/2015/05/focus-features-revives-gramercy-pictures-label-genre-films-1201430500/|accessdate=May 20, 2015|publisher=deadline.com|date=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gramercy Pictures released its first film, the [[Mario Van Peebles]] western [[Posse (1993 film)|''Posse'']], in May 1993.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite journal|author=Staff|title=In Winner's Circle; Miramax's 'Crying Game' paces indies; New Line still running strong|date=August 17, 1993|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|quote=Off to an auspicious start is Gramercy Pictures, with its first release, 'Posse,' immediately making the chart [of largest rentals from independent distributors]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boxofficemojo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Box office information for ''Posse'' (1993) |last= |first= |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=posse.htm |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1996, PolyGram brought the 50% stake owned by Universal thus assuming full control of Gramercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/11/business/gramercy-sold-to-polygram.html|title=Gramercy Sold To Polygram|date=11 January 1996|work=Reuters|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distributor also had box office hits in 1994's ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', 1996's ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' and 1997's ''[[Bean (film)|Bean]]''. Several Gramercy releases of the 1990s have grown in stature to become [[cult classics]] in the present day: ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[Clay Pigeons]]'' and ''[[Mallrats]]''. In addition, 1995's ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' won two Oscars, for [[Best Original Screenplay]] ([[Christopher McQuarrie]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] ([[Kevin Spacey]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

When [[Seagram]] acquired [[PolyGram]] in 1998, the latter was merged and folded into Universal; as a result, it reacquired Gramercy as it controlled Universal. In turn, Seagram sold the bulk of the PolyGram film library titles released up until March 31, 1996 to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1999, and later on, it sold Gramercy and another specialty division, [[October Films]], to [[Barry Diller]]'s [[USA Network]]s, which merged both companies into [[USA Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aEJFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wLsMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6746,3385144&amp;dq=gramercy%20pictures%20barry%20diller&amp;hl=en|title=The Telegraph-Herald - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/28/business/fi-14956|title=Universal Adds Division for Specialty Films|first=JAMES|last=BATES|date=28 September 1999|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; USA Films was then merged with Universal's own art-house division, Universal Focus, and transformed into [[Focus Features]] in 2002 after [[Vivendi|Vivendi Universal]] acquired USA Networks from Diller.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In May 2015, [[Focus Features]] announced that the Gramercy label has been revived to release action, horror and sci-fi genre films. Its first outing was ''[[Insidious: Chapter 3]]'' on June 5, 2015.&lt;ref name=dl/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12503">The '''Honduras Truth and Reconciliation Commission''' (Comisión de la Verdad y la Reconciliación) began its work on May 4 2010 and submitted a final report in July 2011. The commission was created due to its inclusion as one of the measures in the “Accord for National Reconciliation and the Strengthening of Democracy in Honduras".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usip.org/publications/2012/02/truth-commission-honduras-2010|title=Truth Commission: Honduras 2010|website=United States Institute of Peace|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This agreement was created in response to the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état]] which took place on June 28, where military troops were involved in the removal of former president [[Manuel Zelaya]] from office, in response to the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-14072148|title=Removal of Zelaya 'Honduras coup'|date=2011-07-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The report itself collected a significant amount of information and testimonies from the public, and released a report detailing the abuses committed towards 20 of the victims. This report also criticized the role of several actors in the coup, such as de facto president [[Roberto Micheletti]], and presented a list of recommendations for the Honduran government.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.impunitywatch.org/docs/Victim_Participation_in_Honduras.pdf|title=Victim Participation in Honduras|last=|first=|date=|website=Impunity Watch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Background ==
On the morning of June 28 2009, military troops in [[Honduras]] stormed the house of president Manuel Zelaya, who had been in power since November 2005. These troops surrounded his residence, disarmed and beat his security guards, before arresting him and sending him on a plane to [[Costa Rica]] to live in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/28/honduras-coup-president-zelaya|title=Honduras president arrested in military coup|last=Press|first=Associated|date=2009-06-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

What sparked this event had been a disagreement in response to president Zelaya’s proposed changes to the constitution. One of the most controversial was a proposed removal of the presidential term limit, which many critics saw as a self-serving move to extend his own rule. When congress voted against this measure and tried to intervene, Zelaya refused to cancel the referendum, leading to congress ordering the removal of Zelaya from office.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Following the ousting of president Zelaya, there was further political conflict. Several dozen high ranking government officials including the foreign minister were all taken captive, and ambassadors from other countries which supported the Zelaya government were detained and beaten, however later released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2009/0629/p06s01-woam.html|title=Leftist leaders hold emergency meeting over Honduras coup|date=2009-06-29|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2018-11-26|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new military government also committed a range of crimes in the period succeeding including the killing of opposition activists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

== Commission ==

=== Establishment ===
On October 30 2009, the San Jose accords were agreed upon by representatives from each of Micheletti and Zelaya’s camps, in response to the military coup that had occurred, with the aim of ending the political turmoil and restoring a level of peace to the country. One of the key mandates was the creation of the CVR, or the Honduras Truth and Reconciliation Commission.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/demanding-the-truth-in-honduras/|title=Demanding the Truth in Honduras|last=Casas-Zamora|first=Kevin|date=19 April 2010|work=Brookings|access-date=26 November 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Whilst both parties would later go against the terms of the accord, essentially voiding it, the new president, [[Porfirio Lobo Sosa]], was elected shortly after on 29 November 2009, and he supported the contents of the accord with the backing of international actors such as the [[United States]]. The work of the new commission began in May 2010.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ccrjustice.org/home/get-involved/tools-resources/fact-sheets-and-faqs/struggle-truth-honduras-truth-and|title=The Struggle for Truth in Honduras: The Truth and Reconciliation Commission vs. the True Commission|website=Center for Constitutional Rights|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Mandate and structure ===
The commission was set to run for at least 8 months, with a likely end date of early 2011, but was later delayed until July.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=Craig M.|date=2011|title=A Perspective from Honduras' Civil Society Truth Commission|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1788572|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1788572|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission was funded by countries such as the [[United States]] and [[Spain]].'''&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hondurasculturepolitics.blogspot.com/2010/06/honduras-has-two-truth-commissions.html|title=Honduras Culture and Politics: Honduras has Two Truth Commissions|last=Rns|date=2010-06-22|website=Honduras Culture and Politics|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' President Lobo selected five members for the commission, which included two Hondurans, and three foreigners.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  

The first member selected was [[Eduardo Stein]], who was a former vice-president of [[Guatemala]], and was in charge of both writing the charter of and assisting in the picking of foreign candidates for the commission. The two other foreign members selected were [[Michael Kergin]], formerly a Canadian Ambassador in the United States, and [[María Zavala Valladares]], who was formerly a President of the Supreme Court in [[Peru]], and held other high ranking positions. The two Hondurans selected by Lobo were [[Omar casco|Omar Casco]] and [[Julieta Castellanos]], both of whom have served as Rector of the [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/TC%20factsheet%20final%203.22.pdf|title=The Struggle for Truth in Honduras|last=|first=|date=|website=Center for Constitutional Rights|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mandate of the commission was to “Clarify the events that occurred prior to and after June 28, 2009 in Honduras, with the goal of identifying the acts that led to the crisis situation and providing the people of Honduras with elements to prevent such incidents from recurring in the future".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  
=== Report and findings ===
The commission wrote the report using public information collected, reports by human rights organisations and the media, and testimonies from over 250 members of the public with knowledge of the violations committed. The final report, ''So That the Events Will Not Be Repeated'',&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; was presented by Eduardo Stein to President Lobo and other high ranking officials in July 2011.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The commission referenced Zelaya’s proposed changes and actions as key issues which caused the crisis, and that he had broken the law when he had ignored the urges of congress with regards to cancelling the referendum. The commission also said, however, that it was illegal for congress to have removed the president from office and appointed an interim president, Micheletti, in the meantime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It identified that what had occurred was a [[Coup d'état]] and identified that 20 people had been killed by the military government or actors following the coup, and detailed these violations. The commission also found that the police and army had obstructed investigations into some of the human rights violations, and attributed responsibility for the violations to several key actors including de facto President Micheletti.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The commission made a list with more than 80 total recommendations to the Honduran government, such as increasing political transparency, police reforms, and providing conditions which would ensure that human rights defenders could work free from harassment or obstruction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

This included seven key recommendations relating to human rights including the following:&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/412/FAAE/Reports/RP7904976/faaerp07/faaerp07-e.pdf|title=OVERCOMING VIOLENCE AND IMPUNITY: HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGES IN HONDURAS|last=|first=|date=|website=Parliament of Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*pursuing, prosecuting and punishing perpetrators of human rights abuses committed during the interim government;
*establishing a national plan of reparations for those having legitimate and verifiable human rights grievances;
*providing sufficient resources and independence to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, in order that it may respond promptly to human rights complaints;
*conducting an independent review of the actions of the human rights commissioner during the interim government;
*reviewing legislation to ensure that Honduran law is compatible with international norms and standards, particularly in relation to personal security related to freedom of expression – especially that of journalists – and freedom of association;
*guaranteeing that tribal and indigenous people have access to justice in their own language; and
*ensuring compliance with the [[International Labour Organization]] convention regarding the [[Duty to consult and accommodate|duty to consult]] about the use and exploitation of natural resources in aboriginal territories.

===Criticism===
There has been a mixed response to the commission. Much criticism has been levelled at the fact that there was no mandate to investigate human rights violations or abuses during or following the coup.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There has also been criticism for the members selected, none of whom had a significant background in human rights,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; the fact that several of the members hail from countries which were supportive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americasquarterly.org/node/1449|title=Honduras’ Truth Commission Controversy|website=www.americasquarterly.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into the large role that the international community played in forming the truth commission.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The distrust towards President Lobo also manifested itself into a general distrust towards the commission.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

== Aftermath ==
The report itself had limited impact on society in Honduras, due to factors such as the distrust for President Lobo, however, some groups welcomed the information presented and admittance of wrongdoing&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, and it was met by praise from Secretary General of the OAS, [[José Miguel Insulza]], who thought it would likely result in positive change for Honduran society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-755/11|title=OAS - Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development|last=OAS|date=2009-08-01|website=www.oas.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of October 2013, Honduras has reported to have complied with 32 of the recommendations, be in the process with complying with 37 more, and are yet to implement the final 17. Honduras, however, also reported that they had failed to prosecute and investigate those responsible for the violations during the coup.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

There have been reports that politically motivated attacks on opposition supporters have continued under President Lobo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/world/americas/05briefs-TRUTHCOMMISS_BRF.html|title=Honduras: Truth Commission to Study Coup|last=Malkin|first=Elisabeth|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative commission, the Comisión de Verdad (CDV) was set up by human rights groups due to many of the criticisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[File:Idel Jakobson.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Idel Jakobson''' (12 August 1904 in [[Jēkabpils]], [[Latvia]] – 12 September 1997 in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]) was a [[Jewish]] [[NKVD]] Officer. According to the materials of [[Kaitsepolitsei]], Jakobson took part in sentencing around 1,200 people to death and persecuting and torturing at least 1,800 people.&lt;ref name="Tundmatu sõjaroimar"&gt;[http://paber.ekspress.ee/arhiiv/Vanad/1996/44/magnet.html Tundmatu sõjaroimar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jakobson was at first a citizen of [[Latvia]], but moved to [[Estonia]] in 1930s. He participated in the activities of the Jewish cultural society ''[[Licht]]''. In 1931 he was arrested in [[Tallinn]], being accused of subversive activities directed against the Republic of Estonia.&lt;ref name="Tundmatu sõjaroimar"/&gt; In 1938, together with a number of other [[communist]]s, he was granted [[amnesty]] and deported to Latvia. He returned to Estonia after the [[Soviet occupation|June 1940 communist coup]] and became an investigator of the NKVD, since September 1940 leading the investigations' department of the NKVD of the [[Estonian SSR]]. Idel Jakobson was notorious for his sadistic methods (beatings, other methods of [[torture]]) during [[interrogation]]s.&lt;ref name="Tundmatu sõjaroimar"/&gt;

Jakobson fled Estonia in July, 1941, and worked as a chief investigator in [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. His 'investigations' were carried out in the framework of the so-called '[[Vyshinsky]] doctrine', in effect [[presumption of guilt]]:&lt;ref name="Massimõrvadest hingerahuni"&gt;[http://luup.postimees.ee:8080/leht/96/12/18/arvamus.htm#teine Massimõrvadest hingerahuni]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arhiiv2.postimees.ee:8080/htbin/2art?/leht/00/02/18/uudised.shtmXneljateistkymnes Suur jalutuskäik harmooniumi ja kahe kärbsega]&lt;/ref&gt; without a trial, he arranged a death sentence to 621 people.&lt;ref name="Massimõrvadest hingerahuni"/&gt; Most of his victims were ethnic [[Estonians]], including well-known politicians like [[Ado Birk]] and [[Jaan Hünerson]].&lt;ref name="Tundmatu sõjaroimar"/&gt; He returned to Estonia in 1944, working as the head of investigation department until 1950. He was expelled from [[CPSU]] in 1953 for having visited a private Jewish canteen and concealing that fact.

In 1990s, an investigation on I. Jakobson's activities during his NKVD 'career' was launched, but the case never reached the court, as Jakobson died.

'''Incapacitation''' in the context of [[Sentence (law)|criminal sentencing]] philosophy is the effect of a sentence in positively preventing (rather than merely [[Deterrence (legal)|deterring]]) future offending. One of the arguments for incapacitation is that unlike [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], it works on everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/first-step-backward/|title=FIRST STEP Backward|author=Kirsanow, Peter|date=30 November 2018|publisher=National Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

Imprisonment incapacitates prisoners by physically removing them from the society against which they are deemed to have offended or potentially may endanger. Long term imprisonment with the intention to incapacitate is often used by [[criminal justice system]]s against [[Habitual offender|habitual criminals]] who [[Recidivism|recidivate]] (relapse). Therefore, incapacitation focuses on removing the ability of the offenders to commit future crimes by use of imprisonment rather than focusing on rehabilitation or prevention.&lt;ref name="LevittUnderstandingWhyCrime2004.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/LevittUnderstandingWhyCrime2004.pdf|title=Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990s: Four Factors that Explain the Decline and Six that Do Not |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=18|number=1|date=Winter 2004|pages=163–190|author=Steven D. Levitt|doi=10.1257/089533004773563485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the prison system itself, [[Prison#Inmate_security_classifications|inmate security classifications]] are used to classify prisoners based on risk level and place them in an environment that will adequately incapacitate them from causing trouble.

Incarceration is not the only means of incapacitation; supervision can also sometimes serve that purpose.  Although parole and probation have long been justified as means of reintegrating offenders into the community, the trend has been for them to be increasingly perceived as cost-effective ways of imposing long-term management on the dangerous. In the federal system, the [[PROTECT Act]], for example, allowed for lifetime [[federal supervised release]] to be imposed on [[sex offender]]s, the implication being that they will never be rehabilitated to a level of risk comparable to that of the general population. From a standpoint of seeking to incapacitate those who pose a threat to the public, if a high-risk offender goes back to prison for a non-criminal violation of his conditions of release, this is actually a success rather than a failure, because he was incapacitated before he could commit another crime and get caught for it.

Unlike deterrence, rehabilitation, or restitution, incapacitation alters neither the offender nor his social context, but simply rearranges the distribution of offenders in society in such a way as to delay their resumption of crime, and thereby decrease the crime rate. According to Malcolm M. Feeley, "Incapacitation then is to penology what [[arbitrage]] is to investments, a method of capitalizing on minute displacements in time; and like arbitrage it has a diminished relationship to the normative goal of enhancing the value of its objects." Much as an investor analyzes the risk profiles of various investment opportunities so as to make choices that will have the best return, society seeks to identify high-risk offenders and invest in their long-term incarceration.&lt;ref name=newpenology&gt;{{cite journal|title=The New Penology: Notes on the Emerging Strategy of Corrections and Its Implications|volume=30|journal=Criminology|number=449|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==

In his 2004 article, [[Steven Levitt]] attributes part of the decline in the crime rate seen beginning in the mid-1990s to the inability of inmates to recidivate as sentences for crimes, especially for repeat offenders, had been greatly increased.&lt;ref name="LevittUnderstandingWhyCrime2004.pdf"/&gt; Examples of these laws include [[back-to-back life sentences]], [[Three-strikes law|three-strikes sentencing]], and other habitual offender laws. In the United States, {{usc|18|3553}} states that one of the purposes of criminal sentencing is to "protect the public from further crimes of the defendant". Quite simply, those incarcerated cannot commit further crimes against society.

Most of the justification for the continued high levels of those in prison in the United States is due to the incapacitation effect. In the 1970s, the strong emphasis on rehabilitation that had existed since the turn of the century gave way first to a focus on equality and fairness in sentencing, and then to an increased focus on incapacitation, deterrence and restraint strategies of crime prevention.&lt;ref&gt;Zimring, F. E., &amp; Hawkins, Gordon. (1995). Incapacitation: penal confinement and the restraint of crime. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the increase in the number of persons incarcerated has greatly increased due to the implementation of this concept. For the 30 years prior to 1974, the average number or persons incarcerated was 103 per 100,000. This number had climbed to 600 per 100,000 by 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Justice Statistics 1995. [https://web.archive.org/web/20171225223138/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ncot5m.pdf The nation's correctional population tops 5 million]. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics (NCJ-156432)&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013 the figure was 716 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Walmsley (November 21, 2013). [http://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/wppl_10.pdf World Prison Population List (tenth edition)]. ''[[International Centre for Prison Studies]].'' Retrieved July 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of incapacitation often has the unintended effect of incarceration of inmates' families.&lt;ref&gt;Clear, T. R. (1996). [https://web.archive.org/web/20171225223339/http://archive.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/uci.pdf The Unintended Consequences of Incarceration]. Paper presented at the NIJ workshop on corrections research, Feb. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKenzie found that incapacitating offenders who continue to commit crimes at high rates is effective, it works best as a part of a multi-tiered approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/works/chapter9.htm|title=Chapter 9|publisher=|author=Doris Layton MacKenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the effects of incarceration on the families and children of the inmate may be increasing the likelihood of future criminal activities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncsl.org/documents/cyf/childrenofincarceratedparents.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===United States===

The crime rate in the United States unexpectedly fell sharply in the 1990s, in almost all demographic and geographic areas, and a portion  of the drop has been attributed to the incapacitation effect. Beginning in the mid-1990s, sentences began to lengthen due to habitual felon statutes being passed in many states as well as changes in sentencing statutes which reduced the credit inmates could amass to reduce the amount of time they were held in prison.&lt;ref name="LevittUnderstandingWhyCrime2004.pdf"/&gt;

Recidivism remains a problem in the United States, where according to a 2005 Bureau of Justice Statistics rates of recidivism average around 67.5%, although this number is heavily dependent on the type of crime when applied to specific cases. The rate of recidivism has increased since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/reentry/recidivism.cfm|title=Reentry Trends In The U.S.|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the cost to incarcerate inmates continues to rise, which has led states to release inmates before the end of their assigned term, such as in North Carolina's advanced supervisory release program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccriminallaw.sog.unc.edu/advanced-supervised-release/|title=Advanced Supervised Release|date=September 22, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance between the cost of incarceration and the reduction in crime due to the incapacitation effect remains difficult to make decisions on and problematic for politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csgjusticecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JRinNCThreeYearsLater.pdf|title=Justice Reinvestment in North Carolina: Three Years Later|date=November 2014|publisher=Justice Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a similar problem was noted in North Carolina, where a court-ordered reduction in student suspensions appears to be linked in an increase in on-campus crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article12603905.html|title=Fewer kids suspended in Wake, reported school crime up|work=The News&amp;Observer|date=March 5, 2015|author=T. Keung Hui}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
A similar drop in crime was noted in Australia, where the marked increase in the prison population was termed a "very blunt instrument of crime control but it is an important instrument, nonetheless."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weatherburn|first=Don|last2=Hua|first2=Jiuzhao|last3=Moffatt|first3=Steve|date=January 2006|title=How much crime does prison stop--the incapacitation effect of prison on burglary|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225223841/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7027/0ef9e08f1f04695ec861e0636adda6a0549b.pdf|journal=NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research|issue=93|pages=1-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper further states that achieving a 10 percent reduction in the 2006 burglary rate an increase imprisonment of 34 percent would be needed. Doing so would increase cost by an additional $26 million per year. Further research was recommended as to the cost-effectiveness of this method of controlling crime.

===Elsewhere===
[[Amputation#Legal punishment|Cutting off a hand of a thief]] is also an example; this acts to prevent further thefts in a drastic manner, in addition to it having a perceived [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] effect on others.

==Criticism==
One criticism of incapacitation is that it focuses on predictions of dangerousness rather than on the rights of the accused. For example, incapacitation theory might advocate [[pretrial detention]] of a defendant who has not yet been proven guilty. His guilt or innocence of the particular crime he is charged with might have limited relevance to the issue of whether his pretrial detention would serve the goal of protecting the public from future crimes he might commit. The legitimacy of detaining the accused pursuant to the [[Bail Reform Act of 1984]] was upheld in ''[[United States v. Salerno]]''.&lt;ref name=newpenology/&gt;

Another criticism of incapacitation is that, if a prisoner is to be eventually released from prison, then his incarceration could be criminogenic, since offenders are more likely to commit a crime after release from prison than previous to incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Penological crisis in America: Finding meaning in imprisonment post-rehabilitation|author=Brown, Michelle|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incapacitation theories have been criticized for punishing offenders more harshly than would be justified by their culpability and blameworthiness for the offense of conviction. They also may not adequately take into account offenders' potential for rehabilitation. For example, Virginia's sentencing guidelines penalized offenders for being younger than twenty, unmarried, unemployed, or male, even though traditionally youth had been regarded as a [[mitigating factor|mitigating]] rather than an [[aggravating factor|aggravating circumstance]].&lt;ref name=retrospective&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1893&amp;context=journal_articles|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Indicazione geografica tipica''''' is the third of four classifications of [[wine]] recognized by the government of [[Italy]]. Created to recognize the unusually high quality of the class of wines known as [[Italian wine#Super Tuscans|Super Tuscans]], IGT wines are labeled with the locality of their creation, but do not meet the requirements of the stricter [[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]] or [[Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita|DOCG]] designations, which are generally intended to protect traditional wine formulations such as [[Chianti]] or [[Barolo]]. It is considered broadly equivalent to the French [[vin de pays]] designation. French wines will state ''Vin de pays'' on the label in place of ''Indicazione geografica tipica''. This classification is seen to be a higher quality wine above wine that is Vino da Tavola or [[table wine]].

The '''International Convention against Doping in Sport''' is a [[Multilateral treaty|multilateral]] [[UNESCO]] [[treaty]] by which states agree to adopt national measures to prevent and eliminate [[doping in sport|drug doping in sport]].

==Content==
States that agree to the Convention align their domestic rules with the World Anti-Doping Code, which is promulgated by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]]. This includes facilitating doping controls and supporting national [[Drug test|testing programmes]]; encouraging the establishment of "best practice" in the labelling, marketing, and distribution of products that might contain prohibited substances; withholding financial support from those who engage in or support doping; taking measures against manufacturing and trafficking; encouraging the establishment of codes of conduct for professions relating to sport and anti-doping; and funding education and research on drugs in sport.

==Creation and state parties==
The Convention was adopted at the General Conference of UNESCO in [[Paris]] on 19 October 2005. It entered into force on 1 February 2007 after it had been ratified by 30 state parties. As of February 2018, the Convention has been ratified by 187 states, which includes 185 [[UN member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]] and [[State of Palestine]].&lt;ref name = ratification/&gt; The following eight UN members are states that are ''not'' parties to the Convention:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2762">The '''International Tribunal on Crimes against Women''' was a people's tribunal which took place on March 4–8, 1976 in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"&gt;Doughty, Frances. ''lesbians and International Women's Year: A Report on Three Conferences'', in ''Our Right to Love: A Lesbian Resource Book'', Ginny Vida, Prentice Hall, 1978, {{ISBN|0-13-644401-6}}, p148&lt;/ref&gt; The event was created with the intention to "make public the full range of crimes, both violently brutal and subtly discriminatory, committed against women of all cultures."&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"/&gt;

==History==
[[Diana E. H. Russell]] and Nicole Van Den Ven, the main organizers of the tribunal,&lt;ref name="Chesler, Phyllis 1996, p14"&gt;Chesler, Phyllis. ''Rape as a War Crime: Reaching Moral Clarity'', ''On the Issues'', May 1996, p14&lt;/ref&gt; were inspired by [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[International War Crimes Tribunal]], a people's tribunal on crimes committed in the [[Vietnam War]].

==Content==
The ITCW  was attended by over 2000 women from 40 countries, and specific topics include medical and economic crimes, [[rape]], [[political prisoner]]s, crimes against [[lesbians]], [[spousal abuse]], [[prostitution]], [[pornography]] and [[femicide]].&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesler, Phyllis 1996, p14"/&gt;

Numerous testimonies were provided in writing by women who were unable to attend the tribunal.&lt;ref name="Doughty, Frances 1978, p148"/&gt;

Attendee Frances Doughty noted that the Tribunal confirmed for her that "the oppression of women in general and of lesbians in particular is truly worldwide"&lt;ref&gt;Doughty, Frances. ''lesbians and International Women's Year: A Report on Three Conferences'', in ''Our Right to Love: A Lesbian Resource Book'', Ginny Vida, Prentice Hall, 1978, {{ISBN|0-13-644401-6}}, p149&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian poet [[Pat Parker]] was among the contributors of testimony, speaking about her eldest sister, who was murdered by her husband.&lt;ref name="ilene-alexander"&gt;[http://voices.cla.umn.edu/vg/Bios/entries/parker_pat.html Alexander, Ilene 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] march took place as a candlelight procession in association with the Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dso.uncc.edu/women/TBN_Web/history.html Take Back the Night History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Organizers Russell and Van Den Ven published a book based on the Tribunal, ''Crimes Against Women: Proceedings of the International Tribunal'' later in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dianarussell.com/publications.html#CRIMESAGAINSTWOMEN dianarussell.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9747">"International economic law" is an increasingly seminal field of [[international law]] that involves the regulation and conduct of states, international organizations, and private firms operating in the international economic arena.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University Law School: International economic law https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/international_economic_law; Warwick University School of Law http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/applying/postgraduate/llm/iel/; University of Edinburgh Law School http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/teaching/postgraduate/llm_msc/international_economic_law/programme_overview&lt;/ref&gt; As such, '''international economic law''' encompasses a broad range of disciplines touching on [[public international law]],&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, International Economic Law, University of London http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/sites/default/files/international_economic_law.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[private international law]],&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, International Economic Law, University of London http://www.londoninternational.ac.uk/sites/default/files/international_economic_law.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and domestic law applicable to international business transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Tufts http://fletcher.tufts.edu/Academic/Courses/Fields-of-Study/International-Business-and-Economic-Law&lt;/ref&gt;

For several decades, international economic law was most often associated with international trade, largely due to the fact that trade had developed the most mature multilateral legal institutions (e.g. the GATT and later WTO) for governing international commerce.  Today, however, a range of disciplines are routinely acknowledged as being as impactful and relevant to the field, including:
* International monetary law;
* International [[financial regulation]] (including banking, derivatives, insurance and securities regulation);
* [[International development]];
* International labor and services law;
* International investment law, including international commercial arbitration;&lt;ref&gt;[[International arbitration]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* International intellectual property law;
* International tax law;
* [[International environmental law]];
* [[Sovereign debt]] and restructuring.

Because of the breadth of international economic activities and transactions, international economic law is a highly interdisciplinary field of study.  Decisions in one area, such as tax or financial regulation, can impact the transmission of monetary policy, which can, in turn, impact the effectiveness or operation of a trade regime, and vice versa.  Consequently, a wide range of notable governmental and intergovernmental organizations are involved in formulating international economic law and policy.  Among the most important are:
* National finance ministries, trade officials, and financial market supervisors;
* Multilateral institutions including the [[IMF]], [[WTO]], [[Bank for International Settlements]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[World Bank]], [[EU]], [[ILO]], [[United Nations]], and [[European Commission]];&lt;ref&gt;Georgetown University Law Center Institute of International Economic Law http://iielaw.org/about-2/&lt;/ref&gt;
* “Minilateral” institutions associated with regional and bilateral trade, IP, financial regulatory accords, and other targeted diplomatic efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Minilateralism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following research popularized in the 1990s by scholars in international law, [[political science]], [[international relations]], and [[commercial law]], academic institutions have become increasingly engaged in the study of the international economic law.

The '''law of agency''' is an area of [[commercial law]] dealing with a set of [[contract]]ual, [[quasi-contract]]ual and non-contractual [[fiduciary]] relationships that involve a person, called the '''agent''', that is authorized to act on behalf of another (called the [[principal (commercial law)|principal]]) to create legal relations with a third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.trans-lex.org/911000 |work=Trans-Lex.org |title=Document-Id: 911000|quote=Restatement of Agency (Second) §&amp;nbsp;1. Agency; Principal; Agent. "(1) Agency is the fiduciary relation which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his or her behalf and subject to her control, and consent by the other so to act. (2) The one for whom action is to be taken is the principal. (3) The one who is to act is the agent."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Succinctly, it may be referred to as the equal relationship between a principal and an agent whereby the principal, expressly or implicitly, authorizes the agent to work under his or her control and on his or her behalf. The agent is, thus, required to negotiate on behalf of the principal or bring him or her and third parties into contractual relationship. This branch of law separates and regulates the relationships between:
* agents and principals (internal relationship), known as the principal-agent relationship;
* agents and the third parties with whom they deal on their principals' behalf (external relationship); and
* principals and the third parties when the agents deal.

In India, section 182 of the [[Indian Contract Act 1872|Contract Act 1872]] defines Agent as “a person employed to do any act for another or to represent another in dealings with third persons”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.trans-lex.org/911000 |work=Trans-Lex.org |title=Document-Id: 911000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

The reciprocal rights and liabilities between a principal and an agent reflect commercial and legal realities. A business owner often relies on an [[employee]] or another person to conduct a business. In the case of a corporation, since a [[corporation]] can only act through [[Natural person]] agents. The principal is bound by the contract entered into by the agent, so long as the agent performs within the scope of the agency.

A third party may rely in good faith on the representation by a person who identifies himself as an agent for another. It is not always cost effective to check whether someone who is represented as having the authority to act for another actually has such authority. If it is subsequently found that the alleged agent was acting without necessary authority, the agent will generally be held liable.

== Brief statement of legal principles ==

{{Citation needed span|text=There are three broad classes of agent:|date=April 2017|reason=}}

# Universal agents hold broad authority to act on behalf of the principal, e.g. they may hold a [[power of attorney]] (also known as a [[wikt:mandate|mandate]] in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s) or have a professional relationship, say, as [[lawyer]] and client.
# General agents hold a more limited authority to conduct a series of transactions over a continuous period of time; and
# Special agents are authorized to conduct either only a single transaction or a specified series of transactions over a limited period of time.

== Authority ==

An agent who acts within the scope of authority conferred by his or her principal binds the principal in the obligations he or she creates against third parties. There are essentially three kinds of authority recognized in the law: actual authority (whether express or implied), apparent authority, and ratified authority (explained [[Apparent authority#Ratification|here]]).

=== Actual authority ===

{{Main|Actual authority}}
Actual authority can be of two kinds. Either the principal may have expressly conferred authority on the agent, or authority may be implied. Authority arises by consensual agreement, and whether it exists is a question of fact. An agent, as a general rule, is only entitled to indemnity from the principal if he or she has acted within the scope of her actual authority, and may be in breach of contract, and liable to a third party for breach of the implied warranty of authority. In tort, a claimant may not recover from the principal unless the agent is acting within the scope of employment.

==== Express actual authority ====
Express actual authority means an agent has been expressly told he or she may act on behalf of a principal.

==== Implied actual authority ====
Implied actual authority, also called "usual authority", is authority an agent has by virtue of being reasonably necessary to carry out his express authority. As such, it can be inferred by virtue of a position held by an agent. For example, partners have authority to bind the other partners in the firm, their liability being joint and several, and in a corporation, all executives and senior employees with decision-making authority by virtue of their position have authority to bind the corporation.
Other forms of implied actual authority include customary authority. This is where customs of a trade imply the agent to have certain powers. In wool buying industries it is customary for traders to purchase in their own names.&lt;ref&gt;Cropper v Cook 1867&lt;/ref&gt;
Also incidental authority, where an agent is supposed to have any authority to complete other tasks which are necessary and incidental to completing the express actual authority. This must be no more than necessary&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum v Belson 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apparent authority ===

{{Main|Apparent authority|Estoppel}}
Apparent authority (also called "ostensible authority") exists where the principal's words or conduct would lead a reasonable person in the third party's position to believe that the agent was authorized to act, even if the principal and the purported agent had never discussed such a relationship. For example, where one person appoints a person to a position which carries with it agency-like powers, those who know of the appointment are entitled to assume that there is apparent authority to do the things ordinarily entrusted to one occupying such a position. If a principal creates the impression that an agent is authorized but there is no actual authority, third parties are protected so long as they have acted reasonably. This is sometimes termed "agency by [[estoppel]]" or the "doctrine of holding out", where the principal will be estopped from denying the grant of authority if third parties have changed their positions to their detriment in reliance on the representations made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.trans-lex.org/911000 |work=Trans-Lex.org |title=Document-Id: 911000 |quote=Restatement of Agency (Second)§&amp;nbsp;27: "Except for the execution of instruments under seal or for the conduct of transactions required by statute to be authorized in a particular way, apparent authority to do an act is created as to a third person by written or spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the third person to believe that the principal consents to have the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Rama Corporation Ltd v Proved Tin and General Investments Ltd]]'' [1952] 2 QB 147, Slade J, "Ostensible or apparent authority... is merely a form of estoppel, indeed, it has been termed agency by estoppel and you cannot call in aid an estoppel unless you have three ingredients: (i) a representation, (ii) reliance on the representation, and (iii) an alteration of your position resulting from such reliance."

==== ''Watteau v Fenwick'' in the UK ====

In the case of ''[[Watteau v Fenwick]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1893] 1 QB 346&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Coleridge CJ on the Queen's Bench concurred with an opinion by Wills J that a third party could hold personally liable a principal who he did not know about when he sold cigars to an agent that was acting outside of its authority. Wills J held that "the principal is liable for all the acts of the agent which are within the authority usually confided to an agent of that character, notwithstanding limitations, as between the principal and the agent, put upon that authority." This decision is heavily criticised and doubted,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. GHL Fridman, 'The Demise of Watteau v Fenwick: Sign-O-Lite Ltd v Metropolitan Life Insurance Co' (1991) 70 [[Canadian Bar Association|Canadian Bar]] Review 329&lt;/ref&gt; though not entirely overruled in the UK. It is sometimes referred to as "usual authority" (though not in the sense used by Lord Denning MR in ''Hely-Hutchinson'', where it is synonymous with "implied actual authority"). It has been explained as a form of apparent authority, or "inherent agency power".

Authority by virtue of a position held to deter fraud and other harms that may befall individuals dealing with agents, there is a concept of Inherent Agency power, which is power derived solely by virtue of the agency relation.&lt;ref&gt;Restatement of Agency (Second) §&amp;nbsp;8A. Inherent Agency Power. "Inherent agency power is a term used in the restatement of this subject to indicate the power of an agent which is derived not from authority, apparent authority or estoppel, but solely from the agency relation and exists for the protection of persons harmed by or dealing with a servant or other agent."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[partnership|partners]] have apparent authority to bind the other partners in the firm, their liability being [[joint and several liability|joint and several]] (see below), and in a [[corporation]], all executives and senior employees with decision-making authority by virtue of their declared position have apparent authority to bind the corporation.

Even if the agent does act without authority, the principal may ratify the transaction and accept liability on the transactions as negotiated. This may be express or implied from the principal's behavior, e.g. if the agent has purported to act in a number of situations and the principal has knowingly acquiesced, the failure to notify all concerned of the agent's lack of authority is an implied ratification to those transactions and an implied grant of authority for future transactions of a similar nature.

== Liability ==

=== Liability of agent to third party ===

If the agent has actual or apparent authority, the agent will not be liable for acts performed within the scope of such authority, as long as the relationship of the agency and the identity of the principal have been disclosed. When the agency is undisclosed or partially disclosed, however, both the agent and the principal are liable. Where the principal is not bound because the agent has no actual or apparent authority, the purported agent is liable to the third party for breach of the implied warranty of.

=== Liability of agent to principal ===

If the agent has acted without actual authority, but the principal is nevertheless bound because the agent had apparent authority, the agent is liable to indemnify the principal for any resulting loss or damage.

=== Liability of principal to agent ===

If the agent has acted within the scope of the actual authority given, the principal must indemnify the agent for payments made during the course of the relationship whether the expenditure was expressly authorized or merely necessary in promoting the principal's business.

== Duties ==

An agent owes the principal a number of duties. These include:
* a duty to undertake the task or tasks specified by the terms of the agency;
* a duty to discharge his duties with care and due diligence;

An agent must not accept any new obligations that are inconsistent with the duties owed to the principal. An agent can represent the interests of more than one principal, conflicting or potentially conflicting, only after full disclosure and consent of the principal. An agent must not usurp an opportunity from the principal by taking it for himself or passing it on to a third party.

In return, the principal must make a full disclosure of all information relevant to the transactions that the agent is authorized to negotiate.

== Termination ==
Mutual agreement also through the principal responding his authority.
Through renouncing when agent  hm self stop being an agent.when principal revoke.

The internal agency relationship may be dissolved by agreement. Under sections 201 to 210 of the [[Indian Contract Act 1872]], an agency may come to an end in a variety of ways:

# Withdrawal by the agent – however, the principal cannot revoke an agency coupled with interest to the prejudice of such interest. An agency is coupled with interest when the agent himself has an interest in the subject-matter of the agency, e.g., where the goods are consigned by an upcountry constituent to a commission agent for sale, with poor to recoup himself from the sale proceeds, the advances made by him to the principal against the security of the goods; in such a case, the principal cannot revoke the agent’s authority till the goods are actually sold and debts satisfied, nor is the agency terminated by death or insanity (illustrations to s. 201);
# By the agent renouncing the business of agency;
# By discharge of the contractual agency obligations.

Alternatively, agency may be terminated by operation of law:
# By the death of either party;
# By the insanity of either party;
# By the [[bankruptcy]] (insolvency) of either party;

The principal also cannot revoke the agent’s authority after it has been partly exercised, so as to bind the principal (s. 204), though he can always do so, before such authority has been so exercised (s. 203). Further, under s. 205, if the agency is for a fixed period, the principal cannot terminate the agency before the time expired, except for sufficient cause. If he does, he is liable to compensate the agent for the loss caused to him thereby. The same rules apply where the agent, renounces an agency for a fixed period. Notice in this connection that want of skill, continuous disobedience of lawful orders, and rude or insulting behavior has been held to be sufficient cause for dismissal of an agent. Further, reasonable notice has to be given by one party to the other; otherwise, damage resulting from want of such notice, will have to be paid (s. 206). Under s. 207, the revocation or renunciation of an agency may be made expressly or implicitly by conduct. The termination does not take effect as regards the agent, till it becomes known to him and as regards third party, till the termination is known to them (s. 208).

When an agent’s authority is terminated, it operates as a termination of subagent also (s. 210).&lt;ref&gt;Pandia – Principles of Mercantile Law, 8th edition, by Ramkrishna R. Vyas.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships and Companies ==
This has become a more difficult area as states are not consistent on the nature of a partnership. Some states opt for the partnership as no more than an aggregate of the [[natural person]]s who have joined the firm. Others treat the partnership as a [[business entity]] and, like a [[corporation]], vest the partnership with a separate legal personality. Hence, for example, in [[English law]], a partner is the agent of the other partners whereas, in [[Scots law]] where there is a separate personality, a partner is the agent of the partnership. This form of agency is inherent in the status of a partner and does not arise out of a contract of agency with a principal.  The English [[Partnership Act 1890]] provides that a partner who acts within the scope of his actual authority (express or implied) will bind the partnership when he does anything in the ordinary course of carrying on partnership business. Even if that implied authority has been revoked or limited, the partner will have apparent authority unless the third party knows that the authority has been compromised. Hence, if the partnership wishes to limit any partner's authority, it must give express notice of the limitation to the world. However, there would be little substantive difference if English law was amended:&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalarchives.gov.uk-webarchive.info/-/www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/lc283.pdf Law Commission Report 283 (Archived)]&lt;/ref&gt; partners will bind the partnership rather than their fellow partners individually. For these purposes, the knowledge of the partner acting will be [[imputation (law)|imputed]] to the other partners or the firm if a separate personality. The other partners or the firm are the principal and third parties are entitled to assume that the principal has been informed of all relevant information. This causes problems when one partner acts fraudulently or [[negligence|negligently]] and causes loss to clients of the firm. In most states, a distinction is drawn between knowledge of the firm's general business activities and the confidential affairs as they affect one client. Thus, there is no imputation if the partner is acting against the interests of the firm as a fraud. There is more likely to be liability in [[tort]] if the partnership benefited by receiving fee income for the work negligently performed, even if only as an aspect of the standard provisions of vicarious liability. Whether the injured party wishes to sue the partnership or the individual partners is usually a matter for the plaintiff since, in most jurisdictions, their liability is [[joint and several liability|joint and several]].

== Agency relationships ==
Agency relationships are common in many [[profession]]al areas.
* [[employment]].
* [[financial advisor|financial advice]] (insurance agency, [[brokerage firm|stock brokerage]], [[accountancy]])
* contract negotiation and [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] ([[business management]]) such as for [[publishing]], [[fashion model]], [[music]], [[movies]], [[theatre]], [[show business]], and [[sport]].

An ''agent'' in [[commercial law]] (also referred to as a ''manager'') is a person who is authorized to act on behalf of another (called the [[principal (commercial law)|''principal'']] or ''client'') to create a legal relationship with a third party.

=== Agency relationship in a real estate transaction ===
[[Real estate]] transactions refer to [[real estate broker]]age, and [[mortgage broker]]age. In real estate brokerage, the buyers or sellers are the principals themselves and the broker or his salesperson who represents each principal is his agent.

== Applications in jurisdictions ==

=== In English law ===
{{Main|Agency in English law}}
Agency law in the United Kingdom is a component of [[UK commercial law]], and forms a core set of rules necessary for the smooth functioning of business. Agency law is primarily governed by the Common law and to a lesser extent by statutory instruments.

In 1986, the European Communities enacted Directive 86/653/EEC on self-employed commercial agents. In the UK, this was implemented into national law in the Commercial Agents Regulations 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|author=Andrea Tosato|title=An exploration of the European dimension of the Commercial Agents Regulations|year=2010|url=http://www.i-law.com/ilaw/doc/view.htm?id=330056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, agent and principals in a commercial agency relationship are subject both to the Common law and the Commercial Agents Regulations.

The Commercial Agents Regulations require agents to act “dutifully and in good faith” in performing their activities (Reg. 3); co-extensively, principals are required principals to act “dutifully and in good faith” in their “relations” with their commercial agents (Reg 4). Though there is no statutory definition of this obligation to act “dutifully and in good faith”, it has been suggested that it requires principals and agents to act "with honesty, openness and regard for the interests of the other party to the transaction". Two "normative precepts"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tosato|first=Andrea|date=2016-09-01|title=Commercial Agency and the Duty to Act in Good Faith|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ojls/gqv040|journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=661–695|doi=10.1093/ojls/gqv040|issn=0143-6503}}&lt;/ref&gt; assist in concretising this standard of conduct:

"Firstly, expressing honesty and openness, commercial agents and principals must mutually co-operate in the performance of their agreement. Conduct in good faith requires that each party proactively take action to assist the other in the realisation of their bargain, as opposed to mere abstention from obstructive behaviour. However, whether a party has acted in good faith must not be determined by reference to a moral or metaphysical notion of co-operation; this assessment must be based on an objective appraisal of the actual commercial agency relationship. Accordingly, the intensity of the required co-operation will vary, depending on the terms of the contract and the pertinent commercial practices.

Secondly, commercial agents and principals must not exploit asymmetries in their agency relationship in such a manner that frustrates the legitimate expectations of the other party. In this respect, whether a conduct is in breach of the Obligation must be appraised holistically, considering all aspects of the relationship; material facts will include the contractual and commercial leverage of each party, their objective intentions as enshrined in the contract, and the business practices of the sector in question. Nevertheless, the starting axiom of this investigation must be that these are commercial relationships in which professionals are expected to be self-reliant and must be free to pursue their self-interest. Critically, this will not be an estimation aimed at achieving ontological fairness, a just bargain or equilibrium between the giving and receiving of commercial agents and principals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tosato|first=Andrea|date=2016-09-01|title=Commercial Agency and the Duty to Act in Good Faith|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ojls/gqv040|journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=661–695|doi=10.1093/ojls/gqv040|issn=0143-6503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lawrence Wollersheim.jpg|frame|Wollersheim]]
'''Lawrence Dominick Wollersheim''' has been an active director of several specialized non-profit organizations since 2002.

He has worked with others to help to develop the concepts and practices of "Sustainable Prosperity," "the Universe Evolutionary Worldview," "Evolution Spirituality," "Progressive Evolution," the "Universe Principles of Sustainability" and "Job One for Humanity Climate Restabilization Plan." The Job One plan is a meta-systemic, long-term plan for mitigating global warming and climate destabilization. Much of his current work for these organizations is focused on how to apply the scientific principles of universe-scale evolution to our daily lives and to resolve our biggest global challenges.

Wollersheim is also a former [[List of Scientologists|Scientologist]]. He sued the [[Church of Scientology]] in 1980. The story of [[Xenu]] was made public when Church materials detailing the [[Operating Thetan]] [[OT III|Level 3]] were used as exhibits. In Wollersheim's court case Scientology's "top secret" materials about Xenu and their beliefs in past alien invasions of Earth was filed with the LA court on his behalf and then copied from court records and published by media all over the world.

Wollersheim helped co-found Factnet.org in 1993 to help other victims of cult abuse. Currently he is still a director of Factnet. 

==Legal actions==

In 1986, a jury awarded Wollersheim $5 million in compensatory damages and $25 million in [[punitive damages]] for what jurors called [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|intentional]] and [[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|negligent "infliction of emotional distress]]." On appeal this was reduced to $2.5 million.&lt;ref name=ws&gt;[[s:Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology]]&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology officials vowed never to pay, and the phrase "not one thin dime for Wollersheim," was chanted by Scientologists at court hearings.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A63143-2002May9&amp;notFound=true Ex-Scientologist Collects $8.7 Million In 22-Year-Old Case], Richard Leiby, ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 10, 2002; P. A03.&lt;/ref&gt; The church challenged the $2.5 million award, but the case was dismissed and Wollersheim was awarded an additional $130,506.71 in attorney's fees.&lt;ref name=ws2&gt;[[s:Church of Scientology v. Wollersheim]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After over 20 years, the Church agreed to settle the case and pay an $8.7 million settlement on May 9, 2002.&lt;ref name="washpost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crushing Defeat"&gt;{{cite web|first=Tony |last=Ortega |title=Scientology's Crushing Defeat |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-06-24/news/Scientologys-Crushing-Defeat/full |work=[[Village Voice]] |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709230659/http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-06-24/news/Scientologys-Crushing-Defeat/full |archivedate=2008-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2005 the ''[[Metropolitan News-Enterprise]]'', a Los Angeles daily legal publication, reported that the Wollersheim case was ongoing and a trial was forthcoming regarding the claim.  It said that his attorney had received $100,000, but she was suing for more.&lt;ref&gt;Grace, Roger (28 October 2005) "[http://www.metnews.com/articles/2005/perspectives102805.htm 25 Years Later, a High-Profile Superior Court Case Is Still on the Active List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215093334/http://www.metnews.com/articles/2005/perspectives102805.htm |date=2005-12-15 }}" Metropolitan News-Enterprise&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 2006, Wollersheim won the case on appeal, as the plaintiff lacked an enforceable lien under the Rules of Professional Conduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metnews.com/articles/2006/schl120806.htm C.A.

'''''MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.''''', [http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916)] is a famous [[New York Court of Appeals]] opinion by Judge [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] which removed the requirement of [[privity of contract]] for duty in [[negligence]] actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anita Bernstein]] ''The Reciprocal of MacPherson v. Buick Motor Company'' in De Gruyter Journal of Tort Law Vol. 9 issue 1-2 August 2016 https://doi.org/10.1515/jtl-2016-0007 Retrieved 17 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cited with approval by Lord Atkin in ''Donoghue'' v ''Stevenson'' [1932] UKHL 100&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
The [[plaintiff]], Donald C. MacPherson, a stonecutter, was injured when one of the wooden wheels of his 1909 "Buick Runabout" collapsed.&lt;ref name='modelcitation'&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_11/b3924601.htm] Business Week article regarding the case&lt;/ref&gt; The [[defendant]], [[Buick Motor Company]], had manufactured the vehicle, but not the wheel, which had been manufactured by another party but installed by defendant. It was conceded that the defective wheel could have been discovered upon inspection. The defendant denied liability because the plaintiff had purchased the automobile from a dealer, not directly from the defendant.

==Judgment==
In the earlier precedent, duty was imposed on defendants by voluntary contract via [[privity of contract|privity]] as in the [[English law|English case]] of ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Winterbottom v. Wright'', 152 Eng. Rep. 402, 403 (Ex. 1842) (''denying injured man's suit against manufacturer because the judge found no privity between the defendant carriage maker and the injured plaintiff'').&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the precursor rule for [[product liability]]. The portion of the ''MacPherson'' opinion in which Cardozo demolished the privity bar to recovery is as follows:

{{quote|If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequence to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. That is as far as we need to go for the decision of this case . . . . If he is negligent, where danger is to be foreseen, a liability will follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic tort law: cases, statutes, and problems|author=Arthur Best, David W. Barnes|page=657|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c99CumsiZ1QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;!-- This one-sided summary emphasizing a minority point of view is being commented out for NPOV reasons until somebody fixes it.
==Significance==
According to Professors John Goldberg of [[Vanderbilt University Law School]] and [[Benjamin Zipursky]] of [[Fordham University School of Law|Fordham Law]],&lt;ref&gt;John Goldberg and Benjamin Zipursky, ''The Moral of MacPherson'', 146 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1733 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; by holding that the defendant manufacturer owed a duty of care to the ultimate purchaser despite the absence of privity, the case did not remove ''[[duty of care]]'' from the law of torts but reaffirmed the concept of a duty of care. Zipursky and Goldberg argue that scholars like [[William Prosser]] misconstrued Judge Cardozo into an [[Law and economics|economist]] who only cared about efficiency in the tort law in the spirit of Judge [[Guido Calabresi]]'s book the [[The Costs of Accidents]].

'''''Miller v. Campbell''''' is a series of three lawsuits filed by [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate candidate]], [[Joe Miller (Alaska politician)|Joe Miller]], in both federal and Alaska state courts, that dispute vote-counting methods and other procedures conducted by the Alaska Division of Elections relating to the November 2, 2010 [[United States Senate election in Alaska, 2010|general election]].

The first suit was filed by Miller in the [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska|U.S. District Court of Alaska]] on November 9, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;Miller v. Campbell (3:10-cv-00252-RRB, District of Alaska)&lt;/ref&gt; That suit was directed at invalidating write-in ballots that did not perfectly spell the last name of Miller's opponent, [[Lisa Murkowski]], or that did not reproduce her name as it appeared on her declaration of write-in candidacy.&lt;ref name="AFN"/&gt; When he filed the suit, Miller also sought a [[preliminary injunction]] requesting a suspension of the hand count of all the write-in votes pending a final order of the federal court. The judge denied the injunction, stating that irreparable harm would not occur because disputed ballots could be kept separate for re-examination. Miller also filed a suit in State court on November 11, asking for voter rolls to compare to the number of votes cast in certain precincts, and to look for evidence of vote fraud.

On November 19, the federal judge directed Miller to move his suit to State court for a determination of whether the Division of Elections was violating Alaska law, and he issued an order halting the certification of the election, pending the outcome of the litigation.&lt;ref name="files"/&gt; Miller then filed his second State court lawsuit regarding the election in the Alaska Superior Court on November 22.&lt;ref name="files"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-11-22/politics/24846388_1_write-in-ballots-state-court-senate-election|title=Miller files vote-count lawsuit in Alaska court|date=November 22, 2010|author=Rachel D'Oro|agency=The Associated Press|publisher=SFGate.com}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of Miller's claims were rejected by the judge on December 10. Miller appealed the ruling to the Alaska Supreme Court; they will hear oral arguments on December 17 and have fast-tracked their decision-making. The federal court retained jurisdiction of the U.S. constitutional issues that Miller raised in his November 9 Complaint; namely, that when the State Division of Elections used a voter intent standard in counting write-in ballots, it violated the Elections Clause and the Due Process Clause. According to Miller, the State election statute should be strictly construed to prohibit the counting of ballots in a candidates' favor if the ballots do not exactly comply with the clear and mandatory language of the statute. The federal judge has indicated he will rule in an expedited fashion on any U.S. constitutional issues that remain after the ruling by the Alaska Supreme court.

Incumbent U.S. Senator Murkowski, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], ran as a write-in candidate in the November 2010 general election because she had been defeated by Miller in the August 2010 Republican primary. The largest number of ballots cast in the November election were write-ins which required a hand-count to determine the names written on those ballots.

==Federal lawsuit==
When Alaska's state Division of Elections announced that it would consider voter intent when reviewing the write-in ballots, Miller sued to prevent the counting of ballots that did not perfectly spell Murkowski's last name, or that did not reproduce her name exactly as it was stated on Murkowski's declaration of write-in candidacy, or that had penmanship issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Vauhini Vara|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704405704575596702529217476 |title=Candidate Argues Spelling Should Count in Alaska Vote|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2010-11-06 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/11/alaskas-legal-battle-begins/66364/|title=Alaska's Legal Battle Begins|author=Chris Good|date=2010-11-10|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/11/10/miller-sues-alaska-still-counts-misspelled-murkowski/|title=Alaska Counts Misspelled 'Murkowski'|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|author=Vauhini Vara|date=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller claimed State law was very strict in this regard, and that all such ballots should be discounted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/09/1545716/miller-sues-to-force-exact-spelling.html |title=Miller sues over spelling, gains votes in absentee ballot count; NO LEEWAY: Campaign says intent doesn't make write-in vote legitimate |author=Kyle Hopkins and Sean Cockerham |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |date=2010-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110171039/http://www.adn.com/2010/11/09/1545716/miller-sues-to-force-exact-spelling.html |archivedate=2010-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2010/11/joe-miller-alaska-senate-lisa-murkowski-/1|title=Alaska counts write-in ballots in heated Senate race|author=Catakuba Canua|date=2010-11-10|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the federal court [[Federal-question jurisdiction|had jurisdiction]] saying that State election officials would be violating the  [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 4: Congressional elections|Elections Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution and the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the 14th Amendment by using a voter intent standard. On November 19, the court ruled against Miller's request for a preliminary injunction to immediately stop the write-in vote count, but allowed the lawsuit to continue. Alaska election officials said they counted votes that are misspelled if they are phonetic to Murkowski, claiming that Alaska [[case law]] including decisions of the Alaska Supreme Court supports this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/16/1557882/murkowski-widens-lead-over-miller.html#ixzz15YacKx00|title=Murkowski Alaska-bound as vote counting winds down|author=Becky Boehrer|date=2010-11-17|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Anchorage Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alaska Department of Law asked the federal judge to dismiss the case because it is fundamentally concerned with a question of State law that can be decided in the State courts and suggested that Miller was forum shopping by taking an alleged violation of a State statute, and bootstrapping it into a violation of provision of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref name="motion to dismiss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/alaska/akdce/3:2010cv00252/37842/17/|title=Miller v.

On November 15 the [[Alaska Federation of Natives]] asked to be included in the lawsuit, claiming [[Standing (law)|standing]] because if Miller received his requested relief, certain voters whom the AFN represents would be disenfranchised &amp;ndash; namely members of the native population, non-native speakers of English, and people with disabilities that caused them to have shaky or poor handwriting.&lt;ref name="AFN"&gt;{{cite news |author=Richard Mauer |url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/15/1555522/afn-seeks-to-intervene-in-senate.html |title=AFN seeks to intervene in Senate voting lawsuit |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |date=November 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222211915/http://www.adn.com/2010/11/15/1555522/afn-seeks-to-intervene-in-senate.html |archivedate=December 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District judge [[Ralph Beistline]] rejected  both AFN's and Murkowski's requests to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/16/1557509/judge-rejects-afn-involvement.html |title=Judge rejects AFN involvement in Miller write-in lawsuit |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |date=November 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203003010/http://www.adn.com/2010/11/16/1557509/judge-rejects-afn-involvement.html |archivedate=December 3, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Write-in count completed==
The Miller campaign had observers present during the count who questioned the validity of over 8,000 ballots. By the end of the counting on November 17, the Division of Elections showed Murkowski having a lead of over 10,000 votes, with about 8,000 of those votes challenged by Miller. At that point, even if all the challenged ballots were thrown out, Murkowski would still lead by about 2,200 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2013461497_murkowski18.html|title=Murkowski triumphs in Alaska Senate race: Alaska's Murkowski appears to be first write-in candidate to win Senate since 1954|author=Seattle Times news services|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=November 17, 2010|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/11/17/131391244/ap-murkowski-wins-alaska-senate-race|title=AP: Murkowski Wins Alaska Senate Race|author=AP staff reporter|agency=Associated Press|date=November 17, 2010|publisher=NPR|access-date=2018-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206151549/http://www.npr.org/2010/11/17/131391244/ap-murkowski-wins-alaska-senate-race#|archive-date=2010-12-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoping to pick up additional votes, the Miller campaign demanded a hand recount of the entire election, claiming that because Murkowski's votes were all verified by visual inspection, Miller's should also have the same, individualized treatment. The Director of the Division of Elections replied that the State does not do recounts completely by hand; it uses optical scan equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miller calls for hand recount of votes as Murkowski lead grows|author=Sean Cockerham|work=Anchorage Daily News|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State court lawsuits==
After filing the federal lawsuit, Miller began a second legal action against Alaska election officials, this time, in State court, asking to inspect and count signatures of voters in more than 30 precincts.&lt;ref name="voter rolls"/&gt; In support of the suit, Miller provided affidavits that cited, among other things, a ballot box that was not secured, and signatures that appeared similar.&lt;ref name="voter rolls"/&gt; On November 16, the State election authorities agreed to provide Miller with the requested information. The Associated Press noted that similar signatures could be caused by voters requesting and receiving aid in filling out ballots, and that the affidavits suggesting fraud had been mostly by Miller supporters.&lt;ref name="voter rolls"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsminer.com/view/full_story/10339352/article-Alaska-to-provide-Miller-with-voter-rolls?instance=alaska_news|work=Fairbanks Daily News-Miner|agency=The Associated Press|title=Alaska to provide Miller with voter rolls|author=Becky Bohrer|date=November 16, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315105928/http://www.newsminer.com/view/full_story/10339352/article-Alaska-to-provide-Miller-with-voter-rolls?instance=alaska_news|archivedate=March 15, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, U.S. District Court Judge Beistline directed Miller to move his complaint to State court saying that the Alaska courts were in a better position than U.S. federal courts, to apply Alaska law to decide who won the election.&lt;ref name="in the Senate race"/&gt; But Beistline also said he would "review any constitutional issues that may exist once the state remedies have been exhausted".&lt;ref name="in the Senate race"/&gt; Miller then filed his second State case in Fairbanks where he lives, essentially repeating the allegations in his federal lawsuit Complaint, but adding new claims of vote fraud and bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sandyha Somashekhar|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/27/AR2010112702896.html|title=Despite Alaska Senate race results, Joe Miller presses on in principle|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 27, 2010|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; State attorneys succeeded in getting the case moved to the State capital in Juneau where the disputed ballots were being held and where the Alaska Division of Elections is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rachel D'Oro |agency=The Associated Press |url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/26/1574103/miller-opposes-murkowski-intervention.html |title=Miller assails senator's intervention in lawsuit |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |date=November 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203000626/http://www.adn.com/2010/11/26/1574103/miller-opposes-murkowski-intervention.html |archivedate=December 3, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Becky Bohrer |agency=The Associated Press |url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/29/1578269/miller-makes-false-claims-murkowski.html |title=Judge moves Miller lawsuit to Juneau |date=November 29, 2010 |publisher=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203020012/http://www.adn.com/2010/11/29/1578269/miller-makes-false-claims-murkowski.html |archivedate=December 3, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The State also asked for an expedited ruling so that Alaska would not deprived of full representation in the upcoming Senate session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Becky Bohrer |agency=The Associated Press |url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/30/1580321/state-seeks-quick-ruling-in-senate.html |title=State seeks expedited ruling in Miller lawsuit over write-ins |date=November 30, 2010 |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205013104/http://www.adn.com/2010/11/30/1580321/state-seeks-quick-ruling-in-senate.html |archivedate=December 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After briefs and oral arguments, Judge William Carey of the [[Alaska Superior Court|Superior Court]] in [[Juneau]] disagreed with Miller's arguments, saying that if the [[Alaska Legislature]] had intended that a candidate's name must be spelled perfectly to count, it would have written the law to say that. Carey also dismissed Miller's assertions of vote fraud and other irregularities as unfounded. Miller's campaign replied that Carey's ruling modifies State law, and renewed calls for a hand count of all the ballots cast in the election.&lt;ref name="in the Senate race"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/121410/sta_756389092.shtml|title=Miller appeals decision in Senate Race|agency=The Associated Press|author=Becky Bohrer|work=The Juneau Empire |date=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal to the Supreme Court of Alaska===
On December 13, Miller appealed the Alaska Superior Court decision of the prior week to the [[Alaska Supreme Court]]. Miller's appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court on December 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/12/22/breaking-alaska-supreme-court-rules-against-miller | title=Breaking: Alaska Supreme Court rules against Miller|author=CNN|date=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion of constitutional issues in the media==
Writing in [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'' magazine]], election law analyst Richard L. Hasen said Miller's federal complaint involved issues that can arise in close elections, and noted the value of sticking to established rules so that election officials cannot manipulate the vote. However, he also noted that the question of whether the Alaska statute required perfect spelling was a matter of [[statutory interpretation]], and that Alaska's Supreme Court has a long history of interpreting statutes in favor of the voters to avoid disenfranchisement based on technicalities.&lt;ref name="Hasen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2274556|title=Alaska's Big Spelling Test: How strong is Joe Miller's argument against the Leeza Markovsky vote?|author=Richard L. Hasen|date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasen also noted that Miller's constitutional claims derive from a concurring opinion in the 2000 U.S. Supreme Court case, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', and said that the Election Clause claim would fail "because it would mean that election officials could never come up with regulations".&lt;ref name="Hasen"/&gt; Hasen also believed the Equal Protection argument, which is based on inconsistent treatment of similar ballots by different election officials, would also fail because in ''Bush v. Gore'' different election officials in different counties reviewed the ballots, but in Alaska, only one person was judging all the contested ballots.&lt;ref name="Hasen"/&gt;

==Continuation==
After these events, a lawsuit was filed by supporters of Miller arguing that the state violated the [[Voting Rights Act]] by accepting misspellings on write-in ballots, using different counting methods for different types of candidates and by allowing voters to vote without showing identification.  Alaska has taken the position that the lawsuit is moot and in any event beyond the statute of limitations. All of Miller's legal challenges eventually failed. The State of Alaska spent an estimated $100,000 defending itself from these suits, and pursued partial compensation from Miller, as well as proposing new voting rules regarding write-ins in order to prevent a recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;Epler, Patti [https://www.adn.com/politics/article/alaska-former-senate-candidate-joe-millers-write-lawsuit-cost-state-100k/2011/01/26/ Former Senate Candidate Joe Miller's write-in lawsuit cost state 100K] ''[[Alaska Dispatch News]], 1/25/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nigerian Civil Service''' consists of employees in [[Nigeria]]n government agencies other than the military and police. 
Most employees are career civil servants in the Nigerian ministries, progressing based on qualifications and seniority. Recently the head of the service has been introducing measures to make the ministries more efficient and responsive to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

The word civil is derived from an old french word "civil" which means "relating to law" and directly from Latin word "civilis" which means "relating to citizen". while the word service is derived from an old french word "servise" which means "aids".
The Nigerian Civil Service has its origins in organizations established by the [[British people|British]] in colonial times.
Nigeria gained full independence in October 1960 under a constitution that provided for a parliamentary government and a substantial measure of self-government for the country's three regions.
Since then, various panels have studied and made recommendations for reforming of the Civil Service, including the Margan Commission of 1963, the Adebo Commission of 1971 and the Udoji Commission of 1972-74.
A major change occurred with the adoption in 1979 of a constitution modeled on that of the [[United States]].  
The Dotun Philips Panel of 1985 attempted to reform to the Civil Service. The 1988 Civil Service Reorganization Decree promulgated by General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] had a major impact on the structure and efficiency of the Civil Service.
The later report of the Ayida Panel made recommendations to reverse some of the past innovations and to return to the more efficient Civil Service of earlier years.&lt;ref name=backg&gt;{{cite web

 |title=BACKGROUND TO THE NIGERIAN CIVIL SERVICE

 |accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Civil Service has been undergoing gradual and systematic reforms and restructuring since May 29, 1999 after decades of military rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the civil service is still considered stagnant and inefficient, and the attempts made in the past by panels have had little effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In August 2009 the Head of the Civil Service, [[Stephen Osagiede Oronsaye]], proposed reforms where permanent secretaries and directors  would spend a maximum of eight years in office. The reform, approved by President [[Umaru Yar'Adua]], would result in massive retirement of Permanent Secretaries and Directors, many of whom are from the North.&lt;ref name=orons&gt;{{cite web

==Organization==

The civil service is mainly organized around the federal ministries, headed by a minister appointed by the [[President of Nigeria]], who must include at least one member of each of the 36 states in his cabinet. The President's appointments are confirmed by the [[Senate of Nigeria]]. There are less than 36 ministries. In some cases a Federal minister is responsible for more than one ministry(e.g. Environment and Housing may be combined)and a minister may be assisted by one or more ministers of State.
Each ministry also has a Permanent Secretary, who is a senior civil servant.
The ministries are responsible for various[parastatals(government-owned corporations) such as universities (Education), [[Nigerian Broadcasting Commission|National Broadcasting Commission]], Information and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
Other parastatals are the responsibility of the Office of the Presidency, such as the [[Independent National Electoral Commission]], the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] and the [[Civil Service Commission of Nigeria|Federal Civil Service Commission]].
The service has six additional units which provide services to all departments on the Civil Service:
*Establishments &amp; Record Office (E&amp;RO)
*Career Management Office (CMO)
*Manpower Development Office (MDO)
*Management Services Office (MSO)
*Common Services Office (CSO)
*Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR)

==Budget==

'''Oligarchy''' ({{etymology|el|{{lang|grc|ὀλιγαρχία}} (oligarkhía)}}; {{etymology||''ὀλίγος'' (olígos)|few||''ἄρχω'' (arkho)|to rule or to command}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29li%2Fgos "ὀλίγος"], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Frxw "ἄρχω"], Liddell/Scott.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29ligarxi%2Fa "ὀλιγαρχία"]. Liddell/Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of [[power structure]] in which [[Power (social and political)|power]] rests with a small number of people. These people may be distinguished by [[nobility]], [[wealth]], [[family ties]], [[education]] or [[corporate]], [[religious]] or [[political]], [[military]] control. Such states are often controlled by families who typically pass their influence from one [[generation]] to the next, but [[inheritance]] is not a necessary condition for the application of this term.

Throughout history, oligarchies have often been [[tyrant|tyrannical]], relying on public obedience or oppression to exist. [[Aristotle]] pioneered the use of the term as a synonym for rule by the rich,&lt;ref&gt;Winters (2011) p. 26-28. "Aristotle writes that 'oligarchy is when men of property have the government in their hands... wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy, and where the poor rule, that is a democracy'."&lt;/ref&gt; for which another term commonly used today is [[plutocracy]].

In the early 20th century [[Robert Michels|Robert Michels]] developed the theory that democracies, as all large organizations, have a tendency to turn into oligarchies. In his "[[Iron law of oligarchy|Iron law of oligarchy]]" he suggests that the necessary division of labor in large organizations leads to the establishment of a ruling class mostly concerned with protecting their own power.

This was already recognized by the [[Athenian]]s in the fourth century [[BCE]]: After the restoration of [[democracy]] from oligarchical coups, they used the [[Sortition|drawing of lots]] for selecting government officers to counteract that tendency toward oligarchy in government.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Mogens Herman (1991). ''The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes''. Oxford: Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0631180173}}. {{OCLC|22809482}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2014}} They drew lots from large groups of adult volunteers to pick civil servants performing judicial, executive, and administrative functions (''archai'', ''boulē'', and ''hēliastai'').&lt;ref name="Manin"&gt;Bernard Manin.

The exclusive consolidation of power by a [[dominant minority|dominant religious or ethnic minority]] has also been described as a form of oligarchy.&lt;ref name=Minority1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=James|last2=Rosberg|first2=Carl|title=Political Parties and National Integration in Tropical Africa|date=1966|pages=681–683|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0520002531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this system include South Africa under ''[[apartheid]]'', [[Liberia]] under [[Americo-Liberians]], the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], and [[Rhodesia]], where the installation of oligarchic rule by the descendants of foreign settlers was primarily regarded as a legacy of various forms of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref name=Minority1/&gt;

The modern United States of America has also been described as an oligarchy,&lt;ref&gt;Gilens, M., &amp; Page, B. (2014). Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens. Perspectives on Politics, 12(3), 564-581. doi:10.1017/S1537592714001595

== Putative oligarchies==
A business group might be defined as an oligarch if it satisfies the following conditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) owners are the largest private owners in the country 
(2) it possesses sufficient political power to promote its own interests
(3) owners control multiple businesses, which intensively coordinate their activities.&lt;ref name=Chern2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Chernenko|first1= Demid |title= Capital structure and oligarch ownership |journal= Economic Change and Restructuring |date=2018|pages=1–29|doi= 10.1007/S10644-018-9226-9|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10644-018-9226-9 |volume=|issue= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russian Federation===
{{main|Russian oligarch}}
Since [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the collapse of the Soviet Union]] and [[privatisation]] of the economy in December 1991, privately owned Russia-based multinational corporations, including producers of petroleum, natural gas, and metal have, in the view of many analysts, led to the rise of [[Russian oligarch]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 51] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 222–223] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukraine ===
{{main|Ukrainian oligarchs}}

The Ukrainian oligarchs are a group of [[business oligarch]]s that quickly appeared on the economic and political scene of [[Ukraine]] after its independence in 1991. Overall there are 35 oligarchic groups &lt;ref name=Chern2018&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zimbabwe ===

The Zimbabwean oligarchs are a group of [https://mg.co.za/article/2017-12-14-war-veterans-remain-a-potent-political-force-in-zimbabwe-and-sa liberation war veterans]; who form the [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front]], a colonial liberation party. The philosophy of the Zimbabwean government is that Zimbabwe can only be governed by a leader who took part in the pre-independence war. ZANU-PF has a theme motto in Shona "Zimbabwe yakauya neropa" meaning Zimbabwe was born from the blood of the sons and daughters who died fighting for its independence. The born free generation (born since independence in 1980) has no birthright to rule Zimbabwe.

French economist [[Thomas Piketty]] states in his 2013 book, ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]],'' that "the risk of a drift towards oligarchy is real and gives little reason for optimism about where the United States is headed."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Piketty|Piketty, Thomas]] (2014).

A study conducted by political scientists Martin Gilens of [[Princeton University]] and [[Benjamin Page]] of [[Northwestern University]] was released in April 2014,&lt;ref name=Gilens&gt;{{cite journal |title=Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens |author1=Martin Gilens |author2=Benjamin I.

The study analyzed nearly 1,800 policies enacted by the US government between 1981 and 2002 and compared them to the expressed preferences of the American public as opposed to wealthy Americans and large special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/major-study-finds-that-the-us-is-an-oligarchy-2014-4|title=Major Study Finds The US Is An Oligarchy|website=businessinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that wealthy individuals and organizations representing business interests have substantial political influence, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little to none. The study did concede that "Americans do enjoy many features central to democratic governance, such as regular elections, freedom of speech and association, and a widespread ([[Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States|if still contested]]) [[Suffrage|franchise]]." Gilens and Page do not characterize the US as an "oligarchy" per se; however, they do apply the concept of "civil oligarchy" as used by [[Jeffrey A. Winters|Jeffrey Winters]] with respect to the US. Winters has posited a comparative theory of "oligarchy" in which the wealthiest citizens – even in a "civil oligarchy" like the United States – dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth- and income-protection.&lt;ref&gt;Gilens &amp; Page (2014) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilens says that average citizens only get what they want if wealthy Americans and business-oriented interest groups also want it; and that when a policy favored by the majority of the American public is implemented, it is usually because the economic elites did not oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;Prokop, A.

[[File:Panopticon.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Multiview orthographic projection#Elevation|Elevation]], [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|section]] and [[Multiview orthographic projection#Plan|plan]] of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon penitentiary, drawn by [[Willey Reveley]], 1791]]
The '''Panopticon''' is a type of institutional building and a system of control designed by the English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] in the late 18th century. The scheme of the design is to allow all (''pan-'') [[inmate]]s of an institution to be observed (''-opticon'') by a single watchman without the inmates being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all the inmates' cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that they are motivated to act as though they are being watched at all times. Thus, they are effectively compelled to regulate their own behaviour. The name may also allude to the many-eyed giant [[Panoptes]] in [[Greek mythology]], some of whose eyes were always awake, making him a highly effective watchman.

The design consists of a circular structure with an "inspection house" at its centre, from which the manager or staff of the institution is able to watch the inmates. The inmates, who are stationed around the perimeter of the structure, are unable to see into the inspection house. Bentham conceived the basic plan as being equally applicable to hospitals, schools, sanatoriums, and asylums, but he devoted most of his efforts to developing a design for a Panopticon prison. It is his prison that is now most widely meant by the term "panopticon".

Bentham described the Panopticon as "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example".{{Sfn |Bentham |1843d |p=39}} Elsewhere, in a letter, he described the Panopticon prison as "a mill for grinding rogues honest".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Works |volume=10.

In 1786 and 1787, Bentham travelled to [[Krychaw|Krichev]] in White Russia (modern [[Belarus]]) to visit his brother, [[Samuel Bentham|Samuel]], who was engaged in managing various industrial and other projects for [[Grigory Potemkin|Prince Potemkin]]. It was Samuel (as Jeremy later repeatedly acknowledged) who conceived the basic idea of a circular building at the hub of a larger compound as a means of allowing a small number of managers to oversee the activities of a large and unskilled workforce.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 99–100}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Prisons and prison systems: a global encyclopedia| first = Mitchel P | last = Roth |year= 2006 |publisher=Greenwood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTH31DgbTzgC&amp;pg=PA33|page= 33| isbn = 9780313328565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy began to develop this model, particularly as applicable to prisons, and outlined his ideas in a series of letters sent home to his father in England.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 99–101}}  He supplemented the supervisory principle with the idea of ''contract management''; that is, an administration by contract as opposed to trust, where the director would have a [[pecuniary]] interest in lowering the average rate of mortality.{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | pp = 134–40}}

The Panopticon was intended to be cheaper than the prisons of his time, as it required fewer staff; "Allow me to construct a prison on this model," Bentham requested to a Committee for the Reform of Criminal Law, "I will be the [[gaoler]]. You will see&amp;nbsp;... that the gaoler will have no salary—will cost nothing to the nation." As the watchmen cannot be seen, they need not be on duty at all times, effectively leaving the watching to the watched.  According to Bentham's design, the prisoners would also be used as menial labour, walking on wheels to spin [[loom]]s or run a [[water wheel]]. This would decrease the cost of the prison and give a possible source of income.{{Sfn | Bentham | 1995 | pages = 29–95}}

== Abortive prison project ==
On his return to England from Russia, Bentham continued to work on the idea of a Panopticon prison, and commissioned drawings from an architect, [[Willey Reveley]].{{Sfn | Semple | 1993 | p = 118}}  In 1791, he published the material he had written as a book, although he continued to refine his proposals for many years to come. He had by now decided that he wanted to see the prison built: when finished, it would be managed by himself as contractor-governor, with the assistance of Samuel. After unsuccessful attempts to interest the authorities in Ireland and revolutionary France,&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 102–4, 107–8.&lt;/ref&gt; he started trying to persuade the prime minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], to revive an earlier abandoned scheme for a National Penitentiary in England, this time to be built as a Panopticon. He was eventually successful in winning over Pitt and his advisors, and in 1794 was paid £2,000 for preliminary work on the project.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 108–10, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intended site was one that had been authorised (under an [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, 1760–1779|act]] of 1779) for the earlier Penitentiary, at [[Battersea]] Rise; but the new proposals ran into technical legal problems and objections from the local landowner, [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 169–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sites were considered, including one at Hanging Wood, near [[Woolwich]], but all proved unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 194–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Bentham turned to a site at Tothill Fields, near [[Westminster]]. Although this was common land, with no landowner, there were a number of parties with interests in it, including [[Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor|Earl Grosvenor]], who owned a house on an adjacent site and objected to the idea of a prison overlooking it. Again, therefore, the scheme ground to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 197–217.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, however, it became clear that a nearby site at [[Millbank]], adjoining the [[River Thames|Thames]], was available for sale, and this time things ran more smoothly. Using government money, Bentham bought the land on behalf of the Crown for £12,000 in November 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 217–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

From his point of view, the site was far from ideal, being marshy, unhealthy, and too small. When he asked the government for more land and more money, however, the response was that he should build only a small-scale experimental prison—which he interpreted as meaning that there was little real commitment to the concept of the Panopticon as a cornerstone of penal reform.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 226–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations continued, but in 1801 Pitt resigned from office, and in 1803 the new [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]] administration decided not to proceed with the project.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 236–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham was devastated: "They have murdered my best days."&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, a few years later the government revived the idea of a National Penitentiary, and in 1811 and 1812 returned specifically to the idea of a Panopticon.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 265–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Bentham, now aged 63, was still willing to be governor. However, as it became clear that there was still no real commitment to the proposal, he abandoned hope, and instead turned his attentions to extracting financial compensation for his years of fruitless effort. His initial claim was for the enormous sum of nearly £700,000, but he eventually settled for the more modest (but still considerable) sum of £23,000.&lt;ref&gt;Semple 1993, pp. 279–81.&lt;/ref&gt; An Act of Parliament in 1812 transferred his title in the site to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;Penitentiary House, etc. Act: 52 Geo. III, c. 44 (1812).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the Panopticon scheme, convinced that it had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite. It was largely because of his sense of injustice and frustration that he developed his ideas of "sinister interest"—that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest—which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Schofield |title=Bentham: a guide for the perplexed |year=2009 |place=London |publisher= Continuum |isbn=978-0-8264-9589-1 |pages= 90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Millbank Prison|National Penitentiary]] was indeed subsequently built on the Millbank site, but to a design by William Williams that owed little to the Panopticon, beyond the fact that the governor's quarters, administrative offices, and chapel were placed at the centre of the complex. It opened in 1816.

Although most prison designs have included elements of surveillance, the essential elements of Bentham's design were not only that the custodians should be able to view the prisoners at all times (including times when they were in their cells), but also that the prisoners should be unable to see the custodians, and so could never be sure whether or not they were under surveillance. This objective was extremely difficult to achieve within the constraints of the available technology, which explains why Bentham spent so many years reworking his plans.  Subsequent 19th-century prison designs enabled the custodians to keep the doors of cells and the outsides of buildings under observation, but not to see the prisoners in their cells. Something close to a realization of Bentham's vision only became possible through 20th-century technological developments—notably [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV)—but these eliminated the need for a specific architectural framework.

It has been argued that the Panopticon influenced the radial design of 19th-century prisons built on the principles of the "[[separate system]]" (including [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in [[Philadelphia]], opened in 1829, and the later [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville Prison]] in London and [[Armagh Women's Prison|Armagh Gaol]] in Northern Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Andrzejewski |first= Anna Vemer |title= Building Power: Architecture and Surveillance in Victorian America |place= Knoxville |publisher= University of Tennessee Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-1-57233631-5 |pages= 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these prisons control was exercised through strict prisoner isolation rather than surveillance, but they also incorporated a design of radiating wings, allowing a centrally located guard to observe the door of every cell.

===Claimed influence===
As noted, none of these prisons—with the arguable exceptions mentioned above—are true Panopticons in the Benthamic sense. In some cases, the claims for any influence are very dubious indeed, and seem to be based on little more than the fact that (for example) the design is circular.

Bentham always conceived the Panopticon principle as being beneficial to the design of a variety of institutions in which surveillance was important, including hospitals, schools, workhouses, and lunatic asylums, as well as prisons.

A wooden Panopticon factory, capable of holding 5000 workers, was constructed by [[Samuel Bentham]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], on the banks of the [[Neva River]], between 1805 and 1808: its purpose was to educate and employ young men in trades connected with the navy. It burned down in 1818.{{Sfn|Semple|1993|pp=214–5.}} The Round Mill in [[Belper]], Derbyshire, England, is supposed to have been built on the Panopticon principle with a central overseer.

It was considered a model facility at the time.

The Panopticon has been suggested as an "open" hospital architecture:

The [[Akron Plan]] common in American Protestant church buildings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is based on similar principles to the panopticon, although there is no evidence of direct influence.

[[File:Contrasted Residences for the Poor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|"Contrasted Residences for the Poor": a plate from [[Augustus Pugin]]'s ''Contrasts'' (1841)]]
Despite the fact that no Panopticon was built during Bentham's lifetime (and virtually none since), his concept has prompted considerable discussion and debate. Whereas Bentham himself regarded the Panopticon as a rational, enlightened, and therefore just, solution to societal problems, his ideas have been repeatedly criticised by others for their reductive, mechanistic and inhumane approach to human lives. Thus, in 1841, [[Augustus Pugin]] published the second edition of his work ''[[Augustus Pugin#Contrasts|Contrasts]]'' in which one plate showed a "Modern Poor House" (clearly modelled on a Panopticon), a bleak and comfortless structure in which the pauper is separated from his family, subjected to a harsh discipline, fed on a minimal diet, and consigned after death to medical dissection, contrasted with an "Antient Poor House", an architecturally inspiring religious institution in which the pauper is treated throughout with humanity and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Margaret |last= Belcher |chapter=Pugin Writing |editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last= Atterbury |editor2-first= Clive |editor2-last=Wainwright |title=Pugin: a Gothic Passion |publisher=Yale University Press |place= London |year= 1994 |isbn=0-30006012-2 |pages=105–16 (108–9) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, American historian [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] published an essay, "The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham", in which she depicted Bentham's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gertrude |last= Himmelfarb |authorlink=Gertrude Himmelfarb |chapter=The Haunted House of Jeremy Bentham |editor1-first= Richard |editor1-last= Herr |editor2-first=Harold T. |editor2-last=Parker |title=Ideas in History: essays presented to Louis Gottschalk by his former students |publisher=Duke University Press |place=Durham, NC |year= 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel arguments were put forward by French psychoanalyst [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] in an essay entitled "Le despotisme de l'utile: la machine panoptique de Jeremy Bentham", written in 1973 and published in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jacques-Alain |last= Miller |authorlink= Jacques-Alain Miller |trans-title=The despotism of the useful: Jeremy Bentham’s panoptical machine | title=La despotisme de l'utile: la machine panoptique de Jeremy Bentham | language = fr | journal=Ornicar? |volume=3 |year=1975 |pages= 3–36}}; published in English as {{cite journal |first= Jacques-Alain |last= Miller |authorlink= Jacques-Alain Miller |title= Jeremy Bentham's Panoptic Device |journal= October |volume= 41 |year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Martin |last= Jay |authorlink= Martin Jay |title=Downcast eyes: the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought |place= Berkeley |publisher= University of California Press |year= 1993 |isbn= 0-52008154-4 |pages= 381–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most influentially, the idea of the panopticon was invoked by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975), as a metaphor for modern "disciplinary" societies and their pervasive inclination to observe and normalise. This means that the Panopticon operates as a power mechanism. "On the whole, therefore, one can speak of the formation of a disciplinary society in this movement that stretches from the enclosed disciplines, a sort of social 'quarantine', to an indefinitely generalizable mechanism of 'panopticism'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foucault|1995|pp=195–210}}: quotation at p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The Panopticon is an ideal architectural figure of modern disciplinary power which Foucault proposes had existed before it was named as such. Foucault references quarantine procedures in response to the plague at the end of the seventeenth century, which predate the model of the panopticon but resemble the control dynamic closely. A plague-ridden town would be partitioned, then each house would be locked with guards on each street end in a similar design to the later-theorized panopticon. The Panopticon creates a consciousness of permanent visibility as a form of power, where no bars, chains, and heavy locks are necessary for domination any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Thomas |last=Allmer |year=2012 |title=Towards a Critical Theory of Surveillance in Informational Capitalism |place=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Peter Lang |page=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of actual surveillance, the mere threat of surveillance is what disciplines society into behaving according to rules and norms. Furthermore, the spectator of the panopticon changes in Foucault's account, for the idea that fellow people are watching and spectating reinforces the disciplinary society. Foucault proposes that not only prisons but all [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures like the army, schools, hospitals and factories have evolved through history to resemble Bentham's Panopticon. The notoriety of the design today (although not its lasting influence in architectural realities) stems from Foucault's famous analysis of it.

[[File:CCTV graffiti - geograph.org.uk - 977154.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Anti-CCTV graffiti]]
Building on Foucault, contemporary social critics often assert that technology has allowed for the deployment of panoptic structures invisibly throughout society. [[Surveillance]] by [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras in public spaces is an example of a technology that brings the gaze of a superior into the daily lives of the populace. Furthermore, a number of cities in the United Kingdom, including Middlesbrough, Bristol, Brighton and London have added loudspeakers to a number of their existing CCTV cameras. They can transmit the voice of a camera supervisor to issue audible messages to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.thehoya.com/viewpoint/092206/view4.cfm | title = Cameras Help Stop Crime | newspaper = The Hoya | date = 22 September 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2006/09/351051.html | title = 2006, But Has 1984 Finally Arrived? | publisher = Indymedia | place = UK | date = 19 September 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, critical analyses of internet practice have suggested that the internet allows for a panoptic form of observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://theoryandscience.icaap.org/content/vol003.001/brignall.html | title = The New Panopticon: The Internet Viewed as a Structure of Social Control | journal = Theory &amp; science | volume = 3 | number = 1 | publisher = ICAAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet Service Providers|ISP]]s are able to track users' activities, while user-generated content means that daily social activity may be recorded and broadcast online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mobimundi.net/ | title=Workshop: Exploring the Impact of User-generated Mobile Content – The Participatory Panopticon | publisher = Mobi mundi | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311061007/http://mobimundi.net/ | deadurl=yes| archivedate= 11 March 2012| accessdate= 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shoshana Zuboff]] used the metaphor of the panopticon in her book ''In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power'' (1988) to describe how computer technology makes work more visible. Zuboff examined how computer systems were used to track the behavior and output of workers. She used the term panopticon because the workers could not tell that they were being spied on, while the manager was able to check their work continuously. As the book was written in 1988, Zuboff's arguments were based on the online information service [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]] rather than the [[World Wide Web]]. Zuboff argued that there is a collective responsibility formed by the hierarchy in the Information Panopticon that eliminates subjective opinions and judgements of managers on their employees. Because each employee's contribution to the production process is translated into objective data, it becomes more important for managers to be able to analyze the work rather than analyze the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= In the Age of the Smart Machine: The Future of Work and Power | first = Shoshana | last = Zuboff |year=1988 | place =New York | publisher = Basic Books | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url= https://courses.lis.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/227065/mod_resource/content/1/zuboff_info_panopticon.pdf |pages= 315–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1998 essay, "The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963–1997", academic [[Juan Cole]] compares the [[Bahá'í administration]]'s control over members of the [[Baha'i faith]] to panopticon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole |first=Juan |date=June 1998 |title=The Baha’i Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal=The Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=234–238| access-date=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panopticon has also become a symbol of the extreme measures that some companies take in the name of efficiency as well as to guard against employee theft, documented in a 2009 paper by Max Haiven and Scott Stoneman entitled ''[[Walmart|Wal-Mart]]: The Panopticon of Time''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | format = PDF | url = http://www.opencircle.mcmaster.ca/institute-on-globalization-and-the-human-condition/documents/IGHC-WPS_09-1_HaivenStoneman.pdf | last1 = Haiven | first1 = Max | last2 = Stoneman | first2 = Scott | year = 2009 |title=Wal-Mart: The Panopticon of Time |pages=3–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2014 book by Simon Head, ''Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Are Making Dumber Humans''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simon |last=Head |chapter=Walmart and Amazon |editor-first=Tim |editor-last=Bartlett |title=Mindless: Why Smarter Machines Makes Dumber Humans |publisher=Basic Books |place=New York, NY |year=2014 |isbn= 0-46501844-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describes conditions at an [[Amazon.com]] depot in [[Augsburg]], Germany. Both argue that catering at all times to the desires of the customer can lead to increasingly oppressive corporate environments and [[production quota|quotas]] in which many warehouse workers can no longer keep up with demands of management.

Social theorist [[Simone Browne (sociologist)|Simone Browne]] reviews Bentham's theories in her book ''Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Simone |last=Browne |authorlink=Simone Browne (sociologist) |title=Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness |publisher=Duke University Press |place=Durham NC|year=2015 |isbn=9780822359197 |url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters }}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that Bentham travelled on a ship carrying a cargo of what he calls "18 young Negresses" while drafting his Panopticon proposal, and argues that the structure of chattel slavery haunts the theory of the Panopticon. She proposes that the plan of the slave ship ''[[Brookes (ship)|Brookes]]'', produced and distributed by the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] in 1789, should be regarded as the paradigmatic blueprint for what she calls "racializing surveillance".

== The Panopticon of Social Media ==

The concept of Panopticon has been referenced in discussions about of the impact of social media. Jake Goldenfein, researcher at the University of Melbourne's Centre for Media and Communications Law explains that, "The relevance of the panopticon as a metaphor begins to wither when we start thinking about whether contemporary types of visuality (effectively digital and data-driven) are analogous to the central tower concept. For example, whether this type of visuality is as asymmetrical, and – I think more importantly – being co-opted for the same political exercise. Does the fact that we don’t know we’re being watched mean we are being normalized in the way the panopticon was intended to correct behaviour?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Thomas|title=What does the panopticon mean in the age of digital surveillance?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/23/panopticon-digital-surveillance-jeremy-bentham|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Peruta v. San Diego''''' was a 2016 decision of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] pertaining to the legality of [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County's]] restrictive policy regarding requiring documentation of "good cause" that "distinguish[es] the applicant from the mainstream and places the applicant in harm's way" (Cal. Pen. Code §§ 26150, 26155) before issuing a [[concealed carry permit]].

After an initial ruling (2-1) in 2014 that held that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]] protected the right to carry a concealed weapon, the court reheard the case ''[[en banc]]'', ultimately upholding the lower court ruling, saying that "there is no Second Amendment right for members of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public."&lt;ref name="824f3d919"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Peruta v. County of San Diego |vol=824 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=919 |pinpoint=924 |court=9th Cir. |date=2016 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10143057211425779504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the ruling technically applied to all states and territories under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, it only applied to California and Hawaii in practice because the remaining states in the Ninth Circuit's area of responsibility have either Shall-Issue licensing policies or allow concealed carry without a permit.

The case was appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]], which in June 2017 denied the [[writ of certiorari]], leaving the Ninth Circuit's en banc opinion in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Liptak |date=June 26, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-guns-public-california.html |title=Supreme Court Turns Down Case on Carrying Guns in Public |newspaper=New York Times |access-date=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-894_p86b.pdf|title=Peruta v. California, 582 U. S. ____ (2017)|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning==
The court reviewed the history of gun control cases in which laws forbidding the concealed carry of weapons were involved. They covered a time period from 1299 (in England) to the late 1800s US Supreme Court. The majority opinion was that there was an "overwhelming consensus" of historical case decisions establishing that there was never a time in history when courts believed that states could not prohibit concealed carry. Consequently, they concluded it could not be a violation of the long-standing interpretation of the Second Amendment.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/06/ninth-circuit-peruta-ruling/486446/|title=No Constitutional Right to Concealed Firearms, Federal Appeals Court Rules|first=Matt|last=Ford|work=theatlantic.com|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minority argued that a prohibition on concealed carry for the general public, accompanied by a similar prohibition on open carry, was a de facto gun ban, and therefore is unconstitutional under District of Columbia v. Heller.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"/&gt;

==Details==
Under San Diego's policy, a "'typical' citizen in San Diego County cannot bear arms in public for self-defense" because by San Diego's definition, typical citizens cannot '"distinguish [themselves] from the mainstream'" and receive concealed carry permits. (''Peruta v. San Diego'' (9th Cir, 02-13-14) p.&amp;nbsp;54.) Although prior to January 1, 2012, it was legal to openly carry an unloaded handgun in public, in October 2011 Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that modifies the law on openly carrying an unloaded firearm to match the restrictions for openly carrying a loaded weapon,&lt;ref&gt;McGreevy, Patrick and Riccardi, Nicholas (October 10, 2011). [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/10/local/la-me-brown-guns-20111011 "Brown Bans Open Carrying of Handguns"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved December 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; effectively prohibiting (in all but limited circumstances) the open carry of firearms whether loaded or unloaded. (Cal. Pen. Code §§ 25850, 26155.) Thus, the court found San Diego County's restrictive policy in combination with California's denial of open carry ultimately resulted in the destruction of the typical law-abiding, responsible citizen's right to bear arms in any manner in public, thereby violating the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution.

==History==
The February 13, 2014 decision is written by [[Diarmuid O'Scannlain]], with [[Consuelo María Callahan]] joining and [[Sidney Runyan Thomas]] dissenting, and affirmed the right of responsible, law-abiding citizens to carry a handgun in public for lawful self-defense. The primary plaintiff, Edward Peruta, was represented by attorneys Paul Neuharth, Jr. from San Diego and Chuck Michel from Long Beach.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kopel | first=David | title=Ninth Circuit strikes California’s restrictive rule against licensed carry of handguns | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/13/ninth-circuit-strikes-californias-restrictive-rule-against-licensed-carry-of-handguns/ | accessdate=2014-02-13 | publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kpbs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Tosses California's Concealed Weapons Rules | url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/feb/13/court-tosses-californias-concealed-weapons-rules/|publisher=Kpbs.org | accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 2014 [[California Attorney General]] [[Kamala Harris]] filed a petition for [[en banc]] review of the decision. As the state was not a formal party of the case, her action is not an appeal, but merely a request that the full court re-hear the case ''en-banc'' on its own initiative (''[[sua sponte]]''). The court denied Harris' petition on November 12, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-12/california-loses-bid-to-revisit-ruling-striking-gun-rules.html|title=California Loses Bid to Revisit Ruling Striking Gun Rules|author=Karen Gullo|work=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/27/california-attorney-general-tries-overturn-gun-car/|title=MILLER: California attorney general tries to overturn gun carry ruling in 9th Circuit|work=The Washingtion Times|accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-appeals-ninth-circuit-concealed-weapons-permit |title=Attorney General Kamala D.

N2e, 1 October 2014 --&gt;

On December 3, 2014, the Ninth Circuit announced that a judge on the circuit made a ''sua sponte'' call for a vote on whether the case should be reheard ''en banc.'' The court gave the parties, and any [[Amici curiae]], 21 days to file briefs setting forth their positions whether the case should be reheard ''[[en banc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2014/12/03/10-5697112-03-2014B.pdf |format=PDF |title=Peruta v. San Diego County |publisher=Cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 26, 2015, the Ninth Circuit announced that they would hear the case, along with ''Richards v. Prieto'', ''en banc'', including setting aside the original rulings in the cases and stating that they were not to be used as case law. The cases were argued on June 16, 2015.

On June 9, 2016, the en banc court reversed the lower court ruling, saying that "there is no Second Amendment right for members of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public." &lt;ref name="824f3d919"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann E. Marimow|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/appeals-court-suspends-ruling-that-cast-doubt-on-dc-gun-control-law/2016/06/09/04295d2a-2e53-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html|title=Appeals court: No Second Amendment right to carry concealed firearms in public|newspaper=Washington Post|date=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''en banc'' ruling did not address the constitutionality of restrictions on [[open carry]], leaving that matter open to potential future litigation.

On June 23, 2016, the plaintiff-appellants petitioned the Ninth Circuit for a full-court re-hearing. On August 15, 2016, the Ninth Circuit denied the petition for a full-court ''en banc'' rehearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2016/08/15/10-56971%20PFR%20EB%20ORDER.pdf|title=Order for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|accessdate= August 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2017 the plaintiffs filed a petition for a [[Certiorari|''writ of certiorari'']] with the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ammoland.com/2017/01/nra-crpa-petition-u-s-supreme-court-hear-peruta-v-county-san-diego/#axzz4VfT9wyde|title=NRA &amp; CRPA Petition U.S. Supreme Court to Hear Peruta v. County of San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2017 the Supreme Court denied the writ, with Justice [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]], joined by Justice [[Neil Gorsuch|Gorsuch]], dissenting&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;We should have granted certiorari in this case. The approach taken by the ''en banc'' court is indefensible, and the petition raises important questions that this Court should address. I see no reason to await another case. ... [T]he Second Amendment's core purpose further supports this conclusion that the right to bear arms extends to public carry.  The Court in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller|Heller]]'' emphasized that "self-defense" is "the ''central component'' of the [Second Amendment] right itself." ... The Court's decision to deny certiorari in this case reflects a distressing trend: the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right. ... I do not think we should stand by idly while a State denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it. I respectfully dissent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department]] issued a press release on February 21, 2014 stating it will not seek review of the decision by the entire membership of judges sitting in the Ninth Circuit, and that, "Should the decision of the Ninth Circuit become final, the Sheriff's Department will begin to issue CCW's in situations where the applicant has met all other lawful qualifications and has requested a CCW for purposes of self-defense."&lt;ref name="Office of Media Relations"&gt;{{cite web|title=San Diego Sheriff's Decision Regarding Ninth Circuit's Opinion on CCWs | url=http://apps.sdsheriff.net/press/Default.aspx?FileLink=fce6dc6b-e015-4c15-8d6c-4e38b4e212e1 |publisher=Apps.sdsheriff.net| accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the court's original decision in 2014, the [[Orange County Sheriff's Department (California)|Orange County Sheriff's Department]] has loosened requirements for obtaining a concealed carry permit. Instead of requiring the applicant to have "good cause," the applicant need only to assert that a permit is needed for self-defense or personal safety.&lt;ref name="ocsheriff"&gt;{{cite news|last=Montero|first=David|title=Sheriff makes it easier for concealed weapon to be legal|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sheriff-602509-concealed-county.html|accessdate=2014-02-24|date=2014-02-21|publisher=The OC Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

'''Service of process''' is the procedure by which a party to a lawsuit gives an appropriate notice of initial legal action to another party (such as a defendant), [[court]], or [[Government agency|administrative body]] in an effort to exercise [[jurisdiction]] over that person so as to enable that person to respond to the proceeding before the court, body, or other tribunal.

Notice is furnished by delivering a set of court documents (called "[[legal process|process]]") to the person to be served.

==Service==
Each jurisdiction has rules regarding the appropriate service of process. Typically, a [[summons]] and other related documents must be served upon the defendant personally, or in some cases upon another person of suitable age and discretion at the person's residence or place of business or employment. In some cases, service of process may be effected through the mail as in some [[small claims court]] procedures. In exceptional cases, other forms of service may be authorized by procedural rules or court order, including service by publication when an individual cannot be located in a particular jurisdiction.

Proper service of process initially establishes [[personal jurisdiction]] of the court over the person served. If the defendant ignores further pleadings or fails to participate in the proceedings, then the court or administrative body may find the defendant in [[default (law)|default]] and award relief to the claimant, petitioner or plaintiff.  The defendant may contest the default in his or her home state.  Service of process must be distinguished from service of subsequent documents (such as [[pleading]]s and motion papers) between the parties to litigation.

Service of process in cases filed in the [[United States district court]]s is governed by Rule 4 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]]. In [[England and Wales]], the rules governing service of documents are contained within Part 6 of the [[Civil Procedure Rules 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/civil/procrules_fin/contents/parts/part06.htm|title=Justice.gov.uk|first=Ministry of|last=Justice|website=www.dca.gov.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050914185629/http://www.dca.gov.uk/civil/procrules_fin/contents/parts/part06.htm|archivedate=2005-09-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]] the rules vary from [[province]] to province and can be governed differently depending on what the type of case (i.e. family, small claims, criminal, etc.).

Service on a defendant who resides in a country outside the jurisdiction of the Court must comply with special procedures prescribed under the [[Hague Service Convention]], if the recipient's country is a signatory. Service on defendants in many [[South America]]n countries and some other countries is effected through the [[letter rogatory]] process. Where a defendant's whereabouts are unknown, the Court may permit service by publication, usually in a [[newspaper]].

==Manner of service==

===Substituted service===
When an individual party to be served is unavailable for personal service, many jurisdictions allow for '''substituted service'''. Substituted service allows the process server to leave service documents with another responsible individual, called a person of [[Suitable age and discretion#Service of process|suitable age and discretion]], such as a cohabiting adult or a teenager. Under the U.S. Federal Rules, substituted service may only be made at the [[abode]] or [[dwelling]] of the [[defendant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-ii-commencing-an-action-service-of-process-pleadings-motions-and-orders/rule-4-summons/|title=Rule 4 - Summons - Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; California, [[New York Statutes|New York]],&lt;ref name=NY&gt;N.Y. CPLR § 308 (2), (3), (4). Found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS New York State Assembly website], under CVP article 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois, and many other United States jurisdictions require that in addition to substituted service, the documents be mailed to the recipient.&lt;ref name=NY /&gt;  Substituted service often requires a serving party show that ordinary service is impracticable, that [[due diligence]] has been made to attempt to make personal service by delivery, and that substituted service will reach the party and effect notice.&lt;ref name=NY /&gt;

Another method of substituted service is "service by publication" also called "constructive service" in some jurisdictions. Service by publication is used to give "constructive notice" to a defendant who is intentionally absent, in hiding, or unknown (as a possible descendant of a former landowner), and only when allowed by a judge's order based on a sworn declaration of the inability to find the defendant after "due diligence" (trying hard).&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1928 law.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Service by publication is commonly used in a divorce action to serve a spouse who has disappeared without leaving a forwarding address. Service by publication usually involves placing the petition for divorce and the summons to a missing spouse in a local newspaper.

In divorce cases, most states that permit service by publication will require "due diligence" to locate the missing spouse to include: verifying with the post office that there is no forwarding address; contacting in writing all friends, relatives, and former employers of a spouse who may know his or her current address; checking all jails and prisons for any record of a spouse; and checking military records for a spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dwp/index.jsp|title=dmdc.osd.mil|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition, in some jurisdictions, substituted service may be effected through [[Motion (legal)|motion]] and [[public notice]], followed by sending the documents by [[certified mail]].&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. CPLR § 308 (5).&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts in at least two [[Canada|Canadian]] provincial jurisdictions have allowed for substituted service via [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb10/2012abqb10.html#par18 |title=CanLII - 2012 ABQB 10 (CanLII) |publisher=Canlii.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qccq/doc/2011/2011qccq10324/2011qccq10324.html#par19 |title=2011 QCCQ 10324 |publisher=CanLII |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] allowed service via [[Instagram]] and [[LinkedIn]]'s built-in messaging systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/legalfeeds/author/alex-robinson/toronto-lawyer-serves-claim-with-instagram-15294/|title=Toronto lawyer serves claim with Instagram|last=Robinson|first=Alex|date=February 2, 2018|work=[[Canadian Lawyer Magazine]]|access-date=February 2, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service by mail===
Service by mail is permitted by most U.S. jurisdictions for service on defendants located in other U.S. states or foreign countries. Service by mail is not available if the country of destination has filed objections to service by mail pursuant to the multinational [[Hague Service Convention]]. In [[California]], "Any person providing the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[California Department of Motor Vehicles]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with a mailing address shall … [[Implied consent|consent]] to
receive service of process …".&lt;ref&gt;[[California Vehicle Code]] § 1808.21(c)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary acceptance of service (United States)===
As a substitute for personal service by a process server, some jurisdictions may allow voluntary acceptance of service, also called '''waiver of service'''.  It means that the served party agrees to voluntarily acknowledge receipt of the [[complaint]] or [[petition]] without the need to engage a process server.

Acceptance or waiver of service is encouraged by some court systems, especially U.S. federal courts.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(2), when a defendant refuses to waive service "without good cause", the defendant can be held liable for the cost of personal service.

However, in general, individual service by a process server is the best way to effect service of process, as it completely avoids having to litigate the collateral issue of whether the defendant actually had good cause (or not) to not waive service.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Personal service by process server===
Personal service is service of process directly to the (or a) party named on the [[summons]], [[complaint]], or [[petition]]. In most [[lawsuit]]s in the United States, personal service is required to prove service.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Most states allow substituted service in almost all lawsuits unless a corporation, LLC, LLP, or other business entity is being served; in those cases, personal service must be achieved by serving (in hand) the documents to the "registered agent" of a business entity.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Some states, e.g. Florida, do not require that the documents actually be handed to the individual. In California and most other states, the documents must be visible to the person being served, i.e., not in a sealed envelope.{{cn|date=November 2017}} If the individual refuses to accept service, flees, closes the door, etc., and the individual has been positively identified as the person to be served, the documents may be "drop served" (placed as close to the individual as possible); this is considered a valid service.{{cn|date=November 2017}} In the U.S., personal service of process has been the hallmark for initiating litigation for nearly 100 years, primarily because it guarantees actual notice to a defendant of a legal action against him or her.&lt;ref&gt;The National Law Review: The Continuing Relevance of Personal Service of Process&lt;/ref&gt;

===Common law systems in the United States===
[[File:TCSheriff.JPG|thumb|Personal service of civil documents is often done by [[sheriff|sheriff's deputies]].]]
In most states a person to serve the process simply must be 18 years of age or older and not a party to the litigation.

Most jurisdictions require or permit process to be served by a court official, such as a [[sheriff]], [[marshal]], [[constable]], or [[bailiff]]. There may be licensing requirements for private process servers, as is the case in New York City, Alaska, Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Montana, Nevada, and Oklahoma. Arizona process servers are required to apply for certification with the Clerk of the Superior Court in county in which they reside (residents only). Non resident applicants may apply in any county. Applicants must pass a written examination, state and federal criminal records check and be approved by the Presiding Judge or their designee. Applicants renewing their certification must file certificates of attendance of approved continuing education training totaling no less than thirty hours (ten hours per year). Texas process servers are currently certified by order of the Texas Supreme Court and are regulated through the Process Server Review Board, consisting of members of the industry authorized by the Supreme Court.

Other jurisdictions, require a court order allowing a private person to serve process. Many [[private investigator]]s perform process serving duties. Texas and Florida also have a required training course which must be completed prior to certification.

An example of such a license would be in [[Rhode Island]], where an applicant must complete 90 days of training with a constable that has 'full powers'. Once the 90 days of training is complete, a test is given at the local courthouse from the laws included in the constable manual. Once an applicant passed the written exam, one will be scheduled for an oral interview with the disciplinary board. If they find the applicant to be competent, they will pass a recommendation to the chief judge who will then swear in one with 'limited power'. These constables can only serve within the county they are appointed. After one year, a limited power constable can apply for his/her full powers to [[arrest]], [[Eviction|evict]], and be able to serve statewide.

In [[New York State]], personal process is ''required'' in [[divorce]] and similar [[Family law|matrimonial law]] actions, absent court permission.&lt;ref&gt;For N.Y. Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR) § 308 and Domestic Relations Law (DRL) § 232, see [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS  NY Assembly website]. Retrieved September 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific practice is that: {{quote|The defendant must be personally served with the divorce papers, unless the court grants some other means of service. Note that there are special requirements for service of process in a divorce action.}} See CPLR 308 and DRL 232.

===Civil law systems===
In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, which include all of Continental Europe and most Asian countries, service of process is generally performed by the court. This may be done in person by a [[bailiff]], or by mail, depending on the jurisdiction.

===International service===
{{main article|Hague Service Convention}}
International service of foreign judicial and extrajudicial documents is governed in general by the 1965 [[Hague Service Convention]]. Prior to the enactment of the Hague Service Convention, service of process in civil cases was generally effected by a [[letter rogatory]], a formal request from the court in the country where proceedings were initiated or underway to a court in another country where the defendant resided. This procedure generally required the use of [[consular]] and [[diplomacy|diplomatic channels]] as the request had to be made to the foreign minister (Secretary of State in the United States) of the defendant's country by the foreign minister of the originating court.

Since 1965, member states designate a central authority for service of process and requests go directly there.  In addition, many states allow some type of service directly by mail or personal service by a person otherwise authorized to service process without involvement of local courts.

==Agent for acceptance of service==
In some instances, delivery to an '''agent for acceptance of service''' or "[[registered agent]]" can substitute for personal service on the principal party to be served. The Registered Agent is a person or company authorized in advance to accept service on behalf of the served party. For example, most [[corporation]]s are required by local law to maintain a local agent of record for acceptance of service in each jurisdiction where they actively conduct business with the public. The identity of the agent for service can usually be ascertained by searching company filings with appropriate state corporate records or business registration agencies (often the business entity division of a state's [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]]. Generally, these business registration records are searchable by the public on the Secretary of State's website.

In the UK an agent for acceptance of service is generally known as a [[process agent]] and is a contractual relationship rather than a statutory one.

==Return of service==
Once service of process has been effected, the responsible officer or process server must typically file a '''return of service''' or '''proof of service''' or "affidavit of service" with the court (or convey one to the plaintiff to file with the court). The return of service indicates the time and place at which service was effected, the person served, and any additional information needed to establish that service was properly made. It is signed by the process server, and operates as ''prima facie'' evidence that service of process was effectively made.

Arizona Court Rules also require that any return or affidavit of service filed by a process server other than a sheriff or constable shall clearly state the county in which the process server is registered. Many Arizona process servers include their Certification Number on their returns/affidavits. Certification Numbers are assigned by the Clerk of the Superior Court in each county.

Many states have process serving laws that govern the way service of process is effected, the licensing requirements to effect service, the forms to be used and the time deadlines that service of process may be accomplished upon individual respondents and corporations. These differences may be vast. For example, in [[New York (state)|New York]], service of process may require licensing of the process server; in [[Pennsylvania]], process may only be served by the [[Sheriffs in the United States#Pennsylvania|sheriff]] or a sheriff's deputy in most cases (except in [[Philadelphia]], where process may be served "by any competent adult");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/231/chapter400/chap400toc.htm|title=Pa. R.C.P. 400-400.1, available at pacode.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[New Jersey]], process is effected if, after making an affidavit that diligent efforts to effect personal service had failed, the party sends two copies of the pleading by mail&amp;mdash;one by regular mail and one by certified mail, return receipt requested&amp;mdash;and either the certified mail receipt is returned signed or the certified mail envelope is returned unclaimed and the regular mail is not returned to the sender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/r4-4.html|title=N.J. Ct. R. 4:4-4(b)(1)(C), available at judiciary.state.nj.us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, there are specific procedures and rules for most courts, from local [[small claims court]]s to United States District courts. Each court has specific rules, forms, guidelines and procedures which must be followed in order to successfully effect service of process. Failure to follow these guidelines may deem the attempted service improper. Indeed, many defendants in court hearings use the affirmative defense of "I was not served" as an often successful line of defense in any lawsuit. Not surprisingly, this defense tends to be effective in many cases because service of process upon defendant did not follow legal procedure. As for United States federal courts, service of process rules are in the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]], upon which most state service of process laws are based.

===Jurisdiction===
It is universal that the laws of service of process must follow the laws that apply to the court that issues the process. A bias or confusion occurs in many jurisdictions where service is made. In Florida, for example, process servers seem to suggest Florida laws apply to all service of process made within the territory of Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0000-0099/0048/0048.html |title=Statutes &amp; Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine |publisher=Leg.state.fl.us |date=1990-07-01 |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this reference, section 48.195 implies an authority of Florida process servers to serve foreign process. This was added to allow sheriffs to serve foreign process within limitations as the section provides, but it does not, and cannot give exclusivity, to ''state sanctioned licensed approved process servers to foreign process''. This interpretation, however prevalent and beneficial to Florida process servers, is false.

Florida governs only those processes that are issued from ''Florida courts''. An example would be a Wisconsin court process to be served upon a person in Florida. Wisconsin statutes would dictate the service requirements to the Florida participant. Simply, a person must be uninterested, a resident of Florida, and over the age of 18. This is not a popular position as many process servers who have a local Florida license prefer, for reasons of economics, to be considered the only legitimate process server for such a cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.legis.wi.gov/statutes/statutes/801/10/1 |title=Wisconsin Legislature: 801.10(1) |publisher=Docs.legis.wi.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Wisconsin example is in the majority for all states in the US regarding out of state service in their jurisdiction. There are however a small number of states, such as Arizona, that permit a person of one state (e.g. Arizona) to serve another person in another state (e.g. Florida).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://government.westlaw.com/linkedslice/default.asp?SP=AZR-1000 |title=Arizona Court Rules |publisher=Government.westlaw.com |date=2010-05-15 |accessdate=2012-09-03}} Arizona Court Rules Rule "4.2(b). Direct Service Service of process may be made outside the state but within the United States in the same manner provided in Rule 4.1(d)-(l) of these Rules by a person authorized to serve process under the law of the state where such service is made. This Arizona rule acknowledges other states to determine an authorized process server of their service of process."]&lt;/ref&gt; The aforementioned Arizona rule is an exception to the majority of other states that require a process server to be 18 and over and an uninvolved party to serve its process in another state. Arizona law has never been challenged on the grounds of sovereignty as Arizona's statutes appears to give its courts legislative and judicial authority for its people to serve a person in a foreign state government.

It should be noted that in states where Indian reservations are located, the state generally has no legal jurisdiction over Indian Territory as recognized tribes enjoy legal status as a sovereign nation. Thus a process server certified under the authority of the state (i.e. Arizona) cannot serve a party to a case while that person is on the reservation unless the tribal council consents to permit service.

===Trespassing===
In nearly every state of the [[United States]], process servers are restricted from [[trespass]]ing on property as a means of serving process. Such invasions, no matter how innocuous, are regarded as not only invalid, but illegal and may result in penalties for offenders. [[Gated community|Gated communities]] and apartment buildings have created a difficulty for process servers; however, most are required to allow process servers to enter them. However, this fact may be overcome where the process server is in the direct employment of a law enforcement agency, such as the U.S. Marshals Service, a county sheriff's department, or other law enforcement agency having responsibility to serve documents.

In [[California]], "Registered Process Servers" are granted "...a limited exemption against trespassing in gated communities." This allows servers to enter a [[private property]] for a reasonable period of time to attempt service of process. In California, gated communities which are "...staffed by a [[security guard]], or where access is controlled, must allow a Registered Process Server to enter for service of process upon presenting valid identification, and indicating to which address the process server is going." This does not prevent the security guard from contacting the resident and alerting them that a process server is on his way to their residence. § 415.21 Access to gated communities.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person shall be granted access to a gated community ... for the purpose of performing lawful service of process, upon identifying to the guard the person or persons to be served, and upon displaying a current driver's license or other identification, and one of the follow: (1) a badge [applies to sheriffs and marshals] (2) evidence of current registration as a process server...
''''''(b)This section shall only apply to a gated community which is staffed, at the time service of process is attempted, by a guard or other ... personnel assigned to control access...it does not apply to a private residence that has posted no trespassing signs''''''

In [[Washington (state)|Washington]], "Registered Process Servers" are granted a limited exemption or [[affirmative defense]] against trespassing:
{{quote|The actor was attempting to serve legal process which includes any document required or allowed to be served upon persons or property, by any statute, rule, ordinance, regulation, or court order, excluding delivery by the mails of the United States. This defense applies only if the actor did not enter into a private residence or other building not open to the public and the entry onto the premises was reasonable and necessary for service of the legal process.|RCW 9A.52.090 (4)}}

===Deadlines===
Most states have a deadline for completing service of process after filing of the [[summons]] and [[complaint]]. In New York, for example, service must be completed in 120 days after filing for almost all cases,&lt;ref&gt;NY CPLR § 306-b, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS NY Assembly website]. Retrieved September 24, 2008. (The exception is in [[election law]], which is 15 days.)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hawaii State Circuit Court rule 28 requires service in a civil lawsuit must be effected within 6 months from commencing suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.hi.us/jud/ctrules/rcch.pdf|format=PDf|title=Hawaii Circuit Court Rule 28|website=www.state.hi.us/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dies non juridicum''===
Some states prohibit the delivery or serving of documents on Sundays, holidays, and/or election days (''[[List of Latin phrases: D|dies non juridicum]]''). However, some states will allow the service of documents under special circumstances. One such circumstance is when the service of process is pursuant to a court order.

According to various laws,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} service of process cannot be performed on Sundays in Florida (unless with a court order), Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee (unless with a court order), Texas, Virginia, or West Virginia. It can also not be performed on election days or at a place of religious service on Sunday in Michigan, or on holidays in Minnesota. Finally, in New York, process cannot be served on Saturday upon a person who keeps Saturday as holy time.

===GPS certification===
New York’s City Council passed a bill toughening rules for entities that hunt down people and serve them with legal papers, including a requirement that they electronically log every attempt.

The legislation also ensures that deceitful process servers who dump papers instead of serving them — a trick known as “[[sewer service]]" — could be liable if the people they were supposed to serve then turn and sue them.

Under the new legislation, process servers must pass an exam showing they understand the law. They also must electronically log their attempts to serve papers using some kind of GPS device, and keep those records in a database for seven years.

'''Social innovations''' are new [[strategies]], [[concept]]s, [[idea]]s and organizations that aim to meet [[social]] needs resulting from [[working condition]]s, [[education]], [[community development]], and [[health]]. These ideas are created with the goal of extending and strengthening [[civil society]]. Social innovation includes the social ''processes'' of innovation, such as open source methods and techniques and also the [[innovation]]s which have a [[social purpose]]—like [[activism]], [[online volunteering]], [[microcredit]], or [[Distance education|distance learning]].

Prominent innovators associated with the term include Pakistani [[Akhter Hameed Khan]], Bangladeshi [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]], the founder of [[Grameen Bank]] which pioneered the concept of [[microcredit]] for supporting innovations in many developing countries such as Asia, Africa and Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Domanski, Monge, Quitiaquez, Rocha|title=Innovación Social en Latinoamérica|date=2016|publisher=Corporación Universitaria Minuto de Dios|isbn=978-958-763-196-8|url=http://sfs.tu-dortmund.de/Publikationen/Innovacion_Social_en_Latinoamerica.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired programs like the [[Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foreign |first=Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2226809/Info-Ladies-bringing-internet-bike-remote-villages-Bangladesh.html |title=Info Ladies bringing the internet by bike to the remote villages of Bangladesh &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2012-11-02 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asafeworldforwomen.org/global-news/asia/bangladesh/3284-internet-info-ladies.html |title=Internet rolls into Bangladesh villages on a bike |publisher=Asafeworldforwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh |title=Info Ladies – Riding Internet into Rural Bangladesh! |publisher=Amader Kotha |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2014-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317182454/http://amaderkotha.com.bd/2012/11/08/info-ladies-riding-internet-into-rural-bangladesh/ |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Dnet (A Social Enterprise)]]. 

==Focus and application==
Social Innovation has an inter-sectoral approach and is universally applicable. Social Innovations are launched by a variety of actors, including research institutions, companies and independent organizations, which tend to use their respective definitions of Social Innovation. Therefore, it is worth discussing what distinguishes it from other forms of social work or [[innovation]]. 

Social Innovation focuses on the process of innovation, how innovation and change take shape (as opposed to the more traditional definition of innovation, giving priority to the internal organization of firms and their productivity). It likewise centers on new work and new forms of cooperation (business models),&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;Klievink, B., &amp; Janssen, M. (2014). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10580530.2014.923268 "Developing multi-layer information infrastructures: advancing social innovation through public-private governance"]  "Information Systems Management" 31:240–249&lt;/ref&gt; especially on those that work towards the attainment of a sustainable society.

The Young Foundation, in order to distinguish between social and business innovation, stressed that social innovation is developed and diffused via organisations, whose primary purposes are not centred on mere profit maximisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Innovation. What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated|last=Mulgan|first=Tucker|publisher=The Young Foundation|year=2007|isbn=|location=London|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of European Policy Advisers more precisely defined social innovation as socially oriented in both ends and means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=). Empowering People, Driving Change: Social Innovation in the European Union|last=Hubert|first=A,|publisher=BEPA – Bureau of European Policy Advisers|year=2010|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these influential definitions, social innovation is characterised by: the capacity to address social needs that traditional policy seems increasingly unable to tackle; the empowerment of groups and individuals; and the willingness to change social relations. Hence, social innovation is often presented as a way to increase the quality of social services and their cost-effectiveness, offering equivalent, if not superior, outcomes despite considerable budget constraints.

Social innovation can take place within [[government]]; the for-profit sector, the [[nonprofit]] sector (also known as the third sector), or in the spaces between them. Research has focused on the types of platforms needed to facilitate such cross-sector collaborative social innovation.

[[Social entrepreneurship]], like social enterprise, is typically in the nonprofit sector excluding both for-profit and public organizations. Both social entrepreneurship and social enterprise are important contributions to social innovation by creating social value and introducing new ways of achieving goals. Social entrepreneurship brings "new patterns and possibilities for innovation" and are willing to do things that existing organizations are not willing to do.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"&gt;James A. Phills Jr., Kriss Deiglmeier, &amp; Dale T. Miller "Rediscovering Social Innovation", Stanford Social Innovation Review Fall 2008.[http://innovationsociale.lu/sites/default/files/2008_Rediscovering%20Social%20Innovation_Phills%26al.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social innovation is often an effort of mental [[creativity]] which involves fluency and flexibility from a wide range of disciplines. The act of social innovation in a sector is mostly connected with diverse disciplines within the society. The social innovation theory of 'connected difference' emphasizes three key dimensions to social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan. Geoff. [http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx "Social Innovation: What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated: Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, University of Oxford"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902021840/http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/research/Pages/socialinnovationpaper.aspx |date=2012-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, innovations are usually new combinations or hybrids of existing elements, rather than completely new. Second, their practice involves cutting across organizational or disciplinary boundaries. Lastly, they leave behind compelling new relationships between previously separate individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;Nambisan, S. [http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/platforms_for_collaboration "Platforms for Collaboration"], Stanford Social Innovation Review, Summer 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Social innovation is also gaining visibility within academia.&lt;ref&gt;Howaldt, J./ Schwarz, M.
[http://www.internationalmonitoring.de/fileadmin/Downloads/Trendstudien/Trends_V2/IMO-MAG%20Howaldt_final_mit_cover.pdf "Social Innovation: Concepts, research fields and international trends"], IMO international monitoring, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, a subdomain of social innovation has been defined in relation to the introduction of digital technologies. The subdomain is called digital social innovation and refers to "a type of social and collaborative innovation in which innovators, users and communities collaborate using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions for a wide range of social needs and at a scale and speed that was unimaginable before the rise of the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;F. Bria, DSI4EU final report, 2015, available at: http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/dsireport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Social innovation was discussed in the writings of figures such as [[Peter Drucker]] and [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (founder of the [[Open University]] and dozens of other organizations) in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;see for example Gavron, Dench e ds ''Young at 80'', Carcanet Press, London, 1995 for a comprehensive overview of one of the world's most successful social innovators&lt;/ref&gt; It also appeared in the work of French writers in the 1970s, such as [[Pierre Rosanvallon]], [[Jacques Fournier]], and [[Jacques Attali]].&lt;ref&gt;Chambon, J.-L, David, A. and Devevey, J.-M (1982), Les Innovations Sociales, Presses Universitaires de France, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; However, the themes and concepts in social innovation existed long before. [[Benjamin Franklin]], for example, talked about small modifications within the social organization of communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15326934CRJ1402_11 |title=Mumford, M.D. (2002) Social Innovation: Ten Cases from Benjamin Franklin, '&amp;#39;Creativity Research Journal'&amp;#39;, 14(2), 253-266 |publisher=Leaonline.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could help to solve everyday problems. Many radical 19th century [[reform]]ers like [[Robert Owen]], founder of the cooperative movement, promoted innovation in the social field and all of the great sociologists including [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] focused attention on broader processes of [[social change]].  Other theories of innovation became prominent in the 20th century, many of which had social implications, without putting social progress at the center of the theory. [[Joseph Schumpeter]], for example, addressed the process of [[innovation]] directly with his theory of [[creative destruction]] and his definition of entrepreneurs as people who combined existing elements in new ways to create a new product or service. Beginning in the 1980s, writers on technological change increasingly addressed how social factors affect technology diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;notably in the writings of [[Christopher Freeman]], Carlotta Perez, Ian Miles and others&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "Rediscovering Social Innovation" mentions how social innovations are dependent on history and the change in institutions. The article discusses the ten recent social innovations reflecting current change to include:
* '''Charter Schools:''' Charter schools are a social innovation that provides an alternative avenue for students to continue to develop and build upon their educational foundation without many of the issues prominent in the public school system. These primary and secondary schools are publicly funded and operate independently, which allows the teachers and parents to collaboratively develop alternative teaching methods for their students as related regulations are less stringent for Charter Schools.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Charter School." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, n.d. Web. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Community-Centered Planning:''' This social innovation allows communities to plan and develop systems that cater solutions to their specific local needs by using their historical knowledge and other local resources.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Emissions Trading:''' The Emissions Trading program was designed to address issues associated with the continuous increase in pollution. The program provides solutions such as setting a cap on the amount that certain pollutants can be emitted, and implementing a permit system to control the amount of pollution produced by each participating business. If a business needs to use more pollution than permitted, it can purchase credits from a business that has not emitted its maximum permitted amount. The goal of the Emissions Trading program is that, over time and with increased awareness, society will limit the types and the numbers of pollutants emitted to what is only necessary.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Fair Trade:''' Products including coffee, sugar, and chocolate are currently being traded without high standards that result in tough conditions for farmers and a less sustainable environment. Fair trade is a movement that certifies traders to exchange with the farmers that produce these products. The idea behind this movement is that by being paid a living-wage, being able to meet social and environmental standards and promoting "environmental sustainability, the lives of these farmers will be improved.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Habitat Conservation Plans:''' Habitat Conservation Plans is an effort by the US Fish and Wild Life Service and the Environmental Protection Agency to protect species and their endangerment by providing economical incentives to conserve their habitats and protect these species from endangerment.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Individual Development Accounts:''' This social innovation is made to support the working poor with saving decisions that they have made to better enhance their lives. This initiative will give $2 per every $1 saved by the working poor for College tuition, purchasing a home, starting a business, and other similar and productive initiatives. This is made possible by philanthropic, government and corporate sponsors that donate to this cause.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''International Labor Standards:''' Labor standards differ country-to-country, with some agreeably better than others. In effort to internationally align these, the International Labor Organization, participating governments, and employees contributed to the development of standards that protect workers’ rights to freedom, equity, security, and human dignity".&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Microfinance:''' This social innovation is created to support those financially unable to gain access to financial services such as banking, lending, and insurance. The ultimate goal of Microfinance is to enable an escape from poverty by helping to improve the living conditions and financial viability among the impoverished program participants.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Socially Responsible Investing:''' "An investment strategy that attempts to maximize both financial and social returns. Investors generally favor businesses and other organizations whose practices support environmental sustainability, human rights, and consumer protection."&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;
* '''Supported Employment:''' Supported Employment is a social innovation geared towards helping disabled or disadvantaged workers who are un- or under-employed due to their condition obtain suitable employment. The Support Employment service provides access to job coaches, transportation, assistive technology, specialized job training, and individual tailored supervision in effort to help program participants become more competitive applicants and better prepared overall for the job market.&lt;ref name="James A 2008"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Over the last two decades social innovation has gained significant popularity as a strategy to tackle new social risks including population ageing and its health correlates (Hubert, 2010; Mulgan et al., 2007, 2010; Murray, Caulier-Grice and Mulgan, 2010). However, as other concepts recently developed within the academic debate – among them, [[social capital]] (Ferragina, 2012) – social innovation might soon turn out to be simply another way to juxtapose the qualifier "social" to the private sector jargon, in order to avoid heated discussions on structural inequalities (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"&gt;Grisolia, Francesco and Ferragina, Emanuele. (2015), "Social Innovation on the Rise: yet another buzzword in a time of austerity?" (Salute e società, Vol. 1(2015), pp. 169-179).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of ‘neoliberal austerity’, a strong call in favour of social innovation might hide the attempt to shift public attention from structural deficiencies and disparities to individual and group responsibility, following the vision: "doing more with less". In order to guarantee universal coverage and universal social rights, however, the welfare state system cannot be managed with the logic of mere cost-effectiveness alone (Grisolia and Ferragina, 2015).&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; A Universal coverage is the precondition for any well-functioning economy, not the other way around. As such, the enhancement of "politically motivated policies under the pretence of budget cuts" can be particularly dangerous in its consequences for population health (Kleinert and Horton, 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;1074). Social innovation per se might not be able to substantially tackle pressing social needs. Rather, the all-innovating and self-empowering jargon currently in vogue might disguise a dangerous inattention to structural inequalities, adversely affecting health outcomes across the board, but especially of the poorest. Among the therapies prescribed by the neoliberal orthodoxy – liberalisation, deregulation, devolution, individual or group empowerment – social innovation might soon reveal itself as a convenient buzzword, an eclectic concept to dissimulate political choices, legitimated by the doctrine of budgetary constraints.&lt;ref name="Grisolia and Ferragina 2000"/&gt; The redistribution of resources "from past to present generations" – keeping constant the overall public spending – and the shift from a "transfer-based" to a "service-based" welfare state would represent a truly innovative approach to social policy, offering a credible and responsible alternative to the magic wand of social innovation.

== Developments since 2000 ==
Academic research, [[blogs]] and websites feature social innovation, along with organizations working on the boundaries of research and practical action. Topics include:

* '''Innovation in public services''' was pioneered particularly in some [[Scandinavia]]n and [[List of Asian countries|Asian countries]]. Governments are increasingly recognizing that innovation requires [[healthcare]], schooling and [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/innovation/index.asp Innovation in the Public Sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110162352/http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/innovation/index.asp |date=2006-11-10 }} an overview of thinking about innovation in the public sector, published by the UK government's Strategy Unit in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/node/576 Ready or Not?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070618163301/http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/node/576 |date=2007-06-18 }} published by The Young Foundation in 2007 about the need for public sector organizations to innovate&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional support===
The US created an Office for Social Innovation in the White House, which is funding projects that combine public and private resources.&lt;ref name=economist810/&gt; with foundations that support social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Kohli, J. and Geoff Mulgan (2007) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/capital-ideas-july-2010 Capital Ideas. How to Generate Innovation in the Public Sector]. The Young Foundation and Center for American Progress&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the US government listed 11 investments made by its '[[Social Innovation Fund]]', with public funding more than matched by philanthropic organizations. This fund focuses on partnerships with charities, social enterprises, and business.&lt;ref name="economist810"&gt;{{cite news

In addition to pioneered efforts by institutions such as the Harvard Business School's Initiative on Social Enterprise (launched 1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/socialenterprise/ |title=The Social Enterprise Initiative at Harvard Business School |publisher=Hbs.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Said Business School's Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship (launched 2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/ideas-impact/skoll |title=The Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, Said Business School, University of Oxford |publisher=Sbs.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  INSEAD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/centres/social_entrepreneurship/ |title=INSEAD Social Entrepreneurship Programme |publisher=Insead.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other universities now offer short-term programs in Social Innovation, and a few such as [https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/professional-practice/mst-social-innovation/ Cambridge Judge Business School], University of Cambridge and Goldsmiths, University of London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-social-entrepreneurship/ |title=The Goldsmiths MA Programme in Social Entrepreneurship, University of London |publisher=Gold.ac.uk |date=2014-04-16 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer Masters courses dedicated entirely to the study of theory and practice in relation to social entrepreneurship and innovation.

Public policy makers support social innovation in the UK, Australia, China and Denmark, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Mulgan, Ali, Tucker; ''Social innovation: what it is, why it matters, how it can be accelerated, published by Said Business School, Oxford, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union’s innovation strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm |title=Home page - Innovation Union - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2014-05-13 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first well-funded research and development strategy to emphasize social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, R., Caulier- Grice and Geoff Mulgan (2010) [http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 The Open Book of Social Innovation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008044055/http://www.youngfoundation.org/publications/reports/the-open-book-social-innovation-march-2010 |date=2010-10-08 }}. The Young Foundation and NESTA&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the South Australian government, led by Premier and Social Inclusion Minister Mike Rann, embraced a ten-year social innovation strategy with big investments and a focus on reform in areas such as homelessness, school retention, mental health and disability services.

The Common Ground&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonground.org.au&lt;/ref&gt; and Street to Home homelessness initiatives and the Australian Centre for Social Innovation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tacsi.org,au&lt;/ref&gt; were established in Adelaide and many reforms trialed in South Australia have been adopted nationally throughout Australia. This initiative, headed by Monsignor David Cappo, South Australia's Social Inclusion Commissioner, was advised by 'Thinkers in Residence' [[Geoff Mulgan]] and New York social entrepreneur [[Rosanne Haggerty]].

== Role in curbing corruption ==
Lin and Chen, in "The Impact of Societal and Social innovation: a case-based approach" have argued that social innovation's goal is to produce actions that are "socially valuable and good for many".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956953682|title=The impact of societal and social innovation : a case-based approach|last=Yeh-Yun,|first=Lin, Carol|others=Chen, Jeffrey,|isbn=9789811017667|location=Singapore|oclc=956953682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In governance, its main role is to enhance and maximize the trust of citizens through active involvement in society, whether in the public or private sphere.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Social innovation's role in curbing corruption is carried out through two main mediums. Firstly, it is institutionalized through actors (in the public and the private sectors), and secondly, it is executed with new tools available, specifically ICTs.

=== Public participation, governmental action and the private sector against corruption ===

==== Grassroots involvement ====
"Corruption cannot be tackled from the top, it has to be confronted from the grassroots"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/06/corruption-confronted-grassroots-john-githongo-kenya|title='Corruption has to be confronted from the grassroots' {{!}} Madeleine Bunting|last=Bunting|first=Madeleine|date=2011-05-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[John Githongo]], a Kenyan member of [[Transparency International]]. The Stanford Social Innovation Review develops that grassroots innovations emerge through a combination of social and ethical capital. That is especially true when the system in which they lie fails to accommodate to people's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/tapping_the_entrepreneurial_potential_of_grassroots_innovation|title=Tapping the Entrepreneurial Potential of Grassroots Innovation (SSIR)|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fight against corruption, individuals or groups of citizens have used their position to lead battles against corruption. An example is the case of RosPil.net, a [[crowdsourcing]] website relying on anonymous tips and alerts to uncover and expose corruption in Russia,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carnegie.ru/2010/12/08/navalny-effect-rospil.net-pub-42105|title=The Navalny Effect: RosPil.net|last=Petrov|first=Nikolay|work=Carnegie Moscow Center|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether in the private or the public sector. The collective action permits a growing flow of information and offers, on a daily basis, around three promising tip-offs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another example is the initiative Agenda Pública, a Civil Society [[Civil society organisation|Organisation]], which is paving way for transparent governance in Brazil by relying on the education of the country's public administrators,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/06/where-inequality-persists-social-entrepreneurs-can-step-in-to-bridge-the-gap/|title=Where inequality persists, social entrepreneurs can step in to bridge the gap|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in more remote and isolated rural areas. Agenda Pública trained more than 5,000 administrators in policy development and basic infrastructure, in order to promote effective parameters for transparency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They do so by making sure that environmental needs and basic financial, education and overall health are met to circumvent bribing.

===== Women and corruption =====
A [[UNDP]] study conducted amongst women grassroots organization around the world demonstrated that "79% of women are better able to stand up against corruption if affiliated with a community group".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/Democratic%20Governance/Anti-corruption/Grassroots%20women%20and%20anti-corruption.pdf|title=Grassroots, Women and Anti-Corruption|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll suggested that electing women into power in countries heavily affected by corruption should be strongly accompanied by an affiliation to a mobilized grassroots women's group. Moreover, 83% of female respondents gave preferences to organized women's leadership to pursue anti-corruption policies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Innovation lies mainly in the introduction of programmes facilitating access to information as well as a governance agenda designed to augment women's engagement in [[participatory monitoring]].

==== Private sector ====
Rich and Moberg in "Beyond Governments" claim that companies need to take the largest step against corruption and must engage in collective governance in order to include public policy and standards in their core business. It would be way to promote good practices, specifically socially responsible investing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781351286077|title=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|website=www.taylorfrancis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 2006, the corporate sector fully funded and instigated the creation and development of the Business Code of Conduct for Combating Corruption in Malawi. It is considered an anti-corruption task force which works hand in hand with local groups, members of governments, civil society and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/august-2010/african-business-ending-corruption-%E2%80%98priority-number-one%E2%80%99|title=For African business, ending corruption is ‘priority number one’ {{!}} Africa Renewal Online|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governmental action ====
Anderson, Wu and Cho argue that good governance and its benefits can be extrapolated through effective e-governance. The simplification of administrative task and open data transparency, coupled with a clear policy on corruption can have a substantial impact.They also advocate for the strengthening of the delivery of services by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934513454|title=E-government strategy, ICT and innovation for citizen engagement|others=Anderson, Dennis (College teacher),, Wu, Robert (College teacher),, Cho, June-Suh, 1966-, Schroeder, Katja (Social media strategist),|isbn=9781493933501|location=New York, NY|oclc=934513454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the government introduced in 2016 the Open Government National Action Plan with one of the main aim being improved transparency. One of the main commitments is the establishment of an Anti-Corruption Innovation Hub. It is the use of social innovation to mobilize social actors and entrepreneurs against corruption. It is perceived that it will "catalyze and connect [an] innovation approach" while promoting the sharing of good practices.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18/uk-open-government-national-action-plan-2016-18#commitment-4-anti-corruption-innovation-hub|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their plan of action has been supported by Switzerland, Indonesia, Spain, Georgia, Australia, the UAE, France and Norway.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In Kosovo, Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo (SAEK) has been developed in order to strengthen the capacities of the Kosovo Anti-Corruption Agency (KAA). They are using innovative [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], web2.0 and social media technologies as a way to connect the government and younger generations by utilizing the potential of new technologies as well as "giving citizens the opportunity to voice concerns, share observations online and to make these visible to the public while raising the awareness  on the level and form of corruption occurring in Kosovo".&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undp.akvoapp.org/en/project/936/|title=Support to Anti-Corruption Efforts in Kosovo|last=UNDP|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAEK is considered a success as in the year it was launched, more than 1024 cases of corruption were reported (with half of them now resolved).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Information and communications technology as a tool for transparency ===
According to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development (part of the [[United Nations]]): "in addition to being an important technology sector in its own right, information and communication technology (ICT) is important for linking agents in the innovation system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developmentfinance.un.org/promoting-information-and-communication-technology-access-to-technology-for-all-and-social-innovation|title=Promoting information and communication technology, access to technology for all and social innovation {{!}} Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development|website=developmentfinance.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Open data and data mining ====
Open data is currently arising as a corruption-fighting mechanism. Indeed, as transparency in government data increases and becomes accessible to all, there will be opportunities for better accountability as it will increase the odds of uncovering governmental misconduct (specifically in government activities, budgets and expenditures for citizens). Its applications are various, including but not restricted to: following the money, open contracting, changing incentives and enabling cross-sector collaboration.

In 2015, one of the [[G20]] priorities was to reduce corruption and to promote good governance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.g20.utoronto.ca/2015/G20-Anti-Corruption-Open-Data-Principles.pdf|title=G20 Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles|last=G20|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anti-Corruption Working Group (ACWG) developed the Anti-Corruption Open Data Principles in order to leverage open data as one of the key actions to create and foster accountability and transparency. The principles are directly derived from the International Open Data Charter, which specifies the release and use of government data to reduce the reach of corruption.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Transparency International]] and the Web Foundation carried out a study on certain member countries of the G20 (Brazil, France, Germany, Indonesia and South Africa) to evaluate the effect of the principles on their fight against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/open_data_and_the_fight_against_corruption_in_indonesia|title=TI Publication - Open data and the fight against corruption in Indonesia|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia, for example ([[Corruption in Indonesia]]), it is estimated that corruption has cost up to IDR 31,077 trillion to the country.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Through public information availability, the country has tried to foster and promote its anti-corruption actions by utilizing its legal and institutional frameworks. Nonetheless, the access to datasets remains scarce while the lack of education amongst staff and citizens impedes the use of data as a tool against corruption.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Data mining]] was a crucial tool used in the famous anti-corruption investigation of the [[Panama Papers]] by way of the initiative of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/|title=The Panama Papers: Exposing the Rogue Offshore Finance Industry - ICIJ|work=ICIJ|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of data reached was 2.6 terabytes or 11.5 billion documents.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The implementation of a [[graph database]] allowed for better efficiency in the research and analysis of the documents as it found hidden links between accounts and owners that would have been hard to dig up otherwise. Mar Cabra, ICIJ Data Editor, claimed that the software used made them feel like: "we [had] superpowers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Neo4j|title=How the ICIJ Used Neo4j to Unravel the Panama Papers|date=2016-05-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAlu3ud2k_A|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social media ====
[[Social media]] is amongst the newest factors that has been shown by researchers to reduce the impact of corruption.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/968551831|title=Political scandal, corruption, and legitimacy in the age of social media|others=Çakır-Demirhan, Derya,, Demirhan, Kamil,|isbn=9781522520191|location=Hershey, Pennsylvania|oclc=968551831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media platforms have created a multi-way communication which contradicts the one-way channel of traditional media. It enables individuals to share experiences in a quick and cheap manner through its platforms. It facilitates exchanges of geographically separated individuals which makes it an important tool as a dialogue platform.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In many countries, cases of human rights violations and corruption have started to come out publicly. They challenge the status quo of the government holding the monopoly over information.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The World Economic Forum established in 2014 that social media could be a useful tool to drive anti-corruption because of its ability to advance commentary and information provision to the population.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/12/how-to-use-social-media-to-fight-corruption/|title=How to use social media to fight corruption|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also useful because of its key role in investigating through collective action participation. They use the example of I Paid A Bribe, an Indian website inviting users to input their daily contact with corruption and whether they paid a bribe or not to a public servant.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Mobile banking ====
[[Petty corruption]] can be fought by the emergence of cashless payments, and more generally in a cashless economy.

In Kenya, [[M-Pesa]] was launched to allow people to transfer money through mobile phones.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/21/africa/mpesa-10th-anniversary/index.html|title=M-Pesa: Kenya's mobile success story turns 10|last=CNN|first=Kieron Monks,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by almost two-thirds of the population and is gaining momentum as it is opening its technology to other countries (Tanzania for example).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

As traffic police is seen as one of the most notorious sources of corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000189201/i-saw-traffic-officers-extort-bribes-president-tells-top-police-bosses|title=I saw traffic officers extort bribes, President tells top police bosses|last=Reporter|first=Standard|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; M-Pesa proposed to create cashless payments on public buses to avoid the extortion of bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28106004|title=Kenya's buses to go cashless|date=2014-07-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are currently some logistical and regulatory problems preventing it from getting traction, [[mobile banking]] is seen as a potential tool to fight petty corruption, specifically if it is accompanied by the proper framework for legislative action and [[good governance]].
==Local and regional development==
Literature on social innovation in relation to territorial/[[Regional development|regional]] development covers innovation in the [[social economy]], i.e. strategies for satisfaction of human needs; and innovation in the sense of transforming and/or sustaining [[social relations]], especially [[governance]] relations at the regional and local level. Beginning in the late 1980s, Jean-Louis Laville and [[Frank Moulaert]] researched social innovation.&lt;ref name="Laville, J 1994"&gt;Laville, J.-L. (Ed.) (1994) L’économie solidaire, une perspective internationale, Desclée de Brouwer, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylorandfrancis.metapress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;eissn=1360-0591&amp;volume=37&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=289 |title=Moulaert, F. and Sekia, F. (2003) Territorial Innovation Models: a Critical Survey, '&amp;#39;Regional Studies'&amp;#39;, 37(3), 289-302 |publisher=Taylorandfrancis.metapress.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]] CRISES&lt;ref name="CRISES"&gt;[http://www.crises.uqam.ca/pages/en/ CRISES] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214164731/http://www.crises.uqam.ca/pages/en/ |date=December 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; initiated this type of research. Another, larger project was SINGOCOM&lt;ref name="users.skynet.be"&gt;[http://users.skynet.be/bk368453/singocom/index2.html Social Innovation, Governance, and Community Building] (2002–2004)&lt;/ref&gt; a [[European Commission]] [[FP5|Framework 5]] project, which pioneered so-called "Alternative Models for Local Innovation" (ALMOLIN). These models were further elaborated through community actions covered by KATARSIS&lt;ref name="KATARSIS Homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katarsis.ncl.ac.uk/ |title=KATARSIS Homepage |publisher=Katarsis.ncl.ac.uk |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SOCIAL POLIS.&lt;ref name="Social Polis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialpolis.eu/ |title=Social Polis |publisher=Socialpolis.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent works focus on the societal role of the economic life in terms of innovations in social practices and social relations at the local and regional levels. Social Innovation, therefore, is increasingly seen as a process and a strategy to foster human development through solidarity, cooperation, and cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="MacCallum, D. 2009"&gt;MacCallum, D., Moulaert, F., Hillier, J. and S. Vicari (Eds) (2009) ''Social Innovation and Territorial Development''. Ashgate, Aldershot. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-7233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masselin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masselin |first=Matthieu |url=http://www.paristechreview.com/2011/12/16/social-innovation-future-economy/ |title='&amp;#39;Is Social Innovation the Future of Economy?'&amp;#39;, ParisTech Review, Dec. 2011 |publisher=Paristechreview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU funded URBACT programme is designed to help cities to exchange and learn around urban policies.  The URBACT methodology can be seen as a social innovation action planning approach. A typical URBACT network would have ten cities working on a specific theme such as active inclusion or regenerating disadvantaged neighbourhoods.  They examine good practice and then working through a local support group use the results to inform their local action plan.&lt;ref&gt;Jegou F., Bonneau M., (2015) [http://urbact.eu/sites/default/files/03_socialinn-web.pdf Social Innovation in Cities - Urbact II Capitalisation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Innovation Europe&lt;ref name="Socialinnovationeurope.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialinnovationeurope.eu |title=Home &amp;#124; Social Innovation Europe |publisher=Socialinnovationeurope.eu |date=2014-05-15 |accessdate=2014-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; initiative, funded by the European Commission's Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry, was set up to map social innovation at a European level, by creating a directory of grass-roots examples of social innovation from across the 27 member states.

The European Commission funded the SELUSI study between 2008 - 2013 that looked at over 550 social ventures and examined how these insights can spark change and innovation at a much larger scale. It looked at business models of social ventures in five countries - UK being one of them – identifying which specific practices evolved by social ventures are particularly successful, and how and by whom – be it social enterprise, public sector body or mainstream business – they can be most effectively scaled-up.

The European Commission has launched a new initiative (project) in 2013 under FP7 funding, with the aim to build a network of incubators for social innovation across regions and countries. This network facilitates identification of 300 social innovation examples and facilitates its scaling. The network is organised in a way to identify new models for scaling of social innovations across various geographical clusters in collaboration with each other, communicating the ideas, finding the tools and funds, developing business plans and models in order to promote the new promising ideas throughout Europe.

* A guide also exists that provides a way to promote social innovations at a local or regional level.&lt;ref name="s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu"&gt;''The Guide to Social Innovation''.

The '''Special Roads Act 1949''' (c.32) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that:
*Authorised the construction of [[special road]]s (that became known as '''[[motorways]]''')
*Allowed these roads to be restricted to specific types of vehicles

The Special Roads Act was repealed and replaced by the [[Highways Act 1959]], and later the [[Highways Act 1980]].  It did not apply to [[Northern Ireland]].

In '''''Stone v. Graham''''', 449 U.S. 39 (1980), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that a [[Kentucky]] [[statute]] was unconstitutional and in violation of the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]], because it lacked a nonreligious,  legislative purpose. The statute required the posting of a copy of the [[Ten Commandments]] on the wall of each public classroom in the [[Kentucky|state]]. While the copies of the Ten Commandments were purchased with private funding, the Court ruled that because they were being placed in public classrooms they were in violation of the [[First Amendment]].

==Opinion of the Court==

The Court held that the Kentucky statute that required the Ten Commandments to be posted in school classrooms was in violation of the First Amendment. To interpret the First Amendment, the Court rested on the precedent established in ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' and the three-part "Lemon test". The Court concluded that because "requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school rooms has no secular legislative purpose," it is unconstitutional.

The Court approached the case through the lens created in ''Lemon v. Kurtzman''. They agreed that if Kentucky's statute broke any of the three guidelines outlined in the Lemon test, the statute would be in violation of the Establishment Clause. The majority voiced that The Commandments convey a religious undertone, because they concern "the religious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day."  But since "the Commandments are [not] integrated into the school curriculum, where the Bible may constitutionally be used in an appropriate study of history," they have no secular purpose and a definite religious purpose.

The Court concluded that even though The Commandments were paid for by a private institution and even though they were "merely posted on the wall ... the mere posting of the copies under the auspices of the legislature provides the 'official support of the State ... Government' that the Establishment Clause prohibits."  Even though the Commandments were not used to indoctrinate or convert students but were quite passive, the Court maintained that, "it is no defense to urge that the religious practices here may be relatively minor encroachments on the First Amendment."  Because it endorsed religion and had no secular purpose, the Court concluded that the Kentucky statute was unconstitutional. 

Majority:
"This is not a case in which the Ten Commandments are integrated into the school curriculum, where the Bible may constitutionally be used in an appropriate study of history, civilization, ethics, comparative religion, or the like. [See Abington School District v. Schempp.] Posting of religious texts on the wall serves no such educational function. If the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are to have any effect at all, it will be to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments. However desirable this might be as a matter of private devotion, it is not a permissible state objective under the Establishment Clause of the Constitution."

==Dissent==

Justice Rehnquist argued in his dissent that the statute did not violate the First Amendment because there was a legitimate secular purpose to the Ten Commandments' posting. Rehnquist argued that "the Ten Commandments have had a significant impact on the development of secular legal codes of the Western World,"  which he qualified as a secular purpose. Rehnquist's dissent also argued that something's relation to religion does not automatically cause it to "respect an establishment of religion."

Justice Rehnquist agreed with the framework proposed by the majority opinion, but thought that the Kentucky statute had a secular purpose. Rehnquist believed that just because "the asserted secular purpose may overlap with what some may see as a religious objective does not render it unconstitutional."  The Court argued that since the Commandments are a 'sacred text' and are not taught in the context of history classes, their mandatory posting is unconstitutional. Rehnquist argued that the Commandments are a document that has "had a significant impact on the development of secular legal codes of the Western World." Rehnquist's dissent contended that since religion has "been closely identified with our history and government … one can hardly respect the system of education that would leave the student wholly ignorant of the currents of religious thought."

==Subsequent developments==
''Stone v. Graham'' was one of the first Supreme Court cases to condemn a passive religious object for its unconstitutionality. Before ''Stone'', rulings had been made on government endorsed prayers and government subsidized religious activity, but not on the mere presence of religious objects. For this reason, ''Stone v. Graham'' served as a useful precedent in ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'', where it is referenced and compared to the disputed crèche erected in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5023">A '''United States military jury''' (or '''"Members"''', in [[military parlance]]) serves a function similar to an American civilian [[jury]], but with several notable differences. Only a [[Courts-martial in the United States|General Court-Martial]] (which, depending on the offense, may impose any sentence including death and a dishonorable discharge&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|10|818}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or [[Courts-martial in the United States|Special Court-Martial]] (which, depending on the offense, can impose a sentence up to one year in confinement and a bad-conduct discharge&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|10|819}}&lt;/ref&gt;) includes members.  There are no members in a trial by [[Courts-martial in the United States|Summary Court-Martial]] (which, depending on the offense, can impose a sentence up to 30 days in confinement&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|10|820}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  If the accused at a general court-martial or special court-martial chooses to be tried by members rather than by a [[Bench trial|military judge alone]], then the members are responsible for both rendering a verdict and a sentence should the accused be found guilty of the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|10|852}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charges are brought forward by an officer called a "[[convening authority]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|10|822|824}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the convening authority also personally selects each of the members who will try the accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|10|852|d|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charges which have been levied by the convening authority are prosecuted at courts-martial by [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocates]] called "trial counsel".&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|10|838|a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accused persons facing general or special courts-martial receive representation free of charge from Judge Advocates acting as defense counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|10|838|b|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accused persons may also be represented at general or special courts-martial by civilian attorneys hired at their own expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|10|838|b|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not required by Congressional law, service policy provides that many military accused receive the benefit of representation from a Judge Advocate defense counsel free of charge at summary courts-martial as well.

A special court-martial must have at least three members.&lt;ref name=10USC816&gt;{{USC|10|816}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general court-martial must have at least five members&lt;ref name=10USC816 /&gt; unless the death penalty is a mandatory sentence, in which case there must be at least 12 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|10|825|a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convening authority may detail as many members to a court-martial as he or she chooses so long as the minimum number is met. The convening authority chooses "such members of the armed forces as, in his [or her] opinion, are best qualified for the duty by reason of age, education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament."&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|10|825|d|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the accused person is a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]], then all of the members must also be commissioned officers.&lt;ref name=10USC825&gt;{{USC|10|825}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the accused person is a warrant officer, then the members may be either commissioned officers or warrant officers.&lt;ref name=10USC825 /&gt;  If the accused person is an enlisted member of the armed forces, then the members may be commissioned officers, warrant officers, and, if the accused requests it, enlisted members.&lt;ref name=10USC825 /&gt;  If an enlisted accused requests to be tried by a panel that includes enlisted members, then at least one-third of the members must be enlisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|10|825|c}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All members of the court-martial are required to be senior or equal in rank to the accused person.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|10|825|d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verdicts===
The members vote by secret written ballot on each of the allegations the accused person faces, with each member having one vote on each charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|10|851}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike most civilian jurisdictions, a unanimous verdict is not required in most cases.  Unless the death penalty is mandatory for the offense in question, the members may convict by a two-thirds majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|10|852|a|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the death penalty is mandatory if convicted, then the members must be unanimous in their verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|10|852|a|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, military juries are incapable of being a [[hung jury]].

[[File:EnRoute System on B787-8.JPG|thumb|An example of an [[In-flight entertainment system]] using VOD/AVOD technology aboard an [[Air Canada]] [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]]]
'''Video on demand''' ('''VOD''') is a programming system which allows users to select and watch/listen to [[video]] or [[sound recording and reproduction|audio]] content such as movies and TV shows whenever they choose, rather than at a scheduled broadcast time, the method that prevailed with [[over-the-air programming]] during the 20th century. [[IPTV]] technology is commonly used to bring VOD to televisions and [[personal computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ Broadband Users Control What They Watch and When] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420143608/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ |date=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television VOD systems can [[streaming media|stream]] content through either a [[set-top box]], a computer or other device, allowing viewing in real time, or download it to a device such as a computer, [[digital video recorder]] (also called a [[Digital video recorder|personal video recorder]]) or [[portable media player]] for viewing at any time. The majority of [[cable television|cable]]- and [[telephone company]]–based television providers offer:

* VOD streaming, whereby a user selects a video program and it begins to play immediately on the television set, or 
* downloading to a [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) rented or purchased from the provider, or downloading onto a PC or to a portable device, for viewing in the future.

[[Internet television]], using the Internet, is an increasingly popular form of video on demand. VOD can also be accessed via desktop client applications such as the Apple [[iTunes]] online content store.

Some airlines offer VOD as [[in-flight entertainment]] to passengers through individually controlled video screens embedded in seatback or armrests or offered via [[portable media player]]s. Some video on demand services, such as [[Netflix]], use a [[Subscription business model|subscription]] model that requires users to pay a monthly fee to access a bundled set of content, which is mainly movies and TV shows. Other services use an advertising-based model, where access is free.

==Functionality==
Downloading and streaming video on demand systems provide the user with all of the features of [[Portable media player]]s and [[DVD player]]s. Some VOD systems that store and stream programs from [[hard disk]] drives use a [[RAM|memory]] [[Data buffer|buffer]] to allow the user to [[trick mode|fast forward and rewind]] digital videos. It is possible to put video [[server (computing)|server]]s on [[local area network]]s, in which case they can provide very rapid response to users. Cable companies have reeled out their own versions of video on demand services through apps, allowing for TV access anywhere where there is a device that is internet compatible. In addition to cable services launching apps that offer on demand video, they have combined it with offering live streaming services as well. The recent launches of apps from cable companies usually have the phrases "go" or "watch" are attempts to compete with Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) services since they lack having live news, sports, etc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lansing|first1=John|title=TV Everywhere: The Thundering Herd|journal=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=11 May 2015|volume=145|issue=18|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Streaming video servers can also serve a wider community via a [[wide area network|WAN]], in which case the responsiveness may be reduced. Download VOD services are practical to homes equipped with [[cable modem]]s or [[DSL]] connections. Servers for traditional cable and telco VOD services are usually placed at the cable head-end serving a particular market as well as cable hubs in larger markets. In the telco world, they are placed in either the central office, or a newly created location called a ''Video Head-End Office'' (VHO).

==History==
The first video on demand (VOD) systems used tapes as the realtime source of video [[streaming media|streams]]. [[GTE]] started as a trial in 1990 with [[AT&amp;T]] providing all components. By 1992 VOD servers were supplying previously encoded digital video from disks and [[DRAM]].
&lt;ref&gt;"From Videotape to Video Servers, Technology Drives PPV", ''Broadcasting and Cable'', 29 November 1993, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the 1982 anti-trust break-up of AT&amp;T resulted in a number of smaller telephone companies called Baby Bells.  Following this the [[Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984]] prohibited telephone companies from providing video services within their operating regions. In 1993 the National Communication and Information Infrastructure (NII) was proposed and passed by the US House and Senate, thus opening the way for the seven Baby Bells [[Ameritech]], [[Bell Atlantic]], [[BellSouth]], [[NYNEX]], [[Pacific Telesis]], [[Southwestern Bell]] and [[US West]] to implement VOD systems. All of these companies and others began holding trials to set up systems for supplying video on demand over telephone and cable lines.

In November 1992, Bell Atlantic announced a VOD trial. IBM was developing video server code-named Tiger Shark. Concurrently Digital Equipment was developing a scalable video server (configured from small to large for a range of video streams). Bell Atlantic selected IBM and April 1993 the system became the first VOD over [[Asymmetric digital subscriber line|ADSL]] to be deployed outside the lab, serving 50 video streams.

In June 1993, US West filed for a system consisting of the Digital Equipment Corporation Interactive Information Server, with Scientific Atlanta providing the network, and 3DO as the [[set-top box]], with video streams and other information to be deployed to 2500 homes. In 1994–1995 US West went on to file for VOD at several cities: 330,000 subscribers in Denver, 290,000 in Minneapolis, and 140,000 in Portland.

Many VOD trials were held with various combinations of server, network and set-top. Of these the primary players in the US were the telephone companies, using DEC, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, USA Video, nCube, SGI, and other servers. The DEC server system was used in more of these trials than any other.&lt;ref&gt;"NYNEX and Ameritech Are Said to Choose Digital Equipment Corporation to Supply Video-Server System", ''The Wall Street Journal'', 25 February 1994, p. B8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"SGI Ready Opposing Video-Server Architectures: Video on Demand Battle", ''Electronic Engineering Times'', 4 October 1993, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Video Servers: nCube and Oracle Challenge IBM", ''Computergram International'', 29 October 1993, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Minoli, ''Video Dialtone Technology'', 1995, pp. 441–485.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DEC VOD server architecture used interactive gateways to set up video streams and other information for delivery from any of a large number of [[VAX]] servers, enabling it in 1993 to support more than 100,000 streams with full [[VCR]]-like functionality. In 1994, it would upgrade to a [[DEC Alpha]]–based computer for its VOD servers, allowing it to support more than a million users.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Minoli, ''Video Dialtone Technology'', 1995, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994 the Oracle scalable VOD system used massively parallel processors to support from 500 to 30,000 users. The SGI system supported 4000 users.&lt;ref&gt;"Building the Data Highway", ''Byte'', March 1994, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The servers connected to networks of increasing size to eventually support video stream delivery to whole cities.

In the UK, from September 1994, a VOD service formed a major part of the Cambridge Digital Interactive Television Trial&lt;ref name="cambridgeitv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koo.corpus.cam.ac.uk/projects/itv/|title=Cambridge iTV Trial|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in England. This provided video and data to 250 homes and a number of schools connected to the [[Cambridge Cable]] network (later part of NTL, now [[Virgin Media]]). The MPEG-1 encoded video was streamed over an ATM network from an [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] media server to [[Acorn Online Media Set Top Box|set top boxes]] designed by [[Acorn Computers|Acorn]] Online Media. The trial commenced at a speed of 2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s to the home, subsequently increased to 25 Mbit/s.&lt;ref name ="camcorners"&gt;[http://www.iankitching.me.uk/articles/citv-nz.html "Cambridge Corners the Future in Networking"], ''TUANZ Topics'', Volume 05, No. 10, November 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The content was provided by the [[BBC]] and [[Anglia Television]]. Although a technical success, difficulty in sourcing content was a major issue, and the project closed in 1996.

In 1997, [[Enron Corporation]] had entered the broadband market, constructing and purchasing thousands of miles of fiber optic cables throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT1999"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schiesel|first1=Seth|title=Jumping Off the Bandwidth Wagon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/11/business/jumping-off-the-bandwidth-wagon.html|access-date=17 February 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PRNEWS&gt;{{cite press release |title=Montana Power, Williams Communications, Enron Units Announce Fiber Providers for Portland-to-Los Angeles Network|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/montana-power-williams-communications-enron-units-announce-fiber-providers-for-portland-to-los-angeles-network-77921802.html|access-date=17 February 2017|agency=[[PR Newswire]]|date=17 December 1997|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Enron and [[Blockbuster Inc.]] attempted to create a 20-year deal to stream movies on demand over Enron's fiber optic network.&lt;ref name="WPjan01"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Behr|first1=Peter|title=Broadband Strategy Got Enron in Trouble; Bid to Create Market for Fiber-Optic Space Included Aggressive Accounting|work=[[The Washington Post]]|page=E01|date=1 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the "heavily promoted" deal fell through, with Enron's shares dropping following the announcement.&lt;ref name="WPjan01"/&gt;

In 1998, [[Kingston Communications]] became the first UK company to launch a fully commercial VOD service and the first to integrate broadcast TV and Internet access through a single set-top box using IP delivery over ADSL. By 2001, Kingston Interactive TV had attracted 15,000 subscribers. After a number of trials, [[TalkTalk TV|HomeChoice]] followed in 1999, but were restricted to London. After attracting 40,000 customers, they were bought by [[Tiscali]] in 2006 who were in turn bought by [[TalkTalk TV|Talk Talk]] in 2009. Cable TV providers [[Telewest]] and [[NTL:Telewest|NTL]] (now [[Virgin Media]]) launched their VOD services in the United Kingdom in 2005, competing with the leading traditional pay TV distributor [[BSkyB]]. BSkyB responded by launching ''Sky by broadband'', later renamed ''[[Sky Anytime]] on PC''. The service went live on 2 January 2006. Sky Anytime on PC uses a legal [[peer-to-peer]] approach, based on [[Kontiki (company)|Kontiki]] technology, to provide very high capacity multi-point downloads of the video content. Instead of the video content all being downloaded from Sky's servers, the content comes from multiple users of the system who have already downloaded the same content. Other UK TV broadcasters have implemented their own versions of the same technology, such as the [[BBC]]'s [[iPlayer]], which launched on 25 December 2007, and [[Channel 4]]'s [[4oD]] (4 on Demand) which launched in late 2006. Another example of online video publishers using legal [[peer-to-peer]] technology is based on Giraffic technology which was launched in early 2011 with large Online Video-on-Demand publishers such as US based VEOH and UK based Craze's OnlineMoviesBox movie rental service.

The [[BBC]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 4]] planned to launch a joint platform provisionally called [[Kangaroo (video on demand)|Kangaroo]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=27 November 2007 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/27/bbc.itv| title=

That same year, the assets{{clarify|date=October 2017}} of the defunct Kangaroo project were bought by [[Arqiva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=23 July 2009 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jul/23/arqiva-project-kangaroo| title= Arqiva to launch video-on-demand service using Kangaroo technology| publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=25 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who used the technology behind Kangaroo to launch the [[SeeSaw (Internet television)|SeeSaw]] service in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=26 January 2010 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8480815.stm| title= Internet TV service Seesaw launches beta trial| publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=25 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, however, SeeSaw was shut down from lack of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=27 May 2011 | url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2011/05/27/exclusive-arqiva-to-close-seesaw/| title= Arqiva to close SeeSaW| work=Broadband TV News |last=Clover|first=Julian| accessdate=25 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOD services are now available in all parts of the United States, which has the highest global take-up rate of VOD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/198744/percentage-of-video-on-demand-subscribers-in-selected-countries/| title= Percentage of subscribers who use video on demand on the TV by country in 2010 and 2011 | work=Statista | accessdate=30 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 80% of American Internet users had watched video online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/11/16/viewers-treat-online-tv-differently-providers/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126165001/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/11/16/viewers-treat-online-tv-differently-providers/ |archivedate=26 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 42% of mobile users who downloaded video preferred apps to a normal browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |isbn=978-1593157203 |page=86 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Streaming VOD systems are available on desktop and mobile platforms from cable providers (in tandem with [[cable modem]] technology) who use the large downstream bandwidth present on cable systems to deliver movies and television shows to end users, who can typically pause, fast-forward, and rewind VOD movies due to the low latency and random-access nature of cable technology. The large distribution of a single signal makes streaming VOD impractical for most satellite television systems. Both [[EchoStar]]/[[Dish Network]] and [[DirecTV]] offer video on demand programming to [[Digital video recorder|PVR]]-owning subscribers of their satellite TV service. [[In Demand]] is a cable VOD service that also offers pay-per-view. Once the programs have been downloaded onto a user's PVR, he or she can watch, play, pause, and seek at their convenience. VOD is also quite common in more expensive hotels. VOD systems that store and provide a user interface for content downloaded directly from the Internet are widely available.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

According to the [[European Audiovisual Observatory]], 142 paying VOD services were operational in Europe at the end of 2006. The number increased to 650 by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obs.coe.int/oea_publ/market/vod2009.html Video on demand and catch-up TV in Europe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003132457/http://www.obs.coe.int/oea_publ/market/vod2009.html |date=3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the January 2010 Consumer Electronic Show in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Sezmi]] CEO Buno Pati and president Phil Wiser showed a [[set-top box]] with a one-[[terabyte]] [[hard drive]] which could be used for video on demand services previously offered through cable TV or broadband. A movie, for example, could be sent out once using a broadcast signal, rather than numerous times over cable or [[fiber-optic]] lines, and this would not involve the expense of adding many miles of lines. Sezmi planned to lease broadcast spectrum to offer a subscription service which National Association of Broadcasters president [[Gordon H. Smith]] said would provide a superior picture to that of cable or satellite, at a lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/443352-NAB_Shows_Off_New_Spectrum_Applications.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=NAB Shows Off New Spectrum Applications|last=Dickson  |first=Glen |date=9 January 2010 |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |access-date=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing VOD required extensive negotiations to identify a financial model that would serve both content creators and cable providers while providing desirable content for viewers and an acceptable price point. Key factors identified for determining the economic viability of the VOD model included VOD movie buy rates and setting Hollywood and cable operator revenue splits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rizzuto|first=Ronald J.Wirth|title=The Economics of Video on Demand: A Simulation Analysis|journal=Journal of Media Economics|year=2002|volume=15|issue=3|page=209|doi=10.1207/s15327736me1503_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable providers offered VOD as part of digital subscription packages, which by 2005, primarily allowed cable subscribers to only access an "on-demand" version of content that was already provided in linear traditional broadcasting distribution. These on-demand packages sometimes include "extras" and "bonus footage" in addition to the regular content.

== Role of peer-to-peer file sharing ==
{{POV section|talk=On section "Role of piracy and peer to peer" NPOV|date=August 2016}}

[[Peer-to-peer]] (P2P) [[file sharing]] software allow for the distribution of content without the linear costs associated with centralized [[streaming media]]. These innovations proved that it was technically possible to offer the consumer potentially every film ever made, and the popularity and ease of use of such services may have motivated the rise of centralized video on demand services. Some services such as [[Spotify]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ernesto|title=Spotify: A Massive P2P Network, Blessed by Record Labels|url=http://torrentfreak.com/spotify-a-massive-p2p-network-blessed-by-record-labels-110617/|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; use peer-to-peer distribution to better "scale" their platforms. [[Netflix]] is considering switching to a P2P model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brinkmann|first=Martin|title=Could Netflix switch to P2P to lower ISP pressure?|url=http://www.ghacks.net/2014/03/22/netflix-switch-p2p-lower-isp-pressure/|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to cope with [[net neutrality]] problems from downstream providers.

==Types ==

=== Transactional ===
Transactional video on demand (TVOD) is a distribution method by which customers pay for each individual piece of video on demand content.&lt;ref name="Kehoe"&gt;{{Cite web|title = VOD Rights Models|url = http://indiefilmplace.com/2013/10/20/video-on-demand-rights-models/|accessdate = 9 December 2015|first = Keith|last = Kehoe}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a customer would pay a fee for each individual movie or TV show that they watch. TVOD has two sub-categories: [[electronic sell-through]] (EST), by which customers can permanently access a piece of content once purchased via Internet; and download to rent (DTR), by which customers can access the content for a limited time upon renting.&lt;ref name="Kehoe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understand-svod-tvod-avod-terms-business-models-streaming-mads-kaysen|title = Understand the "SVOD", "TVOD" and "AVOD" terms and business models of streaming services like Netflix|date = 24 August 2015|accessdate = 9 December 2015|publisher=LinkedIn|last = Kaysen|first = Mads}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of TVOD services include Apple's [[iTunes]] online store and Google's [[Google Play]] service.

===Catch-up TV===
A growing number of TV stations offer "catch-up TV" as a way for viewers to watch TV shows though their VOD service hours, days, weeks, months, years or even decades after the original television broadcast. This enables viewers to watch a program when they have free time, even if this is not when the program was originally aired. Some studies show that catch up TV is starting to represent a large amount of the views and hours watched, and that users tend to watch catch up TV programs for longer, when compared to live TV (e.g., regular scheduled broadcast TV).

===Subscription models===
[[File:The Great. Courses Plus - App Screen Shot.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A screenshot of "The Great Courses Plus", a subscription video on demand service offered by The Teaching Company that offers instructional videos.]]
Subscription VOD (SVOD) services use a [[subscription business model]], where subscribers are charged a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly fee to access unlimited programs. These services include [[Now TV (UK and Ireland)|Now TV]], [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Video]], [[TVPlayer]], [[Hulu Plus]]. SVOD services have drawn a lot of attention for their role in films. As of June 2017, Netflix is expected to add nearly 40 original movies to its platform.&lt;ref name=hi1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malone|first1=Michael|title=Big SVOD Players Become Bigger Forces in Film: Netflix, Amazon Are Major Factors at Movie Festivals around the World.|journal=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=19 June 2017|volume=147|issue=15|pages=29–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hulu has invested its time in creating documentaries for its platform, while Amazon has acquired films from notable producers such as Spike Lee.&lt;ref name=hi1 /&gt; Because of the large following SVOD services have, Netflix made an appearance at the 2017 [[Cannes Film Festival]] in France. Many took offense to this, stating that movies not presented in theaters should be omitted from qualifying from winning the [[Palme d'Or]] prize.&lt;ref name=hi1 /&gt; SVOD services can be seen as highly successful, and will continue to grow their audience for it being "a production house, broadcaster, recommendation and hosting service, and pseudo-DVD rental store."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giuffre|first1=Liz|title=Netflix: New Media in New Spaces|journal=Metro|date=Summer 2014|issue=179|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near video on demand===
{{Globalize section|date=February 2015}}
Near video on demand (NVOD) is a [[pay-per-view]] consumer video technique used by multi-channel broadcasters using high-bandwidth distribution mechanisms such as [[satellite]] and cable television. Multiple copies of a program are broadcast at short time intervals (typically 10–20 minutes) on linear channels providing convenience for viewers, who can watch the program without needing to tune in at only scheduled point in time. A viewer may only have to wait a few minutes before the next time a movie will be programmed. This form is very [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]-intensive and is generally provided only by large operators with a great deal of redundant capacity and has been reduced in popularity as video on demand is implemented.

Only the satellite services [[Dish Network]] and [[DirecTV]] continue to provide NVOD experiences. These satellite services continue to provide NVOD due to a lack of broadband Internet access for their rural customer bases. Before the rise of video on demand, the cable pay-per-view provider [[In Demand]] provided up to 40 channels in 2002, with several films receiving up to four channels on the staggered schedule to provide the NVOD experience for viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://echelonstudios.us/?page_id=681|title=Echelon Studios|website=Echelon Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, most cable [[pay-per-view]] channels now number mainly 3-5 and are used solely for live ring sports events (boxing and professional wrestling) and concerts. In Australia, pay TV broadcaster [[Foxtel]] offers NVOD for new release movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rent Store + Box Office titles – Store + Box Office – Foxtel Support|url = https://www.foxtel.com.au/got/support/tv/how-to-use/store-box-office/store-box-office.html|publisher = foxtel.com.au|accessdate = 9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Push video on demand===
Push video on demand is so-named because the provider "pushes" the content out to the viewer's set-top box without the viewer having requested the content. This technique used by a number of broadcasters on systems that lack the connectivity and bandwidth to provide true "streaming" video on demand. Push VOD is also used by broadcasters who want to optimize their video streaming infrastructure by pre-loading the most popular contents (e.g., that week's top ten films or shows) to the consumers' set-top device. In this way, the most popular content is already loaded onto a consumer's set-top DVR. That way, if the consumer requests one of these films, it is already loaded on her/his DVR. A push VOD system uses a [[digital video recorder|personal video recorder]] (PVR) to store a selection of content, often transmitted in spare capacity overnight or all day long at low bandwidth. Users can watch the downloaded content at the time they desire, immediately and without any buffering issues. Push VOD depends on the viewer recording content, so choices can be limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/vod-technology-14311.html|title=What Is VOD Technology?|last=Anderson|first=Casey|work=Houston Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As content occupies space on the PVR hard drive, downloaded content is usually deleted after a week to make way for newer programs or movies. The limited space on a PVR hard drive means that the selection of programs is usually restricted to the most popular content. A new generation of Push VOD solution recently appeared on the market which, by using efficient error correction mechanisms, can free significant amount of bandwidth and that can deliver more than video e.g. digital version of magazines and interactive applications.

===Advertising video on demand===
Advertising video on demand is a VOD model which uses an advertising-based revenue model. This allows companies that advertise on broadcast and cable channels to reach people who watch shows using VOD. As well, this model allows people to watch content without paying subscription fees. [[Hulu]] has been one of the major AVOD companies, though the company ended free service in August 2016. Ads still run on the subscription service. [[Yahoo! View]] continues to offer a free AVOD model. Advertisers may find that people watching on VOD services do not want the same ads to appear multiple times. [[Sony Crackle|Crackle]] has introduced the concept of a series of ads for the same company that tie in to what is being watched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=For Ad VOD Players, Success Is Blend of Linear, Digital Models|last=Baysinger|first=Tim|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=15 August 2016|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tech Tweets|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=15 August 2016|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wage theft''' is the denial of [[wages]] or [[employee benefits]] rightfully owed an [[employee]]. It can be conducted by employers in various ways, among them failing to pay [[overtime]]; violating [[minimum wage|minimum-wage]] laws; the [[misclassification of employees as independent contractors]], illegal deductions in pay; forcing employees to work "off the clock", or simply not paying an employee at all.

According to some studies, wage theft is common in the [[United States]], particularly from [[low wage]] legal or [[undocumented immigrant]] workers.&lt;ref name=NYTStudyreport&gt;{{cite news|title=Low-Wage Workers Are Often Cheated, Study Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/02/us/02wage.html|accessdate=May 29, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 1, 2009|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Workers Are Claiming  'Wage Theft' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/business/more-workers-are-claiming-wage-theft.html|accessdate=August 31, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 31, 2014|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Economic Policy Institute]] reported in 2014 that survey evidence suggests wage theft costs US workers billions of dollars a year.&lt;ref&gt;Brady Meixell and Ross Eisenbrey (September 11, 2014).

Retrieved June 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rights violated by wage theft have been guaranteed to workers in the United States in the 1938 [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eE9svG8wLAsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=wage+theft&amp;ots=EMqtcfRtLs&amp;sig=rb7ileUzwElvRRPEMogQKnBeVIk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Wage Theft in America.

]]
According to the FLSA, unless exempt, employees are entitled to receive [[overtime]] pay calculated at least time and one-half times pay for all time worked past forty hours a week. Some exemptions to this rule apply to public service agencies or to employees who meet certain requirements in accordance to their job duties along with a salary of no less than $455 a week. Despite regulations, there are many employees today who are not paid overtime due them. A 2009 study of workers in the United States found that in 12 occupations more than half of surveyed workers reported being denied overtime pay: child care (90.2 percent denial), stock and office clerks (86 percent), home health care (82.7 percent),  beauty/dry cleaning and general repair workers (81.9 percent), car wash workers and parking attendants (77.9 percent), waiters, cafeteria workers and bartenders (77.9 percent), retail salespersons (76.2 percent), janitors and grounds workers (71.2 percent), garment workers (69.9 percent), cooks and dishwashers (67.8 percent), construction workers (66.1 percent) and cashiers (58.8 percent).&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclnet.org/worker-rights/148-wage-theft/525-wage-theft-six-common-methods |title=Wage Theft: Six common methods - National Consumers League |publisher=Nclnet.org |date= |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minimum wage ===
In 2009, reform placed the new [[US|United States]] federal [[minimum wage]] at $7.25. Some states have legislation that sets a state minimum wage. In the case an employee is subject to both federal and state minimum wage acts, the employee is entitled to the higher standard of compensation. For tipped employees, the employer is only required to compensate the employee $2.13 an hour as long as the fixed wage and the tips add up to be at or above the federal minimum wage. Minimum wage is enforced by the [[Wage and Hour Division]] (WHD). WHD is generally contacted by 25,000 people a year in regards to concerns and violations of minimum wage pay.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpps.org.my/resource_centre/FACTSHEET%20ON%20MINIMUM%20WAGE%20LEGISLATION%20AROUND%20THE%20WORLD.pdf |title=Factsheet on Minimum Wage Legislation Around The World |work=Centre for Public Policy Studies (CPPS) |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of wage theft for tipped employees is to receive no standard pay ($2.13 an hour) along with tips.&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt;

=== Misclassification ===
[[Misclassification of employees as independent contractors|Misclassification of employees]] is a violation that leaves employees very vulnerable to other forms of wage theft. Under the FLSA, [[independent contractor]]s do not receive the same protection as an employee for certain benefits. The difference between the two classifications depends on the permanency of the employment, opportunity for profit and loss, the worker's level of [[self-employment]] along with their degree of control. An independent contractor is not entitled to [[minimum wage]], [[overtime]], [[insurance]], protection, or other employee rights. Attempts are sometimes made to define ordinary employees as independent contractors.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt;

Misclassification in the United States is extensive. In New York state, for example, it was found in a 2007 study that approximately 704,785 workers, or 10.3% of the state's private sector workforce, was misclassified each year. For the industries covered in the study, average [[Unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]] taxable wages underreported due to misclassification was on average $4.3 billion for the year and [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act|unemployment insurance tax]] underreported in these industries was $176 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=reports|title = The Cost of Worker Misclassification in New York State|author1=Linda H.

=== Illegal deductions ===
Employees are subject to forms of wage theft through illegal deductions. Trivial to sometimes fabricated violations in the workplace are used to validate deductions. Any deduction that brings an employee to a level of compensation lower than minimum wage is also illegal. In many states, employers are required to issue employees documentation of deductions along with earnings. Failure to issue this documentation is generally prevalent in working places subject to wage theft.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt;

=== Full wage theft ===
The most blatant form of wage theft is for an employee to not be paid for work done. An employee being asked to work overtime, working through breaks, or being asked to report early and/or leave late without pay is being subjected to wage theft. This is sometimes justified as displacing a paid meal break without guaranteeing meal break time. In the most extreme cases, employees report receiving nothing.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft: Six Common Methods" /&gt; In some cases, the [[Illegal immigration to the United States|legal status]] of the workers can enable employers to withhold pay without fear of facing any consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/10/176677299/construction-booming-in-texas-but-many-workers-pay-dearly|title=Construction Booming In Texas, But Many Workers Pay Dearly|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other forms ===
Putting the pressure on injured workers to not file for [[workers' compensation]] is frequently successful.&lt;ref name=NYTStudyreport /&gt; Employees are often confronted with threats of firing or calls to immigration services if they complain or seek redress. Workers are often denied time off or [[Annual leave|vacation time]] that they have acquired or denied pay for [[sick leave]] or vacation time.

In Australia, another form of wage theft is the failure of employers to pay the mandatory minimum contribution to employee's [[Superannuation in Australia|superannuation fund]]. Between 2009 and 2013 the [[Australian Tax Office]] recovered&amp;nbsp;A$1.3 billion&amp;nbsp;in unpaid superannuation which is estimated to be only a small portion of total unpaid superannuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/2014/07/08/unpaid-super-a-billion-dollar-problem-says-actu-a-527139.html#.U7wMjvldXfI|title = Unpaid Super a Billion Dollar Problem, Says ACTU|date = 7 July 2014|work = Targeted News Service|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

A 2009 study based on interviews of over 4,000 [[low wage]] workers in [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New York City]] found that wage theft from low wage workers in large cities in the United States was severe and widespread. Incidents varied with the type of job and employee. Sixty-eight percent of the surveyed workers experienced at least one pay-related violation in the week prior to the survey. On average the workers in the three cities lost a total of $2,634 annually due to [[workplace violation]]s, out of an average income of $17,616, which translates into wage theft of fifteen percent of income. Extrapolating from these figures, low wage workers in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City lost more than $2.9 billion due to employment and labor law violations.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt; Nationally it is estimated that workers are not paid at least $19 billion every year in overtime&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://voiceofrussia.com/us/2014_05_21/Wage-Theft-in-America-How-the-Rich-get-Richer-While-the-Poor-Stay-Poor-6533/|title = Wage Theft in America: How the Rich get Richer While the Poor Stay Poor|last = Park|first = Crystal|date = 21 May 2014|work = Voice of Russia|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that in the US $40 billion to $60 billion in total are lost annually due to all forms of wage theft.&lt;ref name=Groote&gt;{{cite news|last1=Michael De Groote|first1=Michael De Groote|title=Wage theft: How employers steal millions from workers every week|url=http://national.deseretnews.com/article/1748/Wage-theft-How-employers-steal-millions-from-workers-every-week.html|accessdate=July 1, 2014 |publisher=Desert News National|date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to national annual losses of  $340 million due to [[robbery]], $4.1 billion due to [[burglary]], $5.3 billion due to [[larceny]], and $3.8 billion due to [[auto theft]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="Federal Bureau of Investigation"/&gt;

=== Workers at risk ===
Studies have found inflated rates of wage theft violations in markets employing women and foreign-born populations. Within the foreign-born population, women were at a much greater risk for wage violations than their male counterparts. Undocumented workers or unauthorized immigrants stood at the highest risk levels. Education, longer [[tenure]]d employment, and English proficiency proved to be influential factors in employee populations. All three variables reduced the probability of wage theft for the aforementioned demographics. Workplaces where the compensation was paid in one weekly flat rate or in cash saw a higher instance rate of wage theft. Smaller businesses with less than 100 employees also saw a higher instance rate of violations than larger business. In one study, the [[manufacturing industry]], repair services, and private home employment were at the highest risk for violations at the workplace. [[Home health care]], education, and construction saw the lowest levels of wage theft. Restaurants, grocery stores, retail, and warehousing fell around the [[median]].&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wage Theft and Workplace Violations in Los Angeles"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irle.ucla.edu/events/2010/pdf/LAwagetheft.pdf |title=Wage Theft and Workplace Violations in Los Angeles - The Failure of Employment and Labour Law for Low-Wage Workers |author=Milkman, R. |author2=Narro, V. |author3=González, A. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2010 |publisher=Institute for Research on Labor and Employment University of California, Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary examples ===
In November 2011, Warehouse Workers helped [[Wal-Mart]] warehouse employees file their fourth [[Class action|class-action lawsuit]] against the warehouse companies. Without Wal-Mart being a direct defendant, the argument was made that Wal-Mart has created this culture amongst the companies it works with. The first lawsuit filed was in 2009. The workers argued that poor record keeping and broken promises have led to workers receiving less than minimum wage. Walmart also denied workers paid vacations that they were promised upon contracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kari Lydersen |url=http://www.alternet.org/story/153226/wage_theft_at_wal-mart_warehouses_fourth_lawsuit_in_two_years_filed_on_behalf_of_underpaid_workers/ |title=Wage Theft at Wal-Mart Warehouses?

The Florida Retail Federation had recently proposed a bill to block a wage theft ordinance in their county, which was intended to create a system that would speed the investigation and processing of wage theft reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/palm-beach/pb-wage-theft-macys-20111126,0,1398136.story |title=Topic Galleries - South Florida wage theft macys |publisher=Sun-sentinel |date= 26 November 2011|accessdate=March 4, 2012|archive-date= November 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129212218/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/palm-beach/pb-wage-theft-macys-20111126,0,1398136.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study by the Iowa Policy Project calculated that dishonest employers defraud Iowa workers out of about $600 million annually in wages. State Senator [[Tony Bisignano]], Democrat from [[Des Moines]] and Senator [[William Dotzler]], a Democrat from [[Waterloo, Iowa]], proposed a bill to strengthen wage law enforcement on January 28, 2015, "since Iowa's wage theft laws are so weak they are impossible to enforce". The Iowa Association of Business and Industry opposed the bill, saying that resources for enforcement should be the focus instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=William Petroski|title=Senate Democrats offer plan to stop Iowa wage theft|url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/27/iowa-wage-theft-senate/22430863/|accessdate=29 January 2015|work=DesMoinesRegister|publisher=Gannett|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 report by Middlesex University and Trust for London revealed that at least 2 million workers in Britain are losing an estimated £3 billion in unpaid holiday pay and wages per year. It suggested that withholding holiday pay, not paying wages and workers losing a couple of hours money per week are some of the deliberate strategies used by employers to improve their profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unpaid Britain |url=https://www.trustforlondon.org.uk/publications/unpaid-britain-wage-default-british-labour-market/ |website=Trust for London |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) requires employers to keep detailed records regarding the identity of workers and hours worked for all workers who are protected under federal [[minimum wage law]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs21.htm|title =Fact Sheet #21: Recordkeeping Requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) |date = July 2008|accessdate = |website = |publisher = US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=6ed1b6e0e73541547a3ca78d87ee2663&amp;r=PART&amp;n=29y3.1.1.1.13#29:3.1.1.1.13.1.89.1|title =Labor.PART 516—RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY EMPLOYERS |work= Code of Federal Regulations|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states require that employers also provide each worker with documentation every pay period detailing that worker's hours, wages and deductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thehrspecialist.com/38703/Pay_Statements__50_State_Laws.hr?cat=compensation_and_benefits|title =Pay Statements: 50 State Laws |date = August 11, 2011|accessdate = |website=HR Specialist|publisher = Business Management Daily, division of Capitol Information Group, Inc. }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2015}} As of September 2011 [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[South Dakota]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Virginia]] did not require this documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.primepay.com/payroll-business-experts-blog/bid/33887/What-States-Require-Printed-Pay-Statements|title =What States Require Printed Pay Statements? |date = |accessdate = |website = blog.primepay.com|publisher =PrimePay, LLC.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2015}} A 2008 survey of wage theft from workers in [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[California]] found that 57% of low wage workers did not receive this required documentation and that workers who were paid in cash or on a weekly rate were more likely to experience wage theft.&lt;ref name="Broken Laws, Unprotected Workers" /&gt; Anecdotal evidence suggests that tip theft, which is a legally complex issue distinct from wage theft and not necessarily under the control of the same laws governing the payment of wages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.texasemploymentlawblog.com/2013/05/articles/overtime-law-1/courts-make-it-more-difficult-for-employees-to-pursue-tip-theft-by-employers/|title =Courts Make it More Difficult for Employees to Pursue Tip Theft by Employers |date = May 2013 |accessdate = |website = texasemploymentlawblog.com|publisher =texasemploymentlaw }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2015}} may also be common in instances where employer record keeping does not comply with the law.&lt;ref name="Ruggles"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruggles Waitstaff Stages Walk-Out, Alleging Non-Payment of Tips: UPDATE|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/eating/2011/12/ruggles_waitstaff_stages_walk-.php|accessdate=May 29, 2012|newspaper=Houston Press|date=December 5, 2011|author=Katharine Shilcutt|format=blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Penalties and sanctions ===
When the [[Wage and Hour Division]] (WHD) receives reports of violations, it works to ensure that employers change their work practices and pay back missed wages to the employees. [[Willful violation|Willful violators]] can face fines up to $10,000 upon their first conviction with [[imprisonment]] resulting from future convictions. In regards to [[child labor laws]], an employer can face a fine of up to $11,000 per minor. In 2012 the Wage and Hour Division collected $280 million in back wages for 308,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dol.gov/dol/budget/2014/PDF/FY2014BIB.pdf|title = FY 2014 Department of Labor Budget in Brief|date = |accessdate= |website = |publisher = US Department of Labor|page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, there are 1,100 federal investigators for 135 million workers in more than 7 million businesses.&lt;ref name=Carpenter&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carpenter|first1=Zoë|title=Low-Wage Workers' Newest Ally Is a Washington Bureaucrat|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/180462/low-wage-workers-newest-ally-washington-bureaucrat#|accessdate=July 2, 2014|publisher=The Nation|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of labor enforcement agents to U.S. workers has decreased tenfold since the inception of the FLSA from one for every 11,000 workers in 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-05/linkedin-stiffed-its-own-employees-agrees-to-pay-millions|title = LinkedIn Stiffed Its Own Employees, Agrees to Pay Millions|last = Josh Eidelson|first = Josh Eidelson|date = 5 August 2014|work = Businessweek|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to one for every 123,000 workers in 2014.&lt;ref name="Carpenter" /&gt;

In February 2010 [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] became the first jurisdiction in America to ban wage theft with an ordinance passed unanimously by the [[county commission]]. Prior to the ordinance, wage theft was called "the crime wave that almost no one talks about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/stopwagetheft/in-the-news|title=Stop Wage Theft — In the News |publisher=South Florida Interfaith Worker Justice |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
