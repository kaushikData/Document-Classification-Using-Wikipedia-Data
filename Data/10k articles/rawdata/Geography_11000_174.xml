The '''Antarctic Circumpolar Current''' ('''ACC''') is an [[ocean current]] that flows clockwise from west to east around [[Antarctica]]. An alternative name for the ACC is the '''West Wind Drift'''. The ACC is the dominant circulation feature of the [[Southern Ocean]] and has a mean transport estimated at 100-150 [[Sverdrup]]s (Sv, million&amp;nbsp;m³/s),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Desflots|White|Mariano|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly even higher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donohue|first1=K.A. et al.|title=Mean Antarctic Circumpolar Current transport measured in Drake Passage |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2F2016GL070319 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=21 November 2016|volume=43|issue=11|page=760 |doi=10.1002/2016GL070319|accessdate=29 December 2016|bibcode=2016GeoRL..4311760D}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest ocean current. The current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with Antarctica and this keeps warm ocean waters away from Antarctica, enabling that continent to maintain its huge [[ice sheet]].

Associated with the Circumpolar Current is the [[Antarctic Convergence]], where the cold Antarctic waters meet the warmer waters of the [[subantarctic]], creating a zone of upwelling nutrients. These nurture high levels of [[phytoplankton]] with associated copepods and krill, and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses, and a wealth of other species.

The ACC has been known to sailors for centuries; it greatly speeds up any travel from west to east, but makes sailing extremely difficult from east to west; although this is mostly due to the prevailing [[Westerlies|westerly winds]]. The circumstances preceding the [[mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny on the ''Bounty'']] and [[Jack London]]'s story "Make Westing" poignantly illustrated the difficulty it caused for mariners seeking to round [[Cape Horn]] on the clipper ship route between New York and California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|London|1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[clipper route]], which is the fastest sailing route around the world, follows the ACC around three continental capes – [[Cape Agulhas]] (Africa), [[South East Cape]] (Australia), and [[Cape Horn]] (South America).

The current creates the [[Ross Gyre|Ross]] and [[Weddell Gyre|Weddell gyres]].

== Structure ==
[[Image:Antarctic Circumpolar Current.jpg|thumb|The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the strongest current system in the world oceans and the only ocean current linking all major oceans: the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.  Seawater density fronts after {{Harvnb|Orsi|Whitworth|Nowlin|1995}}.]]
The ACC connects the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s, and serves as a principal pathway of exchange among them. The current is strongly constrained by [[landform]] and [[bathymetric]] features. To trace it starting arbitrarily at South America, it flows through the [[Drake Passage]] between South America and the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] and then is split by the [[Scotia Arc]] to the east, with a shallow warm branch flowing to the north in the [[Falkland Current]] and a deeper branch passing through the Arc more to the east before also turning to the north. Passing through the Indian Ocean, the current first retroflects the [[Agulhas Current]] to form the [[Agulhas Return Current]] before it is split by the [[Kerguelen Plateau]], and then moving northward again. Deflection is also seen as it passes over the [[mid-ocean ridge]] in the Southeast Pacific.

===Fronts===
The current is accompanied by three [[Front (Oceanography)|fronts]]: the Subantarctic front (SAF), the [[Polar front]] (PF), and the Southern ACC front (SACC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stewart|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the waters of the Southern Ocean are separated from the warmer and saltier subtropical waters by the [[subtropical front]] (STF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Orsi|Whitworth|Nowlin|1995|loc=Introduction, p.641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern boundary of the ACC is defined by the northern edge of the SAF, this being the most northerly water to pass through Drake Passage and therefore be circumpolar. Much of the ACC transport is carried in this front, which is defined as the latitude at which a subsurface salinity minimum or a thick layer of unstratified Subantarctic [[mode water]] first appears, allowed by temperature dominating density stratification. Still further south lies the PF, which is marked by a transition to very cold, relatively fresh, Antarctic Surface Water at the surface. Here a temperature minimum is allowed by salinity dominating density stratification, due to the lower temperatures. Farther south still is the SACC, which is determined as the southernmost extent of Circumpolar Deep Water (temperature of about 2&amp;nbsp;°C at 400&amp;nbsp;m). This water mass flows along the shelfbreak of the western Antarctic Peninsula and thus marks the most southerly water flowing through Drake Passage and therefore circumpolar. The bulk of the transport is carried in the middle two fronts.

The total transport of the ACC at Drake Passage is estimated to be around 135&amp;nbsp;Sv, or about 135 times the transport of all the world's rivers combined. There is a relatively small addition of flow in the Indian Ocean, with the transport south of [[Tasmania]] reaching around 147&amp;nbsp;Sv, at which point the current is probably the largest on the planet.

==Dynamics==
The circumpolar current is driven by the strong westerly winds in the latitudes of the Southern Ocean.

In latitudes where there are continents, winds blowing on light surface water can simply pile up light water against these continents. But in the Southern Ocean, the momentum imparted to the surface waters cannot be offset in this way. There are different theories on how the Circumpolar Current balances the momentum imparted by the winds. The increasing eastward momentum imparted by the winds causes water parcels to drift outward from the axis of the Earth's rotation (in other words, northward) as a result of the [[Coriolis force]]. This northward [[Ekman transport]] is balanced by a southward, pressure-driven flow below the depths of the major ridge systems. Some theories connect these flows directly, implying that there is significant upwelling of dense deep waters within the Southern Ocean, transformation of these waters into light surface waters, and a transformation of waters in the opposite direction to the north. Such theories link the magnitude of the Circumpolar Current with the global [[thermohaline circulation]], particularly the properties of the North Atlantic.

Alternatively, [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)#Mesoscale ocean eddies|ocean eddies]], the oceanic equivalent of atmospheric storms, or the large-scale meanders of the Circumpolar Current may directly transport momentum downward in the water column. This is because such flows can produce a net southward flow in the troughs and a net northward flow over the ridges without requiring any transformation of density. In practice both the thermohaline and the eddy/meander mechanisms are likely to be important.

The current flows at a rate of about {{Convert|4|km/h|abbr=on}} over the [[Macquarie Fault Zone|Macquarie Ridge]] south of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="brittlestar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-05/coml-ema051208.php |title=Explorers marvel at 'Brittlestar City' on seamount in powerful current swirling around Antarctica |accessdate=6 June 2008 |date=18 May 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACC varies with time. Evidence of this is the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Wave]], a periodic oscillation that affects the climate of much of the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Connolley|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[Antarctic oscillation]], which involves changes in the location and strength of Antarctic winds. Trends in the Antarctic Oscillation have been hypothesized to account for an increase in the transport of the Circumpolar Current over the past two decades.

== Formation ==
Published estimates of the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current vary, but it is commonly considered to have started at the [[Eocene]]/[[Oligocene]] boundary. The isolation of Antarctica and formation of the ACC occurred with the openings of the [[Tasmanian Seaway]] and the [[Drake Passage]]. The Tasmanian Seaway separates East Antarctica and Australia, and is reported to have opened to water circulation 33.5 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hassold|Rea|Pluijm|Parés|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of the opening of the Drake Passage, between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula, is more disputed; [[tectonic]] and sediment evidence show that it could have been open as early as pre 34&amp;nbsp;Ma,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barker|Filippelli|Florindo|Martin|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimates of the opening of the Drake passage are between 20 and 40 Ma.&lt;ref name="Siegert-etal-2008"&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegert|Barrett|Deconto|Dunbar|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The isolation of Antarctica by the current is credited by many researchers with causing the [[glaciation]] of Antarctica and global cooling in the [[Eocene]] epoch. Oceanic models have shown that the opening of these two passages limited polar heat convergence and caused a cooling of sea surface temperatures by several degrees; other models have shown that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels also played a significant role in the glaciation of Antarctica.&lt;ref name="Siegert-etal-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stott|2011|loc=See "Ancient Current Systems" illustrations at bottom of page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phytoplankton ==
[[File:S2004341153052.L2 HCHL.MalvinasCurrent.jpg|thumb|The [[Falkland Current]] transports nutrient-rich cold waters from the ACC north toward the [[Brazil–Malvinas Confluence]]. Phytoplankton chlorophyll concentration are shown in blue (lower concentrations) and yellow (higher concentrations).]]
Antarctic sea ice cycles seasonally, in February–March the amount of sea ice is lowest, and in August–September the sea ice is at its greatest extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geerts|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice levels have been monitored by satellite since 1973. Upwelling of deep water under the sea ice brings substantial amounts of nutrients. As the ice melts, the melt water provides stability and the critical depth is well below the mixing depth, which allows for a positive net [[primary production]].&lt;ref name="Miller-2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2004|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the sea ice recedes epontic algae dominate the first phase of the bloom, and a strong bloom dominate by diatoms follows the ice melt south.&lt;ref name="Miller-2004" /&gt;

Another phytoplankton bloom occurs more to the north near the [[antarctic convergence]], here nutrients are present from [[thermohaline circulation]]. Phytoplankton blooms are dominated by diatoms and grazed by copepods in the open ocean, and by krill closer to the continent. Diatom production continues through the summer, and populations of krill are sustained, bringing large numbers of [[cetacean]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, seals, birds, and fish to the area.&lt;ref name="Miller-2004" /&gt;

Phytoplankton blooms are believed to be limited by irradiance in the austral (southern hemisphere) spring, and by biologically available iron in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peloquin|Smith|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the biology in the area occurs along the major fronts of the current, the Subtropical, Subantarctic, and the Antarctic Polar fronts, these are areas associated with well defined temperature changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/education-and-outreach/additional/science-focus/locus/tutorials/module6.shtml |title=The Southern Ocean |publisher=GES DISC: Goddard Earth Sciences, Data &amp; Information Services Center |date=May 2012 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Size and distribution of phytoplankton are also related to fronts. Microphytoplankton (&gt;20μm) are found at fronts and at sea ice boundaries, while [[nanophytoplankton]] (&lt;20μm) are found between fronts.&lt;ref name="Knox-2007"&gt;{{Harvnb|Knox|2007|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of phytoplankton stocks in the southern sea have shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is dominated by diatoms, while the [[Weddell Sea]] has abundant [[coccolithophorid]]s and silicoflagellates. Surveys of the SW Indian Ocean have shown phytoplankton group variation based on their location relative to the Polar Front, with [[diatom]]s dominating South of the front, and dinoflagellates and [[flagellates]] in higher populations North of the front.&lt;ref name="Knox-2007" /&gt;

Some research has been conducted on Antarctic phytoplankton as a [[carbon sink]]. Areas of open water left from ice melt are good areas for phytoplankton blooms. The phytoplankton takes carbon from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. As the blooms die and sink, the carbon can be stored in sediments for thousands of years. This natural carbon sink is estimated to remove 3.5 million tonnes from the ocean each year. 3.5 million tonnes of carbon taken from the ocean and atmosphere is equivalent to 12.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Peck|Barnes|Cook|Fleming|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies ==
An expedition in May 2008 by 19 scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Hara|Rowden|Williams|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the geology and biology of eight [[Macquarie Fault Zone|Macquarie Ridge]] sea mounts, as well as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to investigate the effects of climate change of the Southern Ocean. The circumpolar current merges the waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and carries up to 150 times the volume of water flowing in all of the world's rivers. The study found that any damage on the cold-water corals nourished by the current will have a long-lasting effect.&lt;ref name="brittlestar" /&gt; After studying the circumpolar current it is clear that it strongly influences regional and global climate as well as underwater biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rintoul|Hughes|Olbers|2001|loc=e.g. p. 271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Adrian Glover of the [[Natural History Museum, London]] says that the current helps preserve wooden shipwrecks by preventing wood-boring "[[ship worms]]" from reaching targets such as [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s ship, the [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glover|Wiklund|Taboada|Avila|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Block paving''' also known as '''brick paving''' is a commonly used decorative method of creating a [[Pavement (architecture)|pavement]] or [[hardstand]]ing. The main benefit of bricks over other materials is that individual bricks can later be lifted up and replaced. This allows for remedial work to be carried out under the surface of the paving without leaving a lasting mark once the paving bricks have been replaced.  Typical areas of use would be for driveways, [[Road surface|pavement]], [[patio]]s, [[town]] centres, [[precinct]]s and more commonly in [[road surfacing]]. Bricks are typically made of concrete or [[clay]], though other [[composite material]]s are also used. Each has its own means of [[construction]]. The biggest difference is the way they set hard ready for use. A clay brick has to be fired in a [[kiln]] to bake the brick hard.  A [[concrete]] brick has to be allowed to set.  The concrete paving bricks are a porous form of brick formed by mixing small [[stone]] hardcore, dyes, cement and sand and other materials in various amounts. Many block paving manufacturing methods are now allowing the use of recycled materials in the construction of the paving bricks such as crushed [[glass]] and crushed old building [[rubble]].

[[File:Common Block Paving Patterns.jpg|thumb|Common Block Paving Patterns]]

There are many different laying patterns that can be achieved using block paving.  The most common of these is the [[herringbone pattern]].  This pattern is the strongest of the block paving bonds as it offers the most interlock, therefore making it a good choice for driveways and road surfacing.  A herringbone pattern can be created by setting the blocks at either 45 degrees or 90 degrees to the perpendicular.  Other popular types of pattern include stretcher bond and basketweave; with the latter being better suited to paved areas that will only receive light foot traffic, due to its weaker bond.

== Concrete pavers ==
Pavers come in a number of styles, shapes and tones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belgard.com/products/pavers/|title=Pavers|last=Belgard|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pavers manufactured from concrete go well with flag, brick and concrete walkways or patios. If you reside in climates wherever winter temperatures dip below zero, concrete pavers are an honest selection. They are ready to stoppage well in extreme temperatures. Opt for pavers in shades like ochre, pink, bisque, white or sand. Pavers are available in hole, x-shape, y-shape, pentagon, polygon and fan styles.

'''Broadband mapping in the United States''' are efforts to describe geographically how [[Internet access]] service from telephone and cable TV companies (commonly called "broadband") is available in terms of available speed and price. Mapping has been done on the national as well as the state level. The efforts are seen as preliminary steps towards [[broadband universal service]].

==Background==
Internet access and [[bit rate]]s (often called "speeds") vary considerably across the US. Generally, [[rural Internet]] users have fewer options and slower service. American consumers often spend more money for slower service than in other countries.&lt;ref name="Gross08"&gt;{{cite news

 |title= FCC Approves New Broadband Mapping Plan
 |work= Washington Post
 |quote= the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday voted to approve a broadband mapping plan that would break down broadband availability by speed across the country and provide a more granular look at where broadband is available. ...customers in many other nations have speeds of 25M bps to 100M bps for less money per month than U.S. customers pay for less than 10M bps. ...

Former [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and [[California Public Utilities Commission]] commissioner Rachelle Chong floated the idea of broadband mapping while working for the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger]] Administration in California in 2006.  The California Broadband Task Force had performed the first voluntary broadband mapping exercise in that state in 2006-2007, having learned about it when Commissioner Chong visited the [[ConnectKentucky]] broadband project in 2005.  The broadband maps were then used by the CPUC to determine both "unserved areas" (defined as an area that is not served by any form of facilities-based broadband, or where Internet connectivity is available only through dial-up service or satellite) and "underserved" areas (defined as an area in which broadband is available but no facilities-based provider offers service at speeds of at least 3 megabytes per second (MB/s) download and 1 Mbit/s upload).  A $100 million program called the California Advanced Services Fund (CASF) was established on December 20, 2007, under the leadership of Assigned Commissioner Chong at the CPUC to bring an "onramp to the Internet" to unserved areas and underserved areas of the state, with unserved areas having first priority using filing windows.  In 2008, State Senator Alex Padilla (D-Pacoima)codified the CASF program with Senate Bill (SB) 1193, signed by Governor Schwarzenegger on September 29, 2008, to ensure it had the legislative authority it needed to operate. On September 25, 2010, Governor Schwarzenegger signed SB1040 which added CASF funds of $125 million, of which $100 million went to broadband infrastructure funding, and $25 million to broadband adoption programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/Telco/Information+for+providing+service/CASF/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901160437/http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/Telco/Information%2Bfor%2Bproviding%2Bservice/CASF/ |archivedate=2013-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the FCC approved a broadband mapping plan which would examine availability by speed and "provide a more granular look at where broadband is available," according to a report in the ''[[Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name="Gross08"/&gt; 
The Broadband Data Improvement Act was introduced by Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] in 2007 and became law on October 10, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= S. 1492: Broadband Data Improvement Act |author= US Congress legislation |date= October 10, 2008 |url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-1492 |accessdate= July 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The act's section 106 created a legal framework for the [[United States Department of Commerce]]'s State Broadband Data and Development Grant Program, but did not fund it.

The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) was funded as part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] (known as the "stimulus package") under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]]. Funds were allocated by the Commerce department and the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA) in February 2009.

In April 2, 2009, California's Commissioner Chong testified before the House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet, about the California broadband program, and recommended that every state be required to perform broadband mapping in order to have an accurate understanding of its unserved and underserved areas, and not waste American Recovery and Reinvestment Act federal funding for broadband expansion. She further recommended that the broadband data be collected at the granular street address level annually in order to get the most accurate data. She testified that broadband mapping funds should be fairly allocated among the states, with an eye towards population, density, area, broadband penetration, and state's commitment to broadband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090402/testimony_chong.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214052655/http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090402/testimony_chong.pdf |archivedate=2012-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NTIA was to create and release a National Broadband Inventory Map by February 17, 2011.

Initially an estimated 350 million dollars would be spent on the map.&lt;ref name=twsH11&gt;{{cite news

==Lack of mapping standards==
As with other [[thematic map]]s, there is no standard for mapping information.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; Rather, different studies have been done using different geographic and data rate parameters.&lt;ref name=twsH11/&gt; Geometric units such as [[census tracts]] as well as [[zip code]]s have been used.&lt;ref name="Gross08"/&gt; 
Although the term [[broadband]] once had a technical meaning, it is used in marketing and policy to generally apply to relatively high data rate (and thus more expensive) Internet access, while technology changes over time.
One 2007 estimate used five speed ranges, with the lowest being from 200 kbit/s to 768 kbit/s, and the highest was more than 6 Mbit/s.&lt;ref name="Gross08"/&gt;

==Politics and controversy==
Politics influences the allocation of funds.&lt;ref name=twsH15/&gt; The National Telecommunications and Information Administration in 2009 said it would reassess the program to ensure the funds are used in a "fiscally prudent" manner, after private firms claimed they could make the map for much less.&lt;ref name=twsH14&gt;{{cite news

 |quote= Broadband mapping is a term in high currency right now, and could become an important part of the Broadband stimulus initiative. While it is likely to have many benefits, these benefits will be achieved only if the process is conducted with careful attention to quality. As someone who has spent 28+ years doing social research, I am concerned to observe that much of the recent broadband mapping is not of high quality, to the extent that to make decisions based on it “results” would be irresponsible and ill advised.

== Geology ==
{{main|Columbia River Basalt Group}}
During late [[Miocene]] and early [[Pliocene]] times, a [[flood basalt]] engulfed about {{convert|63000|sqmi|km2}} of the Pacific Northwest, forming a [[large igneous province]].&lt;ref name=CVO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/ColumbiaPlateau/description_columbia_plateau.html|title=Description: Columbia Plateau Columbia River Basalt|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a period of perhaps 10 to 15 million years, lava flow after lava flow poured out, ultimately accumulating to a thickness of more than 6,000 feet (1.8&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name=CVO/&gt; As the molten rock came to the surface, the Earth's crust gradually sank into the space left by the rising lava. The Columbia River Basalt Group consists of seven formations: The Steens Basalt, Imnaha Basalt, Grande Ronde Basalt, Picture Gorge Basalt, Prineville Basalt, Wanapum Basalt, and Saddle Mountains Basalt. Many of these formations are subdivided into formal and informal members and flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo/cvo_columbia_river_basalt.html|title=Columbia River Basalt Group Stretches from Oregon to Idaho|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CVO/&gt;

The subsidence of the crust produced the large [[plateau]]—a large, slightly depressed lava plain sometimes also known as the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]].&lt;ref name=CVO/&gt; The ancient [[Columbia River]] was forced into its present course by the northwesterly advancing lava. The lava, as it flowed over the area, first filled the stream valleys, forming dams that in turn caused impoundments or lakes.&lt;ref name=CVO/&gt; Entities found in these lake beds include [[fossil]] leaf impressions, [[petrified wood]], fossil insects, and bones of vertebrate animals.&lt;ref name=CVO/&gt;

Evidence suggests that some concentrated heat source is melting rock beneath the Columbia Plateau Province at the base of the lithosphere (the layer of crust and upper mantle that forms Earth's moving tectonic plates). In an effort to figure out why this area, far from a plate boundary, had such an enormous outpouring of lava, scientists established hardening dates for many of the individual lava flows. They found that the youngest volcanic rocks were clustered near the Yellowstone Plateau, and that the farther west they went, the older the lavas.&lt;ref name="columplat"&gt;{{USGS|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/columplat.html
|article=Columbia Plateau Province}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although scientists are still gathering evidence, a probable explanation is that a [[hot spot (geology)|hot spot]], an extremely hot plume of deep [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] material, is rising to the surface beneath the Columbia Plateau Province. Geologists{{who|date=September 2018}} know{{how|date=September 2018}} that beneath [[Hawaii]] and [[Iceland]], a temperature instability develops (for reasons not yet well understood){{by who|date=September 2018}} at the [[core–mantle boundary|boundary between the core and mantle]]. The concentrated heat triggers a plume hundreds of kilometers in diameter that ascends directly through to the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name="columplat"/&gt;

The track of this hot spot starts in the west and sweeps up to [[Yellowstone National Park]]. The steaming fumaroles and explosive [[geyser]]s are ample evidence of a concentration of heat beneath the surface. The hotspot is stationary, but the North American plate is moving over it, creating a superb record of the rate and direction of plate motion.&lt;ref name="columplat"/&gt;

==Flora==
Part of the Columbia Plateau is associated with the [[Columbia Plateau (ecoregion)|Columbia Plateau ecoregion]], part of the 'Nearctic temperate and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands' [[ecoregion]] of the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2655">The '''Côa River''' is a tributary of the [[Douro River]], in central and northeastern [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crossculturedtraveler.com/Heritage/Archives/Coa_Valley.htm Coa Valley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121152705/http://www.crossculturedtraveler.com/Heritage/Archives/Coa_Valley.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}, from [http://www.crossculturedtraveler.com/index.htm The Cultured Traveler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402040912/http://www.crossculturedtraveler.com/index.htm |date=2009-04-02 }}. Retrieved April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few Portuguese rivers that flows south to north. It flows through the municipalities of [[Sabugal Municipality]], [[Almeida Municipality]], [[Pinhel Municipality]], [[Figueira de Castelo Rodrigo Municipality]] and [[Vila Nova de Foz Côa Municipality]], all located in the [[Guarda District]].

Thousands of ancient carvings in stone were discovered in the [[Côa Valley]] in the 1980s and 1990s. These are of particular interest due to the high concentration of [[Paleolithic art]], and because these carvings are found outside of caves, on rocks in plain sight: [[Jean Clottes]], a prominent French prehistorian, had confirmed that "is the biggest open air site of paleolithic art in Europe, if not in the world".

The drawings attracted worldwide attention when plans to build a [[hydroelectric]] dam across the Côa Valley threatened to submerge them. Although hydroelectric development was already well underway, outcry from locals, the scientific community and the media led to dam construction being halted in 1995 after a change in the national government following elections. A significant proportion of the drawings in the Canada do Inferno area were already underwater by that time. The [[Côa Valley Paleolithic Art|Côa Valley Archaeological Park]], opened in 1996 [http://www.ipa.min-cultura.pt/coa/], was declared a protected [[UNESCO]] world heritage site in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Portuguese Tourist Office|title=World Heritage Sites in Portugal: Foz Coa|url=http://www.manorhouses.com/unesco/whfozc.html|publisher=Manor Houses of Portugal|year=2014|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Côa river was also the site of the [[Côa Battle]] during  the [[Peninsular War]]. There are several castles along Terras de Riba-Côa, such as Sabugal and Pinhel.

The '''Dutch East India Company''' ({{lang-nl|Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie}}; '''VOC''') was an early [[megacorporation]], founded by a [[States-General of the Dutch Republic|government-directed]] [[consolidation (business)|amalgamation]] of several rival Dutch trading companies (the so-called ''[[voorcompagnie]]ën'' or ''pre-companies'') in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gelderblom, Oscar; de Jong, Abe; Jonker, Joost (2011), 'An Admiralty for Asia: Business Organization and the Evolution of Corporate Governance in the Dutch Republic, 1590–1640,'; in J.G. Koppell (ed.), Origins of Shareholder Advocacy. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011), pp. 29–70. Gelderblom, Jonker &amp; de Jong (2010): "The hot rivalry between the ''[[voorcompagnie]]ën'' undermined the country's fragile political unity and economic prosperity, and seriously limited the prospects of competing successfully against other Asian traders from Europe. ... According to [[Willem Usselincx]], a large merchant well versed in the intercontinental trade, the VOC charter was drafted by ''bewindhebbers'' bent on defending their own interests and the [[States-General of the Dutch Republic|Estates General]] had allowed that to pass so as to achieve the desired merger (Van Rees 1868, 410). An agreement was finally reached on March 20th, 1602, after which the Estates General issued a charter granting a monopoly on the Asian trade for 21 years (Gaastra 2009, 21–23)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unoki"&gt;Unoki, Ko (2012), 'A Seafaring Empire,'; in ''Mergers, Acquisitions and Global Empires: Tolerance, Diversity and the Success of M&amp;A'', by Ko Unoki.

Along with the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC/GWIC), the VOC became seen as the international arm of the [[Dutch Republic]] and the symbolic power of the [[Dutch Empire]]. To further its trade routes, the VOC-funded exploratory voyages such as those led by [[Willem Janszoon]] (''[[Duyfken]]''), [[Henry Hudson]] (''[[Halve Maen]]'') and [[Abel Tasman]] who revealed largely unknown landmasses to the western world. In the [[Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography]] (c. 1570s–1670s), VOC navigators and cartographers helped shape geographical knowledge of the world as we know it today.

Socio-economic changes in Europe, the shift in power balance, and less successful financial management resulted in a slow decline of the VOC between 1720 and 1799. After the financially disastrous [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] (1780–1784), the company was first nationalised in 1796,&lt;ref&gt;Due to internal structural changes, the effects of the fourth Anglo Dutch War in 1780 and the invasion of the French in 1795 all contributed to created a perfect storm devastating the company's revenue and lending capability. The 'Committee for Affairs Relating to East India Trade and Possessions', instituted by the new Batavian Republic revolutionary government, resulting in the VOC being nationalised on 1 January 1800. The VOC charter, the legal foundation of the enterprise was revoked. Although the state of war in Europe permitted no drastic changes in course as far as shipping and trade to Asia were concerned it spelled the end of the company {{aut|Balk, L., Van Dijk, F., Kortlang, D., Gaastra, F.

All assets were taken over by the government with VOC territories becoming Dutch government colonies. 

In spite of [[Dutch East India Company#Historical roles and legacy|the VOC's historic roles and contributions]], the Company has long been heavily criticized for its monopoly policy, [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]], colonialism, uses of violence, and slavery.

[[File:Michiel Jansz van Mierevelt - Johan van Oldenbarnevelt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The "United East Indian Company", or "United East Indies Company" (also known by the abbreviation "VOC" in Dutch) was the brainchild of [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], the leading statesman of the Dutch Republic.]]

Before the [[Dutch Revolt]], Antwerp had played an important role as a distribution centre in northern Europe. After 1591, however, the Portuguese used an international syndicate of the German [[Fugger]]s and [[Welser]]s, and Spanish and Italian firms, that used Hamburg as the northern staple port to distribute their goods, thereby cutting Dutch merchants out of the trade. At the same time, the Portuguese trade system was unable to increase supply to satisfy growing demand, in particular the demand for pepper. Demand for spices was relatively [[Price elasticity of demand|inelastic]], and therefore each lag in the supply of pepper caused a sharp rise in pepper prices.

In 1580 the Portuguese crown was [[Iberian Union|united]] in a [[personal union]] with the Spanish crown, with which the [[Dutch Republic]] was at war. The [[Portuguese Empire]] therefore became an appropriate target for Dutch military incursions. These factors motivated Dutch merchants to enter the intercontinental spice trade themselves. Further, a number of Dutchmen like [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]] and [[Cornelis de Houtman]] obtained first hand knowledge of the "secret" Portuguese trade routes and practices, thereby providing opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oih1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oost-Indisch Huis|VOC headquarters]] in Amsterdam]]

The stage was thus set for the four-ship exploratory expedition by [[Frederick de Houtman]] in 1595 to [[Bantam (city)|Banten]], the main pepper port of West Java, where they clashed with both the Portuguese and indigenous Indonesians. Houtman's expedition then sailed east along the north coast of [[Java]], losing twelve crew to a Javanese attack at [[Sidayu]] and killing a local ruler in [[Madura]]. Half the crew were lost before the expedition made it back to the Netherlands the following year, but with enough spices to make a considerable profit.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp27"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ricklefs |first=M.C.  |authorlink= |author2= |title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition |publisher=MacMillan |year=1991  |location=London |page=27 |url= |doi= |isbn=0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ThuiskomstVanNeck1599.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Return of the [[Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|second Asia expedition]] of [[Jacob van Neck]] in 1599 by [[Cornelis Vroom]]]]

In 1598, an increasing number of fleets were sent out by competing merchant groups from around the Netherlands. Some fleets were lost, but most were successful, with some voyages producing high profits. In March 1599, a [[Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia (1598–1600)|fleet of eight ships]] under [[Jacob van Neck]] was the first Dutch fleet to reach the 'Spice Islands' of Maluku, the source of pepper, cutting out the Javanese middlemen. The ships returned to Europe in 1599 and 1600 and the expedition made a 400 percent profit.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp27"/&gt;

In 1600, the Dutch joined forces with the Muslim Hituese on [[Ambon Island]] in an anti-Portuguese alliance, in return for which the Dutch were given the sole right to purchase spices from Hitu.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp28"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ricklefs  |first=M.C.  |authorlink= |author2= |title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  |publisher=MacMillan  |year=1991  |location=London  |pages=25–28  |url= |doi= |isbn=0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch control of Ambon was achieved when the Portuguese surrendered their fort in Ambon to the Dutch-Hituese alliance. In 1613, the Dutch expelled the Portuguese from their [[Solor]] fort, but a subsequent Portuguese attack led to a second change of hands; following this second reoccupation, the Dutch once again captured Solor, in 1636.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp28"/&gt;

East of Solor, on the island of Timor, Dutch advances were halted by an autonomous and powerful group of Portuguese Eurasians called the [[Topasses]]. They remained in control of the [[Sandalwood]] trade and their resistance lasted throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, causing [[Portuguese Timor]] to remain under the Portuguese sphere of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} Matos, Artur Teodoro de (1974), ''Timor Portugues, 1515–1769'', Lisboa: Instituto Histórico Infante Dom Henrique.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} Roever, Arend de (2002), ''De jacht op sandelhout: De VOC en de tweedeling van Timor in de zeventiende eeuw'', Zutphen: Walburg Pers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment in these expeditions was a very high-risk venture, not only because of the usual dangers of piracy, disease and shipwreck, but also because the interplay of inelastic demand and relatively elastic supply&lt;ref&gt;In the medium term, as new suppliers could enter the market. In the short term the supply was, of course, also inelastic.&lt;/ref&gt; of spices could make prices tumble at just the wrong moment, thereby ruining prospects of profitability. To manage such risk the forming of a [[cartel]] to control supply would seem logical. The English had been the first to adopt this approach, by bundling their resources into a monopoly enterprise, the [[East India Company|English East India Company]] in 1600, thereby threatening their Dutch competitors with ruin.&lt;ref name="Woude p. 384–385"&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, p.&amp;nbsp;384–385&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1602, the Dutch government followed suit, sponsoring the creation of a single "United East Indies Company" that was also granted monopoly over the Asian trade. For a time in the seventeenth century, they were able to monopolize the trade in nutmeg, mace, and cloves and to sell these spices in Europe and India at fourteen to seventeen times the price they paid in Indonesia;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce, 1450–1680|last=Reid|first=Anthony|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1993|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Dutch profits soared, the local economy of the Spice Islands was destroyed. With a capital of 6,440,200 [[guilder]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Bruce|title=Annals of the Honorable East-India Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3s4NAAAAIAAJ|year=1810|publisher=Black, Parry, and Kingsbury|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the charter of the new company empowered it to build forts, maintain armies, and conclude treaties with Asian rulers. It provided for a venture that would continue for 21 years, with a financial accounting only at the end of each decade.&lt;ref name="Woude p. 384–385" /&gt;

In February 1603, the Company seized the [[Santa Catarina (ship)|''Santa Catarina'']], a 1500-ton Portuguese merchant [[carrack]], off the coast of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=C. R.

Also in 1603 the first permanent Dutch trading post in Indonesia was established in [[Banten]], [[West Java]], and in 1611 another was established at [[Jayakarta]] (later "Batavia" and then "Jakarta").&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp29"&gt;{{cite book  |last=Ricklefs  |first=M.C.  |title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  |publisher=MacMillan  |year=1991  |location=London  |page=29  |isbn=0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1610, the VOC established the post of [[Governor General]] to more firmly control their affairs in Asia. To advise and control the risk of [[Despotism|despotic]] Governors General, a Council of the Indies (''Raad van Indië'') was created. The Governor General effectively became the main administrator of the VOC's activities in Asia, although the ''Heeren XVII'', a body of 17 shareholders representing different chambers, continued to officially have overall control.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp28"/&gt;

[[File:Amboina. 17th century print, most likely English..jpg|thumb|left|''The Isle of Amboina'', a 17th-century print, probably English]]

VOC headquarters were located in [[Governorate of Ambon|Ambon]] during the tenures of the first three Governors General (1610–1619), but it was not a satisfactory location. Although it was at the centre of the spice production areas, it was far from the Asian trade routes and other VOC areas of activity ranging from Africa to India to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Om Prakash, ''The Dutch East India Company and the Economy of Bengal, 1630–1720''  (Princeton University Press, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William De Lange, ''Pars Japonica: the first Dutch expedition to reach the shores of Japan'', (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; A location in the west of the archipelago was thus sought. The Straits of Malacca were strategic but had become dangerous following the Portuguese conquest, and the first permanent VOC settlement in Banten was controlled by a powerful local ruler and subject to stiff competition from Chinese and English traders.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp28"/&gt;

In 1604, a second English [[East India Company]] voyage commanded by [[Sir Henry Middleton]] reached the islands of [[Ternate]], [[Tidore]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Banda Islands|Banda]]. In Banda, they encountered severe VOC hostility, sparking Anglo-Dutch competition for access to spices.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp29"/&gt; From 1611 to 1617, the English established trading posts at [[Sukadana]] (southwest [[Kalimantan]]), [[Makassar]], [[Jayakarta]] and [[Jepara]] in [[Java]], and Aceh, [[Pariaman]] and [[Jambi]] in [[Sumatra]], which threatened Dutch ambitions for a monopoly on East Indies trade.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp29"/&gt;

Diplomatic agreements in Europe in 1620 ushered in a period of co-operation between the Dutch and the English over the spice trade.&lt;ref name="RICKLEFSp29"/&gt; This ended with a notorious but disputed incident known as the '[[Amboyna massacre]]', where ten Englishmen were arrested, tried and beheaded for conspiracy against the Dutch government.&lt;ref name="MILLER_XVI"&gt;{{cite book  |last=Miller |first=George (ed.) |title=To The Spice Islands and Beyond: Travels in Eastern Indonesia |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |location=New York|pages=xvi  |isbn=967-65-3099-9  |nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this caused outrage in Europe and a diplomatic crisis, the English quietly withdrew from most of their Indonesian activities (except trading in Banten) and focused on other Asian interests.

In 1619, [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]] was appointed Governor-General of the VOC. He saw the possibility of the VOC becoming an Asian power, both political and economic. On 30 May 1619, Coen, backed by a force of nineteen ships, stormed Jayakarta, driving out the Banten forces; and from the ashes established [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] as the VOC headquarters. In the 1620s almost the entire native population of the [[Banda Islands]] was driven away, starved to death, or killed in an attempt to replace them with Dutch plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ricklefs |first=M.C. |authorlink= |author2= |title=A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition |publisher=MacMillan |year=1991 |location= London |page=30 |url= |doi= |isbn=0-333-57689-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These plantations were used to grow [[cloves]] and [[nutmeg]] for export. Coen hoped to settle large numbers of Dutch colonists in the East Indies, but implementation of this policy never materialised, mainly because very few Dutch were willing to emigrate to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;The Dutch Seaborne Empire 1600–1800, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Coen's ventures was more successful. A major problem in the European trade with Asia at the time was that the Europeans could offer few goods that Asian consumers wanted, except silver and gold. European traders therefore had to pay for spices with the precious metals, which were in short supply in Europe, except for Spain and Portugal. The Dutch and English had to obtain it by creating a trade surplus with other European countries. Coen discovered the obvious solution for the problem: to start an intra-Asiatic trade system, whose profits could be used to finance the spice trade with Europe. In the long run this obviated the need for exports of precious metals from Europe, though at first it required the formation of a large trading-capital fund in the Indies. The VOC reinvested a large share of its profits to this end in the period up to 1630.&lt;ref name="vries386"&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

The VOC traded throughout Asia. Ships coming into Batavia from the Netherlands carried supplies for VOC settlements in Asia. Silver and copper from Japan were used to trade with India and China for silk, cotton, porcelain, and textiles. These products were either traded within Asia for the coveted spices or brought back to Europe. The VOC was also instrumental in introducing European ideas and technology to Asia. The Company supported Christian missionaries and traded modern technology with China and Japan. A more peaceful VOC trade post on [[Dejima]], an [[artificial island]] off the coast of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], was for more than two hundred years the only place where Europeans were permitted to trade with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Globe Encompassed: The Age of European Discovery, 1500–1700|author=Ames, Glenn J.|year=2008|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the VOC tried to use military force to make [[Ming dynasty]] China open up to Dutch trade, the Chinese defeated the Dutch in [[Sino–Dutch conflicts|a war over the Penghu islands]] from 1623 to 1624, forcing the VOC to abandon [[Penghu]] for Taiwan. The Chinese defeated the VOC again at the [[Battle of Liaoluo Bay]] in 1633.

The Vietnamese Nguyen Lords defeated the VOC in [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War#Later campaigns|a 1643 battle]] during the [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War]], blowing up a Dutch ship. The Cambodians defeated the VOC in the [[Cambodian–Dutch War]] from 1643 to 1644 on the Mekong River.

[[File:Dutch factory at Hooghly-Chinsura 1721.jpg|thumb|left|Dutch factory of Hugly–Chinsurah in Bengal]]

In 1640, the VOC obtained the port of [[Galle]], [[Dutch Ceylon|Ceylon]], from the Portuguese and broke the latter's monopoly of the [[cinnamon]] trade. In 1658, [[Gerard Pietersz. Hulft]] laid siege to [[Colombo]], which was captured with the help of King [[Rajasinghe II]] of [[Kandy]]. By 1659, the Portuguese had been expelled from the coastal regions, which were then occupied by the VOC, securing for it the monopoly over cinnamon.
To prevent the Portuguese or the English from ever recapturing Sri Lanka, the VOC went on to conquer the entire [[Dutch Malabar|Malabar Coast]] from the Portuguese, almost entirely driving them from the west coast of India. When news of a peace agreement between Portugal and the Netherlands reached Asia in 1663, Goa was the only remaining Portuguese city on the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vocwarfare.net/thesis/3/political-interaction|title=Calling the shots: political interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1652, [[Jan van Riebeeck]] established an outpost at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] (the southwestern tip of Africa, now [[Cape Town]], South Africa) to re-supply VOC ships on their journey to East Asia. This post later became a full-fledged colony, the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], when more Dutch and other Europeans started to settle there.

Through the seventeenth century VOC trading posts were also established in [[Persia]], [[Dutch Bengal|Bengal]], [[Dutch Malacca|Malacca]], [[Thailand|Siam]], [[Dutch Formosa|Formosa]] (now Taiwan), as well as the [[Dutch Malabar|Malabar]] and [[Dutch Coromandel|Coromandel]] coasts in India. Direct access to mainland China came in 1729 when a factory was established in [[Guangzhou|Canton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hertroijes |first1=Frasie |title=Meeting the Dutch: cooperation and conflict between Jesuits and Dutch merchants in Asia, 1680–1795 |journal=paper presented at the conference of ENIUGH, London |year=2011 |page=10 |url=http://research.uni-leipzig.de/eniugh/congress/fileadmin/eniugh2011/dokumente/Going_Dutch_Hertroijs_2011_4_7.pdf |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1662, however, [[Koxinga]] expelled the Dutch from Taiwan&lt;ref name=Andrade&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrade|first=Tonio|title=How Taiwan Became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2005|url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/andrade/andrade11.html#s02/}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''see'' [[History of Taiwan]]).

In 1663, the VOC signed the "Painan Treaty" with several local lords in the [[Painan]] area that were revolting against the [[Aceh Sultanate]]. The treaty allowed the VOC to build a trading post in the area and eventually to monopolise the trade there, especially the gold trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/1982/07/31/BK/mbm.19820731.BK47129.id.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314193208/http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/1982/07/31/BK/mbm.19820731.BK47129.id.html |archive-date=14 March 2012 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1669, the VOC was the richest private company the world had ever seen, with over 150 merchant ships, 40 warships, 50,000 employees, a private army of 10,000 soldiers, and a [[dividend]] payment of 40% on the original investment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The share price had appreciated significantly, so in that respect the dividend was less impressive&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1670, two events caused the growth of VOC trade to stall. In the first place, the highly profitable trade with Japan started to decline. The loss of the outpost on Formosa to [[Koxinga]] in the 1662 [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]] and related internal turmoil in China (where the [[Ming dynasty]] was being replaced with the [[Qing dynasty]]) brought an end to the silk trade after 1666. Though the VOC substituted Bengali for Chinese silk other forces affected the supply of Japanese silver and gold. The [[shogunate]] enacted a number of measures to limit the export of these precious metals, in the process limiting VOC opportunities for trade, and severely worsening the terms of trade. Therefore, Japan ceased to function as the lynchpin of the intra-Asiatic trade of the VOC by 1685.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, pp.&amp;nbsp;434–435&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more importantly, the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] temporarily interrupted VOC trade with Europe. This caused a spike in the price of pepper, which enticed the English East India Company (EIC) to enter this market aggressively in the years after 1672. Previously, one of the tenets of the VOC pricing policy was to slightly over-supply the pepper market, so as to depress prices below the level where interlopers were encouraged to enter the market (instead of striving for short-term profit maximisation). The wisdom of such a policy was illustrated when a fierce price war with the EIC ensued, as that company flooded the market with new supplies from India. In this struggle for market share, the VOC (which had much larger financial resources) could wait out the EIC. Indeed, by 1683, the latter came close to bankruptcy; its share price plummeted from 600 to 250; and its president [[Josiah Child]] was temporarily forced from office.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, pp.&amp;nbsp;430–433&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the writing was on the wall. Other companies, like the [[French East India Company]] and the [[Danish East India Company]] also started to make inroads on the Dutch system. The VOC therefore closed the heretofore flourishing open pepper emporium of [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] by a treaty of 1684 with the Sultan. Also, on the [[Dutch Coromandel|Coromandel Coast]], it moved its chief stronghold from [[Pulicat]] to [[Negapatnam]], so as to secure a monopoly on the pepper trade at the detriment of the French and the Danes.&lt;ref&gt;During the [[War of the Grand Alliance|Nine Years' War]], the French and Dutch companies came to blows on the Indian Subcontinent. The French sent naval expeditions from metropolitan France, which the VOC easily countered. On the other hand, the VOC conquered the important fortress of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondichéry]] after a siege of only 16 days by an expedition of 3,000 men and 19 ships under [[Laurens Pit]] from [[Negapatnam]] in September 1693. The Dutch then made the defenses of the fortress impregnable, which they came to regret when the Dutch government returned it to the French by the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] in exchange for tariff concessions in Europe by the French. Chauhuri and Israel, p 424&lt;/ref&gt; However, the importance of these traditional commodities in the Asian-European trade was diminishing rapidly at the time. The military outlays that the VOC needed to make to enhance its monopoly were not justified by the increased profits of this declining trade.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, pp.&amp;nbsp;433–434&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, this lesson was slow to sink in and at first the VOC made the strategic decision to improve its military position on the [[Dutch Malabar|Malabar Coast]] (hoping thereby to curtail English influence in the area, and end the drain on its resources from the cost of the Malabar garrisons) by using force to compel the [[Saamoothiri|Zamorin]] of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] to submit to Dutch domination. In 1710, the Zamorin was made to sign a treaty with the VOC undertaking to trade exclusively with the VOC and expel other European traders. For a brief time, this appeared to improve the Company's prospects. However, in 1715, with EIC encouragement, the Zamorin renounced the treaty. Though a Dutch army managed to suppress this insurrection temporarily, the Zamorin continued to trade with the English and the French, which led to an appreciable upsurge in English and French traffic. The VOC decided in 1721 that it was no longer worth the trouble to try to dominate the [[Malabar pepper]] and spice trade. A strategic decision was taken to scale down the Dutch military presence and in effect yield the area to EIC influence.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri and Israel, pp.&amp;nbsp;428–429&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Lannoy Surrender.JPG|250px|thumb|left|[[Eustachius De Lannoy]] of the Dutch East India Company surrenders to Maharaja [[Marthanda Varma]] of the Indian [[Kingdom of Travancore]] after the [[Battle of Colachel]]. (Depiction at [[Padmanabhapuram Palace]])]]
The 1741 [[Battle of Colachel]] by warriors of [[Travancore]] under Raja [[Marthanda Varma]] defeated the Dutch. The Dutch commander Captain [[Eustachius De Lannoy]] was captured. Marthanda Varma agreed to spare the Dutch captain's life on condition that he joined his army and trained his soldiers on modern lines. This defeat in the [[Travancore-Dutch War]] is considered the earliest example of an organised Asian power overcoming European military technology and tactics; and it signalled the decline of Dutch power in India.&lt;ref&gt;However, the VOC had been defeated many times before. On the Indian Subcontinent, the EIC had suffered a resounding defeat from the Mughal forces in its [[1689 Mughal War]]; Chaudhury and Israel, pp.&amp;nbsp;435–436&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt to continue as before as a low volume-high profit business enterprise with its core business in the spice trade had therefore failed. The Company had however already (reluctantly) followed the example of its European competitors in diversifying into other Asian commodities, like tea, coffee, cotton, textiles, and sugar. These commodities provided a lower profit margin and therefore required a larger sales volume to generate the same amount of revenue. This structural change in the commodity composition of the VOC's trade started in the early 1680s, after the temporary collapse of the EIC around 1683 offered an excellent opportunity to enter these markets. The actual cause for the change lies, however, in two structural features of this new era.

In the first place, there was a revolutionary change in the tastes affecting European demand for Asian textiles, coffee and tea, around the turn of the 18th century. Secondly, a new era of an abundant supply of capital at low interest rates suddenly opened around this time. The second factor enabled the Company easily to finance its expansion in the new areas of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;It was also helpful that the price war with the EIC in the early decade had caused the accumulation of enormous inventories of pepper and spices, which enabled the VOC to cut down on shipments later on, thereby freeing up capital to increase shipments of other goods; De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1680s and 1720s, the VOC was therefore able to equip and man an appreciable expansion of its fleet, and acquire a large amount of precious metals to finance the purchase of large amounts of Asian commodities, for shipment to Europe. The overall effect was approximately to double the size of the company.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, pp.&amp;nbsp;436–437&lt;/ref&gt;

The tonnage of the returning ships rose by 125 percent in this period. However, the Company's revenues from the sale of goods landed in Europe rose by only 78 percent. This reflects the basic change in the VOC's circumstances that had occurred: it now operated in new markets for goods with an elastic demand, in which it had to compete on an equal footing with other suppliers. This made for low profit margins.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, pp.&amp;nbsp;437–440&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the business information systems of the time made this difficult to discern for the managers of the company, which may partly explain the mistakes they made from hindsight. This lack of information might have been counteracted (as in earlier times in the VOC's history) by the business acumen of the directors. Unfortunately by this time these were almost exclusively recruited from the political ''[[Regenten|regent]]'' class, which had long since lost its close relationship with merchant circles.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, pp.&amp;nbsp;441–442&lt;/ref&gt;

Low profit margins in themselves do not explain the deterioration of revenues. To a large extent the costs of the operation of the VOC had a "fixed" character (military establishments; maintenance of the fleet and such). Profit levels might therefore have been maintained if the increase in the scale of trading operations that in fact took place had resulted in [[economies of scale]]. However, though larger ships transported the growing volume of goods, labour productivity did not go up sufficiently to realise these. In general the Company's overhead rose in step with the growth in trade volume; declining gross margins translated directly into a decline in profitability of the invested capital. The era of expansion was one of "profitless growth".&lt;ref name="De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 447"&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically:  "[t]he long-term average annual profit in the VOC's 1630–70 'Golden Age' was 2.1&amp;nbsp;million guilders, of which just under half was distributed as dividends and the remainder reinvested. The long-term average annual profit in the 'Expansion Age' (1680–1730) was 2.0&amp;nbsp;million guilders, of which three-quarters was distributed as dividend and one-quarter reinvested. In the earlier period, profits averaged 18 percent of total revenues; in the latter period, 10 percent. The annual return of invested capital in the earlier period stood at approximately 6 percent; in the latter period, 3.4 percent."&lt;ref name="De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 447"/&gt;

Nevertheless, in the eyes of investors the VOC did not do too badly. The share price hovered consistently around the 400 mark from the mid-1680s (excepting a hiccup around the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688), and they reached an all-time high of around 642 in the 1720s. VOC shares then yielded a return of 3.5 percent, only slightly less than the yield on Dutch government bonds.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decline and fall====
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
After 1730, the fortunes of the VOC started to decline. Five major problems, not all of equal weight, explain its decline over the next fifty years to 1780:&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, pp.&amp;nbsp;449–455&lt;/ref&gt;
* There was a steady erosion of intra-Asiatic trade because of changes in the Asiatic political and economic environment that the VOC could do little about. These factors gradually squeezed the company out of Persia, [[Dutch Suratte|Suratte]], the Malabar Coast, and Bengal. The company had to confine its operations to the belt it physically controlled, from Ceylon through the Indonesian archipelago. The volume of this intra-Asiatic trade, and its profitability, therefore had to shrink.
* The way the company was organised in Asia (centralised on its hub in Batavia), that initially had offered advantages in gathering market information, began to cause disadvantages in the 18th century because of the inefficiency of first shipping everything to this central point. This disadvantage was most keenly felt in the tea trade, where competitors like the EIC and the [[Ostend Company]] shipped directly from China to Europe.
* The "venality" of the VOC's personnel (in the sense of corruption and non-performance of duties), though a problem for all East India Companies at the time, seems to have plagued the VOC on a larger scale than its competitors. To be sure, the company was not a "good employer". Salaries were low, and "private-account trading" was officially not allowed. Not surprisingly, it proliferated in the 18th century to the detriment of the company's performance.&lt;ref&gt;A particularly egregious example was that of the "Amfioen Society". This was a business of higher VOC-employees that received a monopoly of the opium trade on Java, at a time when the VOC had to pay monopoly prices to the EIC to buy the opium in Bengal; Burger, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; From about the 1790s onward, the phrase ''perished under corruption'' (''vergaan onder corruptie'', also abbreviated VOC in Dutch) came to summarise the company's future.
* A problem that the VOC shared with other companies was the high mortality and morbidity rates among its employees. This decimated the company's ranks and enervated many of the survivors.
* A self-inflicted wound was the VOC's [[dividend policy]]. The dividends distributed by the company had exceeded the surplus it garnered in Europe in every decade from 1690 to 1760 except 1710–1720. However, in the period up to 1730 the directors shipped resources to Asia to build up the trading capital there. Consolidated bookkeeping therefore probably would have shown that total profits exceeded dividends. In addition, between 1700 and 1740 the company retired 5.4&amp;nbsp;million guilders of long-term debt. The company therefore was still on a secure financial footing in these years. This changed after 1730. While profits plummeted the ''bewindhebbers'' only slightly decreased dividends from the earlier level. Distributed dividends were therefore in excess of earnings in every decade but one (1760–1770). To accomplish this, the Asian capital stock had to be drawn down by 4&amp;nbsp;million guilders between 1730 and 1780, and the [[market liquidity|liquid]] capital available in Europe was reduced by 20 million guilders in the same period. The directors were therefore constrained to replenish the company's liquidity by resorting to short-term financing from anticipatory loans, backed by expected revenues from home-bound fleets.

Despite these problems, the VOC in 1780 remained an enormous operation. Its capital in the Republic, consisting of ships and goods in inventory, totalled 28&amp;nbsp;million guilders; its capital in Asia, consisting of the liquid trading fund and goods en route to Europe, totalled 46&amp;nbsp;million guilders. Total capital, net of outstanding debt, stood at 62&amp;nbsp;million guilders. The prospects of the company at this time therefore were not hopeless, had one of the plans for reform been undertaken successfully. However, the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] intervened. British attacks in Europe and Asia reduced the VOC fleet by half; removed valuable cargo from its control; and devastated its remaining power in Asia. The direct losses of the VOC can be calculated at 43&amp;nbsp;million guilders. Loans to keep the company operating reduced its net assets to zero.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, pp.&amp;nbsp;454–455&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1720 on, the market for sugar from Indonesia declined as the competition from cheap sugar from Brazil increased. European markets became saturated. Dozens of Chinese sugar traders went bankrupt, which led to massive unemployment, which in turn led to gangs of unemployed [[coolies]]. The Dutch government in Batavia did not adequately respond to these problems. In 1740, rumours of deportation of the gangs from the Batavia area led to widespread rioting. The Dutch military searched houses of Chinese in Batavia for weapons. When a house accidentally burnt down, military and impoverished citizens started slaughtering and pillaging the Chinese community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kumar, Ann|title=Java and Modern Europe: Ambiguous Encounters|year=1997|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[1740 Batavia massacre|massacre of the Chinese]] was deemed sufficiently serious for the board of the VOC to start an official investigation into the Government of the Dutch East Indies for the first time in its history.

After the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, the VOC was a financial wreck. After vain attempts at reorganisation by the provincial States of Holland and Zeeland, it was nationalised by the new [[Batavian Republic]] on 1 March 1796.&lt;ref name="tanap"&gt;TANAP, The end of the VOC&lt;/ref&gt; The VOC charter was renewed several times, but was allowed to expire on 31 December 1799.&lt;ref name="tanap" /&gt; Most of the possessions of the former VOC were subsequently occupied by Great Britain during the [[Napoleonic wars]], but after the new [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was created by the [[Congress of Vienna]], some of these were restored to this successor state of the Dutch Republic by the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].

[[File:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond.jpg|thumb|A [[bond (finance)|bond]] from the Dutch East India Company (VOC), dating from 7 November 1623. The VOC was the first company in history to issue [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]] to the general public. It was the VOC that invented the idea of investing in the company rather than in a specific venture governed by the company. The VOC was also the first company to use a fully-fledged [[capital market]] (including the [[bond market]] and the [[stock market]]) as a crucial channel to raise medium-term and long-term funds.]]
The VOC is generally considered to be the world's first truly [[transnational corporation]] and it was also the first [[multinational enterprise]] to issue [[Share (finance)|shares]] of [[stock]] to the public. Some historians such as [[Timothy Brook]] and [[Russell Shorto]] consider the VOC as the pioneering corporation in the first wave of the [[corporate globalization]] era.&lt;ref name="TimothyBrook"&gt;[[Timothy Brook|Brook, Timothy]]: ''Vermeer's Hat: The Seventeenth Century and the Dawn of the Global World''. (Profile Books, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RussellShorto"&gt;[[Russell Shorto|Shorto, Russell]] (2013). ''Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City''.&lt;/ref&gt; The VOC was the first multinational corporation to operate officially in different [[continents]] such as Europe, Asia and Africa. While the VOC mainly operated in what later became the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern Indonesia), the company also had important operations elsewhere. It employed people from different continents and origins in the same functions and working environments. Although it was a Dutch company its employees included not only people from the Netherlands, but also many from Germany and from other countries as well. Besides the diverse north-west European [[workforce]] recruited by the VOC in the [[Dutch Republic]], the VOC made extensive use of local Asian labour markets. As a result, the personnel of the various VOC offices in Asia consisted of European and Asian employees. Asian or [[Eurasian]] workers might be employed as sailors, soldiers, writers, carpenters, smiths, or as simple unskilled workers.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Clare; Frykma, Niklas; van Voss, Lex Heerma; Rediker, Marcus (2013). ''Mutiny and Maritime Radicalism in the Age of Revolution: A Global Survey'', p. 113-114&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of its existence the VOC had 25,000 employees who worked in Asia and 11,000 who were en route.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, Jan; Van der Woude, Ad (1997). ''The First Modern Economy: Success, Failure, and Perseverance of the Dutch Economy, 1500–1815'', p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while most of its [[shareholder]]s were Dutch, about a quarter of the initial shareholders were Zuid-Nederlanders (people from an area that includes modern Belgium and [[Luxembourg]]) and there were also a few dozen Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Michael C. (2011). ''Transnationalism and Society: An Introduction'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The VOC had two types of shareholders: the ''participanten'', who could be seen as non-managing members, and the 76 ''bewindhebbers'' (later reduced to 60) who acted as managing directors. This was the usual set-up for Dutch [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] at the time. The innovation in the case of the VOC was that the liability of not just the ''participanten'' but also of the ''bewindhebbers'' was limited to the paid-in capital (usually, ''bewindhebbers'' had unlimited liability). The VOC therefore was a [[limited company|limited liability company]]. Also, the capital would be ''permanent'' during the lifetime of the company. As a consequence, investors that wished to liquidate their interest in the interim could only do this by selling their share to others on the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Confusion of confusions]]'', a 1688 dialogue by the Sephardi Jew [[Joseph de la Vega]] analysed the workings of this one-stock exchange.

The VOC consisted of six Chambers (''Kamers'') in port cities: [[Amsterdam]], [[Delft]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Enkhuizen]], [[Middelburg]] and [[Hoorn]]. Delegates of these chambers convened as the ''Heeren XVII'' (the Lords Seventeen). They were selected from the ''bewindhebber''-class of shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries and Van der Woude, pp.&amp;nbsp;384–385&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the ''Heeren XVII'', eight delegates were from the Chamber of Amsterdam (one short of a majority on its own), four from the Chamber of Zeeland, and one from each of the smaller Chambers, while the seventeenth seat was alternatively from the Chamber of Middelburg-Zeeland or rotated among the five small Chambers. Amsterdam had thereby the decisive voice. The Zeelanders in particular had misgivings about this arrangement at the beginning. The fear was not unfounded, because in practice it meant Amsterdam stipulated what happened.

The six chambers raised the start-up capital of the Dutch East India Company:
{|class="wikitable"
!Chamber !! Capital ([[Dutch guilder|Guilders]])
|-
| Amsterdam  || 3,679,915
|-
| Middelburg || 1,300,405
|-
| Enkhuizen  ||   540,000
|-
| Delft      ||   469,400
|-
| Hoorn      ||   266,868
|-
| Rotterdam  ||   173,000
|-
! Total:    !!  6,424,588
|}

The raising of capital in Rotterdam did not go so smoothly. A considerable part originated from inhabitants of [[Dordrecht]]. Although it did not raise as much capital as Amsterdam or Middelburg-Zeeland, Enkhuizen had the largest input in the [[Share (finance)|share]] capital of the VOC. Under the first 358 shareholders, there were many small entrepreneurs, who dared to take the [[risk]]. The minimum investment in the VOC was 3,000 guilders, which priced the Company's stock within the means of many merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Globe Encompassed: The Age of European Discovery, 1500–1700|author=Ames, Glenn J.|year=2008|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AMH-5460-NA Uniform for VOC soldiers.jpg|thumb|Various VOC soldier uniforms, c.{{nbsp}}1783]]

Among the early shareholders of the VOC, immigrants played an important role. Under the 1,143 tenderers were 39 [[German people|Germans]] and no fewer than 301 from the [[Southern Netherlands]] (roughly present Belgium and Luxembourg, then under [[Habsburg]] rule), of whom [[Isaac le Maire]] was the largest subscriber with ƒ85,000. VOC's total [[Market capitalization|capitalisation]] was ten times that of its British rival.

The ''Heeren XVII'' (Lords Seventeen) met alternately 6 years in Amsterdam and 2 years in Middelburg-Zeeland. They defined the VOC's general policy and divided the tasks among the Chambers. The Chambers carried out all the necessary work, built their own ships and warehouses and traded the merchandise. The ''Heeren XVII'' sent the ships' masters off with extensive instructions on the route to be navigated, prevailing winds, currents, shoals and landmarks. The VOC also produced its own [[nautical charts|charts]].

In the context of the [[Dutch-Portuguese War]] the company established its headquarters in Batavia, [[Java island|Java]] (now [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]). Other colonial outposts were also established in the [[East Indies]], such as on the [[Maluku Islands]], which include the [[Banda Islands]], where the VOC forcibly maintained a monopoly over [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]]. Methods used to maintain the monopoly involved [[extortion]] and the violent suppression of the native population, including [[mass murder]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Willard A. (1991). Indonesian Banda: Colonialism and its Aftermath in the Nutmeg Islands. Bandanaira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, VOC representatives sometimes used the tactic of burning spice trees to force indigenous populations to grow other crops, thus artificially cutting the supply of spices like nutmeg and cloves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Globe Encompassed: The Age of European Discovery, 1500–1700|author=Ames, Glenn J.|year=2008|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===VOC outposts===
Organization and leadership structures were varied as necessary in the various VOC outposts:

''Opperhoofd'' is a Dutch word (pl. ''Opperhoofden''), which literally means 'supreme chief'. In this VOC context, the word is a [[gubernatorial]] title, comparable to the English [[Chief factor]], for the chief executive officer of a Dutch ''[[Factory (trading post)|factory]]'' in the sense of trading post, as led by a [[Factor (agent)|factor]], i.e. agent.

==Shareholder activism at the VOC and the beginnings of modern corporate governance problems==
[[File:VOC duit.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Both sides of a [[duit]], a [[Coinage of the Dutch East India Company|coin minted in 1735 by the VOC]]]]

The seventeenth-century Dutch businessmen, especially the VOC investors, were possibly the history's first recorded investors to seriously consider the [[corporate governance]]'s problems.&lt;ref&gt;Frentrop, Paul: ''A History of Corporate Governance, 1602–2002''. (Brussels: Deminor, 2003, {{ISBN|9090170677}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lukomnik, Jon: ''Thoughts on the Origins and Development of the Modern Corporate Governance Movement and Shareholder Activism'' (chapter 22, p. 450–460), in ''The Handbook of Board Governance: A Comprehensive Guide for Public, Private and Not – for – Profit Board Members'', edited by Richard Leblanc (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Le Maire]], who is known as history's first recorded [[short seller]], was also a sizeable shareholder of the VOC. In 1609, he complained of the VOC's shoddy corporate governance. On 24 January 1609, Le Maire filed a petition against the VOC, marking the first recorded expression of [[shareholder activism]]. In what is the first recorded corporate governance dispute, Le Maire formally charged that the VOC's board of directors (the Heeren XVII) sought to "retain another's money for longer or use it ways other than the latter wishes" and petitioned for the liquidation of the VOC in accordance with standard business practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gelderblom, Oscar; De Jong, Abe; Jonker, Joost (2010). ''Putting Le Maire into Perspective: Business Organization and the Evolution of Corporate Governance in the Dutch Republic, 1590–1610'', in J. Koppell, ed., ''Origins of Shareholder Advocacy''.

''The Oxford Handbook of Capitalism'', p. 333. (New York: Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the largest single shareholder in the VOC and a ''bewindhebber'' sitting on the board of governors, Le Maire apparently attempted to divert the firm's profits to himself by undertaking 14 expeditions under his own accounts instead of those of the company. Since his large shareholdings were not accompanied by greater voting power, Le Maire was soon ousted by other governors in 1605 on charges of embezzlement, and was forced to sign an agreement not to compete with the VOC. Having retained stock in the company following this incident, in 1609 Le Maire would become the author of what is celebrated as "first recorded expression of shareholder advocacy at a publicly traded company".&lt;ref&gt;Frentrop, Paul (2009). ''The First Known Shareholder Activist: The Colorful Life and Times of Isaac le Maire (1559–1624)'', in Frentrop/Jonker/Davis 2009, 11–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frentrop, Paul; Jonker, Joost; Davis, S.

''The Evolution of Shareholder Voting Rights: Separation of Ownership and Consumption''. (Yale Law Journal, Vol. 123, pp. 100–165, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1622, the history's first recorded [[shareholder revolt]] also happened among the VOC investors who complained that the company account books had been "smeared with bacon" so that they might be "eaten by dogs." The investors demanded a "reeckeninge," a proper financial audit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/no-accounting-skills-no-moral-reckoning/ |author=Soll, Jacob |title=No Accounting Skills?

The history of VOC commercial conflict, for example with the British [[East India Company]] (EIC), was at times closely connected to Dutch military conflicts.  The commercial interests of the VOC (and more generally the Netherlands) were reflected in military objectives and the settlements agreed by treaty.  In the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)]] ending the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], the Dutch were finally able to secure a [[Nutmeg#History|VOC monopoly for nutmeg trade]], ceding the island of [[Manhattan]] to the British while gaining the last non-VOC controlled source of nutmeg, the island of Rhun in the [[Banda Islands#VOC Monopoly|Banda islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Milton |first1=Giles |title=Nathaniel's Nutmeg, Or, The True and Incredible Adventures of the Spice Trader who Changed the Course of History |date=1999 |publisher=MacMillan |isbn=9781250069283 |url=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250069283 |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch later re-captured [[Manhattan]], but returned it along with the colony of [[New Netherland]] in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)]] ending the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]]. The British also gave up claims on [[Suriname]] as part of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]]. There was also an effort to compensate the [[Dutch West India Company#Decline|war-related losses of the Dutch West India Company]] in the mid-17th Century by the profits of the VOC, though this was ultimately blocked.

In terms of global business history, the lessons from the VOC's successes or failures are critically important. In his book ''Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City'' (2013), American author and historian [[Russell Shorto]] summarizes the VOC's importance in world history: "Like the oceans it mastered, the VOC had a scope that is hard to fathom. One could craft a defensible argument that no company in history has had such an impact on the world. Its surviving archives—in [[Cape Town]], Colombo, [[Chennai]], [[Jakarta]], and [[The Hague]]—have been measured (by a consortium applying for a UNESCO grant to preserve them) in kilometers. In innumerable ways the VOC both expanded the world and brought its far-flung regions together. It introduced Europe to Asia and Africa, and vice versa (while its sister multinational, the [[Dutch West India Company|West India Company]], [[New Netherland|set New York City in motion]] and [[Dutch Brazil|colonized Brazil]] and the Caribbean Islands). It pioneered globalization and invented what might be the first modern bureaucracy. It advanced cartography and shipbuilding. It fostered disease, slavery, and exploitation on a scale never before imaged."&lt;ref name="RussellShorto"/&gt;

{{Cquote|The [[stock market]] – the daytime adventure serial of the well-to-do – would not be the stock market if it did not have its ups and downs. (...) Apart from the economic advantages and disadvantages of stock exchanges – the advantage that they provide a free flow of capital to finance industrial expansion, for instance, and the disadvantage that they provide an all too convenient way for the unlucky, the imprudent, and the gullible to lose their money – their development has created a whole pattern of social behavior, complete with customs, language, and predictable responses to given events. What is truly extraordinary is the speed with which this pattern emerged full blown following the establishment, in 1611, of the world's first important stock exchange – [[:nl:Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser|a roofless courtyard in Amsterdam]] – and the degree to which it persists (with variations, it is true) on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in the nineteen-sixties. Present-day [[stock trading]] in the United States – a bewilderingly vast enterprise, involving millions of miles of private telegraph wires, computers that can read and copy the Manhattan Telephone Directory in three minutes, and over twenty million [[stockholder]] participants – would seem to be a far cry from a handful of seventeenth-century Dutchmen haggling in the rain. But the field marks are much the same. The first stock exchange was, inadvertently, a laboratory in which new human reactions were revealed. By the same token, the New York Stock Exchange is also a sociological test tube, forever contributing to the human species' self-understanding. The behaviour of the pioneering Dutch [[stock trader]]s is ably documented in a book entitled "Confusion of Confusions," written by a plunger on the Amsterdam market named [[Joseph de la Vega]]; originally published in 1688 (...)|200px||[[John Brooks (writer)|John Brooks]], in "Business Adventures" (1968)&lt;ref&gt;[[John Brooks (writer)|Brooks, John]] (1968), 'The Fluctuation: The Little Crash in '62,'; in ''Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street'' by John Brooks.

The idea of a highly competitive and organized (active mainly in [[Greater India]] but [[corporate headquarters|headquartered]] in the [[United Provinces of the Netherlands]]) Dutch government-backed privately-financed military-commercial enterprise was the wartime brainchild of the leading republican statesman [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]] and the [[States-General of the Dutch Republic|States-General]] in the late 1590s. In 1602, the "United" East India Company (VOC) was formed by a [[States-General of the Dutch Republic|government-directed]] [[consolidation (business)|consolidation/amalgamation]] of [[Voorcompagnie|several rival Dutch trading companies]] or the so-called ''[[voorcompagnie]]ën''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jamesmccammon.com/2014/04/04/the-dutch-east-india-company-and-dutch-state-formation-in-the-seventeenth-century/ |author=McCammon, James |title=The Dutch East India Company and Dutch State Formation in the Seventeenth Century |publisher=jamesmccammon.com |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a time when the newly formed Dutch Republic was in the midst of their [[Eighty Years' War|eighty-year-long revolutionary global war]] against the mighty [[Spanish Empire]] and [[Iberian Union]] (1579–1648).&lt;ref&gt;Borschberg, Peter (2002), 'The Seizure of the Santo António at [[Pattani]]: VOC Freebooting, the [[Estado da Índia]], Peninsular Politics, 1602–1609,'.

In other words, the VOC was a fully functioning military-political-commercial complex in its own right rather than a pure trading company or shipping company.{{efn|As Gelderblom, de Jong, and Jonker (2010) noted: "...The gradual articulation of governing large partnerships was taken a step further by the First United East India Company (''Eerste Verenigde Compagnie op Oost-Indië''), formed by a [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] between Amsterdam's ''Oude Compagnie'' and a venture run by Flemish immigrants, the ''Nieuwe Compagnie'', in 1601. (...) In 1597 [[Johan Van Oldenbarnevelt|Van Oldenbarnevelt]] started pushing for a [[consolidation (business)|consolidation]] because the continuing competition threatened to compromise the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch fight against Spain and Portugal]] in Asia (Den Heijer 2005, 41). The companies of Middelburg and Veere followed the Amsterdam example and merged into one ''Verenigde Zeeuwse Compagnie'' in 1600. The idea for a merger between the all companies, first considered in 1599, then reappeared, given new momentum by the emergence of the [[English East India Company|East India Company in Britain]]. (...) Negotiations between the Dutch companies took a long time because of conflicting demands. Firstly, the [[States-General of the Dutch Republic|Estates General]] wanted the merger to secure a strong Dutch presence in Asia. The hot rivalry between the ''[[voorcompagnie]]ën'' undermined the country's fragile political unity and economic prosperity, and seriously limited the prospects of competing successfully against other Asian traders from Europe. By attacking the [[Iberian Union|Luso-Hispanic overseas empire]], a large, united company would also help in the ongoing war against the [[Spanish Habsburg]]s. Initially Van Oldenbarnevelt thought of no more than two or three manned strongholds (Van Deventer 1862, 301), but the Estates General wanted an offensive (Van Brakel 1908, 20–21)."&lt;ref&gt;De Jong, Abe; Gelderblom, Oscar; Jonker, Joost (2010), 'An Admiralty for Asia: Isaac le Maire and Conflicting Conceptions About the Corporate Governance of the VOC'.

By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, and the fleet of the [[Kingdom of England|English]] (later [[Territorial evolution of the British Empire|British]]) [[East India Company]], the VOC's nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC.

From 1609 the VOC had a trading post in Japan ([[Hirado, Nagasaki]]), which used local paper for its own administration. However, the paper was also traded to the VOC's other trading posts and even the Dutch Republic. Many impressions of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artist]] [[Rembrandt]]'s prints were done on Japanese paper. From about 1647 Rembrandt sought increasingly to introduce variation into his prints by using different sorts of paper, and printed most of his plates regularly on Japanese paper.

He was turned back by the ice of the Arctic in his second attempt, so he sailed west to seek a [[Northwest Passage|north-west passage]] rather than return home. He ended up exploring the waters off the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] of North America aboard the ''[[Flyboat|vlieboot]]'' ''[[Halve Maen]]''. His first landfall was at [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and the second at [[Cape Cod]].

Hudson believed that the passage to the Pacific Ocean was between the [[St. Lawrence River]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]], so he sailed south to the Bay then turned northward, traveling close along the shore. He first discovered Delaware Bay and began to sail upriver looking for the passage. This effort was foiled by sandy shoals, and the ''Halve Maen'' continued north. After passing [[Sandy Hook]], Hudson and his crew entered the [[The Narrows|narrows]] into the Upper New York Bay. (Unbeknownst to Hudson, the narrows had already been discovered in 1524 by explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]]; today, the bridge spanning them is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

He found the water too shallow to proceed several days later, at the site of present-day [[Troy, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4ulanguages.com/delaet.html ''Nieuwe Wereldt ofte Beschrijvinghe van West-Indien, uit veelerhande Schriften ende Aen-teekeningen van verscheyden Natien (Leiden, Bonaventure &amp; Abraham Elseviers, 1625)]'' p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to the Netherlands, Hudson reported that he had found a fertile land and an amicable people willing to engage his crew in small-scale bartering of furs, trinkets, clothes, and small manufactured goods. His report was first published in 1611 by [[Emanuel Van Meteren]], an Antwerp émigré and the Dutch Consul at London.&lt;ref name="brusselsjournal.com"/&gt; This stimulated interest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4ulanguages.com/delaet.html ''Nieuwe Wereldt ofte Beschrijvinghe van West-Indien, uit veelerhande Schriften ende Aen-teekeningen van verscheyden Natien (Leiden, Bonaventure &amp; Abraham Elseviers, 1625)''] p.84.&lt;/ref&gt; in exploiting this new trade resource, and it was the catalyst for Dutch merchant-traders to fund more expeditions.

In 1611–12, the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]] sent two covert expeditions to find a passage to China with the yachts ''Craen'' and ''Vos'', captained by Jan Cornelisz Mey and Symon Willemsz Cat, respectively. In four voyages made between 1611 and 1614, the area between present-day [[Maryland]] and [[Massachusetts]] was explored, surveyed, and charted by [[Adriaen Block]], [[Hendrick Christiaensen]], and [[Cornelius Jacobsen Mey]]. The results of these explorations, surveys, and charts made from 1609 through 1614 were consolidated in Block's map, which used the name ''[[New Netherland]]'' for the first time.

[[Hendrik Brouwer]]'s discovery of the [[Brouwer Route]], that sailing east from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] until land was sighted and then sailing north along the west coast of Australia was a much quicker route than around the coast of the Indian Ocean, made Dutch landfalls on the west coast inevitable. The first such landfall was in 1616, when [[Dirk Hartog]] landed at Cape Inscription on what is now known as [[Dirk Hartog Island]], off the coast of Western Australia, and left behind an inscription on a [[pewter]] [[Hartog plate|plate]]. In 1697 the Dutch captain [[Willem de Vlamingh]] landed on the island and discovered [[Hartog Plate|Hartog's plate]]. He replaced it with one of his own, which included a copy of Hartog's inscription, and took the original plate home to [[Amsterdam]], where it is still kept in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].

In 1627, the VOC's explorers [[François Thijssen]] and [[Pieter Nuyts]] discovered the south coast of Australia and charted about {{convert|1800|km}} of it between [[Cape Leeuwin]] and the [[Nuyts Archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = McHugh | first1 = Evan | title = 1606: An Epic Adventure | publisher = University of New South Wales Press | year = 2006 | location = Sydney | pages = 44–57 | isbn = 978-0-86840-866-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;Garden 1977, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Thijssen]], captain of the ship ''[['t Gulden Zeepaert]]'' (The Golden Seahorse), sailed to the east as far as [[Ceduna]] in [[South Australia]]. The first known ship to have visited the area is the ''Leeuwin'' ("Lioness"), a Dutch vessel that charted some of the nearby coastline in 1622. The log of the ''Leeuwin'' has been lost, so very little is known of the voyage. However, the land discovered by the ''Leeuwin'' was recorded on a 1627 map by [[Hessel Gerritsz]]: [[Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht]] ("Chart of the Land of Eendracht"), which appears to show the coast between present-day [[Hamelin Bay]] and Point D’Entrecasteaux. Part of Thijssen's map shows the islands St Francis and St Peter, now known collectively with their respective groups as the [[Nuyts Archipelago]]. Thijssen's observations were included as soon as 1628 by the VOC cartographer [[Hessel Gerritsz]] in a chart of the Indies and New Holland. This voyage defined most of the southern coast of Australia and discouraged the notion that "[[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]" as it was then known, was linked to Antarctica.

In 1642, [[Abel Tasman]] sailed from [[Mauritius]] and on 24 November, sighted [[Tasmania]]. He named Tasmania [[Anthoonij van Diemenslandt]] (Anglicised as [[Van Diemen's Land]]), after [[Anthony van Diemen]], the VOC's Governor General, who had commissioned his voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Fenton, James (1884).

''Paradise Past: The Transformation of the South Pacific, 1520–1920'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially renamed [[Tasmania]] in honour of its first European discoverer on 1 January 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/php/BecomingTasmania/BTAppend2.htm |title=Appendix 2: Select chronology of renaming |last1= Newman |first1=Terry |year=2005 |work=Becoming Tasmania – Companion Web Site |publisher=[[Parliament of Tasmania]] |accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1642, during the same expedition, Tasman's crew discovered and charted [[New Zealand]]'s coastline. They were the first Europeans known to reach New Zealand. Tasman anchored at the northern end of the [[South Island]] in [[Golden Bay]] (he named it [[Murderers' Bay]]) in December 1642 and sailed northward to [[Tonga]] following a clash with local Māori. Tasman sketched sections of the two main islands' west coasts. Tasman called them ''[[Staten Landt]]'', after the ''[[States General of the Netherlands]]'', and that name appeared on his first maps of the country. In 1645 Dutch cartographers changed the name to ''[[Nova Zeelandia]]'' in Latin, from ''Nieuw Zeeland'', after the [[Seventeen Provinces|Dutch province]] of ''[[Zeeland]]''. It was subsequently Anglicised as ''New Zealand'' by [[James Cook]]. Various claims have been made that New Zealand was reached by other non-[[Polynesia]]n voyagers before Tasman, but these are not widely accepted.

===Dutch slave trade and slavery under the VOC colonial rule===
{{More information|History of slavery|Slavery in South Africa|Meermin slave mutiny}}

By the time the settlement was established at the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape]] in 1652, the VOC already had a long experience of practising [[slavery]] in the [[East Indies]]. [[Jan van Riebeeck]] concluded within two months of the establishment of the Cape settlement that [[slave labor]] would be needed for the hardest and dirtiest work. Initially, the VOC considered enslaving men from the indigenous [[Khoikhoi]] population, but the idea was rejected on the grounds that such a policy would be both costly and dangerous. Most Khoikhoi had chosen not to labor for the Dutch because of low wages and harsh conditions. In the beginning, the settlers traded with the Khoikhoi but the harsh working conditions and low wages imposed by the Dutch led to a series of wars. The European population remained under 200 during the settlement's first five years, and war against neighbors numbering more than 20,000 would have been foolhardy. Moreover, the Dutch feared that Khoikhoi people, if enslaved, could always escape into the local community, whereas foreigners would find it much more difficult to elude their "masters."&lt;ref name="Byrnes-slave-economy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Byrnes  |first=Rita  |authorlink=|author2= |title=South Africa: A Country Study |publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress |year=1996  |location=Washington  |pages=Establishing a Slave Economy  |url=  http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/5.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1652 and 1657, a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to obtain men from the [[Dutch East Indies]] and from [[Mauritius]]. In 1658, however, the VOC landed two shiploads of slaves at the Cape, one containing more than 200 people brought from [[Dahomey]] (later Benin), the second with almost 200 people, most of them children, captured from a Portuguese slaver off the coast of Angola. Except for a few individuals, these were to be the only slaves ever brought to the Cape from West Africa.&lt;ref name="Byrnes-slave-economy" /&gt; From 1658 to the end of the Company's rule, many more slaves were brought regularly to the Cape in various ways, chiefly by Company-sponsored slaving voyages and slaves brought to the Cape by its return fleets. From these sources and by natural growth, the slave population increased from zero in 1652 to about 1,000 by 1700. During the 18th century, the slave population increased dramatically to 16,839 by 1795. After the slave trade was initiated, all of the slaves imported into the Cape until the British stopped the trade in 1807 were from East Africa, Mozambique, Madagascar, and South and Southeast Asia. Large numbers were brought from India, [[Dutch Ceylon|Ceylon]], and the Indonesian archipelago. Prisoners from other countries in the VOC's empire were also enslaved. The slave population, which exceeded that of the European settlers until the first quarter of the nineteenth century, was overwhelmingly male and was thus dependent on constant imports of new slaves to maintain and to augment its size.&lt;ref name="Byrnes-slave-economy"/&gt;

By the 1660s the Cape settlement was importing slaves from India, Malaya (Malaysia), and [[Madagascar]] to work on the farms.&lt;ref name="Appiah p732"&gt;{{cite book

In 1659 Doman, a Khoikhoi who had worked as a translator for the Dutch and had even traveled to Java, led an armed attempt to expel the Dutch from the Cape peninsula. The attempt was a failure, although warfare dragged on until an inconclusive peace was established a year later. During the following decade, pressure on the Khoikhoi grew as more of the Dutch became free burghers, expanded their landholdings, and sought pastureland for their growing herds. War broke out again in 1673 and continued until 1677, when Khoikhoi resistance was destroyed by a combination of superior European weapons and Dutch manipulation of divisions among the local people. Thereafter, Khoikhoi society in the western Cape disintegrated. Some people found jobs as shepherds on European farms; others rejected foreign rule and moved away from the Cape. The final blow for most came in 1713 when a Dutch ship brought smallpox to the Cape. Hitherto unknown locally, the disease ravaged the remaining Khoikhoi, killing 90 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="Byrnes-slave-economy"/&gt; Throughout the eighteenth century, the settlement continued to expand through internal growth of the European population and the continued importation of slaves. The approximately 3,000 Europeans and slaves at the Cape in 1700 had increased by the end of the century to nearly 20,000 Europeans, and approximately 25,000 slaves.&lt;ref name="Byrnes-slave-economy"/&gt;

==Field of VOC World studies==
{{Main|List of works about the Dutch East India Company}}
{{See also|:Category:Historians of the Dutch East India Company}}
The Dutch East India Company (VOC), as a historical transcontinental [[megacorporation|company-state]], is one of the best expertly researched business enterprises in history. For almost 200 years of the Company's existence (1602–1800), the VOC had effectively transformed itself from a corporate entity into a state, an empire, or even a world in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Raben, Remco (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The VOC World (i.e. networks of people, places, things, activities, and events associated with the Dutch East India Company) has been the subject of a vast amount of literature, including works of fiction and non-fiction. VOC World studies (often included within a broader field of [[Dutch Empire|early-modern Dutch global world]] studies) is an international [[multidisciplinary]] field focused on social, cultural, religious, scientific, technological, economic, financial, business, maritime, military, political, legal, diplomatic activities, organization and administration of the VOC and [[List of Dutch East India Company trading posts and settlements|its colourful world]]. As North &amp; Kaufmann (2014) notes, "the Dutch East India Company (VOC) has long attracted the attention of scholarship. Its lengthy history, widespread enterprises, and the survival of massive amounts of documentation – literally 1,200 meters of essays pertaining to the VOC may be found in the National Archives in The Hague, and many more documents are scattered in archives throughout Asia and in South Africa – have stimulated many works on economic and social history. Important publications have also appeared on the trade, shipping, institutional organization, and administration of the VOC. Much has also been learned about the VOC and Dutch colonial societies. Moreover, the TANAP (Towards a New Age of Partnership, 2000–2007) project has created momentum for research on the relationship between the VOC and indigenous societies. In contrast, the role of the VOC in cultural history and especially in the history of visual and material culture has not yet attracted comparable interest. To be sure, journals and other travel accounts (some even with illustrations) by soldiers, shippers, and VOC officials among others have been utilized as sources."&lt;ref&gt;North, Michael; Kaufmann, Thomas DaCosta (2014), 'Introduction: Mediating Cultures,'; in Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann &amp; Michael North (eds.), ''Mediating Netherlandish Art and Material Culture in Asia''. (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2014), pp. 9–24&lt;/ref&gt; VOC scholarship is highly specialized in general, such as archaeological studies of the VOC World. Some of the notable [[:Category:Historians of the Dutch East India Company|VOC historians/scholars]] include [[S. Arasaratnam|Sinnappah Arasaratnam]], [[Leonard Blussé]], [[Peter Borschberg]], [[Charles Ralph Boxer]], [[Jaap R. Bruijn]], [[Femme Gaastra]], [[Om Prakash (historian)|Om Prakash]], and [[Nigel Worden]].

The '''Earth Charter Initiative''' is the collective name for the global network of people, organizations, and institutions who participate in promoting the [[Earth Charter]], and in implementing its principles in practice. The Initiative is a broad-based, voluntary, [[civil society]] effort, but participants include leading international institutions, national government agencies, university associations, [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, cities, faith groups, and many well-known leaders in [[sustainable development]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Mission and goals ==
The stated mission of the Earth Charter Initiative is to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, [[Ecological health|ecological integrity]], universal [[human rights]], [[Respect diversity|respect for diversity]], economic justice, [[democracy]], and a culture of [[peace]].

===Goals===
#To raise awareness worldwide of the Earth Charter and to promote understanding of its inclusive ethical vision.  
#To seek recognition and endorsement of the Earth Charter by individuals, organizations, and the [[United Nations]].
#To promote the use of the Earth Charter as an ethical guide and the implementation of its principles by civil society, business, and government.  
#To encourage and support the educational use of the Earth Charter in schools, universities, religious communities, local communities, and many other settings.  
#To promote recognition and use of the Earth Charter as a [[soft law]] document.

===Strategic objectives===
* To promote development of a global network of Earth Charter supporters and activists with the collaboration of advisors, affiliates, partner organizations, and task forces.
* To create and disseminate high quality communications and educational materials to different target groups that will reach millions of people.
* To translate key Earth Charter materials in all major languages of the world.
* To set up Earth Charter websites in all countries in partnership with key individuals and organizations.
* To promote the Earth Charter vision in key local, national and international events and engage individuals and organizations in applying it in their areas of activity.
* To position the Earth Charter in relation to important international initiatives and processes so that its ethical framework can be used as a guide in efforts to address urgent challenges such as climate change, [[biodiversity loss]], the [[Millennium Development Goals]], [[food security]], and [[conflict resolution]].
* To undertake training programmes to facilitate the uptake and application of the Earth Charter in different sectors.
* To develop the guidance and instruments to help organizations, businesses, and local communities use the Earth Charter to assess progress toward sustainable development.

== Organization ==
A formal network of affiliates, partners, and youth groups helps to promote the Earth Charter around the world. Many of these representatives are based in prominent national-level organizations and institutions.

The Initiative is served and coordinated by [[Earth Charter International]], which is composed by an Executive Office called the ECI Secretariat, and by the ECI Council.  The Secretariat is composed by a very small staff, and it is based at [[University for Peace|the University for Peace]] campus in [[San José, Costa Rica]]. The Council is equivalent to a Board, they meet once a year and provide strategic guidance to the Secretariat and the EC Initiative.

== Earth Charter Youth Program ==
The Earth Charter Youth program is a network of youth NGOs and young activists who share a common interest in sustainable development and the Earth Charter. [[Severn Cullis-Suzuki]] from Vancouver, Canada was nominated as [[youth]] representative in the Earth Charter Commission, which oversaw the drafting process. At the age of 17, Severn participated in the Earth Summit of 1997 and made sure that concerns of young people were taken seriously in the process of drafting the Earth Charter. She contributed to the inclusion of principle 12c in the final version of the Earth Charter which stresses the need to: “Honor and support the young people of our communities, enabling them to fulfill their essential role in creating sustainable societies.” The launch of the Earth Charter Youth program was inspired by this ethical principle. Today there are two youth representatives on the Earth Charter International Council.

'''Fiji''' is a group of [[volcano|volcanic]] [[island]]s in the South [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], lying about {{Convert|4,450|km||round=5}}  southwest of [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] and {{Convert|1770|km||abbr=on}} north of [[New Zealand]]. Of the 332 islands and 522 smaller islets making up the [[archipelago]], about 106 are permanently inhabited.&lt;ref name="Factbook-Fiji"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fj.html | title=Fiji | publisher=CIA | work=CIA World Factbook | accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Viti Levu]], the largest island, covers about 57% of the nation's land area, hosts the two official [[Local government in Fiji|cities]] (the [[Capital (political)|capital]] [[Suva]], and [[Lautoka]]) and most other major towns, such as Nausori, Vaileka, [[Ba (town)|Ba]], Tavua, Kororvou, [[Nasinu]], and [[Nadi]] (the site of the international airport), and contains some 69% of the population.  [[Vanua Levu]], {{Convert|64|km||abbr=on}} to the north of Viti Levu, covers just over 30% of the land area though is home to only some 15% of the population.  Its main towns are [[Labasa]] and [[Savusavu]]. In the northeast it features [[Natewa Bay]], carving out the [[Loa]] peninsula.

Both islands are mountainous, with peaks up to {{Convert|1300|m||abbr=on}} rising abruptly from the shore, and covered with [[tropical forest]]s. Heavy rains (up to {{Convert|304|cm||abbr=in|disp=or}} annually) fall on the windward (southeastern) side, covering these sections of the islands with dense tropical forest. [[Lowland]]s on the western portions of each of the main islands are sheltered by the mountains and have a well-marked [[dry season]] favorable to crops such as [[sugarcane]].

Other islands and island groups, which cover just 12.5% of the land area and house some 16% of the population, include [[Taveuni]] southeast off [[Vanua Levu]] and [[Kadavu Island]], south off [[Viti Levu]] (the third and fourth largest islands respectively), the [[Mamanuca Islands|Mamanuca Group]] (just off [[Nadi]]) and [[Yasawa Islands|Yasawa Group]] (to the north of the Mamanucas), which are popular [[tourist]] destinations, the [[Lomaiviti (archipelago)|Lomaiviti Group]] (just off Suva) with [[Levuka]], the former capital and the only major town on any of the smaller islands, located on the island of [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]], and the remote [[Lau Islands|Lau Group]] over the [[Koro Sea]] to the east near Tonga, from which it is separated by the [[Lakeba Passage]].

Two outlying regions are [[Rotuma]], {{Convert|400|km||abbr=on}} to the north, and the uninhabited coral atoll and [[cay]] [[Ceva-i-Ra]] or Conway Reef, {{Convert|450|km||abbr=on}} to the southwest of main Fiji. Culturally conservative Rotuma with its 2000 people on {{Convert|44|km2||abbr=on}} [[geography|geographically]] belongs to [[Polynesia]], and enjoys relative autonomy as a Fijian [[Dependent territory|dependency]].

[[Fiji Television]] reported on 21 September 2006 that the [[Fiji Islands Maritime and Safety Administration]] (FIMSA), while reviewing its outdated maritime charts, had discovered the possibility that more islands could lie within Fiji's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

More than half of Fiji's population lives on the island coasts, either in Suva or in smaller urban centers. The interior is sparsely populated because of its rough terrain.

[[Iceland]] is an [[island country]] at the confluence of the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] and [[Arctic Ocean]]s, east of [[Greenland]] and immediately south of the [[Arctic Circle]], atop the [[constructive boundary]] of the northern [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] about {{convert|860|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} from [[Scotland]] and {{convert|4200|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} from [[New York City]]. One of the world's most [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|sparsely populated countries]], Iceland's boundaries are almost the same as the main island – the world's [[List of islands by area#Islands 100,000–250,000 km2 (39,000–97,000 sq mi)|18th largest in area]] and possessing almost all of the country's area and population. It is the westernmost European country with more land covered by [[glacier]]s than in all of [[continental Europe]].

== Physical geography ==
Iceland consists of eight geographical regions, [[Capital Region (Iceland)|Capital Region]], Southern Peninsula, West, Westfjords, Northwest, Northeast, East and South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icelandontheweb.com/articles-on-iceland/iceland-regions|title=Iceland Regions - Iceland On The Web|website=www.icelandontheweb.com|language=is|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty per cent of the land is used for grazing, while only one per cent is cultivated. Iceland has lost most of the woodland that previously covered large areas of the country, but an ambitious [[reforestation]] program is currently underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forestry in a treeless land|url=http://www.skogur.is/english/forestry-in-a-treeless-land|publisher=Iceland Forest Service|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fossilized tree pollen and descriptions by the early settlers indicate that prior to human settlement, now thought to have occurred from around the year 800 onwards,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rae.ac.uk/submissions/ra1.aspx?id=187&amp;type=hei&amp;subid=3463&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Iceland Review Online|url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/A_New_View_on_the_Origin_of_First_Settlers_in_Iceland_0_378670.news.aspx|title=New View on the Origin of First Settlers in Iceland|date=4 June 2011|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; trees covered between thirty and forty per cent of the island. Today{{When|date=September 2018}}, however, there are only small patches of the original [[birch]] forests left, the most prominent being [[Hallormsstaðaskógur]] and [[Vaglaskógur]]. The country of Iceland contains thirty six islands. The longest river on the island is the Þjórsá at 230 kilometres (about 143 miles). Iceland has [[List of national parks of Iceland|three national parks]]: [[Vatnajökull National Park]], [[Snæfellsjökull|Snæfellsjökull National Park]], and [[Þingvellir|Þingvellir National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inspiredbyiceland.com/things-to-do/destinations/national-parks|title=National parks in Iceland|website=Inspired By Iceland|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inhabited areas are on the coast, particularly in the southwest, while the central highlands are all but uninhabited. The island's terrain is mostly plateau interspersed with mountain peaks, icefields and a coast deeply indented by bays and fjords.

=== Highlands ===
[[File:Map of Iceland highlands-en.svg|thumb|347x347px|Topographic map of Iceland. Areas in brown are 500 metres or greater above sea level with the large center mass making up the inhospitable Highlands. Glaciers shown in white.]]
The [[Highlands of Iceland|Highlands]] make up about half of Iceland's land area, which is of recent volcanic origin, and consists of a mountainous [[lava]] desert (highest elevation {{convert|2110|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level) and other wasteland. The area is mostly uninhabited. 

=== Westfjords ===

The [[Westfjords]] region is composed of a large, mountainous peninsula on Iceland's northwestern coast. The coastline is marked by numerous fjords as its name suggests. The peninsula contains Iceland's northernmost glacier, Drangajökull.

=== Southern Peninsula ===

The [[Southern Peninsula (Iceland)|Southern Peninsula]], also known as the [[Reykjanes|Reykjanes Peninsula]], is located in the southwestern corner of Iceland. The area contains little vegetation due to active [[volcanism]] and large lava fields. There are [[hot springs]] and [[Sulfur|sulphur]] springs in the southern portion of the peninsula, in the [[Kleifarvatn]] lake and the [[Krýsuvík]] [[geothermal]] area.

=== Capital Region ===

Home to Iceland's capital, [[Reykjavík]], the [[Capital Region (Iceland)|Capital Region]] is the most densely populated area in Iceland. It is located on the southwest coast of the island near the Southern Peninsula. The majority of Reykjavik is located on the [[Seltjarnarnes]] peninsula. Mount [[Esja]], at 914 m (2,999 ft), is the highest mountain in the vicinity of Reykjavík. Several natural harbours exist, and provide good fishing grounds. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Iceland#ref10069|title=Iceland {{!}} Culture, History, &amp; People|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West ===

Located in the western portion of the island and north of the Capital Region. In [[Hvalfjörður|Hvaljörður]] fjord rests the tallest waterfall in Iceland, [[Glymur]]. West is also home to [[Borgarfjörður|Borgarfjörður,]] a fjord with volcanic activity such as [[Deildartunguhver]]- a powerful hotspring. The 804 metre Hafnarfjall Mountain rises over the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.west.is/en/west-iceland-regions/the-classic-circle|title=the-classic-circle {{!}} Visit West Iceland|last=Iceland|first=West|work=Visit West Iceland|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South ===

The southern portion of Iceland contains some of its most notable volcanoes such as Hekla, Eldgjá and Katla. Alongside the volcanoes exist numerous glaciers such as Vatnajökull, Mýrdalsjökull and Eyjafjallajökull. Basalt columns and [[black sand]] beaches are examples of the volcanic activity of the area. The area also contains mountain ranges and Iceland's highest peak, [[Hvannadalshnjúkur]], as well as the [[Vestmannaeyjar]] (Westman Islands) archipelago. 

=== East ===

East Iceland contains the majority of the island's vegetation and birch forests. 

=== Glaciers ===
{{See also|Glaciers of Iceland}}[[File:Mýrdalsjökull glacier, Iceland.jpg|thumb|Mýrdalsjökull glacier]]
Around 10.2 per cent of the total land area is covered by [[glaciers of Iceland|glaciers]], although these are now retreating at an accelerating rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loftmyndir.is/vefur/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LM_Joklar2014.pdf|title=Heildarstærð jökla á Íslandi 2014 (“Total surface area of Icelandic glaciers 2014”)|publisher=Loftmyndir ehf.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317021156/http://www.loftmyndir.is/vefur/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LM_Joklar2014.pdf&lt;!-- the link doesn't work in IE --&gt;|archivedate=17 March 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four largest Icelandic glaciers are:

*[[Vatnajökull]] (7,764&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Langjökull]] (868&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Hofsjökull]] (827&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Mýrdalsjökull]] (542&amp;nbsp;km²)

Other notable glaciers include:

*[[Drangajökull]] (145&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Eyjafjallajökull]] (70&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Tungnafellsjökull]] (33&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Þórisjökull]] (25&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Eiríksjökull]] (21&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Þrándarjökull]] (16&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Tindfjallajökull]] (11&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Torfajökull]] (10&amp;nbsp;km²)
*[[Snæfellsjökull]] (10&amp;nbsp;km²).

== Climate ==
[[File:Iceland Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Iceland]]
Because of the [[Gulf Stream]]'s moderating influence, the [[Climate of Iceland|climate]] is temperate and characterized by damp, cool summers and relatively mild but windy winters. [[Reykjavík]] has an average temperature of {{convert|12|°C|°F|1}} in July and {{convert|1|°C|°F}} in January&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mánaðarmeðaltöl fyrir stöð 1 – Reykjavík ("Monthly data for station No 1 – Reykjavík")|url=http://www.vedur.is/Medaltalstoflur-txt/Stod_001_Reykjavik.ManMedal.txt|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Climate Classification of Subpolar oceanic climate (''Cfc'') with most of the island classified as Tundra (''ET'').

==Geology==
{{main|Geology of Iceland}}
Iceland has extensive [[volcanism in Iceland|volcanic]] and [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] activity. The [[rift]] associated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which marks the division between the [[Eurasian Plate]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], runs across Iceland from the southwest to the northeast. This geographic feature is prominent at the [[Þingvellir|Þingvellir National Park]], where the [[promontory]] creates an extraordinary natural [[amphitheatre]]. The site was the home of Iceland's [[parliament]], the [[Alþing]], which was first convened in the year 930. It is a common misconception that Þingvellir is at the juncture between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. However, they are in fact at the juncture of the North American continental plate and a smaller plate (approx. 10,000 km2) called the Hreppar Microplate (Hreppaflekinn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jardvis.hi.is/sites/jardvis.hi.is/files/Pdf_skjol/Jokull58_pdf/jokull58-einarsson.pdf|title=Plate boundaries, rifts and transforms in Iceland|work=[[Jökull]] No. 58, 2008|publisher=Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Iceland|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1963 to 1967, the island of [[Surtsey]] was created on the southwest coast by a volcanic eruption.

===Geological activity===
[[File:1972 Iceland Geysir-X.jpg|thumb|A geyser in Iceland]]{{See also|Geothermal power in Iceland}}
A geologically young land, Iceland is located on both the [[Iceland hotspot]] and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs right through it. This location means that the island is highly geologically active with earthquakes and many volcanoes, notably [[Hekla]], [[Eldgjá]], [[Herðubreið]] and [[Eldfell]]. [[Eyjafjallajökull]] (1,666 m) [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull|erupted]] in 2010, disrupting European air traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ic.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Iceland has many [[geyser]]s, including [[Geysir]], from which the English word ''geyser'' is derived.

With the widespread availability of [[geothermal power]], and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for [[hydroelectricity]], most residents have access to inexpensive hot water, heating and electricity.

The island is composed primarily of [[basalt]], a low-[[silica]] [[lava]] associated with [[effusive eruption|effusive volcanism]] as has occurred also in [[Hawaii]]. Iceland, however, has a variety of volcanic types (composite and fissure), many producing more evolved lavas such as [[rhyolite]] and [[andesite]]. Iceland has hundreds of volcanoes with approximately thirty volcanic systems active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Carmichael, I.S.E.|year = 1964|title = The Petrology of Thingmuli, a Tertiary Volcano in Eastern Iceland|journal = Journal of Petrology|url = http://wiki.web.ru/images/7/78/Carmichael64.pdf|doi = 10.1093/petrology/5.3.435|volume = 5|issue = 3|pages = 435–460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{aquatic layer topics}}

The '''hadal zone''' (named after the realm of [[Hades]], the [[Greek underworld|underworld in Greek mythology]]), also known as the '''hadopelagic zone''', is the deepest region of the [[ocean]] lying within [[oceanic trench]]es. The hadal zone is found from a depth of around {{convert|6000 to 11000|m|ft}} to the bottom of the ocean, and exists in long but narrow topographic V-shaped depressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-016-0051|title=Bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants in the deepest ocean fauna|date=13 February 2017|author=Alan Jamieson |publisher=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hadal-zone-ten-things-you-never-knew-about-oceans-deepest-places-1547518|title=Hadal zone: Ten things you never knew about the ocean’s deepest places|date=5 March 2016|author=Alan Jamieson|publisher=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cumulative area occupied by the 46 individual hadal habitats worldwide is less than 0.25 percent of the world's seafloor, yet trenches account for over 40 percent of the ocean's depth range.&lt;ref name="AllAboutTrenches"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.whoi.edu/hades/all-about-trenches/|title=All About Trenches|author=Alan Jamieson|date=29 April 2014|publisher=HADES – HADal Ecosystem Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most hadal habitat is found in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=AllAboutTrenches/&gt;

==Terminology and definition==
Historically the hadal zone was not recognized as distinct from the [[abyssal zone]], although the deepest sections were sometimes called "ultra-abyssal". During the early 1950s, the Danish ''[[Galathea expeditions#Second expedition|Galathea II]]'' and Russian ''Vitjaz'' expeditions separately discovered a distinct shift in the life at depths of {{Convert|6000-7000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, not recognized by the broad definition of the abyssal zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wolff, T.|year=1959|title=The hadal community, an introduction|journal=Deep Sea Research|volume=6|pages=95–124|doi=10.1016/0146-6313(59)90063-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jamieson2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jamieson | first1 = A.

Depths in excess of {{Convert|6000|m|ft|abbr=on}} are generally in [[ocean trench]]es, but there are also trenches at shallower depths.

==Fauna==
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|left|upright|The hadal zone is the deepest part of the marine environment]]

Marine life decreases with depth, both in [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], but there is a wide range of [[metazoa]]n organisms in the hadal zone, mostly [[benthos]], including [[fish]], [[sea cucumber]], [[Polychaete|bristle worms]], [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], [[isopoda|isopods]], [[sea anemone]]s, [[Amphipoda|amphipods]], and [[Gastropoda|gastropods]]. Most of these trench communities probably originated from the [[abyssal plain]]s, but though they have evolved adaptations to high pressure and low temperatures, such as lower metabolism, intra-cellular protein-stabilising [[osmolyte]]s, and unsaturated fatty acids in cell membrane [[phospholipid]]s, there is no consistent relationship between pressure and metabolic rate in these communities. Increased pressure can instead constrain the [[Ontogeny|ontogenic]] or larval stages of organisms. Pressure increases 10-fold as an organism moves from sea level to a depth of {{Convert|90|m|abbr=on}}, whilst pressure only doubles as an organism moves from {{Convert|6000|to|11000|m|abbr=on}}.

Over a [[geological time scale]], trenches can become accessible as fauna, previously stenobathic (limited to a narrow depth range) evolve into eurybathic (adapted to a wider range of depths), such as [[Grenadiers (fish)|grenadiers]] and [[natantia]]n prawns. Trench communities do, nevertheless, display a contrasting degree of intra-trench [[endemism]] and inter-trench similarities at a higher [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] level.&lt;ref name="Jamieson2010" /&gt; 

Only a relatively small number of fish species are known from the hadal zone, including certain grenadiers, [[cutthroat eel]]s, [[pearlfish]], [[cusk-eel]]s, [[snailfish]] and [[eelpout]]s.&lt;ref name="Linley2017"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Linley, T.D.|author2=M.E.

==Conditions==
Most life at this depth is sustained by [[marine snow]] or the chemical reactions around [[thermal vents]], and by metabolization of hydrogen and methane released by rock and seawater reactions ([[Serpentinite|serpentinization]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/artful-amoeba/what-lives-at-the-bottom-of-the-mariana-trench-more-than-you-might-think/&lt;/ref&gt; The low nutrient level, extreme pressure and lack of sunlight create hostile living conditions in which few species are able to exist.

The hadal zone can reach far below {{convert|6000|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep; the [[Mariana Trench|deepest known]] extends to {{convert|10911|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="NOAA, Office of Ocean Exploration and Research"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/history/quotes/soundings/soundings.html|title=NOAA Ocean Explorer: History: Quotations: Soundings, Sea-Bottom, and Geophysics|accessdate=2010-03-23|publisher=NOAA, Office of Ocean Exploration and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; At such depths the pressure in the hadal zone exceeds {{convert|1100|atm|MPa psi|lk=on}}. Lack of light and extreme pressure makes this part of the ocean difficult to explore.

== Exploration ==
The exploration of the hadal zone requires the use of instruments that are able to withstand pressures of several hundred up to a thousand or more atmospheres. Grabs, trawls, and traps have been used to collect samples of hadal organisms and sediments, however these instruments cannot be used to systematically study hadal ecology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In comparison, manned and unmanned [[Submersible|submersibles]] can be used to study the depths in greater detail. Unmanned robotic submersibles may be [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|remotely operated]] (connected to the research vessel by a cable) or [[Autonomous underwater vehicle|autonomous]] (freely moving). Cameras and manipulators on submersibles allow researchers to observe and take samples of sediment and organisms. Failure of submersibles under the immense pressure at hadal zone depths have occurred. [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|''HROV Nereus'']] was thought to have imploded at a depth of 9,990 meters while exploring the [[Kermadec Trench]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Notable missions==
[[File:Bathyscaphe Trieste.jpg|alt=picture of submersible, Bathyscaphe Trieste|thumb|Bathyscaphe Trieste, used by Piccard and Walsh to reach Challenger Deep]]
The first manned exploration to reach [[Challenger Deep]], the deepest known part of the ocean located in the [[Mariana Trench]], was accomplished in 1960 by [[Jacques Piccard]] and [[Don Walsh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/00116/hadal.htm ThinkQuest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128202822/http://library.thinkquest.org/04oct/00116/hadal.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}.

[[James Cameron]] also reached the bottom of Mariana Trench in March 2012 using the ''[[Deepsea Challenger]]''.&lt;ref name="NGS-20120325"&gt;{{cite web |last=Than |first=Ker |title=James Cameron Completes Record-Breaking Mariana Trench Dive |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-returns-science-sub/ |date=March 25, 2012 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The descent of the ''Deepsea Challenger'' was unable to break the deepest dive record set by Piccard and Walsh by about 100 meters, however Cameron holds the record for the deepest solo dive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In June 2012, the Chinese manned submersible [[Jiaolong (submersible)|''Jiaolong'']] was able to reach 7,020 meters deep in the Mariana Trench, making it the deepest diving manned research submersible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://subseaworldnews.com/2012/07/10/jiaolong-reaches-7-000-meters-below-water/|title=Jiaolong Reaches 7.000 Meters Below Water|work=Subsea World News|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/06/chinas-jiaolong-submersible-plunges-below-7000-metres.html|title=China’s Jiaolong submersible plunges below 7,000 metres : News blog|last=Owens|first=Brian|date=25 Jun 2012|website=blogs.nature.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This range surpasses that of the previous record holder, the Japanese-made [[DSV Shinkai 6500|''Shinkai'']], whose maximum depth is 6,500 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/about/equipment/ships/shinkai6500.html|title=SHINKAI 6500 &lt; Research Vessels and Vehicles &lt; Research Vessels, Facilities and Equipment &lt; About JAMSTEC &lt; JAMSTEC|website=www.jamstec.go.jp|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Jenny''' (7 February 1899 &amp;ndash; 9 January 1992) was a soil scientist and expert on [[pedology (soil study)|pedology]] (the study of [[soil]] in its natural environment), particularly the processes of soil formation. He served as 1949 President of the [[Soil Science Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 75:1179–1188 doi:10.2136/sssaj2010.0107pres_and_yearly_reports&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Hans Jenny was born in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. He earned a diploma in [[agriculture]] from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ([[ETH Zurich]]) in 1922, and a D. Sc. degree in 1927 for a thesis on ion exchange reactions.

Following an appointment at the [[University of Missouri]], he joined the faculty at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] in 1936. International recognition came to Jenny after the 1941 publication of ''Factors of Soil Formation: A System of Quantitative Pedology''. His synthesis of field studies with the abstract formalism of [[physical chemistry]] set down the generic mathematical relationship that connects the observed properties of soil with the independent factors that determine the process of [[soil formation]]:

[[Clorpt|s = f(cl, o, r, p, t, ...)]]

where s - soil properties; cl - regional [[climate]]; o - potential biota, r - relief; p - [[parent material]]; t - time.

Jenny left the [[ellipsis]] open to indicate that there might be other [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] in the [[function (mathematics)|function]].

In ''The Soil Resource, Origin and Behaviour'' (1980), Jenny redefined the soil forming factors as [[state variable]]s and extended the effects to [[ecosystem]] properties. Parent material and relief define the initial state for soil development, regional climate, and potential biota determine the rate at which chemical and biological transformations proceed, and time determines the reach of these processes, and their expression in ecosystem, soil, vegetation, and animal component properties.

One notable project was his study of the Mendocino [[pygmy forest]], a remarkable community of ericaceous and coniferous plant species whose stunted growth and grotesquely twisted morphology reveal a long and tortured struggle for survival on a 500,000-year-old marine [[wiktionary:terrace|terrace]]. The University of California's Jenny Pygmy Forest Reserve is named in his honor, and is found adjacent to Van Damme State Park. Jenny did much of his pygmy forest research within the boundaries of Jug Handle State Natural Reserve, which, as a result of Hans and his wife Jean's lobbying was designated the Pygmy Forest National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1974.

Jenny applied fundamental soil science to the problems of the day, when he wrote about "the rosy outlook that is sweeping the nation about converting [[biomass]] to [[ethanol|alcohol]] and [[gasohol]]...We are promised construction of ingenious machines that will pick up all crop residues in the fields and leaf litter and [[humus]] in the forests. The carbon and nitrogen cycles of ecosystems will be curtailed and soil stability endangered. Because of a possible climatic warm-up, we do not wish to accelerate humus oxidation and the concomitant flux of [[carbon dioxide]] from soil into the atmosphere. I am arguing against indiscriminate conversion of biomass and organic wastes to fuels. The humus capital, which is substantial, deserves being maintained because good soils are a national asset." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Jenny, Hans| title=Alcohol or Humus (Letters) | journal=Science | year= 1980  | volume=209 | pages=444 | doi= 10.1126/science.209.4455.444 | pmid= 17831353 | issue= 4455| bibcode=1980Sci...209..444J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hawkins Bank''' is a large, [[submerged bank]] off the [[Mascarene Plateau]]. It is considered a dependency of [[Mauritius]] (in terms of [[fishing bank]]s, much like [[Saya de Malha Bank]], [[Nazareth Bank]] and the [[Soudan Banks]]). The bank is abundant with fish and Mauritian vessels often fish in the waters in and around the bank.

The '''Hellenic Geodetic Reference System 1987''' or '''HGRS87''' ({{lang-el|Ελληνικό Γεωδετικό Σύστημα Αναφοράς 1987 or ΕΓΣΑ'87}}) is a [[geodetic system]] commonly used in [[Greece]] ([[SRID]]=2100). The system specifies a local geodetic datum and a projection system. In some documents it is called ''Greek Geodetic Reference System 1987'' or ''GGRS87''.

==HGRS87 datum==

HGRS87 specifies a non-geocentric [[Datum (geodesy)|datum]] that is tied to the coordinates of the key geodetic station at the Dionysos Satellite Observatory (DSO) northeast of Athens ({{Coord|38.078400|23.932939}}). The central pedestal (CP) at this location has by definition HGRS87 coordinates 38° 4'&amp;nbsp; 33.8000" N - 23° 55'&amp;nbsp; 51.0000"E, N = +7 m.

Although HGRS87 uses the [[GRS80]] ellipsoid, the origin is shifted relative to the GRS80 geocenter, so that the ellipsoidal surface is best for Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hellenic Positioning System (HEPOS) and its foreseeable implications on the Spatial Data Infrastructure in Greece|author=Delikaroglou. D.|year=2008|journal=Tech. Chron. Sci. J. TCG|volume=I|issue=1-2|pages=95–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specified offsets relative to [[WGS84]] (WGS84-HGRS87) are: Δx = -199.87 m, Δy = 74.79 m, Δz = 246.62 m.

The HGRS87 datum is implemented by a first order [[geodetic network]], which consists of approximately 30 [[triangulation station]]s throughout Greece and is maintained by the [[Hellenic Military Geographical Service]]. The initial uncertainty was estimated as 0.1 ppm (1x10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fotiou A. |author2=Livieratos E. |year=2000|title=Geometric Geodesy and Networks|publisher=Ziti Publications|location=Thessaloniki, Greece|language=Greek|pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are considerable tectonic movements that move parts of Greece towards different directions, causing incompatibilities between surveys taking place at different times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rokos, D., Kyriazis, K. and Lolonis, P.|title=Setting Up the Infrastructure for Improving the Development of Cadastre en Greece|journal=FIG Congress 2010|location=Sydney|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HGRS87 replaced an earlier ''de facto'' geodetic system. The datum of that system was based on the [[Bessel ellipsoid]], with an accurate determination of the geodetic coordinates at the central premises of the [[National Observatory of Athens]] supplemented by an accurately measured [[azimuth]] from the objervatory to [[Parnitha|Mount Parnes]]. [[Cartographic projections]] for civilian use were based on the Hatt projection system, with different projection parameters for each 1:100000 map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geodetic coordinates conversion tables from HATT (old datum) to HGRS87 (new datum) ({{lang-el|Πίνακες συντελεστών μετατροπής συντεταγμένων Ελληνικού χώρου από το Σύστημα HATT (παλαιό datum) στο Σύστημα ΕΓΣΑ'87 (νέο datum)}})|date=October 1995|author1=Hellenic Mapping |author2=Cadastral Organisation |language=Greek|publisher=Hellenic Mapping &amp; Cadastral Organization (HEMCO)|location=Athens, Greece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HGRS87 projection==

HGRS87 also specifies a [[transverse Mercator]] [[cartographic projection]] (TM) with m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=0.9996, covering six degrees of longitude either side of 24 degrees east (18-30 degrees east). This way all Greek territory (stretching to approximately 9° of longitude) is projected in one zone. References are in meters. Northings are counted from the [[equator]]. A false easting of 500000 m is assigned to the central meridian (24° east), so eastings are always positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fotiou A. |author2=Livieratos E. |year=2000|title=Geometric Geodesy and Networks|publisher=Ziti Publications|location=Thessaloniki, Greece|language=Greek|pages=258–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversion from geographical coordinates in GRS80 to a projection in HGRS87 is supported by [[PROJ.4]] with appropriate parameters.&lt;ref name="proj_usgs_manual"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerald I. Evenden |title=Cartographic Projection Procedures for the UNIX Environment - A User's Manual |publisher= |date=24 September 1995 |url=http://download.osgeo.org/proj/from_kai/OF90-284.ps.gz |accessdate =March 20, 2012 |pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion is performed with the following code (shell command line):

&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
proj4 +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=24 +k=0.9996 +x_0=500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=-199.87,74.79,246.62,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs
&lt;/source&gt;

==Migration to HTRS07==
While HGRS87 is still widely used for most civilian uses,&lt;ref&gt;Maps issued by the Hellenic Military Geographical Service for civilian use are based on HGRS87, while maps for military use are based on [[ED50]] with NATO [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|UTM]]/[[Military Grid Reference System|MGRS]] projection.&lt;/ref&gt; it is partly replaced by the new [[Hellenic Terrestrial Reference System 2007]] or HTRS07 ([[SRID]]=96758). HTRS07, which was specified for the Hellenic Positioning System (HEPOS) project, is GPS based and is compatible with [[European Terrestrial Reference System 1989]] (ETRS89). HTRS07 is currently used for the [[cadastre|cadastral surveys]].

'''Hyperboreae Undae''' ([[Latin]]: "Far Northern Waves/Dunes") is one of the largest and densest [[dune field]]s of [[Planum Boreum]], the [[Mars|Martian]] North Pole.&lt;ref name="Tanaka"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K.

==Dune characteristics==
[[File:PIA20237 Hyperboreae Undae.jpg|thumb|400px|Hyperboreae Undae dunes shown with surface frost. The dunes become darker when the frost sublimates from solar heating and the dark sands are revealed.]]
Although the dunes surrounding the Martian north pole show no signs of movement, two possible exceptions may be the dunes in parts of Abalos Undae, and the dunes of Hyperboreae Undae.&lt;ref name="Icarus"/&gt; In the case of Hyperboreae Undae, the dunes close to its eastern boundary appear to be buried under the Planum Boreum 3 unit. At that area, some of the dunes exhibit dark streaks that may have been caused by [[katabatic winds]].&lt;ref name="Icarus"/&gt; This may indicate sand movement, due to [[Aeolian activity]], which is recent enough to retain the streaks, otherwise these marks tend to disappear with time; other dunes do not exhibit such marks.&lt;ref name="Icarus"/&gt;

The dunes of Hyperboreae Undae, according to data provided by the [[Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars]], exhibit the weakest signature for the presence of surface ice in the area of Chasma Boreale.&lt;ref name="Icarus"/&gt;  Hyperboreae Undae, along with Abalos and [[Siton Undae]], contributes sand to mainly medium-density dune fields east of Olympia Undae and extending to the Martian [[prime meridian]],&lt;ref name="Tanaka"/&gt;

Image analysis research, using the method of spectral derivatives, has indicated that Hyperboreae Undae, as well as the other dense officially-named northern circumpolar dune fields ([[Olympia Undae]], [[Abalos Undae]], and Siton Undae), show the highest density of gypsum in the area.&lt;ref name="Earth and Planetary"&gt;{{cite journal |author=M.

==Coexistence of linear and barchan forms==
[[File:ESP 016261 2650 MIRB Hyperboreae Undae barchan and linear dunes.jpg|thumb|Coexistence of linear and barchan forms at Hyperboreae Undae. A study has been undertaken to explain the coexistence of these two forms. The location of the initial study site is at the boundary of Hyperboreae Undae with Boreum Cavus.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt;]]
Linear dunes form primarily in bidirectional (bimodal) wind fields. Transverse dunes, also called [[barchan]], form when there is a unidirectional (unimodal) wind regime.&lt;ref name="USGS2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Dunes|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/|publisher=USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third type of dune, the star dune, is typically formed in multidirectional (multimodal) wind regimes.&lt;ref name="USGS2"/&gt; The presence of each of these dune forms, suggests the wind regime that produced it.&lt;ref name="Icarus2"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edgett, K. S. and D. G. Blumberg|title=Star and Linear Dunes on Mars|journal=Icarus|date=December 1994|volume=112|issue=2|pages=448–464|doi=10.1006/icar.1994.1197|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236897578_Star_and_Linear_Dunes_on_Mars|bibcode=1994Icar..112..448E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linear and star dunes are rare on Mars.&lt;ref name="Icarus2"/&gt; The existence of both linear and barchan dunes in the same location is apparently incompatible, as that would seem to imply the co-existence of unidirectional and bidirectional winds in the same place.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Icarus2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GeoRes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evidence for indurated sand dunes in the Martian north polar region|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=2006|volume=111|issue=E04006|pages=1–14|doi=10.1029/2005JE002514|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2005JE002514/pdf|bibcode=2006JGRE..111.4006S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has been undertaken to explain the coexistence of linear and barchan dunes in Hyperboreae Undae.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt; One paper explains the change from linear to barchan dunes in adjacent locations,&lt;ref name="Icarus2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt; by proposing a wind model that changes from bidirectional to unidirectional due to the influence of local topography; it is proposed that bidirectional winds change to unidirectional due to funneling action introduced by local geomorphology.&lt;ref name="Icarus2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt; Although valid for neighbouring dune locations, this theory cannot explain how linear and barchan dunes can coexist in the same location.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt;

Another study,&lt;ref name="GeoRes"/&gt; proposes that the linear dunes have become crusty (indurated), and thus resistant to changing form with changing wind directions. The study also proposes that the bimodal wind direction changed with time to unidirectional, which would produce barchan-type dunes, while the preexisting indurated linear dunes, due to their hardening, would remain in place.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt; This theory is plausible, although it cannot be easily verified, because the time profile of the wind patterns for Hyperboreae Undae would need to be recovered.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt;
[[File:Hyperboreae Undae barchanoid and linear dunes from THEMIS.jpg|thumb|Hyperboreae Undae barchanoid and linear dunes from NASA's [[Thermal Emission Imaging System]] (THEMIS)]]
A third study combines images taken by the [[High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment]] (HiRISE) camera on board the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] with the deployment of the [[Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter]] (MOLA) to obtain local coordinates of the topography shown in the HiRISE images, and then maps the HiRISE image data into a computer simulation which registers the spatial computer model of the local topography of Hyperboreae Undae in the vicinity of Boreum Cavus. From the crestline orientation of the numerical model, the local wind vectors can be computed, and the results can then be compared to the measured wind data of the area under investigation. Conversely, if the wind vectors are known, the [[bedform]] morphology can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt; By comparing the numerical simulation results to measured real-world data, the computer simulation parameters can be refined, leading to better convergence between numerically-predicted and field-measured results.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt; Limitations for the computer model include the resolution limits of the numerical model, the small area under investigation, and the complexity of the local wind conditions.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt; The numerical study obtained results that demonstrate that Hyperboreae Undae was formed under modern wind conditions and that its form, the coexistence of barchan and linear dunes, can be established by the numerical model.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt; Further research plans include the extension of the field of study to include modelling all of Hyperboreae Undae.&lt;ref name="Lunar and Planetary"/&gt;

'''Indigenous horticulture''' is practised in various ways across all inhabited [[continent]]s. Indigenous refers to the native peoples of a given area and [[horticulture]] is the practice of small-scale [[inter cropping]].

==Africa==

===North Africa===
In North Africa we look at the farming practices of the Egg on, a [[Nigeria]]n [[hill farming]] community. The Egg on live in the Mada hills between [[Lafia]] and [[Akwanga]]. The hills lay between two rivers that Mada and Arikya. The altitude helps retain moisture on the hills due to early morning mists and fogs. The altitude also makes for earlier and longer crop cultivation. They practice bush fallow agriculture as well as mixed farming [[land management]] styles. They focus on growing [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, [[cassava]], [[maize]], [[bean]]s, and [[African rice]]; much of what is produced is exported as a [[cash crop]] and is their primary source of cash income. The Egg on use a terraced agricultural system to maximize space on the hills. The [[goat]]s that they raise are kept mostly for [[fertilizer]] used in farming. They are only killed on special occasions such as [[wedding]]s. The Eggon use the diversity in their environment to maximize their production.

===West Africa===
In West Africa the [[Kissidougou]] live on the [[savannah]] dotted by dense areas of “forest islands” that was created by the Kissidougou. The Kissidougou practice [[intercropping]] within the [[forest]]ed areas. However, they also operate farms maintained on slopes or plateaus that are located between the forest islands. They prepare the savannah lands for [[forestation]] through farming and burning of the [[grass]]es to fertilize the soils. The Kissidougou graze their [[cattle]] on the savannah to help to maintain flammable grasses around the farms and the villages. The Kissidougou create diversity in their environment by farming and transforming savannah into lush, dense forest.

The prevalence of wetlands in West Africa has helped to support local indigenous horticulture. Seasonal flooding of major rivers in the region, such as the River Niger, the Sudd and the Senegal, have made it possible for flood cropping in many areas. Indigenous people have utilized a variety of irrigation techniques in order to take advantage of seasonal flooding. Additionally, they plan their plantings and harvests specifically around the flooding of local rivers. For example, some farmers choose to plant on rising floods and harvest as the flooding diminishes. This techniques is utilized when cultivating rice.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. “Indigenous Use of Wetlands and Sustainable Development in West Africa.” ''The Geographical Journal'' 159. 2 (1993): 209-218.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Africa===
The areas of East Africa are one of the most affected by [[corporate farming]]. In western [[Uganda]] there is a farming society called the [[Ankole|Banyankore]]. Their land is part of the Ryampara hill country, that is between two flat, dry, and less populated areas of land. On the Hills the average monthly rainfall is 970mm with two short dry months in June and July and a short less severe dry month in January. Seven months out of the year the rainfall is over 1000mm per month. Their primary production are [[banana]]s and [[coffee]], they use these as cash crops. Farmers still use substantial areas for [[millet]] farming. This is their main [[food crop]]. They have intensive home gardens to produce for the families needs and the outlying farming is used mostly for the cash crop production where coffee and banana are cultivated using inter cropping methods.

===Southern Africa===
In Southern Africa the conglomerate farming companies has primarily written off the lands in Northwest [[Zambia]]. The land is mostly made of plateaus with lowers lands in the [[Kabompo River|Kabompo]] and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] river valleys. Much of the area is in the [[Congo River|Congo]]–Zambezi [[drainage divide|watershed]], the area of land where all water runs into the same [[river basin]]. The land has several types of soil. There are areas of yellow [[clay]] with higher concentrations of sand where higher rain falls causes [[soil erosion]] and makes farming in those areas difficult. There are also areas with fertile red clay that are rich soils good for cultivation of crops. Farmers in the area grow [[sorghum]], millet, [[sweet potato]]es, [[pumpkin]] and [[maize]]. There is marginal maize production that is used as a cash crop for the community. The area is usually covered by thick forestation that must be cleared before crops can be cultivated, they do not practice [[agroforestry]]. Traditionally spouses must maintain their own gardens. The produce is shared communally but the practice leads to intensive home gardens that are maintained by the women of the villages.

==South Pacific==

===Highlander horticulture===
The Enga of the [[Western Highlands Province]] in [[New Guinea]] receive most of their food from growing sweet potatoes Ipomoea batatas which they plant in [[mulch]] mounds at elevations up to 2,700m or higher (Dove and Carpenter 2008). The mounds that the Enga make to plant their crops of [[potato]]es are formed from by piling large amounts of grass taken from fallow, or unplanted, plots then by covering the grass with dirt (Wohlt 2004). The size of the mounds depends on elevation; the higher the elevation; the bigger the mounds will be. Mounds above 2,500m in altitude can have a height of 0.85m in height; while crops below 1,500m are not mounded at all (Dove and Carpenter 2008). The function of the mound is to protect the crops from the frequent frosts that occur at the high altitudes of the Enga. With sweet potatoes having a very long maturation period, 9 months, the Enga also invest their time and space on the mounds with planting other crops that have much shorter maturation periods such as peas in case a heavy frost does claim the crop (Wohlt 2004).

The planting of the mounds is done so that the plants which have a higher frost tolerance, such as the Irish potatoes, are planted casually throughout the mound and the low tolerant sweet potatoes are planted in the best position to avoid the frost. [[Pea]]s, [[bean]]s, and [[cabbage]] which are all highly tolerant to frost will be planted outside the circle of sweet potatoes and lower on the mound placing them closer to the cold temperatures of the ground (Dove and Carpenter 2008). The Enga practice fallow rotation where a garden will in crop for about four years followed by about four years of fallow [[grassland]] to let the soil replenish (Wohlt 2004).

Garden size for an average Enga garden is about 0.21 hectare or about 2,100 square meters and can contain a few hundred mounds (Wohlt 2004). Another gardening strategy the Enga have implemented is the use of kin lands that are usually within one to two days walk from the farmers normal planting grounds (Dove and Carpenter 2008). The uses of multiple gardens at differing elevation and the ability access clan lands in different areas for gardening have allowed the Enga to adapt to their environment and survive under harsh conditions.

===Lowland Swidden cultivation===
[[Swidden agriculture|Swidden cultivation]] is an extensive agriculture practice that is also known as [[slash and burn|slash-and-burn]] agriculture. The process is extensive because it requires a vast amount of land divided into several plots with one plot planted for a period of years, while the other plots lay fallow for a number of years (Hyde 2010).

For the Bine-speaking peoples of the New Guinea [[lowland]]s swidden cultivation is a main practice for crop propagation. The main crop the Bine grow is the [[taro root]], although they grow about 15 subsidiary crops including: sweet potato, banana, [[manioc]], maize, yam, [[papaya|pawpaw]], [[sugar cane]], [[pineapple]], and others (Eden 1993). The [[swidden]]s which can be placed in either savannas or forests are created by cutting down all the vegetation in the area that the swidden will be. The farmers then pile all of the cut vegetation on the swidden plot and leave it to dry out through the dry season (Hyde 2010). Right before the wet season begins the piles are burned and the soil and ash are tilled together (Eden 1993). The process of [[Tillage|tilling]] the soil and ash mixes the [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] rich ash into the soil thereby fertilizing the soil for the coming crop. After the soil is tilled the crops are planted.

There are two planting years for a single swidden for the Bine farmers. In the first year the Bine plant primary taro root with a few subsidiary crops like bananas and sweet potatoes. In the second year taro root makes up about 50 percent of the swidden and the rest of the swidden is mixed with about 15 other plants. After the second year the Bine farmers move on to an adjacent swidden and allow the previous swidden to lay [[fallow]] or unplanted for a period of 5 to 10 years in order to repopulate the vegetation (Eden 1993). The number of years that a swidden will lay fallow is determined by the plants demand for the nitrogen in the soil. Some plants will leach the soil of nitrogen in a few years and require four or five times that fallow; while other plants can be planted for many years and lay fallow only one or two times the planting period (Hyde 2010). Swidden cultivation requires a lot of land in order to feed only a few people, but the Bine, whose numbers are low, make good uses of their land through swidden farming.

===Island horticulture===
For most South Pacific Island cultures the main subsistence techniques are [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]]. Fishing and the gathering of [[sago]], banana, and other tropical foods are the norm with very little organized agriculture. The Tabalu of [[Kiriwina]] located in the [[Trobriand Islands]] practice a form of agriculture called Kaylu’ebila, a form of garden magic (Malinowski 1965). The main crop for the Tabalu is the yam and there is a definite [[division of labour]] according to sex when it comes to gardening. Heavy work is done by the men and it includes clearing the vegetation, caring the yam supports, and planting the yam [[tuber]]s in the ground (Malinowski 1987). The women aid by [[weeding]] the gardens.

Gardening for the Tabalu is a very long and in depth magical process; with special magicians and magical ingredients which have been handed down from family member to family member over time. Garden fields which are called Kwabila are fenced in on all sides to keep out the [[swine]] that are breed by the Tabalu. Kwabila are then divided into many smaller plots called baleko, these are the individual gardens that the crops will be planted in (Malinowski 1965).

==South America==
South America consists of modern-day [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Suriname]], [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]]. South America has historically been a land exploited not only for its [[natural resource]]s, but also for its indigenous knowledge and [[labor force]]. The environmental diversification of South America has been at the foundation of its presence in the [[global economy]] as a resource for agriculture, [[forestry]], fishing, [[hunting]], [[livestock]], [[mining]] and [[quarrying]].

South America can be seen as cultural regions inhabited by marginal tribes, tropical forest tribes, and the circum-Caribbean tribes each with its own distinct way of agricultural cultivation (Lyon 1974:6). South America's geographic regions are inhabited by regional tribes which include; the Chocó in the Northern Columbian area, The [[Kayapo people|Kayapo]] in the Eastern Para area, the [[Chono]] in the Southern Fuegian area, and the [[Quechua people|Quechua]]s in the Western Peruvian area, (Lyon 1974:24). Each of these regions has adapted not only their own cultural identity and agricultural style,

The Eastern region of South America is known as the '''Para area''' in what is now Brazil, and has for millennia been home to the [[tropical forest]] Kayapớ tribe. The Kayapớ lived in sedentary villages and were proficient in [[pottery]] and loom-weaving, yet they did not domesticate animals or poses knowledge on [[metallurgy]]. These Tropical forest Tribes can be characterized through their farming, [[dugout canoe]]s, woven baskets, loom [[weaving]], and pole and thatch houses (Posey 2002)

In the Para area the Kayapớ like most tribes of this region practiced intensive agriculture or clearing cultivation. Beginning their agricultural year with a low water season intensifies fishing. The low water season is then followed by the high water season or harvest season. It is during this [[harvest]] season that the Kayapớ are able to exercise their leisure time before the cycle ends with (low water levels) and a return to intense fishing. Each changing season commences ceremonies for the Kayapớ that are directly tied to agriculture, hunting, or fishing. Unlike the Chocó the Kayapớ used an agricultural method known as the slash-burn method (shifting agriculture). The Kayapớ cut the forest in April to September (dry season) and time their burns just before the raining season. The Kayapớ used circular plots for agricultural cultivation consisting of five rings (characterized as cultivation zones). The first circle or the inner circle was used for taro and sweet potatoes that thrive in the hotter soil found in the center of the plot. The second circle cultivated maize, manioc, and rice an area that needed various ash enrichment treatments and would experience short term growth. The third zone was an area of rich soil and best served mixed crops including the banana, [[urucu]], papaya. The fourth zones consists of shade loving plants and are for a medical purpose, yet evidence of beans and yams have been also found here. The fifth zone or the outer ring was left as a protective zone that included trap animals protective [[insect]]s and [[bird]]s (Posey 2002). This form of agriculture requires not only intense physical labor but also requires a knowledge of not only the land, but various types of ground cover, shades and temperatures of local soils, as well as cloud formations to time careful burning . When the Kayapớ manage their agricultural plots they must work with a variety of interacting factors including the background soil fertility, the heterogeneous quality of ash and its distribution, crop nutrient requirements, cropping cycles, management requirements, and [[pest (organism)|pest]] and [[disease]] control clearly illustrating the common misconception that this form of agriculture is primitive and ineffiecnet (Posey 2002).

It has often been thought that the slash-burn plots are abandoned after one or two years because of un productive soil, but this is a common [[List of common misconceptions|misconception]]. The Kayapớ revisit abandoned fields because plants can offer direct and indirect benefits. One direct benefit would be the ability to eat that which has been produced and an indirect benefit would be that open fields allow attract game for hunting and can produce long after they have been tended (Posey 2002).

The Southern region of South America is known as the '''Fuegian area ''' and is occupied by the Chono, [[Alacalufe people|Alacaluf]] and [[Yahgan]] . These Marginal tribes differed greatly from the other regions in that they were expert in making bark or plank canoes and domesticating [[dog]]s, hunting, fishing and gathering. [[Nomad]]s with simple socio-religious patterns, yet completely lacked the technology of pottery, loom-weaving, metallurgy and even agriculture . Since there was a lack of agriculture in this region the Chono ate native berries, roots, fruits, and wild [[celery]] . The source of nutrition for the Chono, Yahgans, and Alcaaluf thus mainly consisted of sea food such as; [[whale]]s, [[Pinniped|seal]] [[porpoise]]s, [[guanaco]]s, and [[otter]]s . The Southern tribes of South America distinguished themselves not in having a rare form of agriculture like the North’s slush-mush method or the having intensive agriculture like the East’s sophisticated slash-burn method, yet were able to distinguished themselves in being absent of this trait .

==North America==
Farming methods developed by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s include [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]], [[irrigation]], mound building, [[crop rotation]] and fertilization. They also used extensive [[companion planting]] (see the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]).

[[Terracing (agriculture)|Terracing]] is an effective technique in a steep-sloped, semi-arid climate. The Indigenous farmers stair-stepped the hills so that soil erosion was minimal and land surface was better suited for farming. In the Southwest, including parts of [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and parts of Northern Mexico, terracing was extensive. Terraces were constructed by placing rock dams to redirect runoff water to canals that evenly dispersed rain water. The terraced field transformed the terrain into land suitable for farming maize (Keoke and Porterfield 2005, pg. 56). There is evidence that terracing has been used in the Southwest for about 2,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;Sandor, Gersper and Hawley 1990, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anasazi]] people from this region built reservoirs and directed rain water through ditches to water the crops in the terraces.&lt;ref&gt;Keoke and Porterfield 2005, 58&lt;/ref&gt; The natives grew corn, [[Squash (plant)|squash]], and beans, along with other crops in the terraced fields.

Corn, squash, and beans were staple crops for Native Americans and were grown throughout much of the North American continent. This trio is known as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three sisters]]. Ancient [[folklore]] belief says that the Three Sisters represented three [[goddess]]es. Each sister protected the other two, and therefore the Three Sisters were never be separated and instead be planted, cooked, and consumed together.&lt;ref&gt;Kowtko 2006, 54&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, This Triad was an example of [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] planting. The corn stalks functioned as a support for the beans. The beans fixed nitrogen into a usable form for the corn and squash, and the broad squash leaves provided shade for the soil, which aided in preventing [[evaporation]] and controlling weeds(Kowtko 2006, 54). As the success of the Three Sisters spread, many cultures turned away from hunting and gathering and relied much more on farming (Kowtko 2006, 55). Geographically native cultures in the Woodlands, Prairie, Plains, Great Basin, and Plateau regions of North America all utilized the Three Sisters to some extent. Where they were not grown, the locals traded for them (Berzok 2005, 9). Nomadic tribes, such as the [[Dakota Indians|Dakotas]], would trade [[meat]] for these vegetable staples. The Three Sisters were usually eaten in unison, as they provide fairly balanced nutrition when consumed together(for example, beans and corn together provide a complete set of the [[essential amino acids]]).

Native American farmers also employed [[irrigation]]. This technique was utilized throughout much of the Southwest and is useful where water is scarce. Irrigation was and is still used today throughout much of the world. Native Americans controlled the amount of water that reached their fields by building long irrigation [[canal]]s to redirect water from a source to water their crops. The [[Hohokam]] people constructed about 600 miles of irrigation canals from AD 50 to 1450 near [[Phoenix, Arizona]] (Berzok 2005, 51). Part of the canal is used by the City of Phoenix today.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The [[Olmec]]s of [[Mesoamerica]] built canals over 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Keoke and Porterfield 2005, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinampa]]s, artificial islands constructed in [[swampland]]s and lakes, were invented by [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] farmers and the technique became used extensively throughout Mesoamerica and was later used by the [[Aztec]]s as part of the land reclamation process of the city of [[Tenochtitlan]]. This technique increases arable land, and provided additional farming plots the population of Mesoamerica grew (Keoke and Porterfield 2005, 60).

In the Northeast Woodlands and the [[Great Lakes]] region, an advanced society known as the [[Mound builder (people)|Moundbuilders]] emerged (Berzok 2005, 13). This society lived in the [[flood plain]]s of the Mississippi river basin. This culture farmed mainly maize. They had little need for [[foraging]] and grew to an advanced civilization due to food surplus. They were the largest civilization north of the [[Rio Grande]].

Native Americans also developed storage systems such as storage containers which allowed them to store seeds to plant during the next planting season. They also stored food in dug-out pits or holes in hillsides. Native Americans developed [[corn crib]]s. These were storage bins that were elevated off the ground. This technique prevented moisture and animal intrusion (Berzok 2005, 122-123).

Selective crop breeding was also employed. Corn is a domestic plant and cannot grow on its own. The first corn grown by Native Americans had small ears, and only produced a few kernels per ear. By 2,000 years ago, single stalks with large ears were being produced (Keoke and Porterfield 2005, 55). Native Americans created over 700 varieties of corn by 1500 AD.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">The '''International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities''' ('''IALA''', previously known as '''International Association of Lighthouse Authorities''') is an [[Intergovernmental organization]] founded in 1957 to collect and provide nautical expertise and advice.

==Background==
IALA brings together representatives of the aids to navigation services of about 80 countries for technical coordination, information sharing, and coordination of improvements to aids to [[navigation]] throughout the world. It was established in 1957 to provide a permanent organization to support the goals of the [[Technical Lighthouse Conferences]], which had been convening since 1929. The General Assembly of IALA meets about every 4 years. The Council of 24 members meets twice a year to oversee the ongoing programs.

Four committees maintain work programs established for four year periods:
* ENAV&amp;nbsp;– e-Navigation;
* ARM&amp;nbsp;– Aids to Navigation Requirements and Management&amp;nbsp;– concentrating on management issues experienced by members;
* ENG&amp;nbsp;– Engineering and Sustainability&amp;nbsp;– concentrating on the engineering aspects of all aids to navigation and their impact on the environment, the Committee is also in charge of overseeing the IALA activities regarding the preservation of historic lighthouses and equipment;
* VTS&amp;nbsp;– Vessel Traffic Services&amp;nbsp;– concentrating on all issues surrounding VTS

IALA committees provide important documentation to the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] and other international organizations, while the IALA Secretariat acts as a clearing house for the exchange of technical information, and organizes seminars and technical support for developing countries.

Its principal work since 1973 has been the implementation of the [[IALA Maritime Buoyage System]]. This system replaced some 30 dissimilar buoyage systems in use throughout the world with 2 major systems. This rationalised system was introduced as a result of two accidents in the [[Strait of Dover|Dover Straits]] in 1971 [[List of shipwrecks in 1971|when the ''Brandenburg'' hit the wreck]] of the ''[[MV Texaco Caribbean|Texaco Caribbean]]'' off [[Folkestone]] and sank although the wreck was accurately  buoyed. A short while later the ''Niki'' also struck the ''Texaco Caribbean'' and sank, despite the wreckage being adequately marked. The combined loss of lives in these two accidents was 51 persons.&lt;ref&gt;"The Mariner's Handbook", Admiralty, UKHO, p206&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the international agreement of 1982 implementing a harmonized buoyage system is a major achievement for IALA the Organization, through its committees carried out a lot of works in other directions resulting in innovating techniques being adopted all over the work, such as the AIS (Automatic Identification System), DGNSS (Differential Global Navigation System) and many others.

Its future achievement is likely to be the implementation of the e-navigation. e-navigation does not aim at ships being electronically operated but gathering and displaying all navigation information through connected sources of information and harmonized data exchange.

IALA is based near Paris in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], [[France]].

==Main recommendations==
IALA is primarily known for the IALA Maritime Buoyage Systems or [[sea mark]] systems that are used in the [[pilotage]] of vessels at sea:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cil.ie/media/11141/IALA-MBS.pdf IALA Maritime Buoyage System&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lateral mark]]s  indicate the edges of a channel.
* [[Cardinal mark]]s  indicate the direction of safe water at a dangerous spot.
* [[Safe water mark]]s  indicate the deep water and open end of a channel.
* [[Special mark]]s indicate administrative areas, such as speed restrictions or water skiing areas.
* [[Isolated danger mark]]s indicate a hazard to shipping.
* Emergency Wreck Marking Buoy : a new buoy introduced in 2006, marking a new wreck. It replaces the double [[Cardinal mark|cardinal]] or [[Lateral mark|lateral]] marks (IALA Recommendation O-133).

Each type of mark has a distinctive colour, shape and possibly a [[characteristic light]].

==IALA sea mark regions==
The IALA Maritime Buoyage System defines two regions in the world:  IALA region A and IALA region B. Region B covers the whole of the Americas, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, while the rest of the world belongs to the region A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/folios/00020/images/chart-eng.jpg IALA Buoyage Regions A e B, November 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of international regulation is that it allows localities and the individuals in them to be held accountable for the impact of their actions (e.g. pollution) have on other localities.

'''Kristianstad''' ({{IPA-sv|krɪˈɧanːsta}}, older spelling ''Christianstad'') is a [[Urban areas in Sweden|city]] and the seat of [[Kristianstad Municipality]], [[Skåne County]], [[Sweden]] with 40,145 inhabitants in 2016.&lt;ref name=scb /&gt; During the last 15 years, it has gone from a garrison town to a developed commercial city, today attracting visitors in the summertime mainly from Germany, Denmark and The Netherlands. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Heliga Trefaldighetskyrkan exteriör cropped.jpg|left|thumb|[[Trinity Church, Kristianstad|Trinity Church]] (''Heliga Trefaldighetskyrkan'')]]

The city was founded in 1614 by King [[Christian IV of Denmark]], the city's name literally means 'Town of Christian', as a [[planned city]] after the burning of the nearby town of [[Vä]] and moving the [[city rights]] of the neighbouring town of [[Sölvesborg]] and Åhus to the new town. The purpose of the town was to safeguard the eastern half of the Danish province of Scania against any future raids from Sweden in the north, but also as a symbol of the power of Christian himself. One of these raids had sacked the nearby town of Vä in 1612. Vä then lost its charter and the people were moved to the new, better fortified city. The king also founded the town of [[Christianopel]] in eastern [[Blekinge]] to serve a similar purpose.

Construction of the towns was a great prestige project for the king, and Kristianstad's church ({{lang-da|Trefoldighedskirken}}; {{lang-sv|Heliga Trefaldighetskyrkan}}) is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful buildings constructed by King Christian IV, or even northern Europe's most beautiful [[Renaissance]] church. This meant that the church was built considerably larger than there was initially use for. The king also wanted castle or fortress constructed inside the town but shortage of funds made this impossible, of the intendend castle only an arsenal was constructed which today serves as the main building of the local museum. Also in Christianstad the town planning of the Renaissance could be laid down for the first time at the foundation of the town. This makes the Kristianstad town centre of today exceptionally well-kept and easy to get around in.

[[Pylyp Orlyk]] was after 1709 chosen as a [[Hetman]] in exile by the [[cossack]]s and the Swedish king [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]]. While in [[Tighina|Bender]] Orlyk wrote one of the first state [[constitutions]] in Europe. This [[Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk]] was confirmed by [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] and it also names him as ''the protector of Ukraine''. After 1714 Orlyk now together with several other cossacks followed the Swedish king [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] to [[Sweden]]. Orlyk with his family and about 40 other Cossacks arrived in [[Ystad]], [[Sweden]] in late November 1715. After some months in Ystad they lived in the city of Kristianstad for some years.&lt;ref&gt;'''Alfred Jensen''': ''Mazepa'', p.174–194. Lund 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; Orlyk wrote numerous proclamations and essays about [[Ukraine]] including the 1710 [[Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/63202/ 300th anniversary of first Ukrainian constitution written by Pylyp Orlyk being celebrated], [[Kyiv Post]] (April 5, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Capture of christianstad-claus moinichen 1686.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Short-lived Danish capture of Kristianstad during the [[Scanian War]] (1676), painting by [[Claus Møinichen]].]]
The city's coat of arms depicts two lions holding the King Christian IV's crowned insignia, the monogram C4. The coat of arms was only slightly modified after the Swedish takeover following the 1658 [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in which the eastern third of Denmark was ceded to Sweden. The coat of arms is very similar to the coat of arms of the former town of [[Christianopel]] in eastern [[Blekinge]], a town also founded by Christian IV. Since 1971, the coat of arms is used by [[Kristianstad Municipality]]. Kristianstad's coat of arms is one of the few coat of arms in the world depicting a foreign king's or queen's coat of arms. A reason for the Swedes to continue using the old coat of arms could be its colours – blue and yellow.

The city served as capital of [[Kristianstad County]] between 1719 and 1997. It now houses the administration and the regional parliament of the [[Skåne Regional Council]]. For a long time Kristianstad also was a very important garrison town, the A3 Wendes Artillery Regiment and the P6 South Scanian Infantry Regiment being the towns most prominent military units. Also the town housed for many years the so-called Scanian Fortification Brigade. The Wendes Artillery Regiment served with distinction in the Napoleonic Wars. One of Sweden's higher courts of appeal was located in Kristianstad before being moved to [[Malmö]] in 1917.

==Geography==
Sweden's lowest point, at 2.41 meters below [[mean sea level]], is located in Kristianstad. Because of this, parts of the city have to be protected from flooding by a system of [[levees]] and water pumps. To expand the city, large areas of low-lying wetlands have had to be walled in, especially to the east. To prevent future flooding of the city center, the existing levees are in the process of being reinforced and new levees against both [[Helge å]] and [[Hammarsjön]] are under construction. An extensive system of ponds and dams is also under construction. The threat of flooding became substantial during late winter 2002, when the greater part of the public park [[Tivoliparken]] was under water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kristianstad.se/oversvamningsskydd|title=Skydd mot översvämningar (Protection from flooding)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wetlands around the city are starting to be regarded more as an asset, not least thanks to the creation of [[Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vattenriket.kristianstad.se/eng/|title=Summary|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vattenriket.kristianstad.se|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the Vattenriket is a Unesco biosphere reserve.

==Climate==
Kristianstad straddles the line between an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') and a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'') typical of southern Sweden. The marine influence is greater during winter, a season that averages above the freezing point. Summers are warm and comparatively long by Swedish standards.

==Environmental==
Kristianstad has by now crossed a vital threshold, as the city and adjacent municipality, with a population of 80,000, in essence use no oil, natural gas or coal to warm homes and businesses, even throughout the extensive chilly winters. It is an absolute turnaround from 20 years ago, when all of its heating came from fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/science/earth/11fossil.html?ref=sweden |title=Using Waste, Swedish City Cuts Its Fossil Fuel Use |date=December 10, 2010 |newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==
[[Absolut Vodka]], owned by [[Pernod Ricard]], is produced by the town of [[Åhus]] located within the municipality. Kristianstad was the main military seat in [[Scania]] for a long time, boosting military camps and trainings. After the reforms and military cutbacks of the 1990s all of these have been closed, although a new military presence is being established in nearby Rinkaby which holds an old military training ground. Also in and around Kristianstad are numerous enterprises concerned with agriculture and it is usually said that every Swede everyday eats something produced from Kristianstad. At the old garrison ground for the P6 South Scanian Infantry Regiment (later mechanized) there is today the local Kristianstad University which is specialized in educating teachers and nurses.

==Culture==
The Swedish Film industry ([[Svensk Filmindustri]]) commenced its activities in Kristianstad in the 1910s, {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} before moving to Stockholm in 1920. Today the old studio is a museum.

==Events==
The 2011 [[22nd World Scout Jamboree|World Scout Jamboree]] was held near [[Rinkaby]], in Kristianstad municipality. Also every summer there is a huge beachhandboll tournament in Åhus.

'''Lake Makgadikgadi''' was a [[paleolake]] that existed in what is now the [[Kalahari Desert]] in [[Botswana]] from 2,000,000 years BP to 10,000 years BP.  It may have once covered  an area of from 80,000 km² to 275,000 km² and was 30 m deep &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/92394/makgadikgadi-salt-pans|title=Makgadikgadi Salt Pans|date=2018-07-06|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Okavango River|Okavango]], [[Zambezi|Upper Zambezi]], and [[Cuando River|Cuando]] rivers once all emptied into the lake. Its remains are seen in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan|Makgadikgadi salt pans]] , one of the largest [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pans]] in the world. 

== Meaning of the name ==
The name Makgadikgadi is derived from the same root as the name for the desert Kalahari, meaning a dry thirsty place in the languages of the [[San people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.botswana.co.za/Botswana_Travel_Articles-travel/names-origins.html|title=Botswana Travel Article {{!}} Origins of the Names of Places in Botswana|website=www.botswana.co.za|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and history==
Approximately 3 million years ago, strong easterly winds formed long dunes which ran from east to west across the middle of the Kalahari Desert. During wetter times, these dunes channeled the great rivers of the area, the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], [[Chobe River|Chobe]], and [[Zambezi|Upper Zambezi]], south eastwards to join with the [[Limpopo River]] and drain into the [[Indian Ocean]].

Northern Botswana has a series of deep, underlying fault lines running beneath its sands. These faults are thought to be the southernmost extensions of the same system of parallel fault lines that are pulling away from each other and have formed [[Great Rift Valley|East Africa's Great Rift Valley]].  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.botswana-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1171|title=Geological history - Botswana Travel Guide|website=www.botswana-travel-guide.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the courses of both the  [[Linyanti River]]  and [[Chobe River]], mark the lie of these faults today .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Approximately 2 million years ago, the fault known as the Ovamboland-Kalahari-Zimbabwe axis (which runs from NE to SW  from [[Harare]] through [[Bulawayo]] and ends in the east side of the Kalahari) moved in an  [[Epeirogenic movement|epeirogenic flexure]], and cut off the drainage route into the Limpopo. The blockage created an enormous basin and forced these rivers to flow into and fill it up. Lake Makgadikgadi was thus created.

The great Magwikwe Sand Ridge  between Savuti and North Gate, probably defined one of its northwestern shorelines. Another is thought to have been the less obvious Gidikwe Sand Ridge, which lies just to the west of the western border of the present Makgadikgadi National Park.

Wave washed features can be found on several of the Kalahari's higher places in this region. The eastern side of the Gchoha Hills, north of Savuti, are a particularly clear example of this. Round water eroded pebbles can also be found.

As the millennia passed, the lake filled to capacity and it began to overflow  about 20,000 years ago taking the lowest point in the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] in the north east as its new outlet.  This caused the middle and lower Zambezi Rivers to connect, forming the [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]]. With the water now able to flow out of the basin, Lake Makgadikgadi drained partially and its average level decreased.

A drier climatic period followed which increased evaporation and decreased the flow of the rivers that fed the lake. By about 10,000 years ago the drying of Lake Makgadikgadi was in an advanced stage. [[Sediment]] and debris from the Okavango River and windblown sand were gradually filling the lake.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Gumare fault]] formed and lowered the land. As a result, the water of the Okavango River spread out over a much larger area of land than it previously did, forming the now characteristic fan-shaped inland delta of the Okavango, which further reduced the water that flowed into Lake Makgadikgadi and hastened its demise.

==Ecology==
Lake Makgadikgadi is theorized to have been the birthplace of the vast number of [[cichlids]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Owen, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; that once swam the [[Congo River]], [[Zambezi River]], [[Okavango River]] and [[Limpopo River]] - as many as 100 to 400 new species, of which approximately 25 survive today. The lake's sheer size may have provided the ancestors of these fish with an extremely wide range of new ecological niches to exploit and thus could have served as the stimulus for the evolution of the new species, which they may have done in record time before the lake drained completely. The theory further says that the new species, after having evolved within the confines of the lake, could have escaped with the lakewater as it drained, and populated the rivers of the region to evolve into the cichlids that exist today.

In current times this land is desiccated most of the year and is a seasonal [[wetland]] in the rainy summer months.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Legacy ==

Today the only remains of Lake Makgadikgadi are the [[Okavango Delta]], the [[Nxai Pan]], [[Lake Ngami]], [[Lake Xau]], the [[Mababe Depression]], and the two main [[Makgadikgadi Pan|Makgadikgadi pans]]: the [[Sua Pan]] and the [[Nwetwe Pan]].

The [[Makgadikgadi Pan|Makgadikgadi Salt Pans]] are among the largest in the world and are formed from the last remnants of this great lake.  The [[Okavango Delta]] is   a very large, swampy [[inland delta]] formed where the [[Okavango River]] reaches the former bed of the lake. It is now an  [[endorheic basin]] in which all the water reaching the basin is ultimately [[evaporated]] and [[Transpiration|transpired]],

The other south draining rivers  that once fed the lake have now all been [[Stream capture|captured]] by the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]].

'''Legal nullity''' refers to any entity which theoretically is, or might be, of some legal significance, but in fact lacks any identity or distinct structure of its own.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The usual examples are counties (or equivalent sub-regional groupings) which are wholly subsumed by the municipal government within their boundaries.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wg1dvc2lfcEC&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;dq=legal%20nullity%20-wikipedia%20entity&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20nullity%20-wikipedia%20entity&amp;f=false Textbook on Legal Language and Legal Writing] Bhatia, K, L. 2010. Universal Law Publishing. p269. Retrieved: 27/05/18&lt;/ref&gt;

Some entities which fit this description are [[Philadelphia County]], a legal nullity because it is entirely coterminous with the city of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York County]], which is similarly coterminous with the Borough of Manhattan, in [[New York City]] (as are each of the Five [[Borough (New York City)|Boroughs]] of New York City).&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

These areas are of relatively little legal import, since there is a generally agreed overarching legal coverage. The issue is of greater significance when a significant power is technically under the overarching body's power but has been external from that control for so long that it is generally accepted as to have little consequence. [[Kosovo]] is one particular case, as from many country's viewpoints, it doesn't exist as a country. However it has a well-established legal system without any other party effectively stating control over the region (and no likelihood of that changing in the anticipated future). For the 80 countries that don't recognise its independence, but wish to participate with the country (trade, security etc), then functioning with Kosovo's legal system is necessary. This means functionally ignoring a legal system of significance, from their point of view. The same can be said of several other long-disputed "de-facto" States, where necessity drives rejecting the participation of a legally significant legal system. &lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Legal nullity is also a court decision made without jurisdiction or authority.  Such a decision does not have to be vacated or appealed, it is void from inception.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

=== [[United States|USA]], [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|US Territories]], [[Canada]] &amp; [[Bolivia]] ([[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] band plan) ===

Apart from their main spectrum holdings across large regions in the country (listed below) the major US carriers (AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile &amp; Verizon) also hold various Cellular Market Area (CMA) and/or Economic Area (EA) licenses for the AWS 1700 band, as well as Major Trading Area (MTA) and/or Basic Trading Area (BTA) licenses for the PCS 1900 band. In several small regional areas the named operators combine these with their major spectrum holdings to increase the bandwidth for their LTE deployments. Due to the large amount of these "single" licenses they are not listed here.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12295">This is a '''list of [[airport]]s in [[French Polynesia]]''', sorted by location.

French Polynesia ({{lang-fr|Polynésie française}}) is an [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] (''territoire d'outre-mer'' or ''TOM'') of [[France]] with the particular designation of [[Overseas country of France|overseas country]] (''pays d'outre-mer'' or ''POM'') in the southern [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is made up of several groups of [[Polynesia]]n [[island]]s, the most famous island being [[Tahiti]] in the [[Society Islands]] group, which is also the most populous island, and the seat of the capital of the territory ([[Papeete]]).

== Airport ==

ICAO location identifiers are linked to each airport's [[Aeronautical Information Publication]] (AIP), which are available online in [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) from the French [http://www.sia.aviation-civile.gouv.fr/ ''Service d'information aéronautique'' (SIA)]. Locations shown in bold are as per the airport's AIP page. Most airports give two locations: the first is the city served, second is the city where the airport is located.

Airport names shown in '''bold''' have scheduled commercial airline service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6410">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in French Polynesia'''. There are twelve mammal species in [[French Polynesia]], of which none are critically endangered, two are endangered, one is vulnerable, and none are near-threatened.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically Endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near Threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12984">The '''list of national border changes from 1815 to 1914''', refers to the changes in international borders since the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] until [[World War I]].

Originally, official tours were events predominantly for Canadians to see and possibly meet members of their Royal Family, with the associated patriotic pomp and spectacle. However, nearing the end of the 20th century, such occasions took on the added dimension of a theme, and junior members of the Royal Family began to undertake unofficial "working" tours of Canada as well; in this method, royal figures are invited by provinces, municipalities, and other organizations to events which the latter fund without assistance from the federal government. [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]], [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Duke of York]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|The Prince Edward]], have all made several small tours in this fashion. These arrangements then [[List of royal tours of Canada (21st century)|continued on into the 21st century]].

'''Lower Egypt''' ({{lang-ar| مصر السفلى}} ''{{transl|ar|Miṣr as-Suflā}}'') is the northernmost [[region]] of [[Egypt]]:  the fertile [[Nile Delta]], between [[Upper Egypt]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] — from El Aiyat, south of modern-day [[Cairo]], and [[Dahshur]].

==Geography==

In ancient times, [[Pliny the Elder]] (N.H. 5.11) said that upon reaching the delta the Nile split into seven branches (from east to west): the [[Pelusium|Pelusiac]], the [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanitic]], the [[Mendes]]ian, the [[Phatnitic]], the [[Sebennytic]], the [[Rosetta|Bolbitine]], and the [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopic]]. Today there are two principal channels that the [[Nile]] takes through the [[river]]'s delta: one in the west at [[Rosetta|Rashid]] and one in the east at [[Damietta]].

The delta region is well watered, crisscrossed by channels and canals.

The climate in Lower Egypt is milder than that of [[Upper Egypt]] owing primarily to its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. Temperatures are less extreme and rainfall is more abundant.

==History==

Lower Egypt was known as ''Ta-Mehu'' which means "land of [[papyrus]]." It was divided into twenty districts called [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]s, the first of which was at [[el-Lisht]]. Because Lower Egypt was mostly undeveloped [[scrubland]], undeveloped for human life and filled with all types of plant life such as grasses and herbs, the organization of the nomes underwent several changes.

The capital of Lower Egypt was [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. Its patron Goddess was the cobra goddess [[Wadjet]]. Lower Egypt was represented by the Low Red Crown ''[[Deshret]]'', and its symbols were the papyrus and the bee.

By about 3600 BC, neolithic Egyptian societies along the [[Nile River]] had based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'' (Charles Scribner's Sons Publishing: New York, 1966) p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after 3600 BC Egyptian society began to grow and advance rapidly toward refined civilization.&lt;ref name=Roebuck1&gt;Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'' (Charles Scribner's Sons: New York, 1966) p. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; A new and distinctive pottery, which was related to the [[Syro-Palestinian archaeology#Ceramics analysis|pottery in the Southern Levant]], appeared during this time. Extensive use of copper became common during this time.&lt;ref name=Roebuck1 /&gt; The [[Mesopotamia]]n process of [[mudbrick|sun-dried bricks]], and architectural building principles—including the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effect—became popular during this time.&lt;ref name=Roebuck1 /&gt;

Concurrent with these cultural advances, a process of unification of the societies and towns of the upper Nile River, or [[Upper Egypt]], occurred. At the same time the societies of the [[Nile Delta]], or Lower Egypt also underwent a unification process.&lt;ref name=Roebuck1 /&gt; Warfare between Upper and Lower Egypt occurred often.&lt;ref name=Roebuck1 /&gt; During his reign in Upper Egypt, King [[Narmer]] defeated his enemies on the Delta and merged both the Kingdom of Upper and Lower Egypt under his single rule.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'' (Charles Scribner's Sons Publishers: New York, 1966), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palermo stone]], a royal annal written in the mid Fifth Dynasty (c. 2490 BC &amp;ndash; c. 2350 BC) records a number of kings reigning over Lower Egypt before [[Narmer]]. These are completely unattested outside these inscriptions:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">'''Mainland Finland''' ({{lang-fi|Manner-Suomi}}, {{lang-sv|Fasta Finland}}) is a term used in [[statistics]] and in other contexts to describe the continental parts of [[Finland]], an area which excludes the [[Åland Islands]]. In legal contexts, the relation between the mainland and Åland is depicted by the word pair ''the State–Åland'' ({{Lang-fi|valtakunta–maakunta}}, {{Lang-sv|riket–landskapet}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1991/en19911144.pdf Act on the Autonomy of Åland] (1144/1991) and [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1991/19911144 the Finnish original]. E.g. § 27 shows the difference.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "mainland Finland" is significant in the context of legal differences between Åland and mainland Finland, and in the context of differences of culture, language, history, and self-perceived nationhood between the Ålanders and the [[Swedish-speaking Finns]] in mainland Finland. However, since the population of Åland is only about 0.5% of that of mainland Finland, and below 10% of that of the Swedish-speaking Finns in mainland Finland, there are many instances when this distinction is ignored.

In a [[Geography|geographical]] sense the term "mainland Finland" can be used to exclude Finland's other sea islands, but when distinguishing between Åland and the rest of Finland, the term encompasses those islands.

'''Mario Giovinetto''' (born 1933, [[La Plata]], [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Argentina]])  is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[glaciologist]], [[climatologist]], and [[geographer]].  He is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizen with permanent resident status in the [[US]].

==Career==

Dr. Giovinetto was active in [[polar region|polar]] research beginning in 1952.  He participated in projects supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] (US) and other federal research agencies in [[Argentina]] and Canada.  His field work experience includes three expeditions to high-mountain glaciers in the [[Andes Mountains]] ([[South America]]) and in [[Africa]] (1952–1955), winter stays at two [[Antarctic]] stations ([[Byrd Station]], 1957 and [[South Pole Station]], 1958), and nine summer-seasons in [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]] (1953–1978).  He has logged more than 2000 miles of over-snow traverse, made observations at a number of sea-ice and iceberg sites, and spent approximately nine years as a member of small isolated teams working in demanding environments.  His glaciology and climatology research was done while affiliated with the [[Instituto Antartico Argentino]] (Buenos Aires; 1953–1956),  [[Arctic Institute of North America]] (New York; 1956–1959), Institute of Polar Studies (now [[Byrd Polar Research Center]]), [[Ohio State University]] ([[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]); 1959–1961, and the Geophysical and Polar Research Center, [[University of Wisconsin]] ([[Madison Wisconsin|Madison]]; 1961–1968).

His research led to estimates of mass and energy exchange between atmosphere, ocean (including sea ice) and ice sheets of both hemispheres that are used in global climate change model construction.  His contributions have been recognized in several awards from US and Argentine government agencies.&lt;ref name=NASA2002&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen J. |last=Hoffman |title=Antarctic Explorations Parallels for Future Human Planetary Exploration: A Workshop Report |publisher=[[NASA]] |year=2002 |id=NASA/TP–2002–210778 |format=PDF |url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2002-210778.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415111259/http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2002-210778.pdf |archivedate=2010-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mount Giovinetto]] is a 4090 m/13419&amp;nbsp;ft mountain named for him in the Antarctic [[Ellsworth Mountains]] [[Sentinel Range]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapplanet.com/?do=loc&amp;country=_A&amp;adm1=06&amp;loc=20004596] MapPlanet: List of locations: "Giovinetto, Mount"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Dr. Giovinetto participated in a [[NASA]] [[Johnson Space Center]] workshop - "Antarctic Explorations Parallels for Future Human Planetary Exploration" - where the isolated polar environment experience of researchers was tapped to help predict issues that could arise in human crew extraplanetary exploration.  There are many parallels between a winter-long remote polar settlement and one on the Moon or Mars.&lt;ref name=NASA2002/&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Japan:

'''[[Japan]]''' &amp;ndash; an [[island nation]] in [[East Asia]], located in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It lies to the east of the [[Sea of Japan]], [[China]], [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]] and [[Russia]], stretching from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the north to the [[East China Sea]] and [[Taiwan]] in the south. The [[kanji|characters]] that make up [[Names of Japan|Japan's name]] mean "sun-origin" (because it lies to the east of nearby countries), which is why Japan is sometimes referred to as the "[[Names of Japan|Land of the Rising Sun]]". Japan is an [[archipelago]] of [[List of islands of Japan|6,852 islands]]. The four largest islands are [[Honshu]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Kyushu]], and [[Shikoku]], which together comprise about ninety-seven percent of Japan's land area.

[[File:Harden PWY.jpg|thumb|300px|Harden Parkway in [[Salinas, California]]]]

A '''parkway''' is a broad, landscaped [[highway]] [[thoroughfare]].&lt;ref name="Parkway"&gt;''"parkway."''Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002. http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com (14 Apr. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The term is particularly used for a roadway in a [[park]] or connecting to a park from which trucks and other [[heavy vehicle]]s are excluded.&lt;ref name="Parkway"/&gt; Many parkways originally intended for scenic, recreational driving have evolved into major urban and commuter routes.

The term ''parkway'' is sometimes applied more generally to a variety of [[limited-access road]]s.

In Russia, long, broad (multi-lane) and beautified thoroughfares are referred to as [[Prospekt (street)|prospekt]]s.

==United States==
[[File:Eastern Pkwy west of New York Ave.JPG|thumb|right|[[Brooklyn]]'s [[Eastern Parkway (Brooklyn)|Eastern Parkway]], the world's first parkway, according to the [[New York City]] [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|Department of Parks and Recreation]].]]
[[File:IMG 2237 - Clara Barton Pkwy at NSWC (looking west).JPG|thumb|right|The [[Clara Barton Parkway]] in [[Maryland]]]]

===Scenic roads===
Over the years, many different types of roads have been labeled parkways.

The first parkways in the [[United States]] were developed during the late 19th century by landscape architects [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Beatrix Farrand]] as roads segregated for{{clarifyme|date=March 2018}} pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians, and [[horse carriage]]s, such as the [[Eastern Parkway]], which is credited as the world's first parkway,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycgovparks.org/about/history/historical-signs/listings?id=196&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ocean Parkway (Brooklyn)|Ocean Parkway]] in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Brooklyn]]. The terminology "parkway" to define this type of road was coined by [[Calvert Vaux]] and Frederick Law Olmsted in their proposal to link city and suburban parks with "pleasure roads".

Newer roads such as [[Delaware Park-Front Park System|Bidwell]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] and Park Presidio Boulevard in [[San Francisco, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Jeanne|title=History of Park Presidio Boulevard|website=ppnsf.org/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; were designed for automobiles and are broad and divided by large landscaped central medians. 

During the early 20th century, the meaning of the word was expanded to include [[limited-access highway]]s designed for recreational driving of automobiles, with [[landscape|landscaping]]. These parkways originally provided [[scenic route]]s without very slow or [[commercial vehicle]]s, at [[Level crossing|grade intersections]], or pedestrian traffic. Examples are the [[Merritt Parkway]] in Connecticut and the [[Vanderbilt Motor Parkway]] in New York. But their success led to more development, expanding a city's boundaries, eventually limiting the parkway's recreational driving use. The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] between [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and [[Pasadena, California]] is an example of lost [[pastoral]] aesthetics. It and others have become major commuting routes, while retaining the name "parkway".

===Early high speed roads===
{{See also|Parkways in New York State}}
In New York City, construction on the [[Long Island Motor Parkway]] (Vanderbilt Parkway) began in 1906 and planning for the [[Bronx River Parkway]] in 1907. In the 1920s, the  [[New York City Metropolitan Area]]'s parkway system grew under the direction of [[Robert Moses]], the president of the New York State Council of Parks and [[Long Island State Park Commission]], who used parkways to create and access state parks, especially for city dwellers. As Commissioner of New York City Parks under Mayor LaGuardia, he extended the parkways to the heart of the city, creating and linking its parks to the greater metropolitan systems.

Most of the New York metropolitan parkways were designed by Gilmore Clark. The famed "Gateway to New England" [[Merritt Parkway]] in [[Connecticut]] was designed in the 1930s as a pleasurable alternative for affluent locals to the congested Boston Post Road, running through forest with each bridge designed uniquely to enhance the scenery. Another example is the [[Sprain Brook Parkway]] from [[The Bronx]] to become the [[Taconic State Parkway]] to [[Chatham, New York]]. [[Landscape architect]] [[George Kessler]] designed extensive parkway systems for [[Kansas City, Missouri#Parks and boulevard system|Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Memphis Park and Parkway System|Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Indianapolis Park and Boulevard System|Indianapolis]]; and other cities at the beginning of the 20th century.

[[File:Natchez-Trace-Parkway-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Natchez Trace Parkway]]]]

===New Deal roads===
In the 1930s, as part of the [[New Deal]] the U.S. federal government constructed [[National Parkway]]s designed for recreational driving and to commemorate historic trails and routes. These divided four-lane parkways have lower [[speed limit]]s and are maintained by the [[National Park Service]]. An example is the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) built [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]].

Others are: [[Skyline Drive]] in [[Virginia]]; the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] in [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Tennessee]]; and the [[Colonial Parkway]] in eastern Virginia's [[Historic Triangle]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/special_sections/parkway/parkway1.html |archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20121009162431/http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/special_sections/parkway/parkway1.html |archive-date = October 9, 2012 |first1 = Tim |last1 = Thornton |first2 = Isak |last2 = Howell |title = Parkway’s Past Haunts Its Future |work = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]], running along the [[Potomac River]] near [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia]], were also constructed during this era.

===Post-war parkways===
In [[Kentucky]] the term "parkway" designates a [[controlled-access highway]] in the [[:Category:Kentucky parkway system|Kentucky Parkway system]], with nine built in the 1960s and 1970s. They were [[toll road]]s until the [[construction bond]]s were repaid, and are now [[freeway]]s since 2006.

The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] from [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] to [[Los Angeles]], built in 1940, was the first segment of the vast [[Southern California]] freeway system. It became part of [[Interstate 110 and State Route 110 (California)|State Route 110]] and was renamed the Pasadena Freeway. A 2010 restoration of the freeway brought the Arroyo Seco Parkway designation back.

[[File:Truckersuseexpwysnotpkwys.jpg|thumb|right|Sign informing truckers it is illegal to use a parkway in [[New York City]].]]
In the [[New York metropolitan area]], contemporary parkways are predominantly controlled-access highways restricted to non-commercial traffic, excluding [[truck]]s and [[tractor-trailer]]s. Some have low overpasses that also exclude buses. The Vanderbilt Parkway, an exception in western [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], is a surviving remnant of the [[Long Island Motor Parkway]] that became a [[surface street]], no longer with controlled-access or non-commercial vehicle restrictions. The [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] is a post-war parkway that starts at the [[George Washington Bridge]], heads north through New Jersey, continuing through Rockland and Orange counties in New York. The Palisades Parkway was built to allow for a direct route from New York City to [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]].

In New Jersey, the [[Garden State Parkway]], connecting the urban Northeast U.S. with the [[Jersey Shore]] and [[Atlantic City]], is restricted to buses and non-commercial traffic north of the [[New Jersey Route 18|Route 18]] interchange but is one of the busiest [[toll road]]s in the country.&lt;ref name=njdottrucks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/about/rules/pdf/chapter32truckaccess.pdf|title=Title 16.

In the [[Pittsburgh]] region, two of the major Interstates are referred to informally as parkways. The Parkway East ([[Interstate 376|I-376]], formally the [[Penn-Lincoln Parkway]]) connects Downtown Pittsburgh to [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania]]. The Parkway West ([[Interstate 376|I-376]]) runs through the [[Fort Pitt Tunnel]] and links Downtown to [[Pittsburgh International Airport]], southbound [[Interstate 79|I-79]], [[Imperial, Pennsylvania]], and westbound US&amp;nbsp;22/US&amp;nbsp;30. The Parkway North ([[Interstate 279|I-279]]) connects Downtown to [[Franklin Park, Pennsylvania]] and northbound [[Interstate 79|I-79]].
&lt;!---personal view &amp; opinions, &amp; missing NPOV---Many opponents of increased road construction in the [[United States]]{{Who|date=December 2008}} claim that the use of the term "parkway" in any sense other than as a scenic route through parkland, is deceptive. It is claimed by such advocates{{Who|date=December 2008}} that many existing and proposed parkways (such as the proposed [[West Eugene Parkway]] in [[Oregon]]) are functionally indistinguishable from [[freeway]]s and/or [[Limited-access road|expressways]], and the "parkway" label is used to make construction of such routes seem more palatable to the public{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} (who might otherwise stage a [[Freeway revolts|freeway revolt]], especially if their neighborhood is affected).  Others{{Who|date=December 2008}} claim that this is splitting hairs; and that the use of the term "parkway" in conjunction with urban and suburban highways is a well-established practice.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  Furthermore, most routes{{where}} designated with the "parkway" label do have scenic enhancements (making the route more attractive for both motorists and neighbors),{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} and many such routes do exclude trucks. As truck traffic interferes with normal vehicle movement the congestion in the road can be reduced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}---&gt;

In the suburbs of [[Philadelphia]], [[U.S. Route 202 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 202]] follows an at-grade parkway alignment known as the "U.S. Route 202 Parkway" between [[Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania|Montgomeryville]] and [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]]. The parkway varies from two to four lanes in width, has {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} shoulders, a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} walking path called the [[US 202 Parkway Trail]] on the side, and a {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit.

In [[Minneapolis]], the [[Grand Rounds Scenic Byway]] system has {{convert|50|mi|km}} of streets designated as parkways.

In [[Cincinnati]], parkways are major roads which trucks are prohibited from using. Some Cincinnati parkways, such as Columbia Parkway, are high-speed, limited-access roads, while others, such as Central Parkway, are multi-lane urban roads without controlled access. Columbia Parkway carries US-50 traffic from downtown towards east-side suburbs of Mariemont, Anderson, and Milford, and is a limited access road from downtown to the Village of Mariemont.

==Canada==
[[File:Icefields Parkway-02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Icefields Parkway]] runs through the [[Canadian Rockies]] in [[Jasper National Park]] and [[Banff National Park]].]]

"Parkway" is used in the names of many [[Canada|Canadian]] roads, including major routes through [[National parks of Canada|national parks]], scenic drives, major urban thoroughfares, and even regular freeways that carry commercial traffic.

Parkways in the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] are administered by the [[National Capital Commission|National Capital Region (Canada)]]. However, some of them are named "drive" or "driveway".

The term in Canada is also applied to multi-use paths and [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]] used by walkers and cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.translink.ca/en/Getting-Around/Cycling/BC-Parkway.aspx BC Parkway, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stcatharines.ca/en/playin/WellandCanalsParkwayTrail.asp Welland Canals Parkway Trail, Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
{{main|Parkway (disambiguation)}}
The United Kingdom has parkways (known in that region as a [[carriageway]]) in many large towns and cities.{{dubious|date=March 2018}} Most examples are motorways or [[A road (UK)|A roads]]. Some parkways including [[Chelmsford]] Parkway have flyovers leading to major roads.

===Bristol (and other) park-and-ride railway stations===
[[File:Luton Airport Parkway railway station.jpg|thumb|270px|Luton Airport Parkway railway station]]
Several mainly park-and-ride-status railway stations in England have the suffix "parkway" in their name. The etymology is from the original U.S. meaning as the [[Bristol Parkway railway station]] was named after the adjacent [[M32 motorway]], originally known as The Parkway because of its green-[[buffer zone|buffered]] route into the city. Bristol Parkway was the first railway station so named, in 1972. The majority of such stations were opened in the late 20th century to relieve pressure on existing city centre stations. Examples such as [[Didcot Parkway railway station|Didcot Parkway]] are renamings following the expansion of the car parking facilities where the name is used promotionally (for example commuters to Oxford are encouraged to leave their car at Didcot and travel to Oxford by train) whereas in others with multi-storey car parks serving modest settlements such as [[Brookwood railway station|Brookwood]] and [[Fleet railway station|Fleet]] the suffix has not been adopted.

[[Luton Airport Parkway railway station|Luton Airport Parkway]] and [[Southampton Airport Parkway railway station|Southampton Airport Parkway]] are examples serving [[Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[Southampton Airport|Southampton]] airports. Some were so named as they are not in easy walking distance of an airport terminal; passengers use shuttle bus services, although Southampton Airport station is within easy walking distance of Southampton Airport and has no separate car parking facilities of its own.

===Peterborough===
{{further|Road transport in Peterborough}}
The city and [[New towns in the United Kingdom|third-generation new town]] of [[Peterborough, Cambridgeshire|Peterborough]] (population of 184,500 as at 2011 census) has an overall free-capacity system roads branded as "parkways", which together with other roads provide routes for much through traffic and local traffic sufficient to cope in most peak hours. The majority are dual carriageways, with many of their junctions numbered. Five main parkways (Soke Parkway, Nene Parkway, Fletton Parkway, Frank Perkins Parkway, Paston Parkway) form an orbital outer ring road. Orton Parkway, Werrington Parkway, Longthorpe Parkway are named after the settlements they serve. For example, Werrington Parkway is an arbitrary renaming of a short section of the A15 Lincoln Road.

===Plymouth===
In the [[Plymouth#Government|City of Plymouth]], the [[A38 road|A38]] is called "The Parkway" and bisects a rural belt of the [[unitary authority|local authority]] area, which coincides with the geographical centre; it has two junctions to enter the downtown part of the city.

== Australia ==

===Australian Capital Territory===
The [[Australian Capital Territory]] uses the term "parkway" to refer to roadways of a standard approximately equivalent to what would be designated as an "expressway", "freeway", or "motorway" in other areas. Parkways generally have multiple lanes in each direction of travel, no intersections (crossroads are accessed by interchanges), high speed limits, and are of dual carriageway design (or have high crash barriers on the median).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majuraparkway.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/161316/EPBC_Referral_Majura_Parkway_to_DEWHA_Rev1.pdf EPBC Referral - Majura Parkway to DEWHA (Revision 1)], SMEC, Page 9, 19 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] uses the term "parkway" to sometimes refer to smaller local access roads that travel through parkland. Unlike other uses of the term, these parkways are not high-speed routes but may still have some degree of limited access.

==Singapore==
[[Singapore]] uses the term "parkway" as an alternative to "[[Expressways of Singapore|expressway]]". As such, parkways are also dual carriageways with high speed limits and [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]]. The [[East Coast Parkway]] is currently the only expressway in Singapore that uses this terminology.

{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}
[[Image:Jiangxia-peanuts-9702.JPG|thumb|Drying and bagging of [[peanut]]s in [[Jiangxia District]], [[Hubei]], China]]
In [[agriculture]], '''postharvest''' handling is the stage of [[crop]] production immediately following [[harvest]], including cooling, cleaning, sorting and packing. The instant a crop is removed from the [[soil|ground]], or separated from its parent [[plant]], it begins to deteriorate. Postharvest treatment largely determines final quality, whether a crop is sold for [[fresh food|fresh]] consumption, or used as an ingredient in a [[processed food]] product.

==Goals==
[[Image:E7999-Milyanfan-peppers.jpg|thumb|left|Drying [[chili pepper]]s. [[Milyanfan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]]]
The most important goals of post-harvest handling are keeping the product cool, to avoid moisture loss and slow down undesirable [[chemical]] changes, and avoiding physical damage such as [[bruising]], to delay [[Food spoilage|spoilage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/summaries/summary.php?pub=378|title=Postharvest Handling of Fruits and Vegetables|author=Janet Bachmann and Richard Earles|date=August 2000|publisher=NCAT|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020211213617/http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/postharvest.html|archivedate=2002-02-11|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanitation]] is also an important factor, to reduce the possibility of [[pathogen]]s that could be carried by fresh produce, for example, as residue from [[contamination|contaminated]] washing water.

After the field, post-harvest processing is usually continued in a [[packing house]]. This can be a simple shed, providing shade and running water, or a large-scale, sophisticated, [[mechanization|mechanised]] facility, with [[conveyor belt]]s, [[automation|automated]] sorting and packing stations, walk-in [[cooler]]s and the like. In mechanised harvesting, processing may also begin as part of the actual harvest process, with initial cleaning and sorting performed by the harvesting machinery.

Initial post-harvest storage conditions are critical to maintaining quality. Each crop has an optimum range of storage temperature and humidity. Also, certain crops cannot be effectively stored together, as unwanted chemical interactions can result. Various methods of high-speed cooling, and sophisticated [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] and atmosphere-controlled environments, are employed to prolong freshness, particularly in large-scale operations.

Regardless of the scale of harvest, from domestic garden to industrialised farm, the basic principles of post-harvest handling for most crops are the same: handle with care to avoid damage (cutting, crushing, bruising), cool immediately and maintain in cool conditions, and cull (remove damaged items).

==Postharvest shelf life==
Once harvested, vegetables and fruits are subject to the active process of [[senescence]]. Numerous [[biochemistry|biochemical processes]] continuously change the original composition of the [[crop]] until it becomes unmarketable. The period during which consumption is considered acceptable is defined as the time of "postharvest shelf life".

Postharvest shelf life is typically determined by objective methods that determine the overall appearance, taste, flavour, and texture of the commodity.  These methods usually include a combination of [[sensory analysis|sensorial]], [[biochemistry|biochemical]], mechanical, and [[colorimetric]] ([[optical]]) measurements. A recent study attempted (and failed) to discover a biochemical [[Biomarker|marker]] and [[Peptide mass fingerprinting|fingerprint methods]] as indices for freshness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=93_4 actahort.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of post harvest technology==
* It has to develop in relation with needs of each society to stimulate agriculture production, prevent post harvest losses, Improve nutritional and add value of production.
* To this process, It must be able to generate employment reduce poverty &amp; stimulate growth of other selected economic sector.
* The Process of developing of post harvest technology and its purposeful use need on inter disciplinary and most multidimensional approach which must include scientific creativity, technology innovation and institutional capable of interdisciplinary research.
* The fruit &amp; vegetable processing industry in India is highly decliners having wide capability the deserve Agro-climateric zone make it possible to grow almost all varieties of fresh fruit &amp; green vegetables in India.

==Postharvest physiology==
Postharvest physiology is the scientific study of the [[physiology]] of living plant tissues after they have denied further nutrition by picking. It has direct applications to postharvest handling in establishing the storage and transport conditions that best prolong shelf life.

An example of the importance of the field to postharvest handling is the discovery that ripening of fruit can be delayed, and thus their storage prolonged, by preventing fruit tissue respiration. This insight allowed scientists to bring to bear their knowledge of the fundamental principles and mechanisms of respiration, leading to postharvest storage techniques such as cold storage, gaseous storage, and waxy skin coatings. Another well-known example is the finding that ripening may be brought on by treatment with [[ethylene]].

'''SECORE''' ('''SE'''xual '''CO'''ral '''RE'''production) is an international [[non-profit organization]] focused on [[coral reef]] conservation. The group has over sixty supporters in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Japan]], and comprises [[public aquarium]]s, [[institute]]s, and [[university|universities]]. Founded in 2001 at the [[Diergaarde Blijdorp|Rotterdam Zoo]] in the [[Netherlands]], the organization has been developing methods of captive coral [[reproduction]] and preservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/rso/news.cfm?story=85820|title=U of A researcher helps save endangered coral|author=Elleker, Lindsay|publisher=[[University of Alberta]]|accessdate=2010-01-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129013655/http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/rso/news.cfm?story=85820|archivedate=2011-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing studies that have predicted coral reefs could be [[extinction|extinct]] within decades due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecentric.com/news/article.php?q=08082634 |title=Expedition on corals and global warming in Puerto Rico |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] - Office of University Communications |accessdate=2010-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085722/http://www.sciencecentric.com/news/article.php?q=08082634 |archivedate=August 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the coral reproduction research of Dr. Dirk Petersen at the Rotterdam Zoo (The Netherlands), SECORE was born in 2002. Petersen's findings led to innovative techniques on the use sexual coral reproduction for coral reef conservation. Established by the aquarium community and coral conservation scientists, SECORE initially focused on ex situ conservation and later as well on reef restoration (in situ conservation).

In 2004, Mike Brittsan, M.Sc., of the Columbus Zoo &amp; Aquarium joined SECORE to take over the leading role in the USA. Over the years, both institutions, the Rotterdam Zoo and the Columbus Zoo &amp; Aquarium – in collaboration with other organisations – started a very successful workshop program not only to train experts in the SECORE techniques, but also to bring different institutions together for a common goal – help saving the greatest marine ecosystem on our planet, the coral reef. SECORE supports excellent science in various fields, such as coral restoration, coral population genetics or coral cryopreservation.

Together with its more than 60 supporting partner institutions, SECORE reaches millions of people to spread the word about the dramatic situation of our ocean and what we can do about it.

'''Sary Shagan''' ({{lang-rus|Сары-Шаган}}; {{lang-kz|Сарышаған}}) is an [[anti-ballistic missile]] testing range located in [[Kazakhstan]].

On 17 August 1956 the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union]] authorized plans for an experimental facility for missile defense located at Sary Shagan, on the west bank of [[Lake Balkhash]]. The first missile launched from the facility&lt;ref name="Astronautix"&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/sites/sarhagan.htm Encyclopedia Astronautica - "Sary Shagan"]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Fakel V-1000|V-1000]] on 16 October 1958, but the facilities for full-scale testing were not ready until 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/spp/starwars/program/soviet/sary_1.htm FAS.org - "Sary Shagan General Overview"]&lt;/ref&gt; Sary Shagan remains in use to this day, with the latest known launch on September 26, 2017. Sary Shagan was a [[closed city]] until 2005.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The length of the site is 480&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| publisher = Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sary Shagan range was the intended landing site for the sample return canister of the Russian [[Phobos Grunt]] mission.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Other notable military complexes on site==
In the 1970s the [[Spetztekhnika Vympel NPO|Vympel OKB]], Geofizika, Phazotron, MNIIRE Altair, others; built the [[Terra-3]] [[laser]] testing centre at Sary Shagan.

==Radar site==
{{main|Balkhash Radar Station}} 
The Sary Shagan site has hosted a number of radar prototypes such as the Don-2NP. Also there is Balkhash-9 radar station a few km away which started in the 1960s and still functions as part of the Russian missile warning network.

===References in Fiction===
* The Sary Shagan site is one of the USSR ABM/SDI sites featured in the [[Tom Clancy]] novel [[The Cardinal of the Kremlin]].
* The site is mentioned in the manga '[[Battle Angel Alita]]' in reference to a supposedly historical weapon, a '[[scalar field]]' device called the 'Sarishagan tiger'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="795">'''Trnsko''' is a neighbourhood of [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]], located south of [[Dubrovnik Avenue]] in [[Novi Zagreb - zapad]]. The population is 5,331 (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zagreb.hr/default.aspx?id=15059|title=16. Mjesni odbor Trnsko|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trnsko was one of [[Novi Zagreb]]'s first neighbourhoods constructed in early 1960s. The streets have no names, but the orientation is easy - Trnsko 1 is on the north and Trnsko 49 on the far south of the neighbourhood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2443">The '''White Highlands''' is an area in the [[Central Province (Kenya)|central uplands]] of [[Kenya]], so-called because, during the [[British Kenya|period of British colonialism]], European or white immigrants settled there in considerable numbers. They were attracted to the good soils and growing conditions, as well as the cool climate. Many Kenyans use the rich soil to grow crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lsqjN-t6mP4C&amp;pg=PA48|title=Kenya: Identity of a Nation|last=Mwakikagile|first=Godfrey|date=2007|publisher=New Africa Press|year=|isbn=9780980258790|location=|pages=46–47|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[East Africa Protectorate]], founded in 1905, encouraged British immigration. By the time the [[Kenya Colony]] was established in 1920, about 10,000 [[British people]] had colonised the area. The colony granted settlers 999-year leases over about 25% of the good land in Kenya. The original indigenous occupants of the land were predominantly from the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]], [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Kikuyu people|Gĩkũyũ]]. Later, members of the Gĩkũyũ and other allied tribes, the [[Embu people|Embu]] and [[Wameru|Meru]] mounted a rebellion against the British control of central Kenya in the [[Mau Mau Uprising]], which was a major factor leading to the country's eventual independence in Dec. 12, 1963.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;!-- [Correction: The claim that the Mau Mau uprising led to Kenya's independence is not supported by facts. The Mau Mau were defeated in 1956. How then could a leaderless routed group then bring independence 7 years later in 1963? The fact is that Kenya's independence happened without any input from the Mau Mau]. --&gt; 

The Maasai, who are [[pastoralism|pastoralists]], found the amount of grazing land considerably reduced as the White Highlands expanded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Yāqūt Shihāb al-Dīn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=[[Bayard Dodge|Dodge]] | editor-first=Bayard | title=The Fihrist of al-Nadim | publisher=Columbia University Press | place=New York &amp; London | year=1970 | volume=2 | page=902}}&lt;/ref&gt; ibn-'Abdullāh al-Rūmī al-Hamawī''' (1179–1229) ({{lang-ar|ياقوت الحموي الرومي}}) was an [[Arab]] biographer and geographer of [[Greek people|Greek]] origin,&lt;ref&gt;David C. Conrad, ''Empires of Medieval West Africa: Ghana, Mali, and Songhay'', (Shoreline Publishing, 2005), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig W. Adamec, ''The A to Z of Islam'', (Scarecrow Press, 2009), 333.&lt;/ref&gt; renowned for his [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] writings on the [[Muslim world]]. The ''[[Nisba (onomastics)|nisba]]'' "al-Rumi" ("from [[Rûm]]") refers to his [[Greeks|Greek]] ([[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine]]) descent; "al-Hamawi" is taken after his master's name; and ibn-Abdullah is a reference to his father's name, [[Abdullah (name)|Abdullah]]. The word ''yāqūt'' means ''[[ruby]]'' or ''[[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]]''.

==Biography==
Born in [[Constantinople]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7444/ |title=The Dictionary of Countries |publisher= World Digital Library |accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yāqūt became a "[[mawla]]" (the term can mean client, apprentice or slave) of a trader named Askar ibn Abi Nasr al-Hamawi who lived in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]. His master taught him accounting and trading and sent him to trade on his behalf.

Yāqūt travelled two, or three, times to [[Kish Island|Kish]] in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;cf. F. Wüstenfeld, "[http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/titleinfo/21259 Jacut's Reisen]" in the ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'', vol xviii. pp. 397–493&lt;/ref&gt; In 1194 after a quarrel with his master deprived Yāqūt of his income he supported himself as a copier and availed of an opportunity to study under the grammarian [[Al-Ukbari|Al-‘Ukbarî]]. After five years he returned to his old master and again travelled for him to Kish; on his return he set up as a bookseller and began to write.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Yāqūt |volume=28 |page=904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yāqūt was one of the last scholars to access libraries east of the Caspian Sea before the [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia]], and spent ten years travelling in [[Iran|Persia]], [[Syria]], and [[Egypt]].  For two years he studied in the libraries of the peaceful scholarly city of ancient [[Merv]] (in present-day [[Turkmenistan]]), where he would gain much of the knowledge evident in his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bookrags.com/research/yaqut-scit-021/ |title= Homework Help, Book Summaries, Study Guides, Essays, Lesson Plans, &amp; Educational Resources |publisher= BookRags.com |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also visited the ancient city of [[Balkh]] and in about 1222 he had settled in [[Mosul]] to work on his geography.  The first draft was ready in 1224. In 1227 he had moved to [[Alexandria]], and from there on to [[Aleppo]], where he died in 1229.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In his large geography, the ''[[Mu'jam Al-Buldan|Mu'jam ul-Buldān]]'' (ed. F. Wüstenfeld, 6 vols., Leipzig, 1866–73), the places mentioned in the literature or the stories of the [[Arabs]] are given in alphabetical order, with the correct vocalization of the names, an indication whether they are Arabic or foreign and their locality. Their history is often sketched with a special account of their conquest by [[Muslim]]s and the name of the [[governor]] at the time is recorded. Attention is also given to the monuments they contain and the celebrities who were born in them or had lived there. In this way a quantity of old literature, both prose and poetry, is preserved by Yāqūt.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[File:Ängsälvor - Nils Blommér 1850.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Meadow Elves'', by [[Nils Blommér]], 1850]]

'''Alfheim''' ({{Lang-non|Álfheimr}}, "Land Of The Elves" or "Elfland"), also called '''Ljosalfheim''' (''Ljósálf[a]heimr'', "home of the [[Ljósálfar|light-elves]]"), is one of the [[Norse cosmology|Nine Worlds]] and home of the [[Elf#Old_Norse_texts|Light Elves]] in [[Norse mythology]].

==In Old Norse texts==
{{Also|Svartálfaheimr}}
Álfheim as an abode of the Elves is mentioned only twice in [[Old Norse]] texts.

The [[eddic poem]] ''[[Grímnismál]]'' describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza&amp;nbsp;5 with:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Ýdalir]] call they &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; the place where [[Ullr|Ull]]&lt;br/&gt;
A hall for himself hath set;&lt;br/&gt;
And Álfheim the gods &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; to [[Freyr|Frey]] once gave&lt;br/&gt;
As a tooth-gift in ancient times.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A tooth-gift was a gift given to an [[infant]] on the cutting of the first tooth.

In the 12th century eddic prose ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[Snorri Sturluson]] relates it as the first of a series of abodes in heaven:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That which is called Álfheim is one, where dwell the peoples called ''[[ljósálfar]]'' [Light Elves]; but the ''[[dökkálfar]]'' [Dark Elves] dwell down in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance, but by far more unlike in nature. The Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The account later, in speaking of a hall in the Highest Heaven called [[Gimlé]] that shall survive when heaven and earth have died, explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called [[Andlang]] [''Andlangr'' 'Endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called [[Vídbláin]] [''Vídbláinn'' 'Wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. But we believe that none but Light-Elves inhabit these mansions now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to Álfheim or distinct. Some texts read Vindbláin (''Vindbláinn'' 'Wind-blue') instead of Vídbláin.

Modern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that Álfheim was one of the nine worlds (''heima'') mentioned in stanza&amp;nbsp;2 of the eddic poem ''[[Völuspá]]''.
