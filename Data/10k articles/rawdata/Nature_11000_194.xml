'''Al-Hajar Mountains ''' ({{lang-ar|جِـبَـال الْـحَـجَـر|Jibāl al-Ḥajar}}, ''[[Rock (geology)|Rock]]y [[Mountain]]s'' or ''Stone Mountains'') in northeastern [[Oman]] and also the eastern [[United Arab Emirates]] are the highest [[mountain range]] in the [[eastern Arabia|eastern]] [[Arabian peninsula]]. They separate the low coastal plain of Oman from the high desert plateau, and lie {{convert|50|–|100|km|mile|abbr=on}} inland from the [[Gulf of Oman]].

"Al" ({{lang-ar|اَلْ}}) means "The", and "Ḥajar" ({{lang-ar|حَـجَـر}}) means "Stone" or "Rock". So "Al-Hajar" ({{lang-ar|اَلْـحَـجَـر}}) would be defined as "The Stone" or "The Rock".

==Geology, location and description==
[[Image:Nakhal Fort 1.jpg|thumb|The Hajar Mountains rising behind [[Nakhal Fort]]]]

Geologically, Al-Hajar Mountains are the continuation of the [[Zagros Mountains]], and were mainly formed in the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] as the Arabian Plate collided with and pushed against the Iranian Plate. These mountains are chiefly made of [[Cretaceous]] [[limestone]]s and [[ophiolite]]s.

The mountains begin in the north, forming the peninsula. The central section of the Hajar is the highest and wildest terrain in the country. Jebel Akhdar and the smaller Jebel Nakhl range are bounded on the east by the low Samail Valley (which leads northeast to [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]]). East of Samail are the Eastern Hajar (Hajar ash Sharqi), which run east (much closer to the coast) to the fishing town of [[Sur, Oman|Sur]], almost at the eastern point of Oman. The mountains extend for {{convert|500|km|mile|abbr=on}} in total. 

The low coastal land north and east of the Jebel Hajar is called "Al-Batinah Region." The climate is cool and wet from December to March, and warmer but occasionally rainy from April to September.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Flora and fauna==
The mountains are rich in [[plant]] life compared to most of Arabia, including a number of endemic species. The vegetation changes with altitude, the mountains are covered with shrubland at lower elevations, growing richer and then becoming woodland, including wild [[olive]] and [[ficus|fig]] trees between {{convert|3,630|and|8,250|ft|m|abbr=in}}, and then higher still there are [[juniper]]s. Fruit trees such as [[pomegranate]] and [[apricot]] are grown in the cooler valleys and in places there are rocky outcrops with little vegetation. The flora shows similarities with mountain areas of nearby [[Iran]], as well as with areas along the [[Red Sea]] in the [[Horn of Africa]]. For example, the tree ''[[Ceratonia]] oreothauma'' is found here and also in [[Somalia]].

A number of [[bird]]s are found in the mountains including [[Egyptian vulture|Egyptian]] and [[lappet-faced vulture]]s (''Torgos tracheliotus''). Mammals include [[mountain gazelle]]s (''Gazella gazella'') and the [[Arabian tahr]] (''Arabitragus jayakari'').&lt;ref name="TheNational2015"&gt;{{cite news |author=Hanif, N. |title=Arabian Oryx thriving at Abu Dhabi sanctuary |publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/environment/arabian-oryx-thriving-at-abu-dhabi-sanctuary-1.69958 |date=2015-02-04 |access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GulfNews2018"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Gulf News]] |title=Endangered Arabian tahr born on Sir Bani Yas Island |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/environment/endangered-arabian-tahr-born-on-sir-bani-yas-island-1.2156104 |date=2018-01-13 |access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other endemic species include a number of geckos and lizards: ''[[Asaccus]] montanus'', ''Asaccus platyrhynchus'' and a [[subspecies]] of Wadi Kharrar rock gecko (''[[Pristurus]] gasperetti gallagheri'') are found only in Oman while Musandam leaf-toed gecko (''Asaccus caudivolvulus''), Gallagher's leaf-toed gecko (''Asaccus gallagheri''), Oman rock gecko (''[[Pristurus]] celirrimus''), Jayakar lizard (''[[Lacerta]] jayakari'') and Omman's lizard  (''Lacerta cyanura'') are found only in the Hajar mountains. The endangered [[Arabian leopard]] (''Panthera pardus nimr'') had been recorded here.&lt;ref name=SpaltonHikmani06&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spalton, J. A. |author2=Al Hikmani, H. M. |year=2006 |title=The Leopard in the Arabian Peninsula – Distribution and Subspecies Status |url=http://www.yemenileopard.org/files/cms/reports/Cat_News_Special_Issue_1_-_Arabian_leopard.pdf |journal=Cat News |volume=Special Issue 1 |pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
The Hajar are extensively grazed by domestic goats, camels and donkeys and the landscape has been cleared in parts for urban areas and for mining, which has damaged both vegetation and water supplies and uprooted traditional rural land management behaviours. Poaching of wildlife is another issue. The Oman government has created the Wadi Sareen Reserve and an area of Jebel Qahwan-Jebal Sebtah in the Eastern Hajar, for the protection of Arabian tahr and mountain gazelle. For visitors, there is a road into the mountains from the town of Birkat al-Mawz (on the road to [[Nizwa]] from [[Muscat]]) and a walking route through Wadi al-Muaydin to the Saiq Plateau.

==Trekking and hiking==
There are 11 marked trails/routes of varying intensity (between Grade 1 to 3) and duration (between 1.5 hours to 18 hours) published by Ministry of Tourism, Oman along the Hajar Mountain range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trekking|url=http://www.omantourism.gov.om/wps/portal/mot/tourism/oman/home/experiences/activities/trekking/|work=website|publisher=Ministry of Tourism,Sultanate of Oman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anticyclonic rotation''' or '''circulation''' is movement in the direction opposite to the Earth's rotation.  In the attached video an example of an anticyclonic couplet to a supercell is documented.  Note that while the supercell itself is rotating in a cyclonic direction, the couplet is forced into an anticyclonic rotation due to the [[forward flank downdraft]] and [[Inflow (meteorology)|inflow]] intersecting. Antiyclones on the synoptic scale are more often associated with higher pressure in relation to low pressure cyclones.

The '''Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC)'' was set up by the [[Council of Australian Governments]] through the [[Ministerial Council on Energy]] in 2005. The AEMC was established by the  ''Australian Energy Market Commission Establishment Act 2004'' (SA),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/aemcea2004510/ Australian Energy Market Commission Establishment Act 2004]'' (SA)&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced in July 2005. The Commission consists of one full-time and two part-time Commissioners. Two Commissioners are appointed by the participating State and Territory jurisdictions and one Commissioner is appointed by the Commonwealth.

In 2008, the AEMC completed a review of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s and [[South Australia]]'s retail gas and electricity markets.&lt;ref name="repc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/01/2177099.htm?site=victoria |title=Remove electricity price controls: review |date=1 March 2008 |work=ABC Local |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=7 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aemc.gov.au/Market-Reviews/Completed/Review-of-the-Effectiveness-of-Competition-in-Electricity-and-Gas-Retail-Markets-in-South-Australia.html |title=Review of the Effectiveness of Competition in Electricity and Gas Retail Markets in South Australia |date=18 December 2008 |publisher=Australian Energy Market Commission |accessdate=7 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218145218/http://www.aemc.gov.au/Market-Reviews/Completed/Review-of-the-Effectiveness-of-Competition-in-Electricity-and-Gas-Retail-Markets-in-South-Australia.html |archivedate=18 February 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both states it was found that competition in the market was adequate for [[deregulation]]. The authority is also involved in inter-regional [[Electricity retailing|electricity price]]s and access issues.

==National Electricity Market==
{{main|National Electricity Market}}
The AEMC has two roles in relation to the National Electricity Market - as rule maker and as a provider of advice to Ministers on how best to develop energy markets over time. The AEMC actively considers market development when it considers rule change proposals, policy advice and energy market reviews. These rules are binding on the Australian energy market and enforced by the [[Australian Energy Regulator]].

==National Gas Law==
The ''National Gas (South Australia) Act 2008'' introduced the National Gas Law (NGL) which commenced in all jurisdictions except Western Australia on 1 July 2008 (replacing the Gas Pipelines Access Law). 

The National Gas Rules cover gas transmission and distribution in all participating Australian jurisdictions are developed and maintained by the AEMC. The AEMC is responsible for rule making, market development and policy advice concerning access to natural gas pipelines services and elements of the broader natural gas markets. This is narrower in scope than for the National Electricity Market.

==AEMC Commissioners==
Since its establishment in 2005, the AEMC Commissioners have been:

* John Tamblyn - Chairman and Commissioner (2005-2010)
* Ian Woodward - Commissioner; Chairman of AEMC Audit Committee; Chair Reliability Panel (2005 - 2010)
* Liza Carver - Commissioner (2005 - 2008)
* John Ryan - Acting Commissioner (2008 - 2009)
* Neville Henderson (2010-2018)

The current Commissioners are:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.aemc.gov.au/About-Us/About-the-AEMC/Chair-comissioners|publisher=Australian Energy Market Commission|title=Chair and Commissioners|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620024847/http://aemc.gov.au/About-Us/About-the-AEMC/Chair-comissioners|archivedate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''water bodies of [[Azerbaijan]]''' were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period. This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers ([[canals]]) and [[pond]]s are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems.

The [[hydrography]] of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the [[Caspian Sea basin]].&lt;ref name="landcomm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inland waters |url=http://www.dtxk.gov.az/azerbaijan/nature/nature08_e.html |publisher=[[State Land and Cartography Committee (Azerbaijan)]] |accessdate=11 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182957/http://www.dtxk.gov.az/azerbaijan/nature/nature08_e.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivers==

Rivers form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan. There are 8,359 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Of them 8,188 rivers are less than {{convert|25|km|mi}} long. Only 24 rivers are over {{convert|100|km|mi}} long. 

The largest rivers that flow through the country are:&lt;ref name="minecol"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rivers, Lakes and Reservoirs of Azerbaijan Republic|url=http://www.eco.gov.az/en/hid-chay-gol-suanbar.php|publisher=[[Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (Azerbaijan)]]|accessdate=11 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702101035/http://www.eco.gov.az/en/hid-chay-gol-suanbar.php|archivedate=2 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===River system===
The rivers in Azerbaijan can be divided into three groups:&lt;ref name="landcomm"/&gt;
#The Kur basin rivers (Qanix, Qabirri, Turyan, Agstafa, Shekir, Terter, Khachin, etc.)
#The Araz basin rivers (Arpachay, Nakhchivan, Okhchu, Hekeri, Kondelenchay, etc.)
#Rivers, flowing directly into the Caspian Sea (Samur, Gudyal, Velvele, Vilesh, Lenkeran, etc.)

Azerbaijan river systems are changing and evolving under the influence of various physiographic factors:&lt;ref name="landcomm"/&gt; climate, landscape, geological structure, soil and vegetation. 
The density of the river network increases, then gradually decreases later with higher altitudes. Except for the Talysh region (1.6-2.2 km/km²), the river system density is the highest (1-2 km/km²) at 1,000-2,500 kilometers, while in the area of the Talysh mountains it peaks at 1.6-2.2 km/km² at 500-1,000 km. The average density of the river system of Azerbaijan is 0.39 km/km². The density is even lower than 0.05 km/km² in the plains.

===Kura and Aras===
{{main|Kura (Caspian Sea)|l1=Kura River|Aras River}}
The Kur and Aras are the longest rivers in Azerbaijan. They run through the [[Kur-Araz Lowland]]. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the [[Greater Caucasus]] and [[Talysh Mountains]] and run along the Samur-Devechi and Lenkeran lowlands.

The Kura River basin area (86,000 km²) up to the junction with the Aras River is smaller than the Aras water basin (101,937 km²). The river is still called Kura on the junction because the water level of the Kura is twice as high as that of the Aras River.

Over 60 water reservoirs have been constructed in order to regulate the river flow in Azerbaijan. The formation of these reservoirs is one of the measures that has been undertaken in order to ration the utilization of water and energy resources. 

The largest water reservoirs are:
* [[Agstafachay reservoir|Agstafachay]]
* [[Araz reservoir|Araz]] 
* [[Jeyranbatan reservoir|Jeyranbatan]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">The term '''building engineering physics''' was introduced in a report released in January 2010 commissioned by The Royal Academy of Engineering. The report, entitled ''Engineering a Low Carbon Built Environment: The Discipline of Building Engineering Physics'',  presents the initiative of many at the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] in developing a field that addresses our [[fossil fuel]] dependence while working towards a more sustainably built environment for the future.

The field of building engineering physics combines the existing professions of building services engineering, [[applied physics]] and building construction engineering into a single field designed to investigate the energy efficiency of old and new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;King p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of building engineering physics allows the construction and renovation of high performance, energy efficient buildings, while minimizing their environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

Building engineering physics addresses several different areas in building performance including: air movement, thermal performance, control of moisture, ambient energy, acoustics, light, climate and biology.&lt;ref&gt;King pp. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt; This field employs creative ways of manipulating these principal aspects of a building’s indoor and outdoor environments so that a more eco-friendly standard of living is obtained. Building engineering physics is unique from other established applied sciences or engineering professions as it combines the sciences of architecture, engineering and human biology and physiology. Building engineering physics not only addresses energy efficiency and building sustainability, but also a building's internal environment conditions that affect the comfort and performance levels of its occupants.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, a large percentage of buildings were constructed completely dependent on fossil fuels. Rather than focusing on energy efficiency, architects and engineers were more concerned with experimenting with “new materials and structural forms” to further aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the 21st century, building energy performance standards are pushing towards a zero carbon standard in old and new buildings alike. The threat of global change and the need for energy independence and sustainability has prompted governments across the globe to adopt firm carbon reducing standards.  A significant way to meet these stringent standards is in the construction of buildings that minimize environmental impacts, as well as the refurbishing of older buildings to meet carbon emission standards.  The application of building engineering physics can aid in this transition to reduce energy dependent buildings, provide for the demands of a growing population and better standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in the application of this field is due in large part to the'' introduction of regulations requiring the calculation of carbon emissions to demonstrate compliance, principally the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)''.&lt;ref&gt;King p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the discipline of building engineering physics is severely impaired by lack of diverse education in the construction industry. Very few in the construction industry know how to apply the principles of building engineering physics and do not have interdisciplinary experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton&lt;/ref&gt;

== General ==
Carbon dioxide removal is different from reducing emissions, as the former produces an outlet of carbon dioxide from [[Earth's atmosphere]], whereas the latter decreases the inlet of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|carbon dioxide to the atmosphere]]. Both have the same net effect, but for achieving carbon dioxide concentration levels below present levels,  carbon dioxide removal is critical. Also for meeting higher concentration levels, carbon dioxide removal is  increasingly considered to be crucial as it provides the only possibility to fill the gap between needed reductions to meet [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation targets]] and [[:File:Global Warming Observed CO2 Emissions from fossil fuel burning vs IPCC scenarios.jpg|global emission trends]].

In the ''[[OECD]] Environmental Outlook to 2050'' released at the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], the authors commented on the need for negative emissions, stating "Achieving lower concentration targets (450 ppm) depends significantly on the use of [[BECCS]]".

A [[carbon dioxide sink]] such as a concentrated group of plants or any other primary producer that binds [[carbon dioxide]] into biomass, such as within forests and [[kelp bed]]s, is not carbon negative, as sinks are not permanent. A carbon dioxide sink of this type moves [[carbon]], in the form of carbon dioxide, from the atmosphere or hydrosphere to the biosphere. This process could be undone, for example by [[wildfire]]s or [[logging]].

Carbon dioxide sinks that store carbon dioxide in the Earth's crust by [[Geologic sequestration of CO2|injecting it into the subsurface]], or in the form of insoluble [[carbonate]] salts ([[Carbon capture and storage#Mineral storage|mineral sequestration]]), are considered carbon negative. This is because they are removing carbon from the atmosphere and [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering]] it indefinitely and presumably for a considerable duration (thousands to millions of years). However, Carbon Capture technology remains, at best, theoretical and is yet to reach more than 33% efficiency. Furthermore, this process could be rapidly undone, for example by [[earthquake]]s or [[mining]].

==Methods==

===Bio-energy with carbon capture &amp; storage===
{{Main|Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage}}
Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, uses biomass to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and carbon capture and storage technologies to concentrate and permanently store it in deep geological formations.

BECCS is currently (as of October 2012) the only CDR technology deployed at full industrial scale, with 550 000 tonnes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/year in total capacity operating, divided between three different facilities (as of January 2012).&lt;ref name="Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010"&gt;{{cite web

According to the [[OECD]], "Achieving lower concentration targets (450 ppm) depends significantly on the use of [[BECCS]]".&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/env/cc/49082173.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526212849/http://www.oecd.org/env/cc/49082173.pdf|date=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biochar===
{{Main|Biochar}}

[[Biochar]] is created by the [[pyrolysis]] of [[biomass]], and is under investigation as a method of [[carbon sequestration]].
[[Biochar]] is a charcoal that is used for agricultural purposes which also aids in [[carbon sequestration]], the capture or hold of carbon.  It is created using a process called pyrolysis, which is basically the act of high temperature heating biomass in an environment with low oxygen levels.  What remains is a material known as char, similar to charcoal but is made through a sustainable process, thus the use of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is biochar?|url=http://www.biochar.ac.uk/what_is_biochar.php|website=UK Biochar research center|publisher=University of Edinburgh Kings Buildings Edinburgh|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomass is organic matter produced by living organisms or recently living organisms, most commonly plants or plant based material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Biomass?|url=http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&amp;_dad=portal|website=Biomass Energy Center|publisher=Direct.gov.uk|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offset of GHG emission, if biochar were to be implemented, would be a maximum of 12%.  This equates to about 106 metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents.  On a medium conservative level, it would be 23% less than that, at  82 metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate change and Biochar|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/biochar/carbon|website=International Biochar Initiative|publisher=International Biochar Initiative|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study done by the UK Biochar Research Center has stated that, on a conservative level, biochar can store 1 gigaton of carbon per year.  With greater effort in marketing and acceptance of biochar, the benefit could be the storage of 5–9 gigatons per year of carbon in biochar soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ierm.ed.ac.uk/homes/sshackle/WP2.pdf|title=Biochar reducing and removing CO2 while improving soils: A significant sustainable response to climate change|website=UKBRC|publisher=UK Biochar research Center|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enhanced weathering===
{{Main|Enhanced weathering}}
Enhanced weathering is a chemical approach to remove carbon dioxide involving land- or ocean-based techniques. One example of a land-based enhanced weathering technique is in-situ carbonation of silicates. [[Ultramafic rock]], for example, has the potential to store from hundreds to thousands of years' worth of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, according to estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/03/09/09greenwire-maps-show-rocks-ideal-for-sequestering-carbon-10041.html|title=Maps show rocks ideal for sequestering carbon - NYTimes.com|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=U.S. Department of the Interior|first=|date=|title=Mapping the Mineral Resource Base for Mineral Carbon-Dioxide Sequestration in the Conterminous United States|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/414/downloads/DS414_text_508.pdf|journal=U.S. Geological Survey|volume=Data Series 414|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ocean-based techniques involve alkalinity enhancement, such as grinding, dispersing, and dissolving olivine, limestone, silicates, or calcium hydroxide to address ocean acidification and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration. Enhanced weathering is considered one of the least expensive geoengineering options. One example of a research project on the feasibility of enhanced weathering is the [[CarbFix]] project in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/projects/carbfix-sulfix-project|title=CarbFix Project {{!}} Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute|website=www.globalccsinstitute.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.or.is/english/carbfix/carbfix-project|title=The CarbFix Project|date=2017-08-22|work=www.or.is|access-date=2018-05-15|language=is}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/science/burying-a-mountain-of-co2.html|title=Turning Carbon Dioxide Into Rock, and Burying It|date=2015-02-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct air capture (DAC)===
Carbon dioxide can be removed from ambient air through chemical processes, sequestered, and stored. Traditional modes of carbon capture such as precombustion and postcombustion {{co2}} capture from large point sources can help slow the rate of increase of the atmospheric
{{co2}} concentration, but only the direct removal of {{co2}} from the air, or “direct air capture” (DAC), can actually reduce the global atmospheric {{co2}} concentration if combined with long-term storage of {{co2}}.

A few engineering proposals have been made for removing {{co2}} from the atmosphere, but work in this area is still in its infancy.

and organic−inorganic hybrid sorbents consisting of amines supported in porous [[adsorbents]]. A 2016 article reviews the research in these various areas.&lt;ref name="ReviewDAC2016" /&gt;

One proposed method is by so-called ''artificial trees''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.livescience.com/technology/070501_carbon_capture.html|title=New Device Vacuums Away Carbon Dioxide|publisher= LiveScience|date=2007-05-01|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/31/carbonemissions.climatechange|title=Could US scientist's 'CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catcher' help to slow warming? &amp;#124; Environment|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-10-29|location=London|first=David|last=Adam|date=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept, proposed by climate scientist [[Wallace S.

Retrieved November 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would be captured in a filter and then removed from the filter and stored.

The chemistry used is a variant of that described [[#Example CO2 scrubbing chemistry|below]], as it is based on [[sodium hydroxide]]. However, in a more recent design proposed by [[Klaus Lackner]], the process can be carried out at only 40&amp;nbsp;°C by using a [[polymer]]-based [[ion exchange resin]], which takes advantage of changes in [[humidity]] to prompt the release of captured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, instead of using a kiln. This reduces the energy required to operate the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.columbia.edu/?id=research_carbon_capture#air |title=Lenfest Center for Sustainable Energy |publisher=Energy.columbia.edu |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another substance which can be used are [[Metal-organic framework]]s (or MOF's).&lt;ref&gt;[https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2015/03/17/a-better-way-of-scrubbing-co2/ Scrubbing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with MOFs]&lt;/ref&gt; A special MOF has been made specifically for locking CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by Joeri Denayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weareparis.be/algemeen/vub-prof-joeri-denayer-stopt-de-opwarming-van-de-aarde-in-canvas-wetenschapsprogramma Wetenschap redt de wereld docu on Joeri Denayer's MOFs]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Discovery Channel]] covered&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/project-earth/explores/carbon.html – Discovery Channel, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119022725/http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/project-earth/explores/carbon.html |date=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the work of [[David Keith (scientist)|David Keith]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~keith/AirCapture.html – David Keith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201014040/http://www.ucalgary.ca/~keith/AirCapture.html |date=February 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[University of Calgary]], who built a tower, 4 feet wide and 20 feet tall (1.2×6.1 meters), with a fan at the bottom that sucks air in, which comes out again at the top. In the process, about half the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is removed from the air.

This device uses the chemical process described in detail [[Carbon dioxide removal#Example CO2 scrubbing chemistry|below]]. The system demonstrated on the Discovery Channel was a 1/90,000th scale test system of the capture section; the reagents are regenerated in a separate facility. The main costs of a full plant will be the cost to build it, and the energy input to regenerate the chemicals and produce a pure stream of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

To put this into perspective, people in the U.S. emit about 20 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per person annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita|title=Carbon emissions per person, by country|last=Vaughan|first=Adam|date=2009-09-02|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, each person in the U.S. would require a tower like the one featured by the Discovery Channel to remove this amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air, requiring an annual 2 megawatt-hours of electricity to operate it. By comparison, a refrigerator consumes about 1.2 megawatt-hours annually (2001 figures). A modern, A++ rated refrigerator uses about 140 Kwh annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/recs/recs2001/enduse2001/enduse2001.html|title=End-Use Consumption of Electricity by End Use and Appliance|publisher= Eia.doe.gov|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, by combining many small systems such as this into one large system, the construction costs and energy use can be reduced.

It has been proposed that the [[Solar updraft tower]] to generate electricity from thermal air currents also be used at the same time for amine gravity scrubbing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC0410/S00063.htm The Methane Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; Some heat would be required to regenerate the amine.

A similar CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scrubber has also been built by [[Carbon Engineering]]. Besides simply focusing on capturing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the company also puts emphasis on reuse of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for example in the production of fuels, which would thus be [[zero emissions|carbon-neutral]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/hilarybrueck/2015/07/24/this-company-wants-to-recycle-carbon-dioxide-from-the-atmosphere/ Forbes on Carbon Engineering's carbon scrubber]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carbonengineering.com/our-technology/ More info on the co2 scrubber]&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct air capture has been proposed as a way of generating carbon-neutral organic chemicals, by harvesting the atmospheric compounds and then using them in the production and synthesis of polymers and fuels.

The Swiss-based Climeworks built the first industrial scale direct air capturing plant in [[Hinwil]], in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. It started up in May 2017,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-carbon/from-thin-air-to-stone-greenhouse-gas-test-starts-in-iceland-idUSKBN1CG2D4|title=From thin air to stone: greenhouse gas test starts in Iceland|last=Doyle|first=Alister|date=2017-10-11|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could scrub up to 900 metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year using heat from a local waste incineration plant. The CO2 was then pumped into local [[greenhouse]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, where it was used to help grow vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/3052554/the-worlds-first-commercial-carbon-capture-plant-will-turn-pollution-into-cash?partner=rss|title=The World's First Commercial Carbon Capture Plant Will Turn Pollution Into Cash|date=2015-10-22|newspaper=Co.Exist|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-41816332|title=Climate's magic rabbit: Pulling CO2 out of thin air|last=McGrath|first=Matt|date=2017-11-15|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climeworks and [[Orkuveita Reykjavíkur|Reykjavik Energy]] also started up a small test direct air capturing plant in [[Hellisheiði Power Station|Hellisheidi]], Iceland in October 2017. Using waste heat from a local geothermal power plant, the test plant captured up to 50 tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year which was bound with water and injected over 700 metres underground into basaltic bedrock.  The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacted with the basalt to form solid carbonate minerals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.powermag.com/test-of-carbon-capture-technology-underway-at-iceland-geothermal-plant/?mypower|title=Test of Carbon Capture Technology Underway at Iceland Geothermal Plant|last=Prroctor|first=Daryll|date=2017-12-01|work=POWER Magazine|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean fertilization===
{{Main|Ocean fertilization}}

Ocean fertilization or ocean nourishment is a type of climate engineering based on the purposeful introduction of nutrients to the upper ocean to increase marine food production and to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A number of techniques, including fertilization by iron, urea and phosphorus have been proposed.

=== Wooden building construction ===

In their "roadmap for rapid decarbonization", Rockström et al. (2017) proposed in the journal [[Science]] that "[a]fter 2030, all building construction must be carbon-neutral or carbon-negative. The construction industry must either use emissions-free concrete and steel or replace those materials with zero- or negative-emissions substances such as wood, stone, and carbon fiber.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Rockström]], [[Owen Gaffney]], [[Joeri Rogelj]], [[Malte Meinshausen]], [[Nebojsa Nakicenovic]] and [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]] (2017): "A roadmap for rapid decarbonization." Science 355, no. 6331, pp. 1269-1271.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially wooden building constructions are a promising way to store emissions, as wood mainly contains carbon, grows faster due to the higher CO2 concentration and is established as a building material for several centuries. Projects like [[W350]] in Tokyo demonstrate that even skyscrapers could potentially be built from wood and, thus, store large amounts of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/20/worlds-tallest-wooden-skyscraper-japan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scrubbing chemistry==
{{Main|Carbon dioxide scrubber}}

===Calcium oxide===
[[Calcium oxide]] (quicklime) will absorb CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from [[Atmosphere|atmospheric air]] mixed with [[steam]] at 400&amp;nbsp;°C (forming [[calcium carbonate]]) and release it at 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C. This process, proposed by [[A. Steinfeld]], can be performed using [[renewable energy]] from thermal [[concentrated solar power]].&lt;ref name="newscientist1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126901.200-can-technology-clear-the-air.html?full=true|title=Can technology clear the air? |publisher=[[New Scientist]]|date=2009-01-12|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Quicklime is made by heating limestone to release the {{CO2}} within it.
Quicklime is mixed with sand for brick building as mortar, where it hardens by  absorption of {{CO2}}.

===Sodium hydroxide===
Zeman and Lackner outlined a specific method of air capture using [[Carbon dioxide scrubber#Potassium hydroxide|sodium hydroxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zeman, F.S. |author2=Lackner, K.S. |title=Capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere |journal=World Resour. Rev. |volume=16 |pages=157–72 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon Engineering, a Calgary, Alberta firm founded in 2009 and partially funded by [[Bill Gates]], is developing a process to capture carbon dioxide using a solution of potassium hydroxide mixed with some water at their [[pilot plant]]. They hope to create and sell synthetic fuels at a cost of $100 a ton.&lt;ref name=NYT01513&gt;{{cite news|title=Pulling Carbon Dioxide Out of Thin Air|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/business/pilot-plant-in-the-works-for-carbon-dioxide-cleansing.html|accessdate=January 8, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 5, 2013|author=Anne Eisenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Direct air capture (DAC) process example using NaOH ==
{{see also|carbon dioxide scrubber}}
[[File:Direct Air Capture Process Flow Diagram using Caustic Soda.png|thumb|600px|Main steps in a DCA process that uses NaOH ([[caustic soda]]) as the absorber.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeman|first=Frank|date=2007-11-01|title=Energy and Material Balance of CO2 Capture from Ambient Air|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=41|issue=21|pages=7558–63|doi=10.1021/es070874m|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Among the technologies studied for direct air capture (DAC), the use of [[carbon dioxide scrubber#Sodium Hydroxide|aqueous hydroxide sorbents]] is one of the most promising approaches.&lt;ref name="ReviewDAC2016"/&gt;
In this process, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air is chemically dissolved into NaOH(aq) solution as Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; the Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is then reacted with solid Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which regenerates the solvent and produces CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals; lastly, heat is applied to the CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals to produce pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Air is pumped through the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorber as the first step of this process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration, Vol 1|last=Berend Smit, Jeffrey A. Reimer, Curtis M. Oldenburg and Ian C. Bourg|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorber for DAC are designed either as a [[Countercurrent exchange|counter-current]] [[spray tower]] or as a counter-current [[Falling-film column|thin-falling-film contractor]] to maximize the contact area between the air and the solvent and thus maximize the absorption driving force.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The solvent is regenerated in the causticization unit by reacting the Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which also transfers the captured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the form of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solid crystals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A mechanical filter is then used to separate the CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals from the water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Since the crystals come out wet from the filter, they are dried in a steam dryer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Then the dry crystals are heated in a furnace to produce CaO and pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The CaO is then hydrated to regenerate the Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; used for the causticization reaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stream is then compressed and ready to be transported for geologic sequestration, [[Enhanced oil recovery|EOR]], or other commercial applications.

1 M NaOH (aq) is a typical solvent concentration because this concentrations is limited by the causticization reaction that regenerates the solvent it is not too far from the practical maximum of 2 M NaOH.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The furnace/kiln can be powered renewably or by burning fuel on-site with pure oxygen produces in an on-site air separation unit.

NaOH is economically competitive with other absorbents (e.g. Amines) used for DAC processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
DAC processes are energy intensive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Calcination (at the furnace) is the most energy intensive step of this process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Economic issues==
A crucial issue for CDR methods is their cost, which differs substantially among the different technologies: some of these are not sufficiently developed to perform cost assessments. In 2011 the [[American Physical Society]] estimated the costs for direct air capture to be $600/tonne with optimistic assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;PageID=244407|title=Direct Air Capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Chemicals|publisher=[[The American Physical Society]]|date=2011-06-01|accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 study found this estimate lowered to between $94 and $232 per tonne.&lt;ref name="KeithHolmes2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=David W.|last2=Holmes|first2=Geoffrey|last3=St. Angelo|first3=David|last4=Heidel|first4=Kenton|title=A Process for Capturing CO2 from the Atmosphere|journal=Joule|year=2018|doi=10.1016/j.joule.2018.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carbonengineering.com/climate-change-breakthrough/|title= Climate Change Breakthrough: Large-scale capture of atmospheric CO₂ shown to be feasible and affordable|date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme and [[Ecofys]] provides an estimate that 3.5 billion tonnes could be removed annually from the atmosphere with [[BECCS]] (Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage) at carbon prices as low as €50 per tonne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eenews.net/assets/2011/08/04/document_cw_01.pdf|title= Potential for Biomass and Carbon Capture and Storage|publisher=IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme|date=2011-07-06|accessdate= 2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a report from [[Biorecro]] and the [[Carbon capture and storage (timeline)#Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute|Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute]] estimates costs "below €100" per tonne for large scale BECCS deployment.&lt;ref name=GCCSI /&gt;

==Risks, problems and criticisms==
CDR is slow to act, and requires a long-term political and engineering program to effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cao | first1 = L. | last2 = Caldeira | first2 = K. | doi = 10.1088/1748-9326/5/2/024011 | title = Atmospheric carbon dioxide removal: Long-term consequences and commitment | journal = Environmental Research Letters | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 024011 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; CDR is even slower to take effect on [[Ocean acidification|acidified oceans]]. In a ''Business as usual'' [[Representative Concentration Pathways|concentration pathway]], the deep ocean will remain acidified for centuries, and as a consequence many marine species are in danger of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nclimate2729|title=Long-term response of oceans to CO2 removal from the atmosphere|journal=Nature Climate Change|year=2015|last1=Mathesius|first1=Sabine|last2=Hofmann|first2=Matthias|last3=Caldeira|first3=Ken|last4=Schellnhuber|first4=Hans Joachim|volume=5|issue=12|pages=1107–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">The '''China Energy Label''' ('''CEL''') is an energy consumption label for products in China, similar to the [[European Union energy label]]. Manufacturers of specified [[Consumer electronics|electronic devices]] are obligated to attach a CEL label to their goods to inform China-based consumers of the product’s [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The label includes the product’s energy efficiency class (1-5) as well as information regarding its energy consumption.

== Targets ==
The CEL shows the level of energy consumption and, thus, the energy efficiency of a product. The CEL aims to encourage customers to buy energy efficient products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cqc.com.cn/cms/cms/infopub/infopre.jsp?pubtype=D&amp;pubpath=en&amp;infoid=1312736507034722&amp;templetid=1251363613119632&amp;channelcode=A02310202" |publisher=China Quality Certification Center |title=Catalogue of CCC Certification |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target to increase energy efficiency and the acceptance of Chinese consumers towards energy efficient products is highly important, since China is the world's largest energy consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energylabel.gov.cn/en/Introduction/ChinaEnergyLabel/index.html |publisher=China Energy Label Center |title=About the "Background and Significance of the China Energy Label" Program|deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsible authority==
Applications are to be filed at the China Energy Label Center (CELC), which is the main authority for CEL-classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energylabel.gov.cn/en//KeyProgramsandProjects/LeadList/detail/736.html |publisher=China Energy Label Center |title=About the "China National Lead List of Excellent Enterprises and Energy-saving Products" Program|deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products requiring CEL ==
Since the introduction of China Energy Label in 2005, more than 25 product groups have become CEL-mandatory, while additional classes continually being added to the product catalogue. For every product that requires CEL, a [[GB standards|GB-Standard]] has been implemented.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energylabel.gov.cn/en/EnergyEfficiencyStandards/index.html |publisher=China Energy Label Center |title=About the "Energy Effciency Standards" Program|deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the CEL mandatory products are:
* Motors
* Air conditioners
* Refrigerators
* Washing machines
* Gas kettles
* Water kettles
* Photocopiers
* Air compressors
* Flat-screen televisions
* Fluorescent tube&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[File:Arctic Ocean bathymetric features.png|thumb|350px|Location of the Chukchi Plateau in the Arctic Ocean]]
The '''Chukchi Plateau''' or '''Chukchi Cap''' is a large subsea formation extending north from the [[Alaskan]] margin into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The ridge is normally covered by ice year-round, and reaches an approximate [[bathymetric]] [[prominence]] of 3,400&amp;nbsp;m with its highest point at 246&amp;nbsp;m below sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|title=U.S. Law of the Sea cruise to map and sample the US Arctic Ocean margin|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/HEALY1202_FINAL_CRUISE%20REPORT.pdf|work=Center For Ocean and Coastal Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center, University of New Hampshire|accessdate=November 21, 2013|author2=Andrew Armstrong|page=4|date=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a subsea ridge extending from the [[continental shelf of the United States]] north of Alaska, the Chukchi Plateau is an important feature in [[maritime law]] of the Arctic Ocean and has been the subject of significant geographic research. The ridge has been extensively mapped by the [[USCGC Healy|USCGC ''Healy'']], and by the Canadian icebreaker [[CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent|CCGS ''Louis S. St-Laurent'']] (with the ''Healy'') in 2011 and [[RV Marcus Langseth|RV ''Marcus Langseth'']], a [[National Science Foundation]] vessel operated by the [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] of [[Columbia University]].

The geologic history of Arctic Ocean basins is a major source of debate among marine geophysicists. The difficulties associated with collecting marine geologic and geophysical data in this remote region has added to the debate on the tectonic history of the Arctic Ocean and the formation of its bathymetric features.

The Chukchi Borderland, which comprises the subsea region north of the Alaskan coast as well as the bathymetric highs of the Chukchi Plateau and the adjacent Northwind Ridge, is a continental fragment that is thought to have drifted from the Canadian [[continental margin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agu.org/books/gd/v006/GD006p0045/GD006p0045.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The geomorphology of the region is defined by north-south trending [[normal fault]]ing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=John K.|title=The Arctic Ocean Region|year=1990|publisher=The Geology of North America|pages=337–50|editors=Grantz, Johnson, Sweeney|chapter=Chapter 19: The Chukchi Borderland}}&lt;/ref&gt; –tectonic activity typical of [[continental rifting]].

Although there is no consensus as to the pre-rift location of the Chukchi Borderland, its tectonic migration could be attributed to an inferred [[spreading center]] indicated by a linear gravity low in the [[Canada Basin]] {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Sediments transported from the [[Mackenzie River]] Delta would have buried the spreading center. The Chukchi Plateau, which could have been connected to Canada in the vicinity of [[Ellesmere Island]], would have rifted along the spreading center to its current location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grantz|first=A.|title=Phanerozoic stratigraphy of Northwind Ridge, magnetic anomalies in the Canada basin, and the geometry and timing of rifting in the Amerasia Basin, Arctic Ocean|journal=GSA Bulletin|year=1998|volume=110|issue=6|pages=801–20|bibcode=1998GSAB..110..801G|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1998)110&lt;0801:PSONRM&gt;2.3.CO;2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A competing hypothesis suggests that the Chukchi Plateau may have once been attached to the Siberian shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawver|first=L.A.|title=Palaeogeographic and tectonic evolution of the Arctic Ocean during the Palaeozoic|journal=Geological Society of London Memoir|year=2011|volume=35|pages=61–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law of the sea implications ==

[[File:UNCLOS extension.png|thumb|left|The Hedberg and Gardiner Lines]]
Under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], party states may submit claims to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf to extend its continental shelf beyond the 200-mile buffer that comprises a state’s [[exclusive economic zone]].&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/HEALY1202_FINAL_CRUISE%20REPORT.pdf|accessdate=November 21, 2013|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires that the proposed extension be a [[natural prolongation]] of the state’s continental shelf, which can be concluded through bathymetric mapping and analysis. If a state can prove that a subsea formation is a natural prolongation of its continental shelf, it must consequently locate the foot of the slope, the physical boundary between the natural prolongation and the [[abyssal plain]] of the ocean basin. The foot of the slope is then applied to two equations that inform the claim made by a state for the legal extension of its continental shelf.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;

The first equation calculates the Hedberg Line, which is derived by adding 60 nautical miles to the foot of the slope of the natural prolongation. The second yields the Gardiner Line, which refers to the point at which the measurement of subsea sediment thickness is 1% of the distance back to the foot of the slope. The two formulae for deriving these values can be substituted in order to form a composite continental shelf for a coastal state that yields the most advantageous possible maritime territory extension.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;

The [[United States]] has not ratified UNCLOS, although there is a concerted, bipartisan effort in [[United States Congress|Congress]] and among the various branches of the [[United States Military]] to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patrick|first=Stewart|title=(Almost) Everyone Agrees: The U.S. Should Ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/-almost-everyone-agrees-the-us-should-ratify-the-law-of-the-sea-treaty/258301/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=November 22, 2013|date=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] also supports ratification of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Strategy for the Arctic Region|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/nat_arctic_strategy.pdf|work=The White House|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the United States were to accede to UNCLOS, they would accrue the exclusive rights to exploit the natural resources on and under the continental shelf.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Betsy|title=The Arctic Continental Shelf: Science &amp; Law in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=minahT-ARBA|work=Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Alaska–Anchorage|accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some potentially extractable resources include manganese and metallic sulfides, oil, gas and gas hydrates, and sedentary species such as mollusks and clams.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

== USCGC ''Healy'' expeditions ==

[[File:Healy Icebreaker 744.jpg|thumb|[[USCGC Healy|USCGC ''Healy'']]]] 
Since 2003, [[USCGC Healy|USCGC ''Healy'']] has undertaken eight expeditions to the [[Chukchi Sea]] with researchers from the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center at the [[University of New Hampshire]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law of the Sea|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/theme/law-sea|work=Center for Ocean and Coastal Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center, University of New Hampshire|accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cruises investigated the bathymetry of the Chukchi Borderlands in order to inform discourse involving the potential ratification of UNCLOS by the U.S.

The latest cruise (HEALY-1202), lasting from 25 August to 27 September 2012, traversed 11,965&amp;nbsp;km of the Arctic Ocean and mapped about 68,600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the seafloor. The ''Healy'' was equipped with multi-beam sonar devices and seismic measurement devices, and was manned by a 34-person scientific party and around 100 [[US Coast Guard]]smen. The expedition collected 10,030&amp;nbsp;km (5,416&amp;nbsp;nm) of multi-beam sonar data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|title=U.S. Law of the Sea Cruise to map and sample the US Arctic Ocean margin|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/HEALY1202_FINAL_CRUISE%20REPORT.pdf|work=Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center, University of New Hampshire|accessdate=November 21, 2013|author2=Andrew Armstrong|page=24|date=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; HEALY-1202 began in [[Barrow, Alaska]], reached a northernmost point of 83°&amp;nbsp;32’&amp;nbsp;N, 162°&amp;nbsp;36’&amp;nbsp;W, and culminated in [[Dutch Harbor, Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|title=U.S. Law of the Sea cruise to map and sample the US Arctic Ocean margin|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/HEALY1202_FINAL_CRUISE%20REPORT.pdf|work=Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center, University of New Hampshire|accessdate=November 21, 2013|author2=Andrew Armstrong|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the ''Healy'' cruises, the foot of the slope of the US continental shelf was believed to lie at the margin of the Chukchi Plateau. The cruises revealed that the foot of the slope was significantly further north at 81° 15’ N and a depth of approximately 3,800&amp;nbsp;m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|title=U.S. Law of the Sea Cruise to map and sample the US Arctic Ocean margin|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/HEALY1202_FINAL_CRUISE%20REPORT.pdf|work=Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center, University of New Hampshire|accessdate=November 21, 2013|author2=Andrew Armstrong|page=8|date=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;–the boundary of the Northern Chukchi Borderland with the Nautilus Basin.&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

In 2011 scientists aboard sea vessel, [[RV Marcus G. Langseth|''Marcus G. Langseth'']], ran tests to increase understanding of the geology, structure and history of the continental shelves running underwater off Asia and North America, and the Chukchi Borderland, an adjoining region of dramatic deep-sea plateaus and ridges some 800 miles from the North Pole. One test includes sending sound pulses to the seabed and reading the echoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/09/14/exploring-an-unknown-arctic-seabottom-no-ice-included/ blogs.ei.columbia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''cirque glacier'' is formed in a [[cirque]], a bowl-shaped depression on the side of or near mountains. Snow and ice accumulation in corries often occurs as the result of [[avalanche|avalanching]] from higher surrounding slopes.
If a cirque glacier advances far enough, it may become a valley glacier. Additionally, if a valley glacier retreats enough that it is within the cirque, it becomes a cirque glacier again.

In these depressions, [[snow]] persists through summer months, and becomes [[glacier]] ice.  Snow may be situated on the [[leeward]] slope of a mountain, where it is sheltered from wind.  Rock fall from above slopes also plays an important role in sheltering the snow and ice from sunlight. If enough rock falls onto the glacier, it may become a [[rock glacier]].

[[Randkluft]]s may form beneath corrie glaciers as open space between the ice and the bedrock, where meltwater can play a role in [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] of the rock.

[[File:Cuba The Great War.jpg|242px|thumb|right|Cuba (yellow) in the Greater Antilles during World War 1.]]
The [[Republic of Cuba]] had maintained neutrality during much of [[World War I]]. However this changed in 1917, after German submarine warfare resumed on February 1, 1917. On April 7, 1917, one day after the [[United States of America]] entered the war, '''Cuba declares war on Germany''' and began to support the Allied war effort. Cuba also declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]] later in the year on December 16.

A draft law was enacted and 25,000 soldiers were ready for shipment to [[France]] when the armistice intervened. A hospital unit of 100 Cuban doctors and nurses was equipped and sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)]].

==Background==
[[Mario Garcia Menocal]] (December 17, 1866 - September 7, 1941) served as [[President of Cuba]] from 1913 until 1921. Supported by the USA and an economic boom, he maintained his office when World War I broke out. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the USA entered the war on April 6, 1917. With strong ties to its neighbours and put under preassure by New York Times reports of German [[U-boats]] resupplying in Cuba, the later followed suit an declared war on April 7.

==Entering World War I==
[[File:Cuba declares war on Germany.jpg|217px|thumb|left|The Arizona Daily Star - Cuba declares war on Germany on Friday 7 April 1917.]]

[[File:Cuba declaration war original 1917.png|218px|thumb|right|Original Spanish newspaper in 1917.]]

Because of the total submarine warfare declared by Germany and the continued sinking of ships of different neutral nationalities on the American shores, [[Brazil]] and [[Cuba]] had sent angry protest to the Germans. President Menocal, encouraged by the United States` entry into the war, asked the congress of Cuba to declare war as well, enthusiastically stating that Cuba could not remain neutral. The Cuban senate unanimously passed a resolution that a state of war existed against Germany and the Cuban congress approved the declaration of war on April 7, 1917.

Thus Cuba was one of the few [[Latin American]] countries, along with [[Panama]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Uruguay]], who joined the [[Allies of World War I]]. Most countries in the region, including [[Mexico]], maintained their [[neutral country|neutral]] position.

==War effort on Cuba==
After the declaration of war all German ships within [[Havana Harbor]] were [[seized]]. Likewise Cuban ports opened to Allied warships.  Likewise, a bill was being drafted to authorize the offering of a contingent of 12,000 men to the United States.

Internal politics were strengthened by the declaration as liberals, who agreed with the move, decided to stop criticizing the government. In July 1917, the Menocal government suspended constitutional guarantees with the measure being claimed to be intended against German spies.

The Cuban government also agreed to the stationing of [[U.S. Marines]] on the island. However the Americans, afraid that this would undermine the national and international position of the Menocal government, announced that the goal of the intervention was to support the sugar harvest as major war contribution of Cuba, thus becoming known as [[Sugar Intervention]].

The [[Cuban Red Cross]] was also reorganized, established operations in Europe and supported the Allied forces on the [[Western Front (World War 1)|Western Front]].

==War on Austria-Hungary==

The [[United States declaration of war on Austria-Hungary]] on December 7, 1917. [[Panama]] followed on December 10, 1917 and Cuba would do the same on December 16.

==Recognition of the Mexican government==

[[File:Cuba recognizes the government of Mexico.jpg|218px|thumb|right|On Thursday April 4, 1918, Havana and Mexico City exchanged ambassadors for a further Cuban-Mexican relation.]]

In the midst of the diplomatic crisis caused by the disappearance of the diplomatic baggage of Mexican Ambassador [[Isidro Fabela]], the government of Cuba officially acknowledged the constitutional Government of [[Venustiano Carranza]]. Federico Jimenez O'Farril presented a hand-written letter of the Cuban president to the Mexican President, in which he granted the recognition.

Despite the diplomatic act, the relationship between the two countries cooled due to the treatment of the Mexican travelers in Havana.

An '''earthflow''' ('''earth flow''') is a downslope viscous flow of fine-grained materials that have been saturated with water  and moves under the pull of [[gravity]].  It is an intermediate type of [[mass wasting]] that is between [[downhill creep]] and [[mudflow]]. The types of materials that are susceptible to earthflows are [[clay]], fine [[sand]] and [[silt]], and fine-grained [[pyroclastic]] material.&lt;ref name=East&gt;Easterbrook, D: “Surface Processes and Landforms”, page 78-79. Prentice-Hall, Inc, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ground materials become saturated with enough water, they will start flowing ([[soil liquefaction]]).  Its speed can range from being barely noticeable to rapid movement.  The velocity of the flow is dictated by water content: the higher the water content is, the higher the velocity will be.&lt;ref name=East/&gt; Because of the dependency on water content for the velocity of the flow, it can take minutes or years for the materials to move down the slope.

== Features and behavior ==
Earthflows are just one type of [[mass movement]] that can occur on a hill slope. It has been recognized as its own type of movement since the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Baum, R.L., and W.Z. Savage, and J. Wasowski.(2003) ''Mechanics of Earth Flows.'' Proceedings of the International Conference FLOWS. Sorrento, Italy. [http://ww.unina2.it/flows2003/flows2003/articoli/SAVAGE.pdf Mechanics of Earth Flows.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222080721/http://ww.unina2.it/flows2003/flows2003/articoli/SAVAGE.pdf |date=2015-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earthflows are one of the most [[fluid]] types of mass movements. Earthflows occur on heavily saturated slopes like [[mudflows]] or a [[debris flow]]. Though earthflows are a lot like mudflows, overall they are slower and are covered with solid material carried along by flow from within.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Physical Geography|last = Petersen|first = James|publisher = Cengage Learning|year = 2011|isbn = 111142750X|location = |pages = 441–443}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earthflows are often made up of fine-grained materials so slopes consisting of [[clay]] and [[silt]] materials are more likely to create an earthflow.

As earthflows are usually water-dependent, the risk of one occurring is much higher in humid areas especially after a period of heavy rainfall or [[snowmelt]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Key Concepts in Geomorphology|last = Bierman|first = Paul|publisher = W.H. Freeman and Company Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = 1464152985|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The high level of [[precipitation]], which saturates the ground and adds water to the slope content, increases the pore-water pressure and reduces the [[Shear strength|shearing strength]] of the material. As the slope becomes wet, the earthflow may start as a [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] downslope due to the clay or silt having less friction. As the material is increasingly more saturated, the slope will fail, which depends on [[slope stability]]. In earthflows, the slope does not fail along a clear shear plane and is instead more fluid as the material begins to move under the force of gravity as friction and slope stability is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Environmental Hydrology|last = Ward|first = Andy|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2003|isbn = 1566706165|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Velocity ==
Earthflows vary in velocity of flow depending partly on the consistency of the flow for the speed of the entire movement, usually meaning how much water is in the material of the hill slope before the slope fails. Though water is often the key factor in slope failure, triggering an earthflow, there can also be dry granular flows made up of [[granular material]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2004/3072/pdf/fs2004-3072.pdf|title =Landslide Types and Processes|date =|accessdate =|website =USGS|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =no|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160405030314/http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2004/3072/pdf/fs2004-3072.pdf|archivedate =2016-04-05|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The speed also depends on the angle of slope as earthflows can happen on moderate or steep slopes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Because earthflows are usually water-dependent, they can take many years or just minutes to move a significant amount. An earthflow may affect as few as several square meters or up to several hectares in either time frame.

== Effects ==
Earthflows can have sudden impacts on the amount of sediment that is deposited into a river system, which can have effects on the life in and around the river itself. They can also cause damage to roads and constructions built near the slope. One of the best mitigation techniques to avoid serious earthflow and [[landslide]] damage is properly draining the slope of water, especially in places of high levels of precipitation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Areas of risk ==
The areas most at risk for earthflows are:
* Slopes that have been undercut or loaded with more sediment for human construction
* Slopes that have been undercut by [[river]]s or stream beds
* Areas that receive heavy rainfall or snowmelt
* Hill slopes made up of clay, silt, or other fine-grained materials
* Areas with limited vegetation on hill slopes
* Areas with evidence of past earthflows

The Algerian '''Electricity and Gas Regulation Commission''' (CREG) has been created under the [http://www.mem-algeria.org/fr/legis/txt_law_ele.htm law n° 02-01 of 5 February 2002] relative to [[electricity]] and [[gas]] distribution.
CREG is an independent body with a legal status and a financial autonomy. It is vested with three main missions:

* Realization and control of [[public services|public service]],
* Advising the authorities on [[organisation]] and functioning of the [[electricity]] and [[Algeria]]n [[gas]] market,
* Supervision and control of the respect of [[law]]s and regulations related to the [[electricity]] and the national [[gas]] [[Market (economics)|market]].

CREG has begun its activities after his installation by the [[Prime Minister]] on 24 January 2005.
CREG is managed by a steering committee constituted of a chairman and three (03) directors appointed by presidential decree on proposition of the Minister in charge of Energy.
An Advisory Council is instituted within the regulation commission. It is composed of two (02) representatives of the relevant ministerial departments and of all interested parties (operators, consumers, employees).

The composition and financing of the advisory council are defined by legal ways.

The main competences and functions of the regulation commission are:

1. Permits / [[concession (contract)|Concession]]s

2. Demand forecasts / Investment planning

3. Remuneration of operators and tariffs

4. Access to [[business network|networks]] / [[Market (economics)|Market]]s

5. [[Quality (business)|Quality]], [[regulation]]s /Technical and [[Environmental science|environmental]] control

6. Consumer protection

A conciliation department for conflicts resulting from the implementation of the regulations particularly those relative to access to networks, tariffs and remuneration of operators;

An arbitration chamber, on request from the parties, rules on conflicts which may arise among operators except for those related to contractual rights and obligations.

Chile's [[total primary energy supply]] (TPES) was 36.10 [[tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=iea2014&gt;{{cite web|title=IEA - Report|url=https://www.iea.org/statistics/statisticssearch/report/?country=Chile&amp;product=indicators|website=www.iea.org|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy in Chile is dominated by fossil fuels, with coal, oil and gas accounting for 73.4% of the total primary energy. Biofuels and waste account for another 20.5% of primary energy supply, with the rest sourced from hydro and other renewables.&lt;ref name=iea2014 /&gt;

Electricity consumption was 68.90 TWh in 2014. Main sources of electricity in Chile are [[hydroelectricity]], [[fuel gas|gas]], [[fuel oil|oil]] and [[coal]]. [[Renewable energy]] in the forms of [[Wind energy|wind]] and [[solar energy]] are also coming into use, encouraged by collaboration since 2009 with the [[United States Department of Energy]]. The electricity industry is [[privatization|privatized]] with [[Endesa (Chile)|ENDESA]] as the largest company in the field.

==Electricity==
{{Main|Electricity sector in Chile}}
The electricity sector in [[Chile]] relies mainly on hydro-electric power generation (33% of installed capacity as of May, 2012),&lt;ref name="CE centrales"&gt;[http://www.centralenergia.cl/en/power-plants-chile/ Installed Capacity in Chile] Central Energía: Up-to-date information of the power capacity installed in Chile. Retrieved 15-05-2012&lt;/ref&gt; oil (13%), gas (30%) and coal (20%).&lt;ref name="CE centrales"/&gt; Wind has a small but growing presence with 198 MW.&lt;ref name="CE centrales"/&gt; Faced with natural gas shortages that have the potential to jeopardize electricity supply, Chile is currently building its first [[LNG]] terminal to secure a supply for its existing and upcoming gas-fired thermal plants. In addition, it has engaged in the construction of several new hydropower and coal-fired thermal plants.

Chile’s successful electricity sector reform, which served as a model for other countries, was carried out in the first half of the 1980s. Vertical and horizontal unbundling of [[electricity generation|generation]], [[electricity transmission|transmission]] and [[electricity distribution|distribution]] and large scale privatization led to soaring private investment. However, in recent years, there has been a substantial modification of the 1982 Electricity Act, to bring it line with developments of the last 20 years in the sector. This was the result of a pressing need to change.

The main companies involved, in terms of installed capacity, are the following:&lt;ref name="CE centrales"/&gt;

* [[Endesa (Chile)|ENDESA]] (35%, 6085 MW)
* [[AES Gener]] (18%, 3157 MW)
* [[Colbún S.A.]] (15%, 2621 MW)
* [[Suez Energy Andino]] (12%, 2176 MW)
* E.E. Guacolda (3%, 610 MW)
* [[Pacific Hydro]] (3%, 551 MW)

A number of other companies account for the remaining 14% (2418 MW)&lt;ref name="CE centrales"/&gt;

=== Projects ===
Since the introduction of the so-called [http://www.centralenergia.cl/uploads/2009/09/LEY-20018_19-MAY-2005.pdf "short law II"], investments in generation have risen greatly.  Currently, there are generation projects amounting to over 26,000 MW, in different stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centralenergia.cl/proyectos-electricos-de-chile Proyectos Eléctricos de Chile]. Up to date list of electric generation projects. Central Energía. Retrieved: 19-04-2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Total S.A.]] announced the world's largest unsubsidised [[Photovoltaic power station|solar farm]] would be installed with assistance from [[SunPower|SunPower Corp]] into Chile's [[Atacama desert]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-26/total-plans-biggest-solar-farm-in-chile-that-won-t-rely-on-aid.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewable energy and energy efficiency==
{{Main|Renewable energy in Chile}}
[[USDOE]] announced on June 23, 2009 that [[U.S. Energy Secretary]] Chu has signed a [[Memorandum of Cooperation]] with Minister [[Marcelo Tokman]] of the [[Chilean National Energy Commission]] to further collaboration between the two nations. The memorandum establishes an institutional framework between Chile and the United States, allowing DOE to provide its technical expertise in support of a new [[Renewable Energy Center]] in Chile. The new center will work to identify developments and best practices in [[renewable energy]] technologies from around the world, disseminating its findings within Chile and throughout the region.

The two countries will also collaborate on other high-priority energy issues, including [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies and the establishment of two pilot solar power projects in northern Chile.

      <comment>Updated URL for the Final GADSTF Recommendations Report dated July 20, 2011</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4995">The '''Generating Availability Data System''' ('''GADS''') is a database produced by the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC).  It includes annual summary reports comprising the statistics for [[power station]]s in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reliability, Maintainability and Risk|author=David John Smith|pages=42|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|year=2005|isbn=9780750666947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GADS is the main source of power station outage data in North America.  This reporting system, initiated by the electric utility industry in 1982, expands and extends the data collection procedures begun by the industry in 1963. NERC GADS is recognized today as a valuable source of reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) information.&lt;ref&gt;North American Electric Reliability Corporation's (NERC) Generating Availability Data System (GADS) Data Reporting Instructions (DRI).&lt;/ref&gt;

This information, collected for both total unit and major equipment groups, is used by analysts' industry-wide in numerous applications. GADS maintains complete operating histories on more than 5,800 generating units representing 71% of the installed generating capacity of the United States and Canada. GADS is a mandatory industry program for conventional generating units 50 MW and larger starting January 1, 2012 and 20 MW and larger starting January 1, 2013. GADS remains open to all non-required participants in the Regional Entities (shown in Figure I-2 of the NERC GADS DRI) and any other organization (domestic or international) that operate electric generating facilities who is willing to follow the GADS mandatory requirements as presented in the document [https://www.nerc.com/comm/PC/Generating%20Availability%20Data%20System%20Working%20Group/Archive/Revised_Final_Draft_GADSTF_Recommendation_Report.pdf Final GADSTF Recommendations Report dated July 20, 2011].

GADS data consists of three data types:
# Design – equipment descriptions such as manufacturers, number of [[boiler feedwater pump]]s, steam turbine MW rating, etc.
# Performance – summaries of generation produced, fuels units, start ups, etc.
# Event – description of equipment failures such as when the event started/ended, type of outage (forced, maintenance, planned), etc.

One example of such detail is that in its data pertaining to forced outages and unplanned unit failures, it makes the fine distinction between immediate, delayed, and postponed outages.&lt;ref name=EydelandWolyniec&gt;{{cite book|pages=109|title=Energy and Power Risk Management|author=Alexander Eydeland and Krzysztof Wolyniec|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2003|isbn=9780471455875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important statistic calculated from the raw GADS data is the Equivalent [[Forced outage rate|Forced Outage Rate]] (EFOR), which is the hours of unit failure (unplanned outage hours and equivalent unplanned derated hours) given as a percentage of the total hours of the availability of that unit (unplanned outage, unplanned derated, and service hours).&lt;ref name=EydelandWolyniec /&gt;

Recently, in response to the deregulated energy markets, the Equivalent Forced Outage Rate – Demand (EFORd) has taken on greater importance:

* The probability that a unit will not meet its demand periods for generating requirements.
* Best measure of reliability for all loading types (base, cycling, peaking, etc.)
* Best measure of reliability for all unit types (fossil, nuclear, gas turbines, diesels, etc.)
* For demand period measures and not for the full 24-hour clock.

'''Industry Development of GADS'''

Before any data element was included in GADS, an industry committee to determine its applicability to utility operation and RAM analyses scrutinized it. A series of industry meetings were held to discuss the analytical usefulness of each element and to determine if utilities could reasonably provide that data to GADS. Consequently, the only data requested in the GADS Data Reporting Instructions (DRI) meet industry-prescribed needs.

The industry also realized a need to include standardized terminology in the GADS program if it were to function on an international scale. As a result, the definitions promulgated by The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers' (IEEE) Standard 762, "Definitions for Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability and Productivity" were incorporated.

Utilities started their reporting using the GADS guidelines on January 1, 1982.

GADS superseded the earlier data collection procedures begun by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), a program started in the mid-1960s. GADS contains many of the same elements previously collected by EEI in addition to the many new data items. This seeming duplication of data was done intentionally: the EEI information can be derived from GADS so analyses that include data from earlier than 1982 can be completed.

[[File:Stone veneration in Kolomenskoe Moscow.jpg|thumb|Stone veneration in Kolomenskoe]]'''Golosov Ravine''' (Голосов Овраг), also known as Vlasov (Власов) ravine&lt;ref&gt;[http://moscowparks.narod.ru/mgomz/kolpark/golosovr.htm Data from «Улицы Москвы. Старые и новые названия». М., ИЦ «Наука,техника,образование», 2003] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; is a deep [[ravine]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], between the [[Kolomenskoe]] Hill and Dyakovo Hill. The ravine has several [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and a [[stream|brook]] streaming at its bottom. Up in the ravine, on the left side of it, there is a [[Neopagan]] [[shrine]], organized around two venerated "[[Sin-Kamen|sacred stones]]". In years 2006-2007, during the renovation of Kolomenskoe sides of the ravine were reinforced, and pedestrian paths and stairs were created on its sides.

== History ==
Since ancient times this ravine has always been a bit of a mystery. Inexplicable things constantly happened here in the past. For example, one amazing story was described in the 17th-century sources. In 1621, a small detachment of Tatar horsemen turned up at the walls of the Tsar’s palace in [[Kolomna]]. They were surrounded and captured immediately by the warriors, who guarded the entrance to the palace. Being lost and disoriented, they claimed to be part of the armies of the Crimean khan [[Devlet I Giray]] that had attacked Moscow in 1571. Sensing defeat and wanting to avoid capture, they retreated into Golosov ravine, where they were quickly enveloped in a thick mist. Spending what seemed like only a few minutes finding their way through the fog, they emerged to find that 50 years had already passed. One of the captives, named ''Murza'', said that the mist was unusual, of light green colour, but none of them paid attention to it, due to fear of the chasing. Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich ordered to undertake an inquiry, which showed that the men “probably told the truth.” They had even old-fashioned armor and ammunition, mostly of 1560s or 1570s types.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gazetanv.ru/article/?id=167&lt;/ref&gt;

This wasn’t the only reported incident of time travel in the surroundings of Golosov Ravine. In the 19th century, such cases were documented by the Moscow province's police office. One story was published in the newspaper ''“Moscovkie vedomosti”'' in July 1832. Two local peasants, ''Arhip Kuzmin'' and ''Ivan Botchkarev'', had a big night out at a neighboring village and decided to take a shortcut through the ravine on their way home. There was the same thick green mist that filled the ravine, where a strange corridor suddenly appeared. The peasants stepped down into it and met large and hairy manlike creatures, who managed to put them back on the right path via hand signals. A few minutes later, the peasants left the ravine and continued their way. When they eventually came to their native village, it turned out that two decades had already passed. Their wives and children did not recognize them. The incident was reported to the police who conducted an investigation, during which one of the men dissolved into the fog and never returned.

Down through the centuries, people have been periodically seen hairy human-resembling creatures round Golosov ravine. Such cases were mentioned not only in the ancient and medieval chronicles, but also in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] periodical press. Large hairy manlike creatures most likely represent the [[leshy]] - a sort of bigfoot from Slavic mythology, who is more man than ape and more woodland spirit than mortal creature. In 1926, a policeman reported seeing a “hairy wild man” over two meters tall (6.6&amp;nbsp;ft) in Golosov Ravine. The policeman pulled out his pistol, but the strange creature instantly dissolved in the fog. Local schoolchildren joined the search for the unusual guest, but they were unable to detect his traces. However, one of the official Moscow newspapers published the article “[[Pioneer movement|Young Pioneers]] (Soviet Boy Scouts) are capturing a leshy”, by the journalist A.Ryazantsev.

== The sacred stones ==
The "sacred stones of Kolomenskoe" are a pair of local [[sandstone]]&lt;ref name=rodniki/&gt; rocks of peculiar shape, located high in the ravine. Some sources claim them to be [[granite]] boulders of [[glacier|glacial]] origin,&lt;ref name=archnadzor/&gt; but this seems to be a misconception. Both rocks have traces of manual processing, both old (exaggerating the shape of the stones), and new (as they have been [[Vandalism|vandalized]] by modern [[graffiti]]). Initially the stones were located further down the ravine, closer to the springs, but during one of the renovations of the park in the Soviet era they were dragged to the place where they reside now.

According to a recently popularized theory, Golosov Ravine might have initially hosted a shrine dedicated to the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic deity]] [[Veles (god)|Veles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svet.sva.name/kolom.html Коломенское обращение КО ВСЕМ ЯЗЫЧЕСКИМ ОБЩИНАМ РОССИИ И БЛИЖНЕГО ЗАРУБЕЖЬЯ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328083045/http://www.svet.sva.name/kolom.html |date=2012-03-28 }} at "Свет Сварога" (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; The name of Veles is said to be traceable in modern name of the ravine (Golosov or Vlasov, through Volosov, from Velesov).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrono.ru/religia/yazych/veles.php On the relation between the name Vlas and pagan god Veles] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine might have been later [[Christianization|Christianized]], with the stones re-interepreted by local inhabitants as traces of a famous battle between [[St. George]] (the patron saint of Moscow) and the [[dragon]],&lt;ref name=archnadzor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kahirka.narod.ru/nas.pnk/kasdiak.htm Project "Каширская Дорога"] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; thus preserving the ancient mythological motif under new names (see "Enemy of Perun and storm myth" section in [[Veles (god)|Veles]] article).

=== Modern veneration practices ===
The stones have their own names: one is called ''Deviy'' (or ''Devichiy'', {{lang-ru|Девий, Девичий}}, meaning "Virgin"), and is associated by modern worshipers with giving [[fertility]] to women,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotimdetey.ru/article/sakralnie_mesta/devichiy_kamen/ Detailed description of actions that are expected from stone worshipers] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; while the other one is called ''Gus’'' (''Гусь'', meaning "[[Goose]]"). Local lore tells that they help to cure certain diseases, so people come and sit by them,&lt;ref&gt;[http://shamana.ucoz.ru/publ/5-1-0-34 Description of modern practices associated with the stone] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gromovdv.livejournal.com/12851.html Pictures of the veneration] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; and also tie small pieces of tissue onto [[Wish Tree|nearby trees]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kp.ru/daily/23537.5/41637/ К. Гусев. "Москвичи рискуют провалиться во времени". Комсомольская Правда 03.07.2005] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History of the veneration ===
According to some sources, the stones were not continuously venerated by locals in the 20th century, which would mean that the tradition is discontinuous, and may not follow the older patterns, whatever they might have been.&lt;ref name=rodniki/&gt;

== Springs ==
The nearby springs are also considered sacred (miracle-bearing) in contemporary [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]],&lt;ref name=listoforthodox&gt;[http://www.litportal.ru/genre216/author10226/read/page/10/book60061.html Чудотворные православные источники России]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neopagan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvovich.ru/place/veles_golos.shtml Голосов Овраг] at lvovich.ru (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New-Age]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotimdetey.ru/article/sakralnie_mesta/devichiy_kamen/ «Девичий камень» и «Гусь камень» в Коломенском] at hotimdetey.ru (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mohovoy.ru/altmoscow/pramoscow.htm Совсем не про Коломенское] - a comprehensive set of modern urban legends about Golosov Ravine (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; traditions.

The '''Great Flood of Gun-Yu''' ({{CJKV|t=鯀禹治水}}), also known as the '''Gun-Yu myth''',&lt;ref name="Yang, 74"&gt;Yang, 74&lt;/ref&gt; was a major flood event in [[ancient China]] that allegedly continued for at least two generations, which resulted in great population displacements among other disasters, such as storms and famine.  People left their homes to live on the high hills and mounts, or nest on the trees.&lt;ref name=richard&gt;{{cite book|title=A Chinese bestiary : strange creatures from the guideways through mountains and seas|author=Richard E.

Archaeological evidence of an [[outburst flood]] on the Yellow River (possibly among the worst anywhere in the world in the past 10,000 years) has been dated to about 1920 BCE (several centuries later than the traditional recorded beginning of the [[Xia dynasty]]), and is suggested to have been the basis for the myth.&lt;ref&gt;Outburst flood at 1920 BCE supports historicity of China’s Great Flood and the Xia dynasty.

Treated either historically or mythologically, the story of the Great Flood and the heroic attempts of the various human characters to control it and to abate the disaster is a narrative fundamental to [[Chinese culture]]. Among other things, the Great Flood of China is key to understanding the history of the founding of both the [[Xia dynasty]] and the [[Zhou dynasty]], it is also one of the main flood motifs in [[Chinese mythology]], and it is a major source of [[allusion]] in [[Classical Chinese poetry]].

==Overview==
[[File:Nine Provinces of China.png|thumb|400px|Map showing the legendary flood and the Nine Provinces of ancient China.]]
The story of the Great Flood plays a dramatic role in [[Chinese mythology]], and its various versions present a number of examples of the [[flood myth]] motif around the world. Flood narratives in Chinese mythology share certain common features, despite being somewhat lacking in internal consistency as well as incorporating various magical transformations and divine or semi-divine interventions like [[Nüwa]].&lt;ref&gt;Christie, 83–91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; For example, the flood usually results from natural causes rather than "universal [[Genesis flood narrative|punishment for human sin]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Christie, 83&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinct motif of the myth of the Great Flood of China is an emphasis on the heroic and praiseworthy efforts to mitigate the disaster;&lt;ref name="Yang, 117"&gt;Yang, 117&lt;/ref&gt; flooding is alleviated by constructing [[Levee|dikes]] and [[dam]]s (such as the efforts of [[Gun (Chinese)|Gun]]), digging [[canal]]s (as devised by [[Yu the Great]]), widening or deepening existing channels, and teaching these skills to others.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Another key motif is the development of civilization and bettering the human situation despite the disaster of the deluge.&lt;ref name="Yang, 117"/&gt; During the course of fighting, surviving, and eventually getting the inundation problems under control, much progress was also made in terms of land management, beast control, and agricultural techniques. These and other developments are integral to the narrative, and exemplify a wider approach to human health and societal well being than [[emergency management]] of the flood and its immediate effects. According to legend, a comprehensive approach to societal development resulted not only in wide-scale cooperation and large-scale efforts to control the flood but also led to the establishment of the first state of China, the [[Xia dynasty]] (ca. 2070 – ca. 1600 BC).

==Narrative==

===Flood begins===
[[File:EmperorYao.jpg|thumb|EmperorYao|Emperor Yao. Inscription reads: "The god Yao, Fang Xun, was humane like Heaven itself, and wise like a divine being; to be near him was like approaching the sun, to look at him was like gazing into clouds".&lt;ref&gt;Birrell, Chinese Mythology, {{ISBN|0-8018-6183-7}}, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was during the reign of [[Emperor Yao]] that the Great Flood began, a flood so vast that no part of Yao's territory was spared, and both the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze]] valleys flooded.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Wu, 69&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged nature of the flood is shown in the following quote:

{{Cquote|Like endless boiling water, the flood is pouring forth destruction. Boundless and overwhelming, it overtops hills and mountains. Rising and ever rising, it threatens the very heavens. How the people must be groaning and suffering!|author=Emperor Yao, as quoted in the ''Book of History'', describing the flood&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 69. Translation by Wu.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to both historical and mythological sources, the flooding continued relentlessly. Yao sought to find someone who could control the flood, and turned for advice to his special adviser, or advisers, the [[Four Mountains]] (四嶽 or 四岳, ''Sìyuè''); who, after deliberation, gave Emperor Yao some advice which he did not especially welcome.

===Yao appoints Gun===
{{Main|Gun (Chinese)}}
Upon the insistence of Four Mountains, and over Yao's initial hesitation, the person Yao finally consented to appoint in charge of controlling the flood was [[Gun (Chinese)|Gun]], the Prince of Chong, who was a distant relative of Yao's through common descent from the Yellow Emperor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Gun's efforts===
According to the main mythological tradition, Gun's plan of flood control was through the use of a miraculously continuously self-expanding soil, [[Xirang]].&lt;ref name="Yang, 74"/&gt; Gun chose to obtain the Xirang by stealing it from the [[Supreme Divinity]], which he did; however, the Supreme Divinity became quite angered at this importunity.&lt;ref name="Yang, 74"/&gt; Year in and year out, many times, and to great extents; Gun applied the magical Xirang earth in attempt to block and barricade the flood waters with dams, dikes, and embankments (which he built with the special powers of the magic soil). However, Gun was never able to abate the problems of the Great Flood. Whether his failure to abate the flood was due to divine wrath or to engineering defects remains an unanswered question – although one pointed out over two thousand years ago by Qu Yuan, in his "[[Heavenly Questions]]".&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shun in power===
{{Main|Emperor Shun }}
[[File:禹贡九州图.jpg|thumb|350px|left|A depiction of the system of the ''zhou'', or "islands" (now reinterpreted as "provinces"), a system which Shun is credited with developing as a tool to allow political administration of a territory with ongoing flooding making normal communications impossible, although the number and locations of ''zhou'' have varied over time]]
Even after nine years of the efforts of Gun, the flood continued to rage on, leading to the increase of all sorts of social disorders. The administration of the empire was becoming increasingly difficult; so,  accordingly, at this point, Yao offered to resign the throne in favor of his special adviser(s), Four Mountains: however, Four Mountains declined, and instead recommended [[Emperor Shun|Shun]] – another distant relative to Yao through the Yellow Emperor; but one who was living in obscurity, despite his royal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;

Yao proceeded to put Shun through a series of tests, beginning with marrying his two daughters to Shun and ending by sending him down from the mountains to the plains below where Shun had to face fierce winds, thunder, and rain.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 74–76&lt;/ref&gt; After passing all of Yao's tests, not the least of which being establishing and continuing a state of marital harmony together with [[Xiang River goddesses|Yao's two daughters]], Shun took on administrative responsibilities as co-emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; Among these responsibilities, Shun had to deal with the Great Flood and its associated disruptions, especially in light of the fact that Yao's reluctant decision to appoint Gun to handle the problem had failed to fix the situation, despite having been working on it for the previous nine years. Shun took steps over the next four years to reorganize the empire, in such a way as to solve immediate problems and to put the imperial authority in a better position to deal with the flood and its effects.

Although Shun's organization (or reorganization) of the flooded and increasingly flooded lands into ''zhou'' or islands (the political ancestors of the modern ''zhou'' or provinces, both of which may be written with the same character, [[wikt:州|州]]) alleviated some of the administrative difficulties as a work around to various problems, the fact remained that despite the additional four years of effort, Gun still had not only failed to achieve any success towards solving the main problem of the ongoing flooding, but the water even kept on rising. Gun insisted on staying the course with the dikes, insisting that despite the overwhelming failure so far that the people work even harder and to continue to build more and higher.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 85&lt;/ref&gt; Not only that, but Gun questioned the legitimacy of Shun as a ruler due to his modest background.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts of Shun===
[[File:Emperor Shun performs divination in the palace.jpg|thumb|Emperor Shun performs divination in the palace, with Yu present]]
After the solemnities of his final accession to power, the first thing Shun did was to reform the calendar.&lt;ref name="Wu, 77"&gt;Wu, 77&lt;/ref&gt; Next, for the period of a month, Shun convoked a series of meetings, ceremonies, and interviews at the imperial capital with the Four Mountains and the heads, lords, or princes of the realm's houses, clans, [[Chinese surname|surnames]], tribes, and nations.&lt;ref name="Wu, 77"/&gt;

Shun then went to [[Mount Tai]] as the beginning of his tour of inspection of the flood-ravaged realm.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 77-78&lt;/ref&gt; Here, at Taishan, he met with the princes of the eastern regions; and, after certain religious ceremonies, he standardized weights, measures, and ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 78&lt;/ref&gt; Then he went on to do the same to the south, the west, and the north, meeting at the sacred mountains of each region with the princes and leaders of each region, and standardizing their rules, measures, and practices.&lt;ref name="Wu, 82"&gt;Wu, 82&lt;/ref&gt; All of these acts can be seen as preparatory to the fighting of the flood, as this was an effort requiring extraordinary levels of synchronized and coordinated activity over a relatively large territory: the timing was synchronized through the calendar reform and the engineering measures were made possible by standardizing the weights and measures.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the year, Shun returned to the imperial seat, and after a sacrificial offering of a bullock at his ancestral temple, he then put into action the plan that he had developed during his working tour of inspection.&lt;ref name="Wu, 82"/&gt; One of these was to divide the empire into twelve administrative units (''zhou''), each one administered from the highest mountain within that area.&lt;ref name="Wu, 82"/&gt; This was doubtlessly a useful expedient in the face of the rising and unpredictable flood waters. Another of Shun's acts was administrative reform.

===Gun's demise===
With Gun's overwhelming failure to control the flood waters and his questioning of the legitimacy of Shun's rule, he became labeled as an intransigent. Accordingly, as part of his administrative reforms, Shun had Gun banished to [[Feather Mountain]]. Accounts vary considerably about the details of Gun's demise; but, in any case, the sources seem to agree that he met the end of his human existence at Feather Mountain (although again accounts vary as to whether this end was death, through execution by [[Zhurong]], or through a metamorphic transformation into — depending on account — a yellow bear, a three-footed tortoise, or a yellow dragon.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, 87&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Gun's son Yu===
{{Main|Yu the Great}}
Somehow, Gun had a son Yu. Various myths suggest that this occurred under circumstances that would not meet the normal criteria for historical fact. Yu would continue the struggle to contain the flood waters.

===Great Yu controls the flood===
[[File:Wuhan University - Water Resources Lab - Yu the Great - DSCF4288.JPG|thumb|Yu the Great and his human and [[chelonia (order)|chelonia]]n associates, fighting the flood. Relief outside the Water Resources and Hydro Power Lab, [[Wuhan University]] (2005)]]
Yu tried a different approach to the project of flood control; which in the end having achieved success,  earned Yu renown throughout Chinese history, in which the Gun-Yu Great Flood is commonly referred to as "Great Yu Controls the Waters" ({{zh|c=大禹治水|p=Dà Yǔ Zhì Shuǐ}}). Yu's approach seems to have involved an approach more oriented toward drainage and less towards containment with dams and dikes. According to the more fancily embellished versions of the story it was also necessary for him to subdue various supernatural beings as well as recruit the assistance of others, for instance a channel-digging dragon and a giant mud-hauling tortoise (or turtle).

I opened passages for the streams throughout the [[Nine Provinces (China)|nine provinces]] and conducted them to the seas. I deepened the channels and conducted them to the streams.

禹曰：「洪水滔天，浩浩懷山襄陵，下民昏墊。予乘四載，隨山刊木，暨益奏庶鮮食。予決九川，距四海，濬畎澮距川
|author=Yu the Great, quoted according to tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell and Cotterell, 24&lt;/ref&gt; describing his work in regard to the flood: ''Book of Documents'', ch. "[[Yi and Ji]]" 益稷}}

===Yu's helpers===
Various myths, or versions of myths, specify that Yu received help from various sources which helped him to succeed in controlling the Great Flood. [[Hebo]], the god of the Yellow River is supposed to have provided Yu with a map of the river and its surroundings which helped him make his plans.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the Yellow River map is said to have been provided to Yu by [[Houtu]].&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
After his work in controlling the flood waters, Yu became sole emperor and went on to found the [[Xia dynasty]], when his son [[Qi of Xia]] succeeded him, thus establishing the beginning of a tradition of dynastic succession through primogeniture. But, before this, after ending his work against the flooding, Yu was said to have assembled all of the heroes/gods involved in fighting the flood together on Mount Guiji (in modern [[Zhejiang]]) at a certain time; but, when [[Fangfeng]] arrived late Yu had him executed — later it turned out that Fangfeng was late because he had stopped to fight a local flood which he encountered on his way.

==Acquisition of agricultural civilization==
{{Main|Agriculture (Chinese mythology)}}
Besides the motif of controlling the flood waters another motif is particularly characteristic of the Chinese Gun Yu flood myth, namely the acquisition of the agricultural civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 116-117&lt;/ref&gt; In some versions, this includes the appointment of Ji Qi (later called [[Houji]]) as Minister of Agriculture. Other versions go into the details of how a tiny remnant of people consisting of only two or a few individuals managed to survive the flood and the re-population/civilization process following the worldwide disaster, and/or how grain seeds or fire were obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 114-117&lt;/ref&gt; Another figure in this regard is [[Yi (husbandman)|Yi]], also known as Boyi or Bo Yi.

==Historicity==
The narrative of the Great Flood of prehistoric China may provide some insight into social development during this era. David Hawkes comments on the way that the various versions of the Gun-Yu story seem to contrast the relative success or failure, or at least the differences, between Gun, the father, and his son, Yu. Hawkes proposes a symbolic interpretation of a societal transition. In this case, Gun represents a society at an earlier technological stage, which engages in small scale agriculture which involves raising areas of arable land sufficiently above the level of the marshes existing then in the flood plains of the Yellow River system, including tributaries: from this perspective the "magically-expanding" ''[[xirang]]'' soil can be understood as representing a type of floating garden, made up of soil, brushwood, and similar materials. Yu and his work in controlling the flood would symbolize a later type of society, a one which possessed of technological innovations allowing a much larger scale approach to transforming wetlands to arable fields. Hawkes explains the miraculous transformations of the landscape which appear in the mythological descriptions as symbolically representative of a gridded drainage system engineered to permanently eliminate entire marsh areas, in favor of agriculturally exploitable fields.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, 138-139&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent archaeological and geological discoveries may have some bearing on the story of the Great Flood.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-36966274&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence of a large outburst flood on the Yellow River has been dated to about 1920 BCE, and is suggested to have been the basis for the later myth. A colossal landslide created a natural dam across the river which was breached about a year later. The resulting flood could plausibly have travelled {{Convert|2000|km|abbr=on}} down the river and the resulting instability of river channels might have lasted up to twenty years. About this time, the Neolithic gave way to the Bronze Age in the Yellow River valley. The authors suggest that this coincided with the beginning of the Xia, several centuries later than traditionally thought, and that the [[Erlitou culture]] is an archaeological manifestation of the Xia dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Outburst flood at 1920 BCE supports historicity of China’s Great Flood and the Xia dynasty. Qinglong Wu, Zhijun Zhao, Li Liu, Darryl E. Granger, Hui Wang, David J. Cohen, Xiaohong Wu, Maolin Ye, Ofer Bar-Yosef, Bin Lu, Jin Zhang, Peizhen Zhang, Daoyang Yuan, Wuyun Qi, Linhai Cai, Shibiao Bai. Science  05 Aug 2016: Vol. 353, Issue 6299, pp. 579-582.

===Dating===
[[File:Xihe.jpg|thumb|The Xihe brothers receive orders from emperor Yao to organise the calendar]]
The historian K. C. Wu believes that the "Canon of Yao" ("''yaodian''") in the [[Book of History]] (''Shujing'') has historical value, despite being one of the "second batch" or "new" texts comprising this collection of documents, which despite the problematic nature of their textual transmission, and that they appear to be reconstructed or heavily edited and interpolated, as compared with the "first" or "old" batch, which supposedly survived the Fires of Qin (the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars]] together with the destruction by fire of the Qin imperial library at the collapse of its dynasty). The first batch documents allegedly remained hidden for about a century, until accidentally discovered and handed over to a descendent of Confucius. Wu accepts that the "''yaodian''" is not a direct copy of the original, however he argues that it was based on the same, authentic sources as the first batch documents, perhaps even being to some extent based on the actual original. However, the clinching factor which K. C. Wu claims is objective, extra-textual confirmation of "Yao's Canon" (and by implication, the rest of the second batch documents) has directly to do with dating the Great Flood, specifically to around the year 2200 BCE. This is based on comparing astronomical data from the text with modern astronomical or astrophysical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 35-44, 66-67, and 450-467. Especially 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of his reign, Yao was supposed to have appointed four ministerial officials (two sets of two brothers) to make the necessary astronomical observations for a reformed calendar. Each of these individuals were sent to the limits of the royal territory, one in each of the [[cardinal directions]], where they were supposed to observe certain stars at sunset on each of the solstices and equinoxes, so the results could then be compared, and the calendar accordingly adjusted. K. C. Wu cites references from two modern astronomers that largely confirm a date of around 2200 for Yao's reign, which is in accord with traditional, accepted dating.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 66-67 and 467&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more mythological view of Yao and his reign, this evidence for accurate astronomical observations could be interpreted  as an intrusion of archeoastronomy into the realm of myth.

==History==
As early as 1839, the German mathematician and physicist [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] postulated that an electrically conducting region of the atmosphere could account for observed variations of Earth's magnetic field. Sixty years later, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] received the first trans-Atlantic radio signal on December 12, 1901, in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]] (now in [[Canada]]) using a {{convert|152.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} kite-supported antenna for reception. The transmitting station in [[Poldhu]], Cornwall, used a spark-gap [[transmitter]] to produce a signal with a [[frequency]] of approximately 500&amp;nbsp;[[Kilohertz|kHz]] and a power of 100 times more than any radio signal previously produced. The message received was three dits, the [[Morse code]] for the letter '''S'''. To reach Newfoundland the signal would have to bounce off the ionosphere twice. Dr. [[Jack Belrose]] has contested this, however, based on theoretical and experimental work.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Belrose, "[http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/radio/radio_differences.html Fessenden and Marconi: Their Differing Technologies and Transatlantic Experiments During the First Decade of this Century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123214652/http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/radio/radio_differences.html |date=2009-01-23 }}". International Conference on 100 Years of Radio, 5–7 September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marconi did achieve transatlantic wireless communications in [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia]], one year later.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In 1902, [[Oliver Heaviside]] proposed the existence of the [[Kennelly–Heaviside layer]] of the ionosphere which bears his name. Heaviside's proposal included means by which radio signals are transmitted around the Earth's curvature. Heaviside's proposal, coupled with Planck's law of black body radiation, may have hampered the growth of radio astronomy for the detection of electromagnetic waves from celestial bodies until 1932 (and the development of high-frequency radio transceivers). Also in 1902, [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly]] discovered some of the ionosphere's radio-electrical properties.

In 1912, the [[U.S. Congress]] imposed the [[Radio Act of 1912]] on [[amateur radio operators]], limiting their operations to frequencies above 1.5&amp;nbsp;MHz (wavelength 200 meters or smaller). The government thought those frequencies were useless. This led to the discovery of HF radio propagation via the ionosphere in 1923.

In 1926, Scottish physicist [[Robert Watson-Watt]] introduced the term ''ionosphere'' in a letter published only in 1969 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'':

{{Quotation|We have in quite recent years seen the universal adoption of the term 'stratosphere'..and..the companion term 'troposphere'... The term 'ionosphere', for the region in which the main characteristic is large scale ionisation with considerable mean free paths, appears appropriate as an addition to this series.}}

In the early 1930s, test transmissions of [[Radio Luxembourg]] inadvertently provided evidence of the first radio modification of the ionosphere; [[HAARP]] ran a series of experiments in 2017 using the eponymous Luxembourg Effect.&lt;ref name="Gakona HAARPoon 2017"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/gakonahaarpoon/operations-news |title=Gakona HAARPoon 2017 |date=2017-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220175950/https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/gakonahaarpoon/operations-news |archivedate=2017-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward V. Appleton]] was awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1947 for his confirmation in 1927 of the existence of the ionosphere. [[Lloyd Berkner]] first measured the height and density of the ionosphere. This permitted the first complete theory of short-wave radio propagation. [[Maurice V. Wilkes]] and [[J. A. Ratcliffe]] researched the topic of radio propagation of very long radio waves in the ionosphere. [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] has developed a theory of electromagnetic wave propagation in plasmas such as the ionosphere.

In 1962, the [[Canada|Canadian]] satellite [[Alouette 1]] was launched to study the ionosphere. Following its success were [[Alouette 2]] in 1965 and the two [[ISIS (satellite)|ISIS]] satellites in 1969 and 1971, further AEROS-A  and -B in 1972 and 1975, all for measuring the ionosphere.

On July 26, 1963 the first operational geosynchronous satellite Syncom 2 was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harveycohen.net/crcss/history.html|title=Firsts in the Space Race. From an Australian perspective|author=|date=|website=harveycohen.net|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911162138/http://harveycohen.net/crcss/history.html|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board radio beacons on this satellite (and its successors) enabled – for the first time – the measurement of [[total electron content]] (TEC) variation along a radio beam from geostationary orbit to an earth receiver. (The rotation of the plane of polarization directly measures TEC along the path.)  Australian geophysicist Elizabeth Essex-Cohen from 1969 onwards was using this technique to monitor the atmosphere above Australia and Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harveycohen.net/essex|title=Elizabeth  A. Essex-Cohen Ionospheric Physics Papers etc|author=|date=|website=harveycohen.net|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911205109/http://harveycohen.net/essex/|archivedate=11 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geophysics==
The ionosphere is a shell of [[electron]]s  and electrically charged [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s that surrounds the Earth, stretching from a height of about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} to more than {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It exists primarily due to [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the [[Sun]].

The lowest part of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the [[troposphere]] extends from the surface to about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Above that is the [[stratosphere]], followed by the [[mesosphere]]. In the stratosphere incoming solar radiation creates the [[ozone layer]]. At heights of above {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in the [[thermosphere]], the atmosphere is so thin that free electrons can exist for short periods of time before they are captured by a nearby positive [[ion]]. The number of these free electrons is sufficient to affect [[radio propagation]]. This portion of the atmosphere is partially ''ionized'' and contains a [[Plasma physics|plasma]] which is referred to as the ionosphere.

[[Ultraviolet]] (UV), [[X-ray]] and shorter [[wavelength]]s of [[solar radiation]] are ''ionizing,'' since [[photon]]s at these frequencies contain sufficient energy to dislodge an [[electron]] from a neutral gas [[atom]] or [[molecule]] upon absorption. In this process the light electron obtains a high velocity so that the [[temperature]] of the created electronic gas is much higher (of the order of thousand K) than the one of ions and neutrals. The reverse process to [[ionization]] is [[Recombination (chemistry)|recombination]], in which a free electron is "captured" by a positive ion. Recombination occurs spontaneously, and causes the emission of a photon carrying away the energy produced upon recombination. As gas density increases at lower altitudes, the recombination process prevails, since the gas molecules and ions are closer together. The balance between these two processes determines the quantity of ionization present.

Ionization depends primarily on the [[Sun]] and its [[solar variation|activity]]. The amount of ionization in the ionosphere varies greatly with the amount of radiation received from the Sun. Thus there is a [[Day|diurnal]] (time of day) effect and a seasonal effect. The local winter [[Earth|hemisphere]] is tipped away from the Sun, thus there is less received solar radiation. The activity of the Sun is associated with the [[sunspot cycle]], with more radiation occurring with more sunspots. Radiation received also varies with geographical location (polar, [[auroral]] zones, [[mid-latitudes]], and equatorial regions). There are also mechanisms that disturb the ionosphere and decrease the ionization. There are disturbances such as [[solar flare]]s and the associated release of charged particles into the [[solar wind]] which reaches the Earth and interacts with its [[geomagnetic]] field.

==The ionospheric layers==
[[File:Ionosphere Layers en.svg|thumb|400px|Ionospheric layers....]]

At night the F layer is the only layer of significant ionization present, while the ionization in the E and D layers is extremely low. During the day, the D and E layers become much more heavily ionized, as does the F layer, which develops an additional, weaker region of ionisation known as the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; layer. The F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer persists by day and night and is the main region responsible for the refraction and reflection of radio waves.

===D layer===
The D layer is the innermost layer, {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface of the Earth. Ionization here is due to [[Lyman series]]-alpha hydrogen radiation at a [[wavelength]] of 121.6 [[nanometre]] (nm) ionizing [[nitric oxide]] (NO). In addition, high [[space weather|solar activity]] can generate hard X-rays (wavelength {{nowrap|&lt; 1 nm}}) that ionize N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Recombination rates are high in the D layer, so there are many more neutral air molecules than ions.

Medium frequency (MF) and lower high frequency (HF) [[radio wave]]s are significantly attenuated within the D layer, as the passing radio waves cause electrons to move, which then collide with the neutral molecules, giving up their energy. Lower frequencies experience greater absorption because they move the electrons farther, leading to greater chance of collisions. This is the main reason for [[Ionospheric absorption|absorption of HF radio waves]], particularly at 10&amp;nbsp;MHz and below, with progressively less absorption at higher frequencies. This effect peaks around noon and is reduced at night due to a decrease in the D layer's thickness; only a small part remains due to [[cosmic rays]]. A common example of the D layer in action is the disappearance of distant AM [[broadcast band]] stations in the daytime.

During [[solar proton event]]s, ionization can reach unusually high levels in the D-region over high and polar latitudes. Such very rare events are known as Polar Cap Absorption (or PCA) events, because the increased ionization significantly enhances the absorption of radio signals passing through the region.&lt;ref name="Rose1962"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=D.C.|last2=Ziauddin|first2=Syed|title=The polar cap absorption effect|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=June 1962|volume=1|issue=1|pages=115|doi=10.1007/BF00174638|accessdate=|bibcode=1962SSRv....1..115R}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, absorption levels can increase by many tens of dB during intense events, which is enough to absorb most (if not all) transpolar HF radio signal transmissions. Such events typically last less than 24 to 48 hours.

===E layer===
The [[Kennelly–Heaviside layer|E layer]] is the middle layer, {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface of the Earth. Ionization is due to soft X-ray (1–10&amp;nbsp;nm) and far ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation ionization of molecular [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Normally, at oblique incidence, this layer can only reflect radio waves having frequencies lower than about 10&amp;nbsp;MHz and may contribute a bit to absorption on frequencies above. However, during intense [[sporadic E]] events, the E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; layer can reflect frequencies up to 50&amp;nbsp;MHz and higher. The vertical structure of the E layer is primarily determined by the competing effects of ionization and recombination. At night the E layer weakens because the primary source of ionization is no longer present. After sunset an increase in the height of the E layer maximum increases the range to which radio waves can travel by reflection from the layer.

This region is also known as the [[Kennelly–Heaviside layer]] or simply the Heaviside layer. Its existence was predicted in 1902 independently and almost simultaneously by the American electrical engineer [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly]] (1861–1939) and the British physicist [[Oliver Heaviside]] (1850–1925). However, it was not until 1924 that its existence was detected by [[Edward V. Appleton]] and [[Miles Aylmer Fulton Barnett|Miles Barnett]].

===E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;===
The E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; layer ([[wikt:sporadic#Adjective|sporadic]] E-layer) is characterized by small, thin clouds of intense ionization, which can support reflection of radio waves, rarely up to 225&amp;nbsp;MHz. Sporadic-E events may last for just a few minutes to several hours. [[Sporadic E propagation]] makes VHF-operating [[Amateur radio high bands|radio amateurs]] very excited, as propagation paths that are generally unreachable can open up. There are multiple causes of sporadic-E that are still being pursued by researchers. This propagation occurs most frequently during the summer months when high signal levels may be reached. The skip distances are generally around {{convert|1640|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Distances for one hop propagation can be anywhere from {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Double-hop reception over {{convert|3500|km|mi|abbr=on}} is possible.

===F layer===
{{main|F region}}

The [[F region|F layer]] or region, also known as the Appleton–Barnett layer, extends from about {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} to more than {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface of Earth. It is the layer with the highest electron density, which implies signals penetrating this layer will escape into space. Electron production is dominated by [[extreme ultraviolet]] (UV, 10–100&amp;nbsp;nm) radiation ionizing atomic oxygen. The F layer consists of one layer (F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at night, but during the day, a secondary peak (labelled F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) often forms in the electron density profile. Because the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer remains by day and night, it is responsible for most [[skywave]] propagation of [[radio]] waves and long distances [[high frequency]] (HF, or [[shortwave]]) radio communications.

Above the F layer, the number of [[oxygen]] ions decreases and lighter ions such as hydrogen and helium become dominant. This region above the F layer peak and below the [[plasmasphere]] is called the topside ionosphere.

From 1972 to 1975 [[NASA]] launched the [[AEROS (satellite)|AEROS and AEROS B]] satellites to study the F region.&lt;ref name="Yenne"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yenne, Bill|title=''The Encyclopedia of US Spacecraft''|publisher=Exeter Books (A Bison Book), New York|date=1985|isbn=978-0-671-07580-4}} p. 12 '''AEROS'''&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Ionospheric model}}Ionospheric model==
An '''ionospheric model''' is a mathematical description of the ionosphere as a function of location, altitude, day of year, phase of the sunspot cycle and geomagnetic activity. Geophysically, the state of the ionospheric [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] may be described by four parameters: ''electron density, electron and ion [[temperature]]'' and, since several species of ions are present, ''ionic composition''. [[Radio propagation]] depends uniquely on electron density.

Models are usually expressed as computer programs.  The model may be based on basic physics of the interactions of the ions and electrons with the neutral atmosphere and sunlight, or it may be a statistical description based on a large number of observations or a combination of physics and observations. One of the most widely used models is the [[International Reference Ionosphere]] (IRI),&lt;ref&gt;Bilitza, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on data and specifies the four parameters just mentioned. The IRI is an international project sponsored by the [[Committee on Space Research]] (COSPAR) and the [[International Union of Radio Science]] (URSI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/modelweb/ionos/iri.html |title=International Reference Ionosphere |publisher=Ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223151912/http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/modelweb/ionos/iri.html |archivedate=2011-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The major data sources are the worldwide network of [[ionosonde]]s, the powerful [[incoherent scatter]] radars (Jicamarca, [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]], Millstone Hill, Malvern, St Santin), the ISIS and Alouette topside sounders, and in situ instruments on several satellites and rockets. IRI is updated yearly. IRI is more accurate in describing the variation of the electron density from bottom of the ionosphere to the altitude of maximum density than in describing the [[total electron content]] (TEC). Since 1999 this model is "International Standard" for the terrestrial ionosphere (standard TS16457).

==Persistent anomalies to the idealized model==
[[Ionogram]]s allow deducing, via computation, the true shape of the different layers. Nonhomogeneous structure of the [[electron]]/[[ion]]-[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] produces rough echo traces, seen predominantly at night and at higher latitudes, and during disturbed conditions.

===Winter anomaly===
At mid-latitudes, the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer daytime ion production is higher in the summer, as expected, since the Sun shines more directly on the Earth. However, there are seasonal changes in the molecular-to-atomic ratio of the neutral atmosphere that cause the summer ion loss rate to be even higher. The result is that the increase in the summertime loss overwhelms the increase in summertime production, and total F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ionization is actually lower in the local summer months. This effect is known as the winter anomaly. The anomaly is always present in the northern hemisphere, but is usually absent in the southern hemisphere during periods of low solar activity.

===Equatorial anomaly===
[[Image:Diurnal ionospheric current.jpg|frame|right|Electric currents created in sunward ionosphere.]]
Within approximately ± 20 degrees of the ''magnetic equator'', is the ''[[equator]]ial anomaly''. It is the occurrence of a trough in the ionization in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer at the equator and crests at about 17 degrees in magnetic latitude. The Earth's [[magnetic field]] lines are horizontal at the magnetic equator. Solar heating and [[tidal]] oscillations in the lower ionosphere move plasma up and across the magnetic field lines. This sets up a sheet of electric current in the E region which, with the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] magnetic field, forces ionization up into the F layer, concentrating at ± 20 degrees from the magnetic equator. This phenomenon is known as the ''equatorial fountain''.

===Equatorial electrojet===
The worldwide solar-driven wind results in the so-called Sq (solar quiet) current system in the E region of the Earth's ionosphere ([[ionospheric dynamo region]]) ({{convert|100–130|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude). Resulting from this current is an electrostatic field directed west–east (dawn–dusk) in the equatorial day side of the ionosphere. At the magnetic dip equator, where the geomagnetic field is horizontal, this electric field results in an enhanced eastward current flow within ± 3 degrees of the magnetic equator, known as the [[equatorial electrojet]].

==Ephemeral ionospheric perturbations==
===X-rays: sudden ionospheric disturbances (SID)===
When the Sun is active, strong [[solar flare]]s can occur that will hit the sunlit side of Earth with hard X-rays. The X-rays will penetrate to the D-region, releasing electrons that will rapidly increase absorption, causing a high frequency (3–30&amp;nbsp;MHz) radio blackout. During this time very low frequency (3–30&amp;nbsp;kHz) signals will be reflected by the D layer instead of the E layer, where the increased atmospheric density will usually increase the absorption of the wave and thus dampen it. As soon as the X-rays end, the [[sudden ionospheric disturbance]] (SID) or radio black-out ends as the electrons in the D-region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal.

===Protons: polar cap absorption (PCA)===
Associated with solar flares is a release of high-energy protons. These particles can hit the Earth within 15 minutes to 2 hours of the solar flare. The protons spiral around and down the magnetic field lines of the Earth and penetrate into the atmosphere near the magnetic poles increasing the ionization of the D and E layers. PCA's typically last anywhere from about an hour to several days, with an average of around 24 to 36 hours. [[Coronal mass ejection]]s can also release energetic protons that enhance D-region absorption in the polar regions.

===Geomagnetic storms===
A [[geomagnetic storm]] is a temporary intense disturbance of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]].
* During a geomagnetic storm the F₂ layer will become unstable, fragment, and may even disappear completely.
* In the Northern and Southern pole regions of the Earth [[polar aurora|aurora]]e will be observable in the sky.

===Lightning===
[[Lightning]] can cause ionospheric perturbations in the D-region in one of two ways. The first is through VLF (very low frequency) radio waves launched into the [[magnetosphere]]. These so-called "whistler" mode waves can interact with radiation belt particles and cause them to precipitate onto the ionosphere, adding ionization to the D-region. These disturbances are called "lightning-induced [[electron precipitation]]" (LEP) events.

Additional ionization can also occur from direct heating/ionization as a result of huge motions of charge in lightning strikes. These events are called early/fast.

In 1925, C. T. R. Wilson proposed a mechanism by which electrical discharge from lightning storms could propagate upwards from clouds to the ionosphere. Around the same time, Robert Watson-Watt, working at the Radio Research Station in Slough, UK, suggested that the ionospheric sporadic E layer (E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) appeared to be enhanced as a result of lightning but that more work was needed. In 2005, C. Davis and C. Johnson, working at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, UK, demonstrated that the E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; layer was indeed enhanced as a result of lightning activity. Their subsequent research has focused on the mechanism by which this process can occur.

==Applications==
===Radio communication{{anchor|Radio application}}===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Triple J]] --&gt;
Due to the ability of ionized atmospheric gases to [[refract]] high frequency (HF, or [[shortwave]]) radio waves, the ionosphere can reflect radio waves directed into the sky back toward the Earth.  Radio waves directed at an angle into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon.  This technique, called "skip" or "[[skywave]]" propagation, has been used since the 1920s to communicate at international or intercontinental distances.  The returning radio waves can reflect off the Earth's surface into the sky again, allowing greater ranges to be achieved with multiple [[Hop (telecommunications)|hop]]s. This communication method is variable and unreliable, with reception over a given path depending on time of day or night, the seasons, weather, and the 11-year [[sunspot cycle]].  During the first half of the 20th century it was widely used for transoceanic telephone and telegraph service, and business and diplomatic communication. Due to its relative unreliability, shortwave radio communication has been mostly abandoned by the telecommunications industry, though it remains important for high-latitude communication where satellite-based radio communication is not possible. Some broadcasting stations and automated services still use [[shortwave radio]] frequencies, as do [[radio amateur]] hobbyists for private recreational contacts.

====Mechanism of refraction====
When a radio wave reaches the ionosphere, the [[electric field]] in the wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into [[oscillation]] at the same frequency as the radio wave. Some of the radio-frequency energy is given up to this resonant oscillation. The oscillating electrons will then either be lost to recombination or will re-radiate the original wave energy. Total refraction can occur when the collision frequency of the ionosphere is less than the radio frequency, and if the electron density in the ionosphere is great enough.

A qualitative understanding of how an electromagnetic wave propagates through the ionosphere can be obtained by recalling [[geometric optics]].  Since the ionosphere is a plasma, it can be shown that the [[refractive index]] is less than unity.  Hence, the electromagnetic "ray" is bent away from the normal rather than toward the normal as would be indicated when the refractive index is greater than unity.  It can also be shown that the refractive index of a plasma, and hence the ionosphere, is frequency-dependent, see [[Dispersion (optics)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lied|first1=Finn|title=High Frequency Radio Communications with Emphasis on Polar Problems|date=1967|publisher=Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[critical frequency]] is the limiting frequency at or below which a radio wave is reflected by an ionospheric layer at vertical [[angle of incidence (optics)|incidence]]. If the transmitted frequency is higher than the [[plasma frequency]] of the ionosphere, then the electrons cannot respond fast enough, and they are not able to re-radiate the signal. It is calculated as shown below:

: &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{critical}} = 9 \times\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt;

where N = electron density per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;critical&lt;/sub&gt; is in Hz.

The Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) is defined as the upper frequency limit that can be used for transmission between two points at a specified time.

: &lt;math&gt;f_\text{muf} = \frac{f_\text{critical}}{ \sin \alpha} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = [[angle of attack]], the angle of the wave relative to the [[horizon]], and sin is the [[sine]] function.

The [[cutoff frequency]] is the frequency below which a radio wave fails to penetrate a layer of the ionosphere at the incidence angle required for transmission between two specified points by refraction from the layer.

===Other applications===
The [[open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[electrodynamic tether]], which uses the ionosphere, is being researched. The [[space tether]] uses plasma contactors and the ionosphere as parts of a circuit to extract energy from the Earth's magnetic field by [[electromagnetic induction]].

==Measurements==
===Overview===
Scientists explore the structure of the ionosphere by a wide variety of methods. They include:
* passive observations of optical and radio emissions generated in the ionosphere
* bouncing radio waves of different frequencies from it
* [[incoherent scatter]] radars such as the [[EISCAT]], Sondre Stromfjord, [[Millstone Hill Observatory|Millstone Hill]], [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]], and [[Jicamarca Radio Observatory|Jicamarca]] radars
* coherent scatter radars such as the [[Super Dual Auroral Radar Network|Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)]] radars,
* special receivers to detect how the reflected waves have changed from the transmitted waves.

A variety of experiments, such as HAARP ([[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program]]), involve high power radio transmitters to modify the properties of the ionosphere. These investigations focus on studying the properties and behavior of ionospheric plasma, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and military purposes. HAARP was started in 1993 as a proposed twenty-year experiment, and is currently active near Gakona, Alaska.

The SuperDARN radar project researches the high- and mid-latitudes using coherent backscatter of radio waves in the 8 to 20&amp;nbsp;MHz range. Coherent backscatter is similar to Bragg scattering in crystals and involves the constructive interference of scattering from ionospheric density irregularities. The project involves more than 11 different countries and multiple radars in both hemispheres.

Scientists are also examining the ionosphere by the changes to radio waves, from satellites and stars, passing through it. The [[Arecibo radio telescope]] located in [[Puerto Rico]], was originally intended to study Earth's ionosphere.

===Ionograms===
{{main|Ionogram}}
Ionograms show the virtual heights and '''critical frequencies''' of the ionospheric layers and which are measured by an [[ionosonde]]. An ionosonde sweeps a range of frequencies, usually from 0.1 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz, transmitting at vertical incidence to the ionosphere. As the frequency increases, each wave is refracted less by the ionization in the layer, and so each penetrates further before it is reflected. Eventually, a frequency is reached that enables the wave to penetrate the layer without being reflected. For ordinary mode waves, this occurs when the transmitted frequency just exceeds the peak plasma, or critical, frequency of the layer. Tracings of the reflected high frequency radio pulses are known as ionograms. Reduction rules are given in: "URSI Handbook of Ionogram Interpretation and Reduction", edited by [[William Roy Piggott]] and [[Karl Rawer]], Elsevier Amsterdam, 1961 (translations into Chinese, French, Japanese and Russian are available).

===Incoherent scatter radars===
[[Incoherent scatter]] radars operate above the critical frequencies. Therefore, the technique allows probing the ionosphere, unlike ionosondes, also above the electron density peaks. The thermal fluctuations of the electron density scattering the transmitted signals lack [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]], which gave the technique its name. Their power spectrum contains information not only on the density, but also on the ion and electron temperatures, ion masses and drift velocities.

=== GNSS radio occultation ===
[[Radio occultation]] is a remote sensing technique where a GNSS signal tangentially scrapes the Earth, passing through the atmosphere, and is received by a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. As the signal passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted, curved and delayed. An LEO satellite samples the total electron content and bending angle of many such signal paths as it watches the GNSS satellite rise or set behind the Earth. Using an Inverse [[Abel transform|Abel's transform]], a radial profile of refractivity at that tangent point on earth can be reconstructed.

Major GNSS radio occultation missions include the [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]], [[CHAMP (satellite)|CHAMP]], and [[Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate|COSMIC]].

== Indices of the ionosphere ==
In empirical models of the ionosphere such as Nequick, the following indices are used as indirect indicators of the state of the ionosphere.

===Solar intensity===
F10.7 and R12 are two indices commonly used in ionospheric modelling. Both are valuable for their long historical records covering multiple solar cycles. F10.7 is a measurement of the intensity of solar radio emissions at a frequency of 2800&amp;nbsp;MHz made using a ground [[radio telescope]]. R12 is a 12 months average of daily sunspot numbers.  Both indices have been shown to be correlated to each other.

However, both indices are only indirect indicators of solar ultraviolet and X-ray emissions, which are primarily responsible for causing ionization in the Earth's upper atmosphere. We now have data from the [[GOES]] spacecraft that measures the background '''X-ray flux''' from the Sun, a parameter more closely related to the ionization levels in the ionosphere.

=== Geomagnetic disturbances ===
* The ''[[A-index|A]]''- and ''[[K-index|K]]''-indices are a measurement of the behavior of the horizontal component of the '''geomagnetic field'''. The ''K''-index uses a scale from 0 to 9 to measure the change in the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field. A new ''K''-index is determined at the [[Boulder Geomagnetic Observatory]].
* The geomagnetic activity levels of the Earth are measured by the fluctuation of the Earth's magnetic field in [[SI]] units called [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s (or in non-SI [[gauss (unit)|gauss]], especially in older literature). The Earth's magnetic field is measured around the planet by many observatories. The data retrieved is processed and turned into measurement indices. Daily measurements for the entire planet are made available through an estimate of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;-index, called the ''planetary A-index'' (PAI).

==GPS/GNSS ionospheric correction==
{{stub section|date=October 2013}}
{{see also|Total electron content}}
There are a number of models used to understand the effects of the ionosphere global navigation satellite systems. The Klobuchar model is currently used to compensate for ionospheric effects in [[GPS]]. This model was developed at the US Air Force Geophysical Research Laboratory circa 1974 by John (Jack) Klobuchar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ion.org/awards/2003-ionfellow-Klobuchar.cfm|title=ION Fellow - Mr. John A.

==Ionospheres of other planets and natural satellites==
Objects in the Solar System that have appreciable atmospheres (i.e., all of the major planets and many of the larger [[natural satellite]]s) generally produce ionospheres.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Planets known to have ionospheres include [[Atmosphere of Venus#Upper atmosphere and ionosphere|Venus]],

==History of term==
Essays in ''[[Libération]]'' and [[France 24]] on the history of this term do not claim to find the definitive origin of this term, rather, both publications trace the term as far back as a 2002 use in ''New Judeophobia'', a book by [[Pierre-André Taguieff]], historian of ideas, who describes Islamo-fascism as a type of anti-Zionism popular among "the new third-worldist, neo-communist and neo-leftist configuration, better known as the 'anti-globalization movement.' "&lt;ref name="FaureIslamoGauchisme"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faure|first1=Sonya|title=Islamo-gauchisme, aux origines d'une expression médiatique|url=http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2016/04/14/islamo-gauchisme-aux-origines-d-une-expression-mediatique_1445857|accessdate=19 March 2017|publisher=Liberation|date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QuestcequecetIslamoGauchisme"&gt;{{cite news|title=Qu'est ce que cet "islamo-gauchisme" dont le camp Valls accuse Hamon ?|url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20170125-islamo-gauchisme-signification-manuel-valls-accuse-benoit-hamon-primaire|accessdate=28 March 2017|publisher=France 24|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed in 2016 by ''Liberation'' journalists Sonya Faure and Frantz Durupt, Taguieff is not certain whether he coined it or had heard it used, but he points out that the phrases Islamo-Progressives, and, in the 1980s, palestino-progressives were used as self-descriptions by the French left.&lt;ref name="FaureIslamoGauchisme"/&gt;

According to [[Alain Badiou]] and Eric Hazan, Islamo-leftists was coined by French police for reasons of simple utility.&lt;ref name="Alain Badiou"&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Alain Badiou]], Eric Hazan|title="Anti-Semitism is Everywhere" in France Today, Chapter in, ''Reflections On Anti-Semitism''|date=2013|publisher=Verso Books|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jazeera]] claims that the term Islamo-leftism was coined by [[Marine Le Pen]], who uses it "to describe what she considers an unhealthy alliance between "Islamist fanatics" and the [[French Left]]."&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Yasmine|title=French right focuses on 'radical' Muslims|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/04/201244102955800772.html|accessdate=3 November 2015|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

French philosopher [[Pascal Bruckner]] understands Islamo-leftism as  "the fusion between the atheist Far Left and religious radicalism."&lt;ref name=Bruckner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruckner|first1=Pascal|title=The Tyranny of Guilt: An Essay on Western Masochism|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1400834310|page=25|title-link=The Tyranny of Guilt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Bruckner, Islamo-leftism was "chiefly" conceived by British [[Trotskyism|Trotskyites]] of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]].  Because these dedicated Leftists perceive Islam's potential for fomenting societal unrest, they promote tactical, temporary alliances with reactionary Muslim parties.  According to Bruckner, Leftist adherents of [[Third-Worldism]] hope to use [[Islamism]] as a "battering-ram" to bring about the downfall of free-market capitalism, and they see the sacrifice of individual rights  - in particular, of women's rights - as an acceptable trade-off in service of the greater goal of destroying capitalism.  Bruckner contends that [[Islamists]], for their part, pretend to join the left in its opposition to racism, [[neocolonialism]], and globalization as a tactical and temporary means to achieve their true goal of imposing the "totalitarian theocracy" of Islamist government.&lt;ref name=Bruckner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pascal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pascal|first1=Julia|title=The Tyranny Of Guilt: An Essay On Western Masochism, By Pascal Bruckner, trans by Steven Rendall|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-tyranny-of-guilt-an-essay-on-western-masochism-by-pascal-bruckner-trans-by-steven-rendall-1951335.html|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist Maurice Fraser regards Islamo-leftism as part of a, "striking and recent abdication of the Enlightenment project of human rights, freedom, secularism, science and progress," on the part of the political left, particularly among the anti-globalization activists of the New Left.&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fraser|first1=Maurice|title=Is the Decline of the West Reversible?|journal=[[Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies|European View]]|date=11 November 2010|volume=2|issue=2|page=149|doi=10.1007/s12290-010-0128-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] has described "Islamo-leftism" as, "this grand new alliance between the reds and the new [[Sturmabteilung|browns]], of the axis which runs from Le Monde diplomatique to the death squads,"&lt;ref name="WaldenTwoIntellectuals"&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[George Walden]]|title=Public Enemies; Two French intellectuals fight it out.|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2011/12/levy-houellebecq-french|accessdate=19 March 2017|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|date=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a sort of "anti-American religion."&lt;ref name="HenriLévy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Bernard-Henri Lévy]]|title=Left in Dark Times: A Stand Against the New Barbarism|date=2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0812974720|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mark Silinsky]] of the [[United States Army War College]], Islamo-leftism is alliance of Islamists and leftists in opposition to Western values that can also be also referred to as the "red-green axis."&lt;ref name="Silinsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silinsky|first1=Mark|title=Jihad and the West: Black Flag over Babylon|date=2016|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253027207|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kpZNDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=%22islamo-leftism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22islamo-leftism%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silinsky characterizes the black-green alliance between [[Black Lives Matter]] and the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]] as an example of Islamo-leftism.&lt;ref name="Silinsky"/&gt;

According to [[Robert S. Wistrich]], "A poisonous anti-Jewish legacy can be found in Marx, Fourier, and Proudhon, extending through the orthodox Communists and "non-conformist" Trotskyists to the Islamo-Leftist hybrids of today who...  (are allied with) the [[Islamist]] anti-Semites of [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name="WistrichBetrayal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robert|first1=Wistrich|title=From Ambivalence to Betrayal: The Left, the Jews, and Israel|date=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803240834|page=xii|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yBvt4Fwc5XoC&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=%22islamo-leftist%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22islamo-leftist%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alvin Hirsch Rosenfeld]] describes Islamo Leftism as, "the hope, entertained by a revolutionary fringe, of seeing Islam become the spearhead of a new insurrection, engaged in a 'Holy War against global capitalism."&lt;ref name="RosenfeldDeciphering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Alvin|title=Deciphering the New Antisemitism|date=2015|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253018694|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ibfkCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22islamo-leftism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22islamo-leftism%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Islamo-leftism" in Iran ===
[[Shireen Hunter]] credits [[Mahmoud Taleghani]]'s reinterpretation of Islam in the light of Marxist theory in the 1970s with inspiring the "Islamo-leftist" group [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mujahaedin-e-Khalq]].&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Shireen|title=Iran's Foreign Policy in the Post-Soviet Era: Resisting the New International Order|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0313381942|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wLtA_J3VUt4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22islamo-leftist%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22islamo-leftist%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hunter, one of the goals of Islamo-leftism in the Muslim world during that period was to combat the Left by borrowing parts of its platform, thus hoping to attract economically disadvantaged groups like the [[Shia]] to Islamic politics. The result of these developments was the left-wing "radicalization of Islam" and "the emergence of what could be described as a leftist Islam."&lt;ref name=HunterFuture&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Shireen Hunter]]|title=The Future of Islam and the West|date=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0275962883|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunter describes the way in which "Islamo-leftist intellectuals (the Mujahedin e Khalq) and Islamo-liberal intellectuals (the Islamic wing of the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] and later the [[Freedom Movement of Iran|Freedom Movement]]) also directed anti-Pahlavi activities," which included guerrilla warfare.&lt;ref name="HunterVoices"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reformist Voices of Islam: Mediating Islam and Modernity|first=|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317461241|location=|page=|pages=42, 45|last1=[[Shireen Hunter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frictions later between the various Islamic groups that had participated in the [[Iranian Revolution]], with [[Morteza Motahhari]], a socially progressive ally of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] being assassinated by an Islamo-leftist followers of [[Ali Shariati]].&lt;ref name="HunterVoices" /&gt; According to [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]], the three major Iranian political groups — leftist, Islamist, and Islamo-leftist — active in the 1970s had revolutionary rather than liberal democratic ideologies.&lt;ref name=Roy&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]], chapter in book edited by Larry Diamond, Marc F.

==Use in fiction==

In his 2015 novel, ''[[Submission (novel)|Submission]]'', [[Michel Houellebecq]] has Robert Rediger, the fictional character who is a convert to Islam and university professor turned politician, describe Islamo-leftism as "a desperate attempt by moldering, putrefying, brain-dead [[Marxism|Marxists]] to hoist themselves out of the [[ash heap of history|dustbin of history]] by latching onto the coattails of Islam."&lt;ref name=Houellebecq&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houellebecq|first1=Michel|title=Submission|date=2015|publisher=Farrar, Straus, Giroux|pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrassHouellebecq"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brass|first1=Tom|title=Labour Markets, Identities, Controversies: Reviews and Essays, 1982-2016|date=2017|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004337091|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dtvzDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=Houellebecq++++%22islamo-leftism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Houellebecq%20%20%20%20%22islamo-leftism%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beef]] broth may be substituted for the anchovy broth. It is served with a sauce made from [[sesame oil]], ''[[Korean soy sauce|ganjang]]'' and small amounts of [[Chili powder|chili pepper powder]] and [[scallion]]s.

== History ==
The name derives from the [[Korean language|Korean]] word ''janchi'' (잔치, literally "feast" or "banquet"), because the noodle dish has been eaten for special occasions like wedding feasts, birthday parties, or ''[[hwangap]]'' (60th birthday celebration) throughout Korea. The word ''guksu'' means "noodles" in Korean, and noodles symbolise longevity - in life, in a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dtnews24.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=54110 |title=Janchiguksu, blessing for longevity (장수를 기원하는 ‘잔치국수) |publisher=dtnews24 |author=Lee Seong-hui (이성희)|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are records of ''guksu'' dating back to the [[Goryeo]] period. In the book ''Dongguk Isangguk Jeonjip'' Book 6 (hangul:동국이상국전집 6, hanja:東國李相國全集) there is a mention of ''guksu'' in a line of poetry, and in the book ''Goryeo Dogyeong'' (hangul:고려도경, hanja:高麗圖經) written by an envoy from the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] it is mentioned that ''guksu'' was eaten on special occasions as wheat was rare and expensive in Goryeo.&lt;ref name="guksu history"&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://www.tongilnews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=90270 Guksu's meaning], Tongil News 2010-05-20. Retrieved 2010-06-19&lt;/ref&gt; (The most common ingredients for noodles were [[buckwheat]] or [[starch]].)&lt;ref name="guksu history"/&gt;

== Popular culture ==
Because the noodles are traditionally eaten at weddings, the expression "When are you going to feed us ''guksu''?" is a way of asking "When are you going to get married?" and a wedding day might be referred as "a day to eat ''guksu''".&lt;ref name="guksu history"/&gt;

Following the [[impeachment of Park Geun-hye]], many Koreans ate fried chicken and janchi-guksu, which trended on Korean [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0103_201703101256578834_001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Koreans feel like chicken tonight after president's removal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/10/south-koreans-feel-like-chicken-tonight-after-presidents-removal|work=The Guardian|date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KeweenawPeninsula.svg|right|thumb|250px|Keweenaw Peninsula]]
The '''Keweenaw Peninsula''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|iː|w|ᵻ|n|ɔː}} {{respell|KEE|wi-naw}}, sometimes [[Yooper dialect|locally]] /ˈkiːvənɔː/) is the northernmost part of [[Michigan]]'s [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. It projects into [[Lake Superior]] and was the site of the first [[copper]] boom in the [[United States]]. As of the 2000 census, its population was roughly 43,200. Its major industries are now [[logging]] and [[tourism]], as well as jobs related to [[Michigan Technological University]] and [[Finlandia University]].

==Geology==
[[Image:Keweenaw structure.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Cross-section of the Lake Superior basin showing the tilted strata of volcanic rock that form both the Keweenaw Peninsula and [[Isle Royale]]]]
[[File:USGS Lake Superior syncline.png|thumb|350px|Lake Superior syncline]]
The ancient [[lava flow]]s of the Keweenaw Peninsula were produced during the [[Mesoproterozoic]] Era as a part of the [[Midcontinent Rift]] between 1.096 and 1.087 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/kewe/learn/nature/geologic-timeline.htm|title=Geologic Timeline - Keweenaw National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This volcanic activity produced the only strata on Earth where large-scale economically recoverable 97 percent pure [[native copper]] is found.

Much of the native copper found in the Keweenaw comes in either the form of cavity fillings on lava flow surfaces, which has a ''lacy'' consistency, or as ''"float" copper'', which is found as a solid mass.  Copper ore may occur within [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] or [[breccia]] as void or interclast fillings. The conglomerate layers occur as interbedded units within the volcanic pile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/geology/publications/pp/754-C/sec1.htm |last= Huber |first= N. King |year= 1973 |title= The Portage Lake Volcanics (Middle Keweenawan) on Isle Royale, Michigan |journal= Geological Survey Professional Paper |id= 754—C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Keweenaw Peninsula and [[Isle Royale]], formed by the Midcontinent Rift System, are the only sites in the United States with evidence of prehistoric aboriginal mining of copper.  Artifacts made from this copper by these ancient Indians were traded as far south as present-day [[Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 102-543 (Oct. 27, 1992); 106 STAT. 3569&lt;/ref&gt; These areas are also the unique location where [[chlorastrolite]], the state gem of Michigan, can be found.

[[Image:MichiganCopperIsland.svg|right|thumb|250px|Copper Island]]
The northern end of the peninsula is sometimes referred to as [[Copper Island]] (or ''"Kuparisaari"'' by Finnish immigrants), although this term is becoming less common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Finns in Michigan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcJVNoE3BuUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA442&amp;lpg=RA1-PA442&amp;dq=%22Copper+Island%22+Michigan+origins#PPA76,M1 |page=76 |last1= Holmio |first1= Armas K. E. |last2= Ryynanen, |first2= Ellen M.  |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] | isbn=978-0-8143-2974-0 |year=2001 |accessdate=2008-09-28}} ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ethnicity.lib.mtu.edu/groups_Finns.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070308124318/http://ethnicity.lib.mtu.edu/groups_Finns.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2007-03-08 |title= An Interior Ellis Island: Ethnic Diversity and the Peopling of Michigan’s Copper Country, Keweenaw Ethnic Groups: The Finns |work= MTU Archives and Copper Country Historical Collection |publisher= J. Robert Van Pelt Library, [[Michigan Technological University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is separated from the rest of the peninsula by the [[Keweenaw Waterway]], a natural waterway which was dredged and expanded in the 1860s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.exploringthenorth.com/houghton/main.html |work= Exploring the North |title= Houghton}}&lt;/ref&gt; across the [[peninsula]] between the cities of [[Houghton, Michigan|Houghton]] (named for [[Douglass Houghton]]) on the south side and [[Hancock, Michigan|Hancock]] on the north.

A Keweenaw [[Water trail|Water Trail]] has been established around Copper Island.  The Water Trail stretches approximately {{convert|125|mi|km}} and can be paddled in five to ten days, depending on weather and water conditions.

The [[Keweenaw Fault]] runs fairly lengthwise through both Keweenaw and neighboring Houghton counties. This ancient geological slip has given rise to cliffs. [[U.S. Route 41 in Michigan|U.S. Highway&amp;nbsp;41]] (US&amp;nbsp;41) and [[Brockway Mountain Drive]], north of Calumet, were constructed along the cliff line.&lt;!-- Note: The roads came ''after'' the cliffs. --&gt;

==Climate==
[[Image:Keweenaw Snow Thermometer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Keweenaw Snow-mometer north of Mohawk on US&amp;nbsp;41]]
Lake Superior significantly controls the climate of the Keweenaw Peninsula, keeping winters milder than those in surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/kewe/index.htm|title=Keweenaw|publisher=US National Park Serive|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring is cool and brief, transitioning into a summer with highs near {{convert|70|F|C}}. Fall begins in September, with winter beginning in mid-November.

The peninsula receives copious amounts of [[lake-effect snow]] from Lake Superior. Official records are maintained close to the base of the peninsula in [[Hancock, Michigan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtu.edu/alumni/favorites/snowfall/snowfall.html|title=Snowfall Records|publisher=Michigan Technological University|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the annual snowfall average is about {{convert|220|in|cm}}. Farther north, in a community called [[Delaware, Michigan|Delaware]], an unofficial average of about {{convert|240|in|cm}} is maintained. At Delaware, the record snowfall for one season was {{convert|390|in|cm}} in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleharborweb.net/archive/kewsnorec.htm|title=Keweenaw Snowfall Record|publisher=Eagle Harbor Web|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Averages over {{convert|250|in|cm}} certainly occur in the higher elevations closer to the tip of the peninsula.

==History==
[[File:Copper and calcite (Mesoproterozoic, 1.05-1.06 Ga; Pewabic Lode, Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA) 3 (16679632374).jpg|thumb|Spectacular copper and calcite specimen from the Pewabic Lode, Keweenaw Peninsula.]]
Beginning as early as seven thousand years ago and apparently peaking around 3000 B.C., Native Americans dug copper from the southern shore of Lake Superior.  This development was possible in large part because, in this region, large deposits of copper were easily accessible in surface rock and from shallow diggings.  Native copper could be found as large nuggets and wiry masses. Copper as a resource for functional tooling achieved popularity around 3000 B.C., during the Middle Archaic Stage. The focus of copper working seems to have gradually shifted from functional tools to ornamental objects by the Late Archaic Stage c. 1200 B.C.   Native Americans would build a fire to heat the rock around and over a copper mass and, after heating, pour on cold water to crack the rock. The copper was then pounded out, using rock hammers and stone chisels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.ramtops.co.uk/copper.html |title= The State of Our Knowledge About Ancient Copper Mining in Michigan |journal= The Michigan Archaeologist |volume= 41 |issue= 2-3 |pages= 119–138 |year= 1995 |first= Susan R. |last= Martin |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160207073036/http://www.ramtops.co.uk/copper.html |archivedate= 2016-02-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Keweenaw's rich deposits of copper (and some silver) were extracted on an industrial scale beginning around the middle of the 19th century. The industry grew through the latter part of the century and employed thousands of people well into the 20th century. Hard rock mining in the region ceased in 1967 though copper sulfide deposits continued for some time after in Ontonagon. This vigorous industry created a need for educated mining professionals and directly led in 1885 to the founding of the Michigan Mining School (now [[Michigan Technological University]]) in [[Houghton, Michigan|Houghton]]. Although MTU discontinued its undergraduate mining engineering program in 2006, the university continues to offer engineering degrees in a variety of other disciplines.  (In 2012 mining engineering was restarted in the re-formed [http://www.mtu.edu/geo/ Department of Geological and Mining Engineering and Sciences].)
[[File:Keweenaw Forest.jpg|thumb|Second-Growth forest near the tip of the Keweenaw, facing west]]
Running concurrently with the mining boom in the Keweenaw was the white pine lumber boom. Trees were cut for timbers for mine shafts, to heat the communities around the large copper mines, and to help build a growing nation. Much of the logging at the time was done in winter due to the ease of operability with the snow. Due to the logging practices at that time, the forest of the Keweenaw looks much different today from 100 years ago.

US 41 terminates in the northern Keweenaw at the Michigan State Park housing Fort Wilkins. US 41 was the so-called "Military Trail" that started in Chicago in the 1900s and ended in the Keweenaw wilderness. The restored fort has numerous exhibits.

For detailed information on the region's mineralogical history, see the virtual tour of the peninsula written by the Mineralogical Society of America, found in "External links" on this page. Information on the geological formations of the region are also detailed.

From 1964 to 1971, the [[University of Michigan]] cooperated with [[NASA]] and the [[U.S. Navy]] to run the [[Keweenaw (Rocket launch site)|Keweenaw Rocket launch site]].

Many '''rivers in Europe''' have '''alternative names''' in different languages. Some rivers have also undergone [[geographical renaming|name changes]] for political or other reasons. This article attempts to give all known alternative names for all major European rivers. It also includes some lesser rivers that are important because of their location or history.

This article does not offer any opinion about what the "original", "official", "real", or "correct" name of any river is or was. Rivers are listed alphabetically by their '''current best-known name in English'''. The English version is followed by variants in other languages, in alphabetical order by name, and then by any historical variants and former names.

Foreign names that are the same as their English equivalents may be listed, to provide an answer to the question "What is that name in...?".

The '''national parks of [[South Korea]]''' are preserved parcels of [[public land]] on which most forms of development are prohibited. They cover a total of 6.6% of the country's area, and are typically located in mountainous or coastal regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index.go.kr/egams/stts/jsp/potal/stts/PO_STTS_IdxMain.jsp?idx_cd=1460&amp;bbs=INDX_001 |title= e-나라지표 국립공원현황|publisher= Statistics Korea|accessdate=2016-09-19|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's largest mountain park is [[Jirisan National Park]] in the southwest; this was also the first national park to be designated in 1967. The largest marine park is [[Dadohaehaesang National Park|Dadohaehaesang]], with an area of more than {{convert|2200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, but almost all of this is water. The smallest park is [[Wolchulsan National Park|Wolchulsan]], with an area of only {{convert|56.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

As of 2016, there are 22 national parks in South Korea; the parks, with the exception of [[Hallasan National Park]], are managed by the [[Korea National Park Service]], established in 1987.&lt;ref name="knps.or.kr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.knps.or.kr/AboutUs/NationalParks/Default.aspx?MenuNum=6&amp;Submenu=NationalParks |title=National Parks: About the Korea National Park Service |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Korea National Park Service |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Authority operates its own police force, and since 1998 has been under the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of Environment (South Korea)|Ministry of Environment]]. It was previously under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Construction.

'''Macroinvertebrate Community Index''' (MCI) is an [[Index (statistics)|index]] used in [[New Zealand]] to measure the [[water quality]] of fresh water streams.&lt;ref name="LAWADefn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroinvertebrate Community Index|url=https://www.lawa.org.nz/learn/glossary/m/macroinvertebrate-community-index-(mci)|website=www.lawa.org.nz|publisher=Land Air Water Aoteraroa|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence or lack of [[invertebrate|macroinvertebrates]] such as insects, worms and snails in a river or stream can give a [[Bioindicator|biological indicator]] on the health of that waterway.&lt;ref name="MFEMCI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroinvertebrate Community Composition (MCI)|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/more/environmental-reporting/reporting-act/fresh-water/river-condition-indicator/macroinvertebrates|website=Ministry for the Environment|publisher=Government of New Zealand|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCI assigns a number to each [[species]] of macroinvertebrate based on the sensitivity of that species to [[pollution]]. The index then calculates an average score.&lt;ref name="LAWADefn"/&gt; A higher score on the MCI generally indicates a more healthy stream.&lt;ref name="MFEMCI"/&gt;

The '''MCI (Macro invertebrate Community Index)''' relies on an allocation of scores to freshwater macroinvertebrates based on their pollution tolerances. Freshwater macroinvertebrates found in pristine conditions would score higher than those found in polluted areas.&lt;ref name="STARK 1993"&gt;Stark, J. D. (1993) Performance of the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Effects of sampling method, sample replication, water depth, current velocity, and substratum on index values. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 27:4, 463-478.&lt;/ref&gt; MCI values can be calculated using macroinvertebrate presence-absence data using this equation:&lt;ref name="STARK 1993"/&gt;

'''MCI = [(site score)/(# of scoring taxa)]*20'''

Previous [[water quality]] assessments have relied on both chemical and habitat analysis, however, these methods have been proven to be insufficient due to pollution from nonpoint sources.&lt;ref name="BENNETT"&gt;Bennett, H. H., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, J. A. Sawyer, and E. C. W. (2004) Development of an Invertebrate Community Index for an Alabama Coastal Plain Watershed. Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 40:1, 43-51&lt;/ref&gt; Species living in an aquatic environment may be the best natural indicator of environmental quality and reveal the effects of any habitat alteration or pollution,&lt;ref name="BENNETT"/&gt; and have proved to respond to a wide range of stressors such as [[sedimentation]], [[urbanization]], [[agricultural]] practices and forest harvesting effects.&lt;ref name="COLLIER"&gt;Collier, KJ. (2014) Wood decay rates and macroinvertebrate community structure along contrasting human pressure gradients (Waikato, New Zealand), New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 48:1, 97-111&lt;/ref&gt; Any changes that may occur in macroinvertebrate communities that lead to a reduction in diversity increase the dominance of pollution-tolerant invertebrates, such as [[oligochaetes]] and [[chironomids]].&lt;ref name="HALL"&gt;Hall, M. J., G. P. Closs and R. H. Riley. (2001) Relationships between land use and stream invertebrate community structure in a South Island, New Zealand, coastal stream catchment. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 35:3, 591-603&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a lack of species diversity and low [[biotic index]] scores of inhabitant macroinvertebrates may be an indicator of poor water quality.&lt;ref name="COLLINS"&gt;Collins, C. L., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, and E. C. Webber. (2008) Validation of an Invertebrate Community Index for Urban Streams for an Alabama Coastal Plains Watershed. Journal of The American Water Resources Association, 44(3), 663-669&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of water quality degradation is the greatest in low-elevation areas, where high intensity agriculture and urban development are the dominant land uses.&lt;ref name="LARNED"&gt;Larned, S. T., T. Snelder, M. J. Unwin, and G.B. McBride. (2016) Water quality in New Zealand rivers: current state and trends. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 50:3, 389-417&lt;/ref&gt;

Macro invertebrate communities are the preferred indicators of aquatic ecosystem health because they are very easy to both collect and identify, and have short life spans, thus responding very quickly to changes in their environment.&lt;ref name="COLLIER"/&gt; The MCI methods of utilizing macroinvertebrate communities to assess the overall health of an aquatic environment continues to be the most reliable, applicable, and widely acclaimed method around the world.&lt;ref name="OLOMUKORO"&gt;Olomukoro, J. O. and A. Dirisu. (2014) Macroinvertebrate Community and Pollution Tolerance Index in Edion and Omodo Rivers in Derived Savannah Wetlands in Southern Nigeria. Jordan Journal of Biological Sciences, 7:1, 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Variations on the MCI'''

In addition to the MCI indexed defined above, there are also two other variations of the MCI. The QMCI (Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index) and the SQMCI (Semi-Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index). Both MCI and QMCI are widely used in countries like New Zealand. The combination of widespread use and good performance of the MCI and the QMCI in detecting water quality in aquatic ecosystems has sparked interest in further refinement of the methods in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"&gt;Stark, J. D. (1998) SQMCI: A biotic index for freshwater macroinvertebrate coded‐abundance data. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 32:1, 55-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The QMCI, just like the MCI, was initially designed to evaluate the organic enrichment in aquatic ecosystems. The third index, the SQMCI, was created to reduce sampling and processing efforts required for the QMCI.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"&gt;Wright‐Stow, A. E. and Winterbourn, M. J. (2003) How well do New Zealand's stream‐monitoring indicators, the macroinvertebrate community index and its quantitative variant, correspond? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 37:2, 461-470.&lt;/ref&gt; The SQMCI will respond in a similar matter to the QMCI in community dominance, however, will require fewer samples to achieve the same precision. The SQMCI gives a comparative appraisal to the QMCI with under 40% of the [[exertion]], in circumstances that macroinvertebrate densities are not required. This diminishes expenses and also enhances the logical solidness of biomonitoring projects.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"/&gt; Both the QMCI and SQMCI are similar to the MCI in the way that they are graded on a 1 (extremely tolerant) to 10 (highly intolerant) scale. However, they differ in the way that MCI is calculated using presence-absence data whereas QMCI uses quantitative or percentage data.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt; Having a qualitative, quantitative, and semi-quantitative version of the same index has raised some questions as to if this is a good thing or not. All three indexes have the same purpose, which is to measure the quality of an aquatic ecosystem, however, there are no clear recommendations about when each one is most appropriate to be used. In a study conducted on 88 rivers, Searsbrook et al. (2000) concluded MCI is more useful than the QMCI for recognizing changes in stream water quality over time. Having three forms of a similar index may prompt to various conclusions and also opens the route for specific utilization of either file to give bias to a specific position or position taken by a specialist.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt; Consistency on the different versions of MCI have not yet been formally measured despite the communication that has been made to the public, managers and politicians.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt;
	

'''QMCI values can be calculated using:
QMCI = ∑_(i=1)^(i=s)▒(n_i*a_i)/N'''

SQMCI values can be calculated similar to QMCI except that coded abundances are substituted for actual counts. Example:

'''SQMCI = ∑_(i=1)^(i=s)▒(n_i*a_i)/N'''

'''Factors Influencing MCI'''
There are several factors which can affect the data acquisition of MCI when assessing the water quality of an aquatic ecosystem. Hard-bottom and Soft-bottom channels can often yield different results and many researchers will use two different versions of the MCI. For example, in a study by Stark &amp; Mallard (2007) they discuss that hard and soft bottom channels have separate versions of the MCI and the two versions can not be combined into one data set because of the differences in [[taxa]] and tolerance values.&lt;ref name="LARNED"/&gt;
	

[[Spatial variability]] is also of interest in terms of affecting the data acquired through MCI. Sites which are progressively down stream often tend to yield a lower MCI value. There may also be confounding influences between riffles, runs, or pools with a single stream reach.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"&gt;Stark, J. D. and N. Phillips. (2009) Seasonal variability in the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Are seasonal correction factors required? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 43:4, 867-882&lt;/ref&gt;
	

Depth and velocity have also been raised as a concern with regards to effecting results, however Stark (1993) investigated the influences of the sampling method, water depth, current velocity and [[substratum]] on the results and found that both MCI and QMCI are independent of depth, velocity, and substratum from macroinvertebrate samples collected from stony riffles.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"/&gt; This finding is an advantage for the assessment of water pollution.
	

There have been several studies conducted on seasonal variability, which has been considered the main influential factor on the assessment of water quality. It has been concluded that all models should test data that has been collected in the season as the reference data, which is being used.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"/&gt;
	

There have been several other factors such as water temperature, invertebrate life histories and dissolved oxygen levels that have all been explained as causes of seasonal variability. Warmer seasons have biotic indices that are indicative of poorer stream health.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"/&gt; Warmer seasons such as summer, would have increased temperatures therefore increasing water temperature and decreasing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water making the environment less ideal to aquatic macroinvertebrates. In return, this effects the density of macroinvertebrate population and changes the results of the indices.

'''Mediated transport''' refers to transport mediated by a [[membrane transport protein]]. Substances in the human body may be [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], [[Electrophile|electrophilic]], contain a positively or negatively charge, or have another property. As such there are times when those substances may not be able to pass over the [[cell membrane]] using protein-independent movement&lt;ref&gt;Lodish, Berk, Zipursky, H,A,SL (2000). ''Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition''. New York: W.H. Freeman. pp. Ch. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;. The cell membrane is imbedded with many membrane transport proteins that allow such molecules to travel in and out of the cell&lt;ref&gt;"Protein-Mediated Transport". ''content.openclass.com''. Retrieved 2018-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are three types of mediated transport: [[uniport]], [[symport]], and [[antiport]]. Things that can be transported are nutrients, ions, glucose, etc, all depending on the needs of the cell.

The '''moment distance index''' (MDI) is a shape-based metric or shape index that can be used to analyze [[Reflectance|spectral reflectance]] curves and waveform [[LiDAR]], proposed by Salas and Henebry in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salas|first=Eric Ariel L.|last2=Henebry|first2=Geoffrey M.|date=2013-12-19|title=A New Approach for the Analysis of Hyperspectral Data: Theory and Sensitivity Analysis of the Moment Distance Method|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/6/1/20|journal=Remote Sensing|volume=6|issue=1|pages=20–41|doi=10.3390/rs6010020|bibcode=2013RemS....6...20S}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Various approaches have been devised to analyze medium and fine spectral resolution data and maximize their use to extract specific information for vegetation biophysical and biochemical properties.  Combinations of spectral bands, called indices, have been used to diminish the effects of soil background and/or atmospheric conditions while highlighting specific spectral features associated with plant or canopy properties. [[Vegetation Indices|Vegetation indices]] (VIs) use the concept of band ratio and differences or weighted linear combinations to take advantage of the visible and NIR bands, two important spectral bands for vegetation studies, in measuring the photosynthetic activity of the plant and explore vegetation dynamics.  There is an extensive list of such indices, including the [[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index|normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)]], ratio-based indices such as the [[modified simplerRatio]], soil-distance-based indices such as the [[Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI)|modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI)]], and many others.  Whereas most indices incorporate two-band or three-band relations – slope-based, distance-based on soil line or optimized (slope-based and distance-based concepts combined) – no approach deals with the raw shape of the spectral curve.  MDI, however, investigates the shape of the reflectance curve using multiple spectral bands not considered by other indices, which could carry additional spectral information useful for vegetation monitoring.  

A full-waveform [[Light detection and ranging|Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR)]] system has the ability to record many returns per emitted pulse, as a function of time, to reveal the vertical structure of the illuminated object, showing position of the individual targets, and finer details of the signature of intercepted surfaces or the proportion of the canopy complexity. Information associated with the illuminated object can be decoded from the generated backscattered waveform, as key features of the waveform such as the shape, area, and power are directly related to the geometry of the illuminated object.  The richness of the LiDAR waveform holds a promise to address the challenge of characterizing in detail the geometric and reflection characteristics of vegetation structure, e.g., the vertical canopy volume distribution. MDI utilizes the raw waveform and place importance on its shape and its return power. MDI departs from the usual [[Gaussian|Gaussian modeling]] in detecting peaks (canopy and ground) for example in canopy height estimation and focus more on the full geometry (raw shape) and radiometry (raw power) of the LiDAR waveform to retain richness of the data. 

The moment distance is a matrix of distances computed from two reference locations (pivots) to each spectral or waveform point within the specified range. 

Assume that a curve (reflectance or absorption curve or backscattered waveform) is displayed in Cartesian coordinates with the abscissa displaying the wavelength ''λ'' or time lapse ''t'' and the ordinate displaying the reflectance ''ρ'' or the backscattered power ''p''.   Let the subscript LP denote the ''left pivot'' (located in a shorter wavelength for the spectral curve and earlier temporal reference point for the waveform) and subscript RP denote the ''right pivot'' (located in a longer wavelength for the spectral curve and later temporal reference point for the waveform). Let ''λ&lt;sub&gt;LP&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''λ&lt;sub&gt;RP&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the wavelength locations observed at the left and right pivots for a reflectance data, respectively, where left (right) indicates a shorter (longer) wavelength. Let ''t&lt;sub&gt;LP&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''t&lt;sub&gt;RP&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the time value observed at the left and right pivots for a waveform data, respectively, where left (right) indicates an earlier (later) time.  The proposed MD approach can be described in a set of equations.
[[File:Moment Distance (MD) Framework.png|left|thumb|513x513px|'''''Moment distance index (MDI) schematic diagram for spectral reflectance curve (top) and LiDAR waveform (bottom). Note the number of points between pivots can vary.''''']]

For spectral data, the index is given as:

&lt;math&gt;MDI = MD_{RP} - MD_{LP}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;MD_{RP} = \textstyle \sum_{i=\lambda_{RP}}^{\lambda_{LP}} \displaystyle(\rho_i^2+ ({\lambda_{RP}}-i)^2)^{0.5}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;MD_{LP} = \textstyle \sum_{i=\lambda_{LP}}^{\lambda_{RP}} \displaystyle(\rho_i^2+ (i-{\lambda_{LP}})^2)^{0.5}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;MDI_{RP}&lt;/math&gt;is the moment distance from the right pivot, &lt;math&gt;MDI_{LP}&lt;/math&gt;is the moment distance from the left pivot, &lt;math&gt;{\lambda_{LP}}&lt;/math&gt;is the wavelength location at left pivot, &lt;math&gt;{\lambda_{RP}}&lt;/math&gt;is the wavelength location at right pivot, &lt;math&gt;\rho_i&lt;/math&gt;is the spectral reflectance at a given wavelength, and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is successive wavelength location.

For waveform LiDAR data, the index is given as:

&lt;math&gt;MDI = MD_{LP} - MD_{RP}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;MD_{RP} = \textstyle \sum_{i=t_{RP}}^{t_{LP}} \displaystyle(\rho_i^2+ ({t_{RP}}-i)^2)^{0.5}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;MD_{LP} = \textstyle \sum_{i=t_{LP}}^{t_{RP}} \displaystyle(\rho_i^2+ (i-{t_{LP}})^2)^{0.5}&lt;/math&gt;

where the moment distance from the left pivot (MD&lt;sub&gt;LP&lt;/sub&gt;) is the sum of the hypotenuses constructed from the left pivot to the power at successively later times (index ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;LP&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;RP&lt;/sub&gt;): one base of each triangle is difference from the left pivot (''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' − ''t''&lt;sub&gt;LP&lt;/sub&gt;) along the abscissa and the other base is simply the backscattered power at ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;''. Similarly, the moment distance from the right pivot (MD&lt;sub&gt;RP&lt;/sub&gt;) is the sum of the hypotenuses constructed from the right pivot to the power at successively earlier times (index ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;RP&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;LP&lt;/sub&gt;): one base of each triangle is the difference from the right pivot (''t''&lt;sub&gt;RP&lt;/sub&gt; − ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'') along the abscissa and the other base is simply the backscattered power at ''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;''.

MDI is an unbounded metric.  It increases or decreases as a nontrivial function of the number of spectral bands or bins considered and the shape of the spectrum or waveform that spans those contiguous bands or bins.  The number of bands or bins is a function of the spectral resolution of the imaging spectrometer or the temporal resolution of the LiDAR (digitization rate) and the length of the reference range (i.e., full extent or subsets of the curve) being analyzed.

'''Mossø''' is Denmark's third largest freshwater lake and [[Jutland]]'s largest, as measured by surface area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dst.dk/en/Statistik/Publikationer/VisPub.aspx?cid=17957 Statistical Yearbook 2013] Geography, environment and energy, Table 409&lt;/ref&gt; The lake is located just west of the city of [[Skanderborg]] in east [[Jutland]], but is part of both [[Skanderborg Municipality]] and [[Horsens Municipality]]. Mossø lies in the middle of the area and landscape known as [[Søhøjlandet]] (English: ''The Lake-highland'').

There is a small lake named '''Mossø''' in the forest of [[Rold Skov]] in [[Himmerland]].

The '''Occupied Enemy Territory Administration''' ('''OETA''') was a [[Condominium (international law)|joint]] British and French military administration over Levantine and Mesopotamian provinces of the former Ottoman Empire between 1918–20, set up following the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] of [[World War I]]. It was initially set up via the [[1918 Anglo–French Modus Vivendi]].

The administration ended following the assignment of the [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon]] and [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]] at the 19–26 April 1920 [[San Remo conference]].

==History==
Following British and French occupation, the region was split into three administrative sub-units, which varied very little from the previous Ottoman divisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O9ENRvFwZmoC&amp;pg=PA110 Israel: the first hundred years, Efraim Karsh]&lt;/ref&gt; '''OETA South''', consisting of the Ottoman [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]] and the [[sanjak]]s of [[Nablus Sanjak|Nablus]] and [[Acre Sanjak|Acre]], '''OETA North''' (later renamed '''OETA West''') consisting of the Ottoman sanjaks of [[Beirut Sanjak|Beirut]], [[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate|Lebanon]], [[Latakia Sanjak|Latakia]] and a number of sub-districts, and '''OETA East''' consisting of the Ottoman [[Syria Vilayet]] and [[Hejaz Vilayet]]. But, success of [[Turkish War of Independence]], [[Marash Sanjak|Maraş]], [[Aintab Sanjak|Antep]] and [[Urfa Sanjak|Urfa]] sanjaks of former [[Aleppo Vilayet|Halep Eyalet]] remained in Turkey after 1921. Also, [[Antakya]] and [[İskenderun]] kazas of [[Aleppo Sanjak|Halep Sanjak]] in one were separated as the [[Hatay State|Republic of Hatay]] in 1938. The republic joined to Turkey in 1939.

When the British forces occupied [[Ethiopia]], [[Libya]] and other Italian colonies during World War II, the OETA was revived as the administrative structure by which the British governed these territories.&lt;ref&gt;Harold G. Marcus. Haile Selassie and Italians, 1941–1943. Northeast African Studies, Vol. 10, No. 3 (New Series) 2003, pp. 19–25. [http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/neas/pdf/3_NE_10.3_Marcus_19-26.pdf (Online version of the article)].&lt;/ref&gt; In Ethiopia, Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] was allowed to return and claim his throne, but the OETA authorities ruled the country for some time before full sovereignty was restored to Ethiopia.

==Military administrators==
When [[Field Marshal]] [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]] first assumed command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force he quickly joined the army in the field leaving the political and administrative problems related to the Egyptian Mandate to a Government appointee with a suitable staff. The area of formerly Ottoman territory now under occupation also required management, and with the approval of the Government, Allenby appointed a Chief Administrator for Palestine.&lt;ref name="Mazza2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberto Mazza|title=Jerusalem: From the Ottomans to the British|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f_ABAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148|date=30 September 2009|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-393-3|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He divided the country into four districts: Jerusalem, Jaffa, Majdal and Beersheba, each under a military governor.

An '''orbital arc''' is an imaginary arc in the sky composed of the connected pointing angles of all the [[geostationary satellites]] seen from any given location on the surface of the earth.

==Training==
Modern [[VSAT]] satellite receiver system installations take into consideration the orbital arc when conducting a [[site survey]] to determine the optimal location for the [[earth station]].  Best practice methods for factoring in the orbital arc during a site survey are contained in VSAT training:

[[File:Mother Lode Gold OreHarvard mine quartz-gold vein.jpg|thumb|High-grade gold ore from the Harvard Mine, [[Jamestown, California]], a wide quartz-gold vein in California's [[Mother Lode]]. Specimen is 3.2 cm wide.]]

Various theories of '''ore genesis''' explain how the various types of [[mineral deposit]]s form within the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]]. Ore-genesis theories vary depending on the [[mineral]] or commodity examined.

Ore-genesis theories generally involve three components: source, transport or conduit, and trap. (This also applies to the [[petroleum]] industry: [[petroleum geology|petroleum geologist]]s originated this analysis.)

*'''Source''' is required because metal must come from somewhere, and be liberated by some process.
*'''Transport''' is required first to move the metal-bearing fluids or solid minerals into their current position, and refers to the act of physically moving the metal, as well as to chemical or physical phenomenon which encourage movement.
*'''Trapping''' is required to concentrate the metal via some physical, chemical, or geological mechanism into a concentration which forms mineable [[ore]].

The biggest deposits form when the source is large, the transport mechanism is efficient, and the trap is active and ready at the right time.

==Ore genesis processes==
{{No footnotes|section|date=November 2016}}

===Endogenous===

====Magmatic processes====
*[[Fractional crystallization (geology)|Fractional crystallization]]: separates ore and non-ore minerals according to their crystallization temperature. As early crystallizing minerals form from [[magma]], they incorporate certain elements, some of which are metals. These crystals may settle onto the bottom of the [[intrusive rock|intrusion]], concentrating ore minerals there. [[Chromite]] and [[magnetite]] are ore minerals that form in this way.
*Liquid [[miscibility|immiscibility]]: sulfide ores containing copper, nickel, or platinum may form from this process. As a magma changes, parts of it may separate from the main body of magma. Two liquids that will not mix are called immiscible; oil and water are an example. In magmas, sulfides may separate and sink below the silicate-rich part of the intrusion or be injected into the rock surrounding it. These deposits are found in [[mafic]] and [[ultramafic rock]]s.

====Hydrothermal processes====
These processes are the physicochemical phenomena and reactions caused by movement of [[hydrothermal]] water within the crust, often as a consequence of magmatic intrusion or tectonic upheavals. The foundations of hydrothermal processes are the source-transport-trap mechanism.

Sources of hydrothermal solutions include [[seawater]] and [[meteoric water]] circulating through fractured rock, formational [[brine]]s (water trapped within sediments at deposition), and metamorphic fluids created by dehydration of hydrous minerals during [[metamorphism]].

Metal sources may include a plethora of rocks. However most metals of economic importance are carried as trace elements within rock-forming minerals, and so may be liberated by hydrothermal processes. This happens because of:
*incompatibility of the metal with its host mineral, for example [[zinc]] in [[calcite]], which favours aqueous fluids in contact with the host mineral during [[diagenesis]].
*solubility of the host mineral within nascent hydrothermal solutions in the source rocks, for example mineral salts ([[halite]]), carbonates ([[cerussite]]), phosphates ([[monazite]] and [[thorianite]]), and sulfates ([[barite]])
*elevated temperatures causing decomposition reactions of minerals

Transport by hydrothermal solutions usually requires a salt or other soluble species which can form a metal-bearing complex. These metal-bearing complexes facilitate transport of metals within aqueous solutions, generally as [[hydroxide]]s, but also by processes similar to [[chelation]].

This process is especially well understood in gold metallogeny where various thiosulfate, chloride, and other gold-carrying chemical complexes (notably [[tellurium]]-chloride/sulfate or antimony-chloride/sulfate). The majority of metal deposits formed by hydrothermal processes include [[sulfide minerals]], indicating sulfur is an important metal-carrying complex.

Sulfide deposition:&lt;br&gt;
Sulfide deposition within the ''trap'' zone occurs when metal-carrying sulfate, sulfide, or other complexes become chemically unstable due to one or more of the following processes;
*falling temperature, which renders the complex unstable or metal insoluble
*loss of pressure, which has the same effect
*reaction with chemically reactive wall rocks, usually of [[redox|reduced]] [[oxidation state]], such as iron-bearing rocks, [[mafic]] or [[ultramafic rock]]s, or [[carbonate rock]]s
*degassing of the hydrothermal fluid into a gas and water system, or boiling, which alters the metal carrying capacity of the solution and even destroys metal-carrying chemical complexes

Metal can also precipitate when temperature and pressure or oxidation state favour different ionic complexes in the water, for instance the change from sulfide to sulfate, oxygen [[fugacity]], exchange of metals between sulfide and chloride complexes, et cetera.

====Metamorphic processes====
Lateral secretion:&lt;br&gt;
Ore deposits formed by lateral secretion are formed by metamorphic reactions during [[shear (geology)|shearing]], which liberate mineral constituents such as quartz, sulfides, gold, carbonates, and oxides from deforming rocks, and focus these constituents into zones of reduced pressure or dilation such as [[fault (geology)|faults]]. This may occur without much hydrothermal fluid flow, and this is typical of podiform chromite deposits.

Metamorphic processes also control many physical processes which form the source of hydrothermal fluids, outlined above.

===Sedimentary or surficial processes (exogenous)===
Surficial processes are the physical and chemical phenomena which cause concentration of ore material within the [[regolith]], generally by the action of the environment. This includes [[placer mining|placer]] deposits, [[laterite]] deposits, and residual or [[eluvium (geology)|eluvial]] deposits. The physical processes of ore deposit formation in the surficial realm include;
*[[erosion]]
*deposition by sedimentary processes, including [[Winnowing (sedimentology)|winnowing]], density separation (e.g.; gold placers)
*[[weathering]] via oxidation or chemical attack of a rock, either liberating rock fragments or creating chemically deposited clays, laterites, or [[supergene (geology)|supergene enrichment]]
*Deposition in low-energy environments in [[beach]] environments

==Classification of ore deposits==
Ore deposits are usually classified by ore formation processes and geological setting. For example, [[sedimentary exhalative deposits]] (SEDEX), are a class of ore deposit formed on the sea floor (sedimentary) by exhalation of brines into seawater (exhalative), causing chemical precipitation of ore minerals when the brine cools, mixes with sea water, and loses its metal carrying capacity.

Ore deposits rarely fit neatly into the categories in which geologists wish to place them. Many may be formed by one or more of the basic genesis processes above, creating ambiguous classifications and much argument and conjecture. Often ore deposits are classified after examples of their type, for instance [[Broken Hill Type ore deposits|Broken Hill type lead-zinc-silver deposits]] or [[Carlin–type gold deposit]]s.

Classification of hydrothermal ore deposits is also achieved by classifying according to the temperature of formation, which roughly also correlates with particular mineralising fluids, mineral associations and structural styles. This scheme, proposed by [[Waldemar Lindgren]] (1933) classified hydrothermal deposits as ''hypothermal'', ''mesothermal'', ''epithermal'', and ''telethermal''. Epithermal deposits are hydrothermal ore deposits formed at low temperatures (50-200&amp;nbsp;°C) near the Earth´s surface (&lt;1500 m), that fill veins, breccias, and stockworks. The age of formation of epithermal deposits in México is currently being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Camprubí|first=Antoni|last2=et|first2=al|year=2016|title=Geochronology of Mexican mineral deposits. IV: the Cinco Minas epithermal deposit, Jalisco|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/6802/(12)Camprubi.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|volume=68|pages=357–364|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis of common ores==
''As they require the conjunction of specific environmental conditions to form, particular mineral deposit types tend to occupy specific geodynamic niches,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Groves, David I.|author2=Bierlein, Frank P.|year=2007|title=Geodynamic settings of mineral deposit systems|journal= Journal of the Geological Society|volume=164|pages=19&amp;ndash;30|doi=10.1144/0016-76492006-065}} [http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/content/164/1/19.short Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, this page has been organised by [[metal]] [[commodity]]. It is also possible to organise theories the other way, namely according to [[geological]] criteria of formation. Often ores of the same metal can be formed by multiple processes, and this is described here under each metal or metal complex.

===Iron===
{{Main|Iron ore}}
Iron ores are overwhelmingly derived from ancient [[sediment]]s known as ''[[banded iron formation]]s'' (BIFs). These sediments are composed of [[iron oxide]] minerals deposited on the sea floor. Particular environmental conditions are needed to transport enough iron in sea water to form these deposits, such as acidic and oxygen-poor atmospheres within the [[Proterozoic]] Era.

Often, more recent [[weathering]] is required to convert the usual [[magnetite]] minerals into more easily processed [[hematite]]. Some iron deposits within the [[Pilbara]] of [[West Australia]] are ''placer deposits'', formed by accumulation of hematite gravels called ''pisolites'' which form [[channel-iron deposits]]. These are preferred because they are cheap to mine.

===Lead zinc silver===
{{Main|Sedimentary exhalative deposits|Carbonate-hosted lead-zinc ore deposits|Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit}}
[[Lead]]-[[zinc]] deposits are generally accompanied by [[silver]], hosted within the lead sulfide mineral [[galena]] or within the zinc sulfide mineral [[sphalerite]].

Lead and zinc deposits are formed by discharge of deep sedimentary [[brine]] onto the sea floor (termed ''[[sedimentary exhalative deposits|sedimentary exhalative]]'' or SEDEX), or by replacement of [[limestone]], in [[skarn]] deposits, some associated with submarine volcanoes (called [[volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit]]s or VMS), or in the [[aureole]] of [[subvolcanic rock|subvolcanic]] intrusions of granite. The vast majority of SEDEX lead and zinc deposits are [[Proterozoic]] in age, although there are significant Jurassic examples in Canada and Alaska.

The carbonate replacement type deposit is exemplified by the [[carbonate-hosted lead-zinc ore deposits|Mississippi valley type (MVT)]] ore deposits. MVT and similar styles occur by replacement and degradation of carbonate sequences by [[hydrocarbon]]s, which are thought important for transporting lead.

===Gold===
[[File:Auriferous brecciated quartz-adularia rhyolite (Sleeper Rhyolite Gold Ore, Nevada) 1 (14719259472).jpg|thumb|High-grade (bonanza) gold ore, brecciated quartz-adularia rhyolite. [[Native gold]] (Au) occurs in this rock as colloform bands, partially replaces breccia clasts, and is also disseminated in the matrix. Published research indicates that Sleeper Mine rocks represent an ancient [[epithermal]] gold deposit (hot springs gold deposit), formed by volcanism during Basin &amp; Range [[extensional tectonics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubs.usgs.gov/of/1989/0476/report.pdf Geology and geochemistry of the Sleeper Gold Mine], USGS Open File Report 89-476, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Sleeper Mine, [[Humboldt County, Nevada]].|350px]]
Gold deposits are formed via a very wide variety of [[geological]] processes. Deposits are classified as primary, alluvial or [[placer mining|placer]] deposits, or residual or [[laterite]] deposits. Often a deposit will contain a mixture of all three types of ore.

[[Plate tectonics]] is the underlying mechanism for generating gold deposits. The majority of primary gold deposits fall into two main categories: [[lode]] gold deposits or [[intrusion]]-related deposits.

''Lode gold deposits'' are generally high-grade, thin, vein and fault hosted. They are primarily made up of [[quartz]] veins also known as lodes or ''reefs'', which contain either native gold or gold [[sulfides]] and [[telluride (chemistry)|telluride]]s. Lode gold deposits are usually hosted in [[basalt]] or in sediments known as [[turbidite]], although when in [[fault (geology)|faults]], they may occupy intrusive igneous rocks such as [[granite]].

Lode-gold deposits are intimately associated with [[orogeny]] and other plate collision events within geologic history. Most lode gold deposits ''sourced'' from [[metamorphic rocks]] because it is thought that the majority are formed by dehydration of [[basalt]] during metamorphism. The gold is transported up faults by [[hydrothermal]] waters and deposited when the water cools too much to retain gold in solution.

''Intrusive related gold'' (Lang &amp; Baker, 2001) is generally hosted in granites, [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]], or rarely [[dike (geology)|dikes]]. Intrusive related gold usually also contains [[copper]], and is often associated with [[tin]] and [[tungsten]], and rarely [[molybdenum]], [[antimony]], and [[uranium]]. Intrusive-related gold deposits rely on gold existing in the fluids associated with the [[magma]] (White, 2001), and the inevitable discharge of these [[hydrothermal]] fluids into the wall-rocks (Lowenstern, 2001). [[Skarn]] deposits are another manifestation of intrusive-related deposits.

''Placer'' deposits are sourced from pre-existing gold deposits and are secondary deposits. Placer deposits are formed by [[alluvial]] processes within rivers and streams, and on [[beaches]]. Placer gold deposits form via [[gravity]], with the [[density]] of gold causing it to sink into trap sites within the river bed, or where water velocity drops, such as bends in rivers and behind boulders. Often placer deposits are found within sedimentary rocks and can be billions of years old, for instance the [[Witwatersrand]] deposits in [[South Africa]]. Sedimentary placer deposits are known as 'leads' or 'deep leads'.

Placer deposits are often worked by [[fossicking]], and panning for gold is a popular pastime.

[[Laterite]] gold deposits are formed from pre-existing gold deposits (including some placer deposits) during prolonged [[weathering]] of the bedrock. Gold is deposited within [[iron oxide]]s in the weathered rock or [[regolith]], and may be further enriched by reworking by erosion. Some laterite deposits are formed by wind erosion of the bedrock leaving a residuum of native gold metal at surface.

A bacterium, [[Cupriavidus metallidurans]] plays a vital role in the formation of [[gold nugget]]s, by precipitating metallic gold from a solution of [[chloroauric acid|gold (III) tetrachloride]], a compound highly toxic to most other microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Delftia acidovorans]] can form gold nuggets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= O'Hanlon, Larry |title= Bacteria Make Gold Nuggets |url= http://news.discovery.com/earth/gold-bacteria-nuggets.html |work= [[Discovery News]] |date= September 1, 2010 |accessdate= September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Platinum===
Platinum and palladium are precious metals generally found in [[ultramafic]] rocks. The source of platinum and palladium deposits is ultramafic rocks which have enough [[sulfur]] to form a [[sulfide]] mineral while the magma is still liquid. This sulfide mineral (usually [[pentlandite]], [[pyrite]], [[chalcopyrite]], or [[pyrrhotite]]) gains platinum by mixing with the bulk of the magma because platinum is [[chalcophile]] and is concentrated in sulfides. Alternatively, platinum occurs in association with [[chromite]] either within the chromite mineral itself or within sulfides associated with it.

Sulfide phases only form in ultramafic magmas when the magma reaches sulfur saturation. This is generally thought to be nearly impossible by pure fractional crystallisation, so other processes are usually required in ore genesis models to explain sulfur saturation. These include contamination of the magma with crustal material, especially sulfur-rich wall-rocks or sediments; magma mixing; volatile gain or loss.

Often [[platinum]] is associated with [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], and [[cobalt]] deposits.

===Nickel===
{{Main|Kambalda type komatiitic nickel ore deposits|Lateritic nickel ore deposits}}
Nickel deposits are generally found in two forms, either as sulfide or laterite.

Sulfide type nickel deposits are formed in essentially the same manner as [[platinum]] deposits. Nickel is a chalcophile element which prefers sulfides, so an ultramafic or mafic rock which has a sulfide phase in the magma may form nickel sulfides. The best nickel deposits are formed where sulfide accumulates in the base of [[lava tube]]s or [[volcanic]] flows &amp;mdash; especially [[komatiite]] lavas.

Komatiitic nickel-copper sulfide deposits are considered to be formed by a mixture of sulfide segregation, immiscibility, and thermal erosion of sulfidic sediments. The sediments are considered to be necessary to promote sulfur saturation.

Some subvolcanic sills in the Thompson Belt of Canada host nickel sulfide deposits formed by deposition of sulfides near the feeder vent. Sulfide was accumulated near the vent due to the loss of magma velocity at the vent interface. The massive [[Voisey's Bay]] nickel deposit is considered to have formed via a similar process.

The process of forming ''nickel laterite'' deposits is essentially similar to the formation of gold laterite deposits, except that [[ultramafic]] or [[mafic]] rocks are required. Generally nickel laterites require very large [[olivine]]-bearing ultramafic intrusions. Minerals formed in laterite nickel deposits include [[gibbsite]].

===Copper===

Copper is found in association with many other metals and deposit styles. Commonly, copper is either formed within sedimentary rocks, or associated with [[igneous]] rocks.

The world's major copper deposits are formed within the granitic [[porphyry copper]] style. Copper is enriched by processes during crystallisation of the granite and forms as [[chalcopyrite]] &amp;mdash; a sulfide mineral, which is carried up with the granite.

Sometimes granites erupt to surface as [[volcanoes]], and copper mineralisation forms during this phase when the granite and volcanic rocks cool via [[hydrothermal circulation]].

Sedimentary copper forms within ocean basins in sedimentary rocks. Generally this forms by [[brine]] from deeply buried sediments discharging into the deep sea, and precipitating copper and often [[lead]] and [[zinc]] sulfides directly onto the sea floor. This is then buried by further sediment. This is a process similar to SEDEX zinc and lead, although some carbonate-hosted examples exist.

Often copper is associated with [[gold]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], and [[nickel]] deposits.

===Uranium===
{{Main|Uranium ore}}
[[File:Citrobacter freundii.jpg|thumb|''[[Citrobacter]]'' species can have concentrations of uranium in their bodies 300 times higher than in the surrounding environment.|alt=Five cylinder-like bodies on a flat surface: four in a group and one separate.]]

Uranium deposits are usually ''sourced'' from [[radioactive]] granites, where certain minerals such as [[monazite]] are leached during [[hydrothermal]] activity or during circulation of [[groundwater]]. The uranium is brought into solution by acidic conditions and is deposited when this acidity is neutralised. Generally this occurs in certain carbon-bearing sediments, within an [[unconformity]] in sedimentary strata. The majority of the world's [[nuclear power]] is sourced from uranium in such deposits.

Uranium is also found in nearly all [[coal]] at several [[parts per million]], and in all granites. [[Radon]] is a common problem during mining of uranium as it is a radioactive gas.

Uranium is also found associated with certain igneous rocks, such as [[granite]] and [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]]. The [[Olympic Dam, South Australia|Olympic Dam]] deposit in Australia is an example of this type of uranium deposit. It contains 70% of Australia's share of 40% of the known global low-cost recoverable uranium inventory.

===Titanium and zirconium===
{{Main|Heavy mineral sands ore deposits}}

Mineral sands are the predominant type of [[titanium]], [[zirconium]], and [[thorium]] deposit. They are formed by accumulation of such [[heavy mineral sands ore deposits|heavy minerals]] within [[beach]] systems, and are a type of ''[[placer deposit]]s''. The minerals which contain titanium are ilmenite, rutile, and [[leucoxene]], zirconium is contained within [[zircon]], and thorium is generally contained within [[monazite]]. These minerals are sourced from primarily [[granite]] bedrock by [[erosion]] and transported to the sea by [[rivers]] where they accumulate within beach sands. Rarely, but importantly, [[gold]], [[tin]], and [[platinum]] deposits can form in beach placer deposits.

===Tin, tungsten, and molybdenum===
These three metals generally form in a certain type of [[granite]], via a similar mechanism to intrusive-related gold and copper. They are considered together because the process of forming these deposits is essentially the same. [[Skarn]] type mineralisation related to these granites is a very important type of tin, tungsten, and molybdenum deposit. Skarn deposits form by reaction of mineralised fluids from the granite reacting with wall rocks such as [[limestone]]. Skarn mineralisation is also important in [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[gold]], and occasionally [[uranium]] mineralisation.

[[Greisen]] granite is another related tin-molybdenum and topaz mineralisation style.

===Rare earth elements, niobium, tantalum, lithium===
The overwhelming majority of [[rare earth elements]], [[tantalum]], and [[lithium]] are found within [[pegmatite]]. Ore genesis theories for these ores are wide and varied, but most involve [[metamorphism]] and [[igneous]] activity. [[Lithium]] is present as [[spodumene]] or [[lepidolite]] within pegmatite.

[[Carbonatite]] intrusions are an important source of these elements. Ore minerals are essentially part of the unusual mineralogy of carbonatite.

===Phosphate===
[[Phosphate]] is used in fertilisers. Immense quantities of ''phosphate rock'' or [[phosphorite]] occur in sedimentary shelf deposits, ranging in age from the [[Proterozoic]] to currently forming environments.&lt;ref&gt;Guilbert, John M. and Charles F. Park, ''The Geology of Ore Deposits'', 1986, Freeman, pp. 715-720, {{ISBN|0-7167-1456-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphate deposits are thought to be sourced from the skeletons of dead sea creatures which accumulated on the seafloor. Similar to iron ore deposits and oil, particular conditions in the ocean and environment are thought to have contributed to these deposits within the geological past.

Phosphate deposits are also formed from alkaline igneous rocks such as [[nepheline syenite]]s, [[carbonatite]]s, and associated rock types. The phosphate is, in this case, contained within magmatic [[apatite]], [[monazite]], or other rare-earth phosphates.

===Vanadium===
[[File:Bluebell tunicates Nick Hobgood.jpg|thumb|[[Tunicate]]s such as this bluebell tunicate contain vanadium as [[vanabin]].]]

Due to the presence of [[vanabins]], concentration of [[vanadium]] found in the blood cells of ''[[Ascidia gemmata]]'' belonging to the [[scientific classification|suborder]] [[Phlebobranchia]] is 10,000,000 times higher than that in the surrounding seawater. A similar biological process might have played a role in the formation of [[vanadium]] ores.
Vanadium is also present in [[fossil fuel]] deposits such as [[crude oil]], [[coal]], [[oil shale]], and [[oil sands]]. In crude oil, concentrations up to 1200&amp;nbsp;ppm have been reported.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">'''Poetic naturalism''' is a philosophical approach to [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] which encourages a variety of ways to talk about the world, using language dependent upon the aspect of reality being discussed. The term was coined by [[Sean M. Carroll]] in his book ''The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself'' to offer richer insight into naturalism, with strategies for agreeing on useful ways of talking about the [[Physical law|natural]] world. It acknowledges that the methods and terms used within one domain may not be coherent with those of another domain, yet both can be considered valid representations of reality.&lt;ref name="TheBigPicture"&gt;

==Overview==
Poetic naturalism resolves many of the conflicts caused by the fundamental differences between the various branches of science and philosophy. For example, the universe can be described mechanically in terms of atoms obeying certain [[Laws of science|laws]]. This results in a [[Determinism|deterministic]] universe incompatible with the concepts of [[choice]] or [[free will]]. Determinism is not a useful perspective for navigating the [[human condition]], which includes [[value judgment]]s and the concept of [[Causality|cause and effect]], as it essentially posits an endless chain of unavoidable "effects" stemming from a single primordial "cause". In spite of determinism, humans can be said to make decisions and control aspects of their environment. This apparent conflict does not negate either viewpoint; they can both be said to be legitimate depending on the frame of reference in which we are currently operating.

The tenets of poetic naturalism can be summarized in three points:
{{Quote|text=&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are many ways of talking about the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another and with the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;|multiline=y|author=Sean Carroll|title=''The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself'' &lt;ref name="TheBigPicture"/&gt;{{rp|20}}}}

==Distinction from naturalism==
Sean Carroll cites a quote which speaks to the essence of poetic naturalism's distinction from naturalism:&lt;ref name="TheBigPicture" /&gt;{{rp|19}}{{Quote|text="The Universe is made of stories, not atoms"|author=[[Muriel Rukeyser]]|title=''The Speed of Darkness'' (1968)}}

While naturalism is the "idea or belief that only natural (as opposed to [[supernatural]] or [[spiritualism|spiritual]]) laws and forces operate in the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED| Naturalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; poetic naturalism understands that the way we find personally relevant meaning to life does not naturally emerge from a purely scientific approach. [[Science]] is a rigorous method of finding what is true or false, while poetic naturalism encourages extending the conversation to include contemplation into what is right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/godless-universe-a-physicist-searches-for-meaning-in-nature/|title=Godless Universe: A Physicist Searches for Meaning in Nature; Scientific American |publisher=Scientific American |author=Clara Moskowitz|date=2016-05-10|accessdate=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It integrates scientific reasoning methods into our personal purpose-seeking and meaning-making, with an emphasis on [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] techniques.&lt;ref name="TheBigPicture" /&gt;{{rp|75}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7881">The '''Valkyrie''' is a theoretical spacecraft designed by [[Charles Pellegrino]] and Jim Powell (a physicist at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]). The Valkyrie is theoretically able to accelerate to 92% the speed of light and decelerate afterward, carrying a small human crew to another star system.&lt;ref name="AtomicRocket"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3aj.html#valkyrie |title=Valkyrie Antimatter Starship |work=Atomic Rockets: Slower Than Light |date=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Valkyrie's high performance is attributable to its innovative design. Instead of a solid spacecraft with a rocket at the back, Valkyrie is built more like a cable car train, with the crew quarters, fuel tanks, radiation shielding, and other vital components being pulled between front and aft engines on long tethers. This greatly reduces the mass of the ship, because it no longer requires heavy structural members and radiation shielding. This is a considerable advantage because in a rocket every extra kilogram of payload (dry mass) will require a corresponding extra amount of propellant or fuel.

The Valkyrie would have a crew module trailing 10 kilometers behind the engine. A small 20-cm-thick tungsten shield would hang 100 meters behind the engine, to help protect the trailing crew module from its harmful radiation.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A11949195 |date=8 August 2006 |title=The Valkyrie Spacecraft - The Next Giant Leap? |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=Edited Guide Entry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuel tank might be placed between the crew module and the engine, to further protect it. At the trailing end of the ship would be a second engine, which the ship would use to decelerate. The forward engine and the tank holding its fuel supply might be jettisoned before deceleration, to reduce fuel consumption.&lt;ref name="AtomicRocket"/&gt; The tether system requires that the elements of the ship must be moved "up" or "down" the tethers depending on flight direction.

==Engines==
Initially the Valkyrie's engine would work by using small quantities of [[antimatter]] to initiate an extremely energetic fusion reaction. A magnetic coil captures the exhaust products of this reaction, expelling them with an exhaust velocity of 12-20% the speed of light (35,000-60,000&amp;nbsp;km/s). As the spacecraft approaches 20% the speed of light, more antimatter is fed into the engines until it switches over to pure matter-antimatter annihilation.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; It will use this mode to accelerate the remainder of the way to .92&amp;nbsp;c. Pellegrino estimates that the ship would require 100 tons of matter and antimatter to reach 0.1-0.2c, with an undetermined excess of matter to ensure the antimatter is efficiently utilized. To reach a speed of .92 c and decelerate afterward, Valkyrie would require a mass ratio of 22 (or 2200 tons of fuel for a 100-ton spacecraft).&lt;ref name="AtomicRocket"/&gt;

At such high speeds, incident debris would be a major hazard. While accelerating, Valkyrie uses a device that combines the functions of a particle shield and a [[liquid droplet radiator]]. Waste heat is dumped into liquid droplets that are cast out in front of the ship. As the ship accelerates the droplets (now cool) effectively fall back into the ship, so the system is self-recycling. During deceleration the ship will be protected by ultra-thin umbrella shields, augmented by a dust shield, possibly made by grinding up pieces of the discarded first stage.&lt;ref name="AtomicRocket"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The chief feasibility issue of Valkyrie (or for ''any'' antimatter-beam drive) lies in its requirement of quantities of antimatter fuel measured in tons. Antimatter cannot be produced at an efficiency of more than 50% (that is to say, to produce one gram of antimatter requires twice as much energy as you would get from annihilating that gram with a gram of matter). Since a half a kilogram of antimatter would yield 9×10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J if annihilated with an equal amount of matter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equivME/ |title=The Equivalence of Mass and Energy |date=12 September 2001 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; this quickly adds up to enormous energy requirements for its production. To produce the 50&amp;nbsp;tons of antimatter Valkyrie would require 1.8×10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J. This is the same amount of energy that the entire human race currently uses in about forty years.

This may be solved by creating a truly enormous power plant for the antimatter factory, probably in the form of a vast array of [[solar panel]]s with a combined area of millions of square kilometers or many [[fusion reactor]]s. Alternately the antimatter-fusion hybrid drive the Valkyrie uses to accelerate up to 0.2&amp;nbsp;''c'' would require much less antimatter and, with an exhaust velocity of 30-60,000&amp;nbsp;km·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, still compares quite favorably with competing engines such as the inertial confinement pulse drive used by [[Project Daedalus]] or [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]]. The Valkyrie's lightweight construction could also be applied to a wide variety of space vehicle.

By using tethers there is no rigidity between ship elements and engines. Without active acceleration or thrust to pull and straighten the tethers the slightest imbalance, excess force, or the moving of the ship elements into different flight configurations pose a danger for collisions between ship elements and engines. As long term space flight at interstellar velocities causes erosion due to collision with particles, gas, dust and micrometeorites the tethers are literally lifelines.&lt;ref name="NASA-tm108537"&gt;[http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~cdhall/courses/aoe4065/NASADesignSPs/tm108537.pdf ''Space Tethers: Design Criteria''] NASA Technical Memorandum 108537, July, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HGarrett&gt;[http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/systems2012/presentations/garrett.pdf ''There and Back Again: A Layman’s Guide to Ultra-Reliability for Interstellar Missions''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508062130/http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/systems2012/presentations/garrett.pdf |date=2014-05-08 }} Henry Garrett, 30 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Changing course or turning the ship requires re-positioning or aligning every ship element and presumably consumes more fuel in doing so.

As the liquid droplet radiators (LDR) are deployed on the other side of propulsion and the main body, the droplets and the collectors are exposed to the other half of heat energy from the gamma radiation from the antimatter annihilation. If the total area of the collectors are larger than the radiation shield the LDR would serve to cool itself rather than the shield for the ship's main components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxauCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=antimatter+beam+drive+criticism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q6J7s8ct6v&amp;sig=6Rmt6E9h9s-vBRGJNSwXrBV9IME&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju-5y3sqHXAhVR-2MKHauTAKIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=antimatter%20beam%20drive%20criticism&amp;f=false/|title=The Cosmic Compendium: Interstellar Travel |date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rupelian''' is, in the [[geologic timescale]], the older of two [[age (geology)|ages]] or the lower of two [[stage (stratigraphy)|stages]] of the [[Oligocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]/[[series (stratigraphy)|series]]. It spans the time between {{ma|Rupelian|and}} {{ma|Chattian|Ma}}. It is preceded by the [[Priabonian]] stage (part of the Eocene) and is followed by the [[Chattian]] stage.

==Name==
The stage is named after the small river [[Rupel]] in [[Belgium]], a tributary to the [[Scheldt]]. The Belgian [[Rupel Group]] derives its name from the same source. The name Rupelian was introduced in scientific literature by Belgian geologist [[André Hubert Dumont]] in 1850. The separation between the [[group (stratigraphy)|group]] and the stage was made in the second half of the 20th century, when stratigraphers saw the need to distinguish between [[lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphic]] and [[chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] names.

==Stratigraphic definition==
The base of the Rupelian stage (which is also the base of the Oligocene series) is at the [[extinction]] of the [[foraminiferan]] [[genus]] ''[[Hantkenina]]''. An official [[GSSP]] for the base of the Rupelian has been assigned in 1992 ([[Massignano]], [[Italy]]). The transition with the Chattian has also been marked with a GSSP in August 2017 ([[Monte Conero]], [[Italy]]).&lt;ref name="International Commission of Stratigraphy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/GSSP_table2011.pdf|title=International Commission of Stratigraphy|website=Stratigraphy.org|publisher=International Commission of Stratigraphy|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The top of the Rupelian stage (the base of the Chattian) is at the extinction of the foram genus ''Chiloguembelina'' (which is also the base of foram [[biozone]] P21b).

The Rupelian overlaps the [[Orellan]], [[Whitneyan]] and lower [[Arikareean]] [[North American Land Mammal Ages]], the upper [[Mustersan]] and [[Tinguirirican]] [[South American Land Mammal Ages]], the uppermost [[Headonian]], Suevian and lower [[Arvernian]] [[European Land Mammal Mega Zone]]s (the Rupelian spans the [[Mammal Paleogene zones]] 21 through 24 and part of 25&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;{{cite web |last = Alroy |first = John | page = The Paleobiology Database | title = Mammal Paleogene zones |url = http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=processViewScale&amp;scale_no=125 | accessdate = 15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the lower Hsandgolian [[Asian Land Mammal Age]]. It is also coeval with the only regionally used upper Aldingan and lower Janjukian stages of [[Australia]], the upper Refugian and lower Zemorrian stages of [[California]] and the lower Kiscellian [[Paratethys]] stage of Central and eastern Europe. Other regionally used alternatives include the Stampian, Tongrian, Latdorfian and Vicksburgian.

'''SN1972E''' was a [[supernova]] in the galaxy [[NGC 5253]] that was discovered 13 May 1972 with an [[apparent magnitude|apparent B magnitude]] of about 8.5, shortly after it had reached its maximum brightness.  In terms of apparent brightness, it was the second-brightest supernova of any kind (fainter only than [[SN 1987A]]) of the 20th century.  It was observed for nearly 700 days, and it became the prototype object for the development of theoretical understanding of [[Type Ia supernova]]e.

==Background==

The extended length of the observed light curve found a remarkably uniform 0.01 [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] per day decline starting about 60 days after discovery.  Translated into other units, this is almost exactly a 77-day [[half-life]], which is the half-life of [[isotopes of cobalt|&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co]].  In the [[Type Ia supernova#Consensus model|standard model for Type Ia supernovae]], approximately a [[solar mass]] of [[isotopes of nickel|&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni]] is formed and ejected from a [[white dwarf]] which accretes mass from a binary companion and is raised over the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] and explodes.  This &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni decays with a half-life of about 6 days to &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co, and the decay of the cobalt provides the energy radiated away by the supernova remnant.  The model also produces an estimate for the luminosity of such a supernova.  The observations of SN1972e, both peak brightness and fade rate, were in general agreement with these predictions, and led to rapid acceptance of this degenerate-explosion model.&lt;ref name=VT&gt;{{cite journal | last=Trimble | first=Virginia | date=Oct 1982 | journal=[[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume=54 | pages=1183–1224 |title=Supernovae.

{{about||the computerized video processing technique|Iskiography}}

'''Sciography''', also spelled '''sciagraphy''' or '''skiagraphy''' ({{lang-el|σκιά "shadow" and γράφειν graphein, "write"}}), is a branch of science of the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] dealing with the projection of shadows, or delineation of an object in perspective with its gradations of [[Light &amp; Shade|light and shade]]. One of the major professional fields that use this technique is the architectural field. In [[architecture]] it is defined as a study of shades and shadows cast by simple architectural forms on plane surfaces.

In general sciography the light source is imagined as the sun inclined at 45 degrees to both vertical plane and horizontal plane coming from left hand side. The resultant shadow is then drawn.

'''Silkeborg Forests''' is Denmark's largest forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/naturoplevelser/naturguider/silkeborgskovene/|title=Silkeborg-skovene|language=Danish|publisher=Naturstyrelsen|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises a collection of several independent private and public woodlands, that have been allowed to merge into a single connected forest south of the city of [[Silkeborg]]. At 22,400 ha, it is Denmark's largest forest since 2004, after [[Rold Skov]], and it is located within the largest forest district in the country as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tv2ostjylland.dk/artikel/danmarks-storste-skov-er-tredoblet|title=Danmarks største skov er tredoblet [Denmark's biggest forest has tripled]|language=Danish|publisher=TV2 Østjylland|date=6 January 2010|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forests forms an important part of the larger regional landscape known as [[Søhøjlandet]].

Silkeborg Forests are named after the city of [[Silkeborg]], situated in the northern outskirts and the forest is naturally divided into a north, west, east and south section, known as Nordskoven, Vesterskoven, Østerskoven and Sønderskoven respectively.

==Protections==
A total area of 1,455 ha of the forest is to be protected under [[Natura 2000]] and is designated as area 57 and [[Habitats Directive|EU Habitat]] area H181.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/NR/rdonlyres/0A9A0091-C4EF-42A3-91C1-447AB0DAA3AF/0/hab181.pdf Map of the H181 area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222121921/http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/NR/rdonlyres/0A9A0091-C4EF-42A3-91C1-447AB0DAA3AF/0/hab181.pdf |date=2014-02-22 }} Danish Nature Agency&lt;/ref&gt; 

The protection comprises several conservationally important forest and aquatic [[habitat]]s. Amongst these, habitat type 9120 defined as "Beech forests (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'') with holly (''[[Ilex]]''), growing on acidic soils, in a humid Atlantic climate",&lt;ref&gt;[http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/protectedsites/sacselection/habitat.asp?FeatureIntCode=H9120 Habitat account - Forests] Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)&lt;/ref&gt; is the most prevalent forest habitat at 351 ha,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/NR/rdonlyres/C0088849-2B3B-4DAB-B0D9-791232F5986E/0/SNSH181Silkeborgskovene.pdf Natura 2000 Basic Analysis (forest habitats), Silkeborg Forests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208110809/http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/NR/rdonlyres/C0088849-2B3B-4DAB-B0D9-791232F5986E/0/SNSH181Silkeborgskovene.pdf |date=2013-12-08 }} Danish Ministry of the Environment, May 2007 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while habitat type 3150, defined as "Natural eutrophic lakes with ''Magnopotamion'' or ''Hydrocharition''-type vegetation"&lt;ref&gt;[http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/publications/JNCC312/habitat.asp?FeatureIntCode=H3150 Freshwater habitats], Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)&lt;/ref&gt; is the most prevalent aquatic habitat in the area, at 188 ha. There are other important - but less extent - habitat types present, like the 54 ha [[Lobelian lake]]&lt;ref&gt;Habitat type 3130: "Oligotrophic to mesotrophic standing waters with vegetation of the ''Littorelletea'' uniflorae and/or of the ''Isoëto-Nanojuncetea''.

The designation is also based on the presence of [[European brook lamprey]], [[Northern crested newt]], [[Pond bat]] and the [[European otter]] living here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://naturstyrelsen.dk/media/204572/n57-silkeborg-skovene.pdf|title=Natura 2000-plejeplan 2016-2021 (N57 Silkeborg Skovene)|language=Danish|publisher=Naturstyrelsen|date=2017|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''summer park''' is a form of [[amusement park|theme park]] with a [[summer]]time theme, open only during the summertime season. Instead of electricity-generated [[carousel]]s, [[playground]]s and [[swimming pool]] make up most attractions.

In [[Denmark]], several summer parks have been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderful-denmark.com/Jutland-entertainment.html|title=Entertainment in Jutland|publisher=Wonderful Denmark|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sweden]], the phenomenon was booming by the mid and late 1980s. After expanding during the [[Roaring 1980s|economic boom]], a decrease began in the early 1990s during the [[Swedish banking rescue|economc recession]], but also because of the introduction of a wider entertainment market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornmark.se/places_intro.aspx?placeid=98&amp;lang= Övergivna platser - ''Svenska Sommarland]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terry Tempest Williams''' (born 8 September 1955), is an American author, [[Conservation movement|conservationist]], and [[activist]]. Williams' writing is rooted in the [[American West]] and has been significantly influenced by the [[arid]] landscape of her native [[Utah]] and its [[Mormon culture]]. Her work ranges from issues of [[ecology]] and [[wilderness]] [[Protected area|preservation]], to [[women's health]], to exploring our relationship to [[culture]] and [[nature]].

Williams has testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] on women's health, committed acts of [[civil disobedience]] in the years 1987–1992 in protest against [[Nevada National Security Site|nuclear testing in the Nevada Desert]], and again, in March 2003 in [[Washington, D.C.]], with [[Code Pink]], against the [[Iraq War]]. She has been a guest at the [[White House]], has camped in the remote regions of the Utah and [[Alaska]] wildernesses and worked as "a [[Creative peacebuilding#Barefoot Artists|barefoot artist]]" in [[Rwanda]].

Williams is the author of a number of books: ''Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place''; ''An Unspoken Hunger: Stories from the Field'';  ''Desert Quartet''; ''Leap'';  ''Red: Passion and Patience in the Desert''; ''The Open Space of Democracy''; and ''Finding Beauty in a Broken World''.

In 2006, Williams received the [[Robert Marshall Award]] from [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], their highest honor given to an American citizen. She also received the Distinguished Achievement Award from the [[Western Literature Association|Western American Literature Association]] and the 2005 [[Wallace Stegner Award]] given by [[Center of the American West]] (of the [[University of Colorado Boulder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STEGNER AWARD|url=http://centerwest.org/events/stegner|website=Center of the American West|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the recipient of a [[Lannan Literary Awards#Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction|Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction]] and a [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1997|1997]] [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in creative nonfiction. Williams was featured in [[Ken Burns]]' PBS series ''[[The National Parks: America's Best Idea]]'' (2009) and in [[Stephen Ives (filmmaker)|Stephen Ives's]] PBS documentary series ''[[The West (miniseries)|The West]]'', which was produced by Burns. In 2011, Williams received the 18th [[Community of Christ International Peace Award|International Peace Award]] given by the [[Community of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community of Christ International Peace Award|url=http://www.cofchrist.org/international-peace-award|website=Community of Christ|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2014, the [[Sierra Club]] honored her with their highest award, the [[Sierra Club John Muir Award]].

Williams is the current [[Obert C. Tanner|Annie Clark Tanner Fellow]] in the [[Environmental Humanities]] Graduate program at the [[University of Utah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terry Tempest Williams profile|url=http://humanities.utah.edu/alumni/profiles/terrywilliams.php|website=College of Humanities|publisher=The University of Utah|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and has written for ''[[The Progressive]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Progressive, Inc.|url=http://www.progressive.org/about|website=The Progressive|publisher=The Progressive Inc.|accessdate=22 September 2016|date=16 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been a [[Montgomery Fellow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barber|first1=Bonnie|title=Terry Tempest Williams and Christo Are Winter Term Montgomery Fellows|url=https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2009/01/terry-tempest-williams-and-christo-are-winter-term-montgomery-fellows|accessdate=22 September 2016|work=[[Dartmouth News]]|publisher=Trustees of Dartmouth College|date=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Dartmouth College]] where she continues to teach. She divides her time between [[Moose, Wyoming]] and [[Castle Valley, Utah]], where her husband [[Brooke Williams (conservationist)|Brooke]] is field coordinator for the [[Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance]].

==Early life, education, and work==
Terry Tempest Williams was born in [[Corona, California]], to Diane Dixon Tempest and John Henry Tempest, III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tredinnick|first1=Mark|title=The Land's Wild Music: Encounters with Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, Terry Tempest William, and James Galvin|date=29 September 2005|publisher=[[Trinity University Press]]|isbn=1595340181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was serving in the [[United States Air Force]] in [[Riverside, California]], for two years. She grew up in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], within sight of [[Great Salt Lake]].

[[Atomic testing]] at the [[Nevada Test Site]] (outside [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]) between 1951 and 1962 exposed Williams' family to [[radiation]] like many Utahns (especially those living in the southern part of the state), which Williams believes is the reason so many members of her family have been [[Radiation-induced cancer|affected by cancer]].  By 1994, nine members of the Tempest family had had [[mastectomies]], and seven had died of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mencimer|first1=Stephanie|title=A fierce responsibility|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1994/03/fierce-responsibility|accessdate=23 September 2016|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=March–April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the family members affected by cancer included Williams' own mother, [[grandmother]], and brother.

Williams met her husband [[Brooke Williams (conservationist)|Brooke Williams]] in 1974 while working part-time at [[Sam Weller's Bookstore]], a Salt Lake City bookstore, where he was a customer.  The two married six months after their first meeting and began their life together working at the [[Teton Science Schools|Teton Science School]] in [[Grand Teton National Park]].

In 1976 Williams was hired to teach science at [[Carden Method|Carden School]] of Salt Lake City (since renamed [[Mae Carden|Carden]] Memorial School).
She often clashed with the conservative couple that led the school over her unorthodox teaching methods and environmental politics, but she respected their gift of teaching through storytelling and prized her five years there.
"Teaching helped me find my voice," she later wrote. "The challenge was to impart large ecological concepts to young burgeoning minds in a language that wasn't polemical, but woven into a compelling story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Terry Tempest|title=When Women Were Birds: Fifty-four Variations on Voice|date=2012|publisher=[[Sarah Crichton Books]]|location=New York|isbn=1250024110|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Williams graduated from the [[University of Utah]] with a degree in [[English studies|English]] and a [[Minor (academic)|minor]] in [[biology]], followed by a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[environmental education]] in 1984. After graduating from college, Williams worked as a teacher in [[Montezuma Creek, Utah]], on the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] Reservation.  She worked at the [[Utah Museum of Natural History]] from 1986–96, first as curator of education and later as [[naturalist-in-residence]].

==Writing career==
Williams published her first book, ''The Secret Language of Snow'' in 1984. A children’s book written with [[Ted Major]], her mentor at the [[Teton Science School]], it received a [[National Science Foundation]] Book Award. Over the next few years, she published three other books: ''Pieces of White Shell: A Journey to Navajo Land'' (1984, illustrated by [[Clifford Brycelea]], a Navajo artist), ''Between Cattails'' (1985, illustrated by [[Peter Parnall]]), and ''Coyote’s Canyon'', (1989, with photographs by [[John Telford]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books|url=http://www.coyoteclan.com/books.html|website=Coyote Clan|publisher=Terry Tempest Williams|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Williams' memoir, ''[[Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place]]'' was published by [[Pantheon Books]]. The book interweaves [[memoir]] and [[natural history]], explores her complicated relationship to [[Mormonism]], and recounts her mother's diagnosis with [[ovarian cancer]] along with the concurrent flooding of the [[Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge]], a place special to Williams since childhood. The book's widely anthologized [[epilogue]], ''[[The Clan of One-Breasted Women]]'', explores whether the high incidence of cancer in her family might be due to their status as [[downwinders]] during the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]]'s above-ground [[nuclear testing]] in the 1950s and 60s. ''Refuge'' received the 1991 [[Evans Biography Award]] from the [[Mountain West Center for Regional Studies]] at [[Utah State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous Evans Winners|url=http://mountainwest.usu.edu/page14325610.aspx|website=Mountain West Center for Regional Studies|publisher=Utah State University|accessdate=23 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107204433/http://mountainwest.usu.edu/page14325610.aspx|archivedate=7 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mountains and Plains Independent Booksellers Association|Mountain &amp; Plains Booksellers]]' [[Reading the West Book Award]] for creative nonfiction in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading the West Book Awards Winners – 1990 through 2015|url=https://www.mountainsplains.org/wp-content/userfiles/2016/06/MPIBA_ReadingTheWest_Winners_1990-2015_5pgs.pdf|website=Mountains and Plains Independent Booksellers Association|accessdate=26 September 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, when the [[United States Congress]] was debating issues related to the [[List of U.S. Wilderness Areas#Utah|Utah wilderness]], Williams and writer [[Stephen Trimble]] edited the collection, ''Testimony: Writers Speak On Behalf of Utah Wilderness'', an effort by twenty American writers to sway public policy. A copy of the book was given to every member of Congress.&lt;ref name="Summer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summer|first1=David Thomas|title=''Testimony'', ''Refuge'', and the Sense of Place—A Conversation with Terry Tempest Williams|url=http://weberstudies.weber.edu/archive/archive%20C%20Vol.%2018.2-21.1/vol.%2019.3/sumner%20williams.htm|website=[[Weber (journal)|Weber]]|accessdate=26 September 2016|date=Spring–Summer 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 1996, President [[Bill Clinton]] at the dedication of the new [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]], held up this book and said, "This made a difference."&lt;ref name=Summer/&gt;

Williams' writing on ecological and social issues has appeared in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[Orion (magazine)|Orion]]'' magazine, among others. She has been published in numerous environmental, [[feminist]], political, and literary anthologies. She has also collaborated in the creation of [[fine art]] books with photographers [[Emmet Gowin]], [[Richard Misrach]], [[Debra Bloomfield]], [[Meridel Rubenstein]], [[Rosalie Winard]], and [[Edward Riddell]].

==Activism==
Williams wrote and spoke about the impact of the [[BP oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Terry Tempest|title=The Gulf Between Us: Stories of Terror and Beauty from the World’s Largest Accidental Offshore Oil Disaster|url=http://www.onbeing.org/program/vitality-struggle/feature/gulf-between-us-stories-terror-and-beauty-worlds-largest|accessdate=26 September 2016|work=[[Orion magazine|Orion]]|date=November–December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=6 Months Since BP Oil Spill, Writer and Environmentalist Terry Tempest Williams Asks "Where Is Our Outrage?"

On 13 June 2014, Williams posted an [[open letter]] to the leadership of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] expressing "[[solidarity]] with [[Kate Kelly (feminist)|Kate Kelly]] and her plea to grant women equal standing in the rights, responsibilities and privileges of the [LDS Church], including the [[Ordination of women|right to hold]] the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|Priesthood]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Terry Tempest|title=AN OPEN LETTER TO BISHOP MARK HARRISON AND PRESIDENT THOMAS S.

'''''Tropical Grasslands''''' was a [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] published by the Tropical Grassland Society of Australia which was formed in 1963. The journal was established in 1967 and was discontinued in 2010 when the Tropical Grassland Society of Australia closed due to declining membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tropicalgrasslands.asn.au/ |title=Welcome |publisher=Tropical Grassland Society |work=Official website |accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covered [[ecology|ecological]] and [[agriculture|agricultural]] aspects of [[grassland]]s.

In 2012, a new peer-reviewed scientific journal, ''Tropical Grasslands – Forrajes Tropicales'', covering research on tropical pastures and forages was established as an initiative of scientists from Australia and the [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]]. It succeeds the Spanish-only journal ''Pasturas Tropicales'', published from 1979 to 2007, and ''Tropical Grasslands''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tropicalgrasslands.info/index.php/tgft |title=Tropical Grasslands - Forrajes Tropicales |publisher=CIAT |work=Official website |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyle Winks, the former editor of ''Tropical Grasslands'', is the new journal's English editor; Rainer Schultze-Kraft is in charge of submissions in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=21 December 2012 |url=http://www.ciatnews.cgiar.org/2012/12/21/tropical-forages-new-journal-launched/#sthash.Jz8uYP0Y.dpuf |title=New journal launched: Tropical Grasslands - Forrajes Tropicales |work=CIAT Blog |publisher=[[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] |date=2012-12-21 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3410">The '''Veracruz moist forests''' are an [[ecoregion]], in the  [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[biome]], in eastern [[Mexico]].

==Setting==
The Veracruz moist forests cover an area of {{convert|69101|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, occupying a portion of [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Mexico's Gulf Coastal Plain]] between the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The forests extend from southern [[Tamaulipas]] state across northern [[Veracruz]], eastern [[San Luis Potosí]], and portions of eastern [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] and northeastern [[Puebla]].

To the north, the forests transition to the dry lowland [[Tamaulipan mezquital]] and the upland [[Tamaulipan matorral]]. To the east, the [[Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests]] occupy the higher elevations of the Sierra Madre Oriental. South of the gap where the [[Panuco River]] cuts through the Sierra Madre, the [[Veracruz montane forests]] and [[Oaxacan montane forests]] occupy middle slopes of the Sierra. The [[Veracruz dry forests]] separate the Veracruz moist forests from the [[Petén-Veracruz moist forests]] further south.

The northernmost extension of the Veracruz moist forests occurs in the [[El Cielo Biosphere]] and the [[Sierra de Tamaulipas]] at a latitude of about 23° 20′ degrees north.&lt;ref&gt;"Veracruz Moist Forests" http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/nt0176, accessed 18 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The climate of the region is tropical and humid, with rains during seven months of the year and mild variation in temperature. Average annual rainfall is {{convert|1100|-|1600|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

==Flora==
The canopy of this ecoregion is characterized by trees reaching a height of up to {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, such as Mayan breadnut (''[[Brosimum alicastrum]]''), sapodilla (''[[Manilkara zapota]]''), rosadillo (''[[Celtis monoica]]''), ''[[Bursera simaruba]]'', ''[[Dendropanax arboreus]]'', and ''[[Sideroxylon capiri]]''. The southern parts of the ecoregion feature mahogany (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]''), ''Manilkara zapota'', ''[[Bernoullia flammea]]'', and ''[[Astronium graveolens]]''.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=nt0176 |name=Veracruz moist forests |accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
Endemic birds include the [[red-crowned amazon]] (''Amazona viridigenalis''), [[Tamaulipas crow]] (''Corvus imparatus''), [[Altamira yellowthroat]] (''Geothlypis flavovelata''), and [[crimson-collared grosbeak]] (''Rhodothraupis celaeno''). Two rodent species, the [[El Carrizo deer mouse]] (''Peromyscus ochraventer'') and the [[Tamaulipan woodrat]] (''Neotoma angustapalata''), are also endemic.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==People==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==Conservation and threats==
The forests have been heavily altered by human activity, so that only a few enclaves of mature forest remain. Forests have been cleared for timber harvesting, agriculture, and grazing, and much of the original forest has been replaced with scrubland or secondary forest.

El Cielo Biosphere Reserve in southern Tamaulipas is the only protected area in the ecoregion.

A '''water horse''' (or "waterhorse" in some folklore) is a [[mythical creature]], such as the [[Ceffyl Dŵr]], [[Capaill Uisce]], the [[bäckahäst]] and [[kelpie]].

==Name origin==
[[File:Hippokampos, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|The hippocamp (as seen in this sketch from [[Pompeii]]) is a water creature that has been referred to as a water horse.]]

The term "water horse" was originally a name given to the [[kelpie]], a creature similar to the [[Hippocampus (mythology)|hippocamp]], which has the head, neck and mane of a normal [[horse]], legs like a horse, [[webbed feet]], and a long, two-lobed, [[whale]]-like tail. The term has also been used as a nickname for [[lake monsters]], particularly [[Ogopogo]] and [[Loch Ness Monster|Nessie]].{{r|Sarasota}} The name "kelpie" has often been a nickname for many other Scottish lake monsters, such as [[each uisge]] and [[Morag (lake monster)|Morag]] of [[Loch Morar]] and Lizzie of [[Loch Lochy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Monsters Inc: Scottish lochs and their creatures |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-21603269 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=23 July 2016 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for these sea monsters include "seahorse" (not referring to the [[seahorse]] fish) and "hippocampus" (which is the [[genus]] name for seahorses).

The usage of "water horse" or "kelpie" can often be a source of confusion; some consider the two terms to be synonymous, while others distinguish the water horse as a denizen of lochs and the kelpie of turbulent water such as rivers, fords, and waterfalls. Some authors call one creature of a certain place a kelpie while others call it a water horse. The name "[[water bull]]" has been used for either creature.

[[File:Evariste-Vital Luminais - Fuite de Gradlon.jpg|thumb|Flight of King Gradlon: Morvarc'h, the magical steed of King Gradlon of [[Ys]]]]

The [[Brittany|Breton]] King [[Gradlon]]'s magical "horse of the sea" [[Morvarc'h]] (whose name literally means "sea horse" in Breton) was said to have the ability to gallop upon the waves of the sea, in a similar fashion to the water horses of [[Cornish folklore|Cornish]] legend.

==Other lake monsters==
The water horse has often become a basic description of other lake monsters such as the Canadian [[Lake Okanagan]] monster [[Ogopogo]] and the [[Lake Champlain]] monster [[Champ (cryptozoology)|Champ]]. [[Loch Morar]] is reputedly home to "[[Morag (loch monster)|Morag]]", a [[lake monster]] that has been portrayed as a water horse.

==Settings==
Whilst most Scottish/Celtic [[folklore]] places the water horse in a [[loch]] (particularly a loch that is famous for a lake monster, such as [[Loch Ness]], [[Loch Morar]] or [[Loch Lomond]]), some [[Breton people|Breton]] and [[Cornish people|Cornish]] tales of water horses place them in the [[ocean]], making them [[sea monster]]s.

Most Highland loch have some kind of water-horse tradition, although a study of 19th-century literature of the time showed that only about sixty lochs and lochans merited a mention out of the thousands of bodies of water in Scotland. The water horse that was reputed to inhabit Loch Ness gained the most mentions in Highland literature.{{sfnp|Watson|2011|ps=none}}

==Sightings==
Water horse sightings were reported regularly during the 18th century, but it was not until the 19th century that sightings were recorded.
* In 1846 Captain Christmas of the [[Danish Navy]] reported sighting "an enormous, long-necked beast pursuing a school of [[dolphins]]" somewhere between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. He described the creature as having a horse-like head and a neck as thick as a man's [[waist]] "moving gracefully like a [[swan]]'s".
* On 6 August 1848 an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] corvette [[HMS Daedalus (1826)|HMS ''Daedalus'']] noticed an unusual looking animal swimming towards the ship. It was said to look similar to a [[sea serpent]] with a {{convert|4|ft|m|1|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} neck. Its head was about {{convert|15|or|16|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} long. It was reported to have no visible fins/flippers or tail, and it had what appeared to be a horsy mane on its neck with [[seaweed]] washed over its back.
* In late 1883, two horse-headed beasts, one of them smaller than the other (suggesting or implying a [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile]]), were reported off the southern coast of [[Panama]]. The crew of the American [[whaler]] ''Hope On'' reported seeing a {{convert|20|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} creature submerge. It was brownish coloured with black speckles and four legs/flippers with a tail "that seemed to be divided into two parts" (implying the whale-like tail appearance) and all four limbs and tail were exposed when it reached the surface. A second creature that looked just like it only much smaller tagged along behind it. In the same year, a sighting of a similar looking creature occurred in the [[Bristol Channel]]. This creature was reported as leaving behind a greasy [[slug]]/[[snail]]-like trail.

In  [[geochemistry]], [[hydrology]], [[paleoclimatology]] and [[paleoceanography]] '''''δ''&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N'''  (pronounced "delta fifteen n") or '''delta-N-15''' is a measure of the ratio of the two [[stable isotope]]s of [[nitrogen]], [[Nitrogen-15|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]]:[[Nitrogen-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Katzenberg | first=MA | title=Biological Anthropology of the Human Skeleton | chapter=Chapter 13: Stable Isotope Analysis: A Tool for Studying Past Diet, Demography, and Life History | year=2008 | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-471-79372-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulas==

Two very similar expressions for {{delta|15|N}} are in wide use in [[hydrology]].&lt;ref name="hed"&gt;{{cite article|last=Bedard-Haughn|first=A.|title=Tracing {{delta|15|N}} through landscapes: potential uses and precautions|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=272|pages=175-190|year=2003|bibcode=2003JHyd..272..175B|doi=10.1016/S0022-1694(02)00263-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both have the form &lt;math&gt;1000\frac{s-a}a&lt;/math&gt; &amp;permil; (&amp;permil; = permil or parts per thousand) where ''s'' and ''a'' are the relative abundances of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N in respectively the sample and the atmosphere.  The difference is whether the relative abundance is with respect to all the nitrogen, i.e. &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N plus &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, or just to &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N.  Since the atmosphere is 99.6337% &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N and 0.3663% &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, ''a'' is 0.003663 in the former case and 0.003663/0.996337 = 0.003676 in the latter.  However ''s'' varies similarly; for example if in the sample &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N is 0.385% and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N is 99.615%, ''s'' is 0.003850 in the former case and 0.00385/0.99615 = 0.003865 in the latter.  The value of &lt;math&gt;1000\frac{s-a}a&lt;/math&gt; is then 51.05&amp;permil; in the former case and 51.38&amp;permil; in the latter, an insignificant difference in practice given the typical range of -20 to 80 for {{delta|15|N}}.

==Applications==

One use of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N is as a tracer to determine the path taken by fertilizers applied to anything from pots to landscapes.&lt;ref name="hed" /&gt;  Fertilizer enriched in &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N to an extent significantly different from that prevailing in the soil (which may be different from the atmospheric standard ''a'') is applied at a point and other points are then monitored for variations in {{delta|15|N}}.

Another application is the assessment of human waste water discharge into bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;http://longislandsoundstudy.net/2010/07/sediment-delta-15/&lt;/ref&gt;  The abundance of &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N  is greater in human waste water than in natural water sources.  Hence {{delta|15|N}} in [[Benthic zone|benthic]] sediment gives an indication of the contribution of human waste to the total nitrogen in the sediment.  Sediment cores analyzed for {{delta|15|N}} yield an historical record of such waste, with older samples at greater depths.
