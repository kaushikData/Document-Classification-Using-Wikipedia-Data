      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13964">During the '''Parade of Nations''' portion of the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], athletes from each country participating in the Olympics paraded in the arena, preceded by their flag. The flag was borne by a sportsperson from that country chosen either by the [[National Olympic Committee]] or by the athletes themselves to represent their country.

Notable flag bearers included triple jumper and Olympic bronze medalist [[João Carlos de Oliveira]] (Brazil), heavyweight boxer and two-time Olympic gold medalist [[Teofilo Stevenson]] (Cuba), sprinter and defending Olympic champion [[Hasely Crawford]] (Trinidad and Tobago), hurdler and former Olympic champion [[John Akii-Bua]] (Uganda), and middle-distance runner [[Miruts Yifter]] (Ethiopia).

In partial support to the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|United States boycott]], sixteen countries marched into the Olympic stadium under the Olympic flag. Seven of them, however, did not attend the opening ceremonies, their flags were instead carried by Moscow Olympic Committee volunteers. Two other countries (Great Britain and Ireland) paraded into the Stadium only with their officials, while four of them participated under the Olympic flag with their athletes. New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain, on the other hand, participated at the Games under their NOC flags.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9076">'''Al Gromer Khan''' is a German-born [[sitar]] player and [[composer]] whose music spans the multiple genres of [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[New-age music|new age]], [[World music|world]] and [[electronica]]. He is author of 4 novels and author of National-Radio documentaries and features about music since more than 25 years and works as a visual artist. 
Al Gromer Khan was awarded the RABINDRANATH TAGORE CULTURAL PRIZE 2015 for his lifetime achievement as musician/performer on sitar and surbahar of the highest order, composer, writer and visual artist by the Indo-German Society.

== Early influences ==
Al Gromer Khan was born on April 8, 1946, at Frauenzell in the alpine foothills of Bavaria between Lake Constance and Munich.

During his college time he founded a skiffle-group became a jazzguitarist and  left his home to become a jazz musician and a beat poet, spending time in London, Tangier and India.

Gromer Khan claims that he was drawn to the "mysteries of sound", from early childhood, be it the sound of the bells worn by the Bavarian cows grazing in the alpine meadows near his birthplace, or the "singing" telephone wires on the wind in the freezing Bavarian winters, and later American blues and country music, Indian stringed instruments, the drums of North Africa. Gromer Khan claims to have rejected the academic or diplomatic careers his parents expected him to take up.

The 1960s found a twenty-something Al Gromer in London where he took part in a number of creative experiments which were to have a lasting influence on him. According to Gromer Khan, the Prince Tiane na Champassak of Laos introduced him to tantric art and pop star Marc Bolan invited him to join in the all-night jam sessions he hosted. He explored psycho-acoustic phenomena with film director Mike Figgis, and saxophonist Ronnie Scott of Ronnie Scott's Jazzclub, who introduced Al to Ben Webster, Max Roach and Miles Davis, while Cat Stevens (now known as Yusuf Islam), gave him a taste for English poetry. At times he attended a London art school.

== Development as a sitarist==
There is no doubt that Gromer Khan's creative encounters during the 1960s deeply formed his musical taste and style; however, Gromer’s ultimate musical awakening came at a recital by sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan in Westminster Abbey 1968. Gromer Khan professes to have been so moved by the performance that he instantly decided to devote his life to the study of the sitar. He went to India, where he was to find a powerful teacher in Vilayat Khan's brother, Ustad Imrat Khan. Gromer Khan remained in India for the next three years, speed-learning his instrument at the feet of his guru. He returned to Bavaria in 1973, already an accomplished sitarist.

Gromer Khan spent the next 7 years studying with Imrat Khan in Europe and India. In 1975, his teacher performed the Ghanda Ceremony, thus initiating Al Gromer into the Khan-I-Gharana lineage of sitarists. He was the first outsider to be accepted into this particular Gharana, which like most Hindustani musical traditions, passes knowledge down the generations from father to son. After his initiation, Al Gromer added "Khan" to his name.

== Creative works ==
Concurrently, Khan engaged in a number of experimental projects, pioneering the proto-electronic music amongst others together with Popol Vuh. He was involved in contemplative and world music for radio, television, film and sound recordings projects. With his extensive compositional work he was the initiator and key figure of musical genres that are now known as Ambient and World Music, New Age.

Travel and concerts of classical Indian music in India and Europe followed. In addition, texts and documentaries on music for various ARD radio stations.
Since 1974, Khan has released more than 50 albums.

He currently resides in Munich, Germany.

In 2006 the novel Der Lehrer sein Schüler und der weiße Mogul audiobook was released. 2007 the short novel Jazzweihnacht audiobook followed. 2011 the English version e-book Jazzchristmas. 2009 the novels Jimi of Silence and Der weiße Mogul were released. 2013 the English version The White Mogul and e-book 2015.

'''Alexios Komnenos''', [[latinised]] as '''Alexius Comnenus''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Ἀλέξιος Κομνηνός}}}}), was the eldest son of the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[John II Komnenos]] and his wife [[Piroska of Hungary|Eirene of Hungary]]. He was born in February 1106 at [[Sidirokastro|Balabista]] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], was made co-emperor with his father at 16 or 17 years of age and died on 2 August 1142 &lt;ref name="Choniates p.22"&gt;Choniates p.22&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Antalya|Attalia]], [[Pamphylia]]. He was an elder brother of the emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]], and had a twin sister, Maria Komnene (plus other siblings).

==Life==

Alexios was made co-emperor by his father in 1122, but died in 1142. This was the year before his father's death as the result of a hunting accident. The reign of John II is less well chronicled than those of his father, [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], or successor, Manuel I, and coverage of the life of his son Alexios is very sparse.

A [[panegyric]]al poem by [[Theodore Prodromos]] was addressed to John and his son on the occasion of the coronation of Alexios. It hailed both rulers as "kings born of kings and emperors, reformers of old customs and privileges, with whom the august throne and sceptre-bearing are a paternal acquisition, a matter of inheritance."&lt;ref&gt;Magdalino p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

His final illness is described: "...of the severest kind and of short duration, took the form of a rushing fever attacking the head as though it were an acropolis."&lt;ref name="Choniates p.22"/&gt; The location of Alexios' death, at Attalia, suggests that he was on campaign with his father, who had established this city as a base from which to pacify the inland areas around Lake Pousgousē (probably the modern [[Beyşehir Gölü]]).&lt;ref&gt;Choniates pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; Alexios' younger brother [[Andronikos Komnenos (son of John II)|Andronikos]] was charged with escorting the body back to Constantinople, however, while discharging this duty, he too was taken ill and died.&lt;ref&gt;Choniates p.374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
[[File:Jan2 Alexios1.jpg|thumb|left|John II and his eldest son Alexios (right), crowned by Christ]]

The identity of his wife is uncertain. It is possible he was married twice, the first wife being Dobrodjeja Mstislavna of Kiev, a daughter of [[Mstislav I of Kiev]], and the second being [[Kata of Georgia]], a daughter of [[David IV of Georgia]]. While both women are known to have married members of the [[Komnenoi]] family, several theories have been suggested as to the identities of their husband or husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BYZANTIUM%2010571204.htm#AlexiosKdied1142 |title-date= |title= Profile of Alexios Komnenos and his daughter |date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His daughter Maria Komnene married the ''[[pansebastos]]'' [[Alexios Axuch]]. He was the son of [[John Axuch]], the ''[[megas domestikos]]'' (commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army), who was a close friend of John II.&lt;ref&gt;Choniates p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Alexios Axuch served as Duke of [[Cilicia]] and ''[[protostrator]]''.&lt;ref name="fmg.ac"&gt;{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BYZANTINE%20NOBILITY.htm#_Toc178348366 |title-date= |title= Profile of the Axuches family |date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he eventually fell out of favor with [[Manuel I Komnenos]] in 1167. [[John Kinnamos]] and [[Niketas Choniates]] report that the accusations against him included practice of [[witchcraft]]. He and an unnamed "[[Latins (Middle Ages)|Latin]]" [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] were accused of causing the pregnancy of [[Maria of Antioch]], the Empress consort, to result in a [[miscarriage]]. They supposedly managed to do so by providing [[drug]]s to Maria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/maryant.htm Lynda Garland and Andrew Stone, "Mary of Antioch"]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexios ended his life as a monk.&lt;ref name="fmg.ac"/&gt; Maria Komnene, "wife of Alexios the ''protostrator''" was mentioned in a seal. According to the ''Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople'' (1983) by Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza, this Maria was suffering from [[insanity]] by the end of her life.&lt;ref&gt;Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza, ''Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople'' (1983), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were the parents of [[John Komnenos the Fat|John Komnenos "the Fat"]], a short-lived rival emperor to [[Alexios III Angelos]]. [[Theodora Axuchina]], wife of [[Alexios I of Trebizond]], is considered a possible daughter of John the Fat.&lt;ref name="fmg.ac"/&gt;

'''Amie Noelle Comeaux''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|m|oʊ}}; December 4, 1976 – December 21, 1997) was an American [[country music]] singer who gained fame in her teens. Her debut album, ''Moving Out'', was released on [[Polydor Records]] in 1994, and it produced the single "Who's She to You", a No.&amp;nbsp;64 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Two posthumous albums, ''A Very Special Angel'' and ''Memories Left Behind'', were issued in 1998 and 2007, respectively.

==Early life==
Comeaux first began singing at nursing homes and weddings as a child. When she was nine years old, she sang the [[Star-Spangled Banner]] at a [[New Orleans Saints]] game in the [[Louisiana Superdome]], and continued to do so throughout her teenage years. Comeaux was also chosen to play the lead role in ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at the [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] Little Theater.

==Career==
Record producer [[Harold Shedd]] had been working with Comeaux since she was ten years old, helping her with her singing skills.&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/amie-comeaux-mn0000747865/discography&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wire"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/01-12-98/nash_music-industry.html |title="Before Her Time": Country music loses Amie Comeaux |accessdate=2008-01-07 |last=Keel |first=Beverly |date= 1998-01-12 |work=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, she was signed to [[Polydor Records]] label. A year later, her debut album ''Moving Out'' was released;&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; however, Polydor closed its doors soon afterward, and Comeaux was left without a record deal. [[Toby Keith]], who was also on Polydor at the time, had offered to help with Comeaux's second album before the label's closure.&lt;ref name="wire"/&gt;

==Death==
On December 21, 1997, Comeaux was returning home with her grandmother and her godchild, Megan, from a [[Christmas]] family gathering in [[Alabama]]. As Comeaux passed a car, her car [[hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaned]] due to heavy rain and struck a tree. She was killed instantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brusly singer dies in car wreck|date=December 22, 1997|work=[[The Advocate (Louisiana)|The Advocate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comeaux's grandmother and godchild were injured in the crash and were hospitalized for some time, but both survived. She was buried in Grace Memorial Park Cemetery in [[Plaquemine, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Briefs|date=December 23, 1997|work=The Advocate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comeaux's posthumous album ''A Very Special Angel'' was released March 6, 1998 by Rival Records of [[Nashville, Tennessee]], but due to printing errors, the album had to be repackaged and was re-released 20 days later. Comeaux had co-written some of the songs on the album. A second posthumous album, ''Memories Left Behind'', was released in 2007. This album was dedicated to Comeaux's mother, who died in August 2006.

==Background==
Born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], he moved to Marietta, Georgia at a young age, attending [[Joseph Wheeler High School]], where he was teammates with [[Reggie Witherspoon (athlete)|Reggie Witherspoon]]. Merritt ran for the [[University of Tennessee]] from 2003 to 2006 and had a successful college career, a seven-time All-American. He took the 110 meter hurdles gold at the [[2004 World Junior Championships in Athletics|2004 World Junior Championships]] and finished sixth at the [[2006 IAAF World Athletics Final|2006 World Athletics Final]]. Also in 2006, he won the [[NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|NCAA Championships]], was undefeated in all hurdles events that year, and broke [[Willie Gault]]'s [[Tennessee Volunteers track and field|Tennessee Volunteers]] hurdles record. His victory at the NCAA Championships in 13.21&amp;nbsp;s was the second fastest ever collegiate time in the United States, behind only [[Renaldo Nehemiah]]. He reached the [[2008 IAAF World Athletics Final|World Athletics Final in 2008]], finishing in fourth.
Merritt is the first hurdler to ever win gold in the US Indoor Championship, the World Indoor Championship (Istanbul, Turkey), the US Olympic Trials, and the Olympic Games all in the same year.

==Professional athletics career==

===2011===
In the final of the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics – Men's 110 metres hurdles|110m hurdles at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics]], Merritt was initially classified 6th, with a time of 13.67&amp;nbsp;s. After [[Dayron Robles]] was disqualified, Merritt was promoted to 5th. His season's best was 13.12&amp;nbsp;s, achieved in Eugene, Oregon and Oslo.

===2012===
Merritt began the 2012 campaign by altering his approach to the first hurdle, switching from eight to seven steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/story/2012-07-23/Merritts-risky-adjustment-helps-him-step-into-Olympics/56440402/1 |work=USA Today |title=Aries Merritt's risky change helps him step into Olympics |date=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview he stated, "[it] was pretty risky to make a change like that, but something had to be done if I was going to compete with (Liu Xiang of China and Dayron Robles of Cuba). The change allows me to maintain my momentum going into the first barrier." Merrit's change was highly successful for the 2012 indoor season as he became the indoor world champion in the 60 meters hurdles at the [[2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships|2012 World Indoor Championships]] in [[Istanbul]]. In the final, he beat [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]] and [[Pascal Martinot-Lagarde]] with a time of 7.44&amp;nbsp;s.

====2012 Summer Olympics====
{{See also|Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics}}

At the [[2012 United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|Olympic trials]] in Oregon, Merritt won the 110 meter hurdles final in a world leading time of 12.93&amp;nbsp;s,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|jQanySaHsbY}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the Olympic team for the first time.  Merritt subsequently matched the time at two consecutive [[Diamond League]] events, at Crystal Palace and Monaco, winning both races.

At the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]] in London, Merritt began by running the fastest qualifying time in the heats with a time of 13.07&amp;nbsp;s.  In the semi-finals, he was again dominant with a time of 12.94&amp;nbsp;s.  In the final, [[Dayron Robles]] and Merritt got the fastest starts but Merritt pulled ahead at hurdle 3.  He continued to a personal best of 12.92&amp;nbsp;s and a 0.12&amp;nbsp;s win over reigning world champion [[Jason Richardson (athlete)|Jason Richardson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Long |first=Mark |title=Aries Merritt Wins 110-Meter Hurdles Gold, Jason Richardson Takes Silver |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/08/aries-merritt-jason-richardson-hurdles-olympics_n_1757917.html |accessdate=2012-08-08 |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18907751 |title=Aries Merritt claims 110m hurdles Olympic gold |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashton Joseph Mouton, Sr.''' (October 16, 1916 &amp;ndash; January 31, 1988),  was a United States [[businessperson|businessman]] and [[politician]] who became, at thirty-one, the youngest [[mayor]] in the history of [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Mouton was elected mayor in 1948. He served two four-year terms and left office in 1956. In 1963, Mouton was an unsuccessful contender for [[lieutenant governor]] on an intraparty ticket with the winning [[gubernatorial]] candidate, [[John McKeithen|John Julian McKeithen]] of tiny [[Columbia, Louisiana|Columbia]], the seat of [[Caldwell Parish]], in northeastern Louisiana.

==Biography==
Mouton was born in Lafayette (also [[Lafayette Parish]]) to Edwin Mouton, Sr., and the former Georgie McBride. He was educated at Mount Carmel Elementary School and Cathedral High School in Lafayette. In 1939, he obtained a degree in [[business administration]] from Southwestern Louisiana Institute, now the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]]. He married the former Stella Rose Dupuis, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. J.W. Dupuis, Sr., of [[Youngsville, Louisiana|Youngsville]] in [[Lafayette Parish]]. They had five children: Stella Rose; Ashton J. Mouton, Jr. (born 1947); twins Catherine Anne and Carolyn Anne (born 1953); and John Mouton. The twins were the first pygopagus [[conjoined twins]] to be successfully separated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818902,00.html?promoid=googlep/ "Prayer &amp; Surgery"], ''Time'', September 28, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a namesake grandson, Ashton J. Mouton, III, of Lafayette (born 1983).

From 1939-1941, Mouton was the administrative assistant in the Lafayette [[municipal]] finance office. He served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]] from 1941 to 1945. After the war, Mouton started a career in [[life insurance]].

Mouton succeeded Claude C. Colomb (July 19, 1889 - December 1973) as mayor. He was recognized widely for his mayoral success, even being honored on March 10, 1955, by the [[Louisiana Municipal Association]] and its trade publication, the ''Louisiana Municipal Review'', as one of the outstanding mayors in Louisiana at the time. Over the next several decades, Lafayette became the fourth largest city in the state. At the time of Mouton's service, Lafayette, as did many other Louisiana communities, had a [[City commission government|commission]] form of city [[government]]. He was succeeded as mayor by [[Jerome E. Domengeaux]] (March 3, 1919 - May 27, 1999).

After his mayoral years, Mouton became an independent [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] lease broker. He held various state-level appointments too, including the Mineral Board (1950–1952), Board of Tax Appeals (1956–1958), commissioner of conservation (1958–1960, collector of revenues, (1964–1970), director of hospitals (1970–1971), and administrative assistant to the director of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement in 1972. The three former appointments were in the administration of Governor [[Earl Kemp Long]], and the three later positions were under his mentor John McKeithen. Mouton was affiliated with the powerful [[Earl Long|Long]] [[Political faction|faction]] of Louisiana politics.

In 1965, Mouton sued the Schwegmann Brothers Giant Super Markets, Inc., to collect for the state sales, use and occupational license taxes plus interest in the amount of $62,517.98. Schwegmann appealed the assessments to the Louisiana Board of Tax Appeals. Ten years later, the tax board ruled in Mouton's favor, some five years after he had left the collector's position. The former super market was owned in part by then [[Louisiana State Legislature|state Representative]] [[John G. Schwegmann]] of [[Jefferson Parish]].  Thereafter, Mouton sued to collect another $103,290.59. Schwegmann answered and denied liability. The two cases were consolidated in the trial court by consent of the parties. In the trial, Mouton was upheld in both cases. In 1971, Schwegmann unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor on a platform to cut government spending.

Mouton began selling [[real estate]] in 1976 and was associated with an agency in Lafayette from 1978 until his death ten years later.

In his lieutenant governor's race, Mouton failed to make the Democratic runoff primary, which was won by the [[incumbent]] [[Clarence C. Aycock|Clarence C. "Taddy" Aycock]] of [[Franklin, Louisiana|Franklin]], the seat of [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]]. Aycock defeated future state Senator [[Claude B. Duval]] of [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]] in [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne Parish]]. Also running on the McKeithen-Mouton ticket for the new position of [[insurance commissioner]] was future [[U.S. Representative]] and then [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Speedy O. Long]] (1928–2006) of [[Jena, Louisiana|Jena]], the seat of [[La Salle Parish]]. Long was defeated by [[Dudley A. Guglielmo]], an [[Italian-American]] politician.

Mouton was a member of the [[American Legion]], the [[Knights of Columbus]] (a [[Catholic]] men's organization), and Mardi Gras Krewe of Gabriel.

Mouton is interred in the Lafayette Memorial Park Cemetery.

Aisha suffered early in life, losing her mother and forced into marriage as a teenager.&lt;ref name="CNN2012" /&gt; In a practice known as [[baad (practice)|baad]], Aisha's father promised her to a [[Taliban]] fighter when she was 12 years old as compensation for a killing that a member of her family had committed. She was married at 14 and subjected to abuse. At 18 she fled the abuse but was caught by police, jailed for five months, and returned to her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grenoble |first=Ryan |title=Afghan Woman Who Had Nose, Ears Cut Off By Taliban Recovers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/27/aesha-mohammadzai-nose-ears-taliban_n_2773994.html|accessdate=11 February 2015|newspaper=''[[Huffington Post]]'' |date=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father returned her to her husband's family. To take revenge on her escape, her father-in-law, husband, and three other family members took Aisha into the mountains, cut off her nose and her ears, and left her to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bates|first=Karen Grigsby|title=Bibi Aisha, Disfigured Afghan Woman Featured On 'Time' Cover, Visits U.S.|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/10/13/130527903/bibi-aisha-disfigured-afghan-woman-featured-on-time-cover-visits-u-s|accessdate=27 November 2010|newspaper=[[National Public Radio]] blog: The Two-Way|date=13 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101112133515/http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/10/13/130527903/bibi-aisha-disfigured-afghan-woman-featured-on-time-cover-visits-u-s| archivedate= 12 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aisha was later rescued by aid workers and the U.S. military.

==Appearance in ''Time'' magazine==
Aisha was featured on the August 2010 cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, and in the corresponding article, "Afghan Women and the Return of the Taliban."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Aryn |title=Afghan Women and the Return of the Taliban |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2007238,00.html |accessdate=27 November 2010 |newspaper=''[[Time (magazine)]]'' |date=29 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s2Dybv1t?url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2007238,00.html |archivedate=2010-08-16 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover image generated enormous controversy.&lt;ref name=AOL&gt;{{cite news|title=Disfigured Afghan on Cover of Time Heads to US|url=http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/disfigured-afghan-on-cover-of-time-heads-to-us/19582078|accessdate=27 November 2010|newspaper=[[AOL News]]|date=5 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022124150/http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/disfigured-afghan-on-cover-of-time-heads-to-us/19582078|archivedate=22 October 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image and the accompanying cover title, "What Happens if We Leave Afghanistan," fueled debate about the merits of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nordland |first=Ron |title=Portrait of Pain Ignites Debate Over Afghan War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/world/asia/05afghan.html?src=mv|accessdate=27 November 2010|newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in the United States ==
Shortly after ''Time'''s cover ran in August 2010, Aisha was flown to the United States to receive free [[reconstructive surgery]].&lt;ref name="AOL"/&gt; After arriving in [[California]], she psychologically regressed into performing fake seizures, tantrums, and [[self-harm]] that required hospitalization. Surgeons concluded that she was not "emotionally prepared" to handle the patient responsibilities in the reconstructive surgery process, and her psychologist diagnosed her with [[borderline personality disorder]].&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/05/world/saving.aesha/?hpt=hp_c2 | work=CNN | title=Saving Aesha}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her reconstructive surgery was delayed, she was taken in by the [[Women for Afghan Women]] shelter in [[Queens, New York]], but she caused many problems for the staff and other residents, including roommates hired by the shelter to live with her.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt; Aisha's condition improved with a change in medications, and the seizures stopped.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt;

Later, Aisha's psychological condition improved enough that she was able to cease taking medications to control her behavior. Starting in 2012, preparations to do a multistage facial reconstruction for Aisha began.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt; Her forehead was expanded over the course of several months to provide enough tissue to build a new nose. The structure for her new nose was built using cartilage from her own body and tissue from her left hand was also used for the inner lining.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt; Aisha underwent a total of 12 completed surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRAokVK_R2w Video chronicling her surgery by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (Nov 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[ABC News]] revisited Aisha and revealed her new nose that has altered her appearance. Aisha has been adopted by an Afghan-American couple, and lives in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QBeakiLzNY "Meet Aesha, a Symbol of Strength and Triumph" ABC News video (July 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=American Society of Plastic Surgeons ASPS|title=Patients of Courage {{!}} Bibi Aisha|date=2014-11-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRAokVK_R2w|accessdate=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studies English and mathematics and aspires to be a police officer.&lt;ref name="Saving Aesha" /&gt;

'''Budi Sudarsono''' (born 19 September 1979 in [[Kediri (city)|Kediri, East Java]]) is an active [[Indonesia]]n [[Association football|footballer]]. He normally plays either as an attacking midfielder or a forward.

He played for [[Persik Kediri]] in the [[2007 AFC Champions League]] group stage, where he scored two goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|author1=Saaid, Hamdan  |author2=Stokkermans, Karel |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Asian Club Competitions 2007|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/ascup07.html|date=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
He has made several appearances for the [[Indonesia national football team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]] |author=Widigdo, Novianto |title=Indonesia – Record International Players |url=http://rsssf.com/miscellaneous/indo-recintlp.html |accessdate=9 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706091901/http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/indo-recintlp.html |archivedate=6 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is best remembered for scoring goals in two consecutive [[Asian Cup]] tournaments. He opened his account by scoring a goal in the [[2004 Asian Cup]] for [[Indonesia]] against [[Qatar]] in a group A game which Indonesia ended up winning 2–1. It was Indonesia's first ever victory in [[Asian Cup]] history since their first participation in [[Asian Cup 1996]]. The other goal was scored by his teammate [[Ponaryo Astaman]]. He scored another goal in the [[2007 Asian Cup]] for Indonesia against Bahrain in group D, which ended in a 2–1 win for Indonesia. The other goal was scored by [[Bambang Pamungkas]]. His fans have nicknamed him ''Budi Gol'', ''Budi Jancok'', ''Kileng'', ''Budi Drogba'' (for his resemblance to the Ivorian striker [[Didier Drogba]]), and ''Ular Piton'' (''Python''). He scored the only goal for Indonesia against Syria during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualification in Jakarta in which Indonesia went on to lose 1–4 and lose the 2nd leg 0–7 and eliminated from the competition.

The '''early political career of [[Habib Bourguiba]]''' began in the early 1930s when he joined the main political party of the [[Tunisian national movement]], the [[Destour]]. His political beginnings were characterized with a "battle" in newspapers such as ''L'Étandar Tunisien'' and ''La voix du Tunisien'', while defending Tunisia's integrity and the preservation of its national identity. Shocked by the 1930 International [[Eucharistic Congress]] of [[Carthage]], Bourguiba and his mates decided to start a press campaign to denounce the event. They soon acquired an unprecedented popularity, and stood out from the elders of Destour. They attracted the hostility of settlers, eager to put an end to their activism and press campaign. However, Bourguiba and his friends founded their own newspaper, despite the colonial attempts to stop them. ''[[L'Action Tunisienne]]'' was thus created in order to defend the "little people" in a context of economic crisis, following the [[Great Depression]].

Bourguiba, worried about his country's state, knew that a good cause would revive the national movement, weakened by the 1926 repressions. In order to do so, he was the only one to defend M'hamed Chenik, a Tunis notable, who had been in trouble with the Residence, the French colonial administration. Bourguiba jumped at the chance to rally the bourgeoisie class to the nationalist cause. But his attempt failed and ended up dividing ''L'Action'' team. In this context, the uprising following the [[Tunisian naturalization issue]], in early 1933, was the perfect opportunity for him. He started another successful press campaign. With his friends [[Tahar Sfar]], [[Mahmoud El Materi]], [[Bahri Guiga]] and his brother M'hamed, they sensitized lower classes to their cause and changed the Residence policy. The popularity he acquired during the event, led to his election as a member of the executive committee of the Destour, in May 1933. However, differences with the elders caused him to resign from the party in September 1933.

==First steps in politics==
{{See also|Early life of Habib Bourguiba}}

=== Challenging the protectorate ===

In the early 1930s, Bourguiba joined the [[Destour]] party, then the major political organization of the [[Tunisian national movement]]. He rose to its leadership along with [[Mahmoud El Materi]], [[Bahri Guiga]], [[Tahar Sfar]] and his brother [[M'hamed Bourguiba|M'hamed]]. As preparations took place to host [[President of France|French President]] [[Paul Doumer]] as part of the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the [[French protectorate of Tunisia|protectorate]], nationalists were not pleased. In an article he wrote in ''Le Croissant'', a newspaper managed by his cousin Abdelaziz El-Aroui, Bourguiba denounced the festivities as a "humiliating affront to the dignity of the Tunisian people to whom France recalls the loss of freedom and independence".{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Juliette|last=Bessis|title=La méditerranée fasciste, l'Italie mussolinienne et la Tunisie|publisher=Karthala Editions|location=Paris|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these events, the Destour leadership gathered in an emergency meeting at the Hôtel d'Orient in February 1931. It was decided to constitute a supporting committee for Chedly Khairallah's weekly newspaper, ''La Voix du Tunisien'', which became a daily. The young nationalists joined the team and wrote critical analyses of the protectorate. Bourguiba, unlike his elders, dared to challenge the protectorate, publishing numerous articles and defining his own views on the colonial administration. He questioned both its effects and existence, writing: {{quote|text=A State can not be both subject and sovereign: Any treaty of protectorate, because of its nature, carries its own seed of death [...] Is it a lifeless country, a degenerate people who declines? Reduced to be nothing more than a dust of individuals; that means awaiting for downfall [...] In short, total and inevitable demise. Is it, in contrary, a sain people, vigorous, that international races or a momentary crisis forced them to accept the tutelage of a strong state, the necessarily inferior status imposed upon them, the contact of a more advanced civilization determines in them a salutary reaction [...] a real regeneration occurs in them and through judicious assimilation, they inevitably come to realize in stages their final emancipation. Time will tell if the Tunisian people belong to one or the other category.|author=[[Habib Bourguiba]]|source=''La Voix du Tunisien'' (February 23, 1931)}}

[[Image:Bourguiba in 1932.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Habib Bourguiba in the early 1930s]]

''La Voix du Tunisien'' became a very popular newspaper because of the originality with which Bourguiba, Sfar, Guiga and Materi addressed problems. They stood out from their Destour elders by their new ways of thinking. Bourguiba reckoned the end of the protectorate as the outcome of an evolution that had taken its roots in the very principles of French civilization, unlike [[Abdelaziz Thâalbi]], who thought of it as a breakup, in an article he wrote in ''La Tunisie martyre''. Referred to as the "four musketeers", they were in favor of the intangibility of national personality and political sovereignty of the Tunisian people with a progressive emancipation of the country, while advocating for a nationalism that struggled against a regime and not a civilization.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=71}}

Their work soon attracted the interest of both public opinion and wealthy landowners and businessmen (preponderants) who had a strong influence on the colonial administration. Hostile to their daring plea, the preponderants wrote in ''La Tunisie française'': "Mr Bourguiba proposes to transform the Destourian lament into a doctoral thesis in law. The claims are not modest [...] They must be demanded to tone down their ''Voix du Tunisien''".{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=71}} During the conference he held in November 1973, Bourguiba related the events of his beginnings in journalism and the success of his articles:&lt;ref name="Conférence4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bourguiba.com/uploads/docs/pdf/fr/bourguiba-CONFERENCE-4-9-NOV-1973.pdf|title=Fourth conference held by : President Habib Bourguiba|author=Bourguiba, Habib|date=November 9, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|text=A strong turmoil had broken in Tunisia. In cafés and public places, my articles were read and commented. They seriously bothered French people because they did not only paint a grim picture of the current conditions, they also denounced, through logical deductions, the hidden agendas of authorities and exposed their concealed wills. I denounced the goals they had aimed and alerted them against the dangers of their policy that only could, eventually, jeopardize the security of France. I highlighted, at last, all the interests the french government had to negotiate with a free and independent Tunisian state.|author=[[Habib Bourguiba]]|source=Fourth conference held on November 9, 1973.}}

The preponderants were successful in their attempts to silence the nationalist papers as the colonial administration censored ''An-Nahdha'', the daily paper of the reformist party and the weekly ''Ez-Zohra'', on May 12, 1931. Within days, Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, Bahri Guiga, Salah Farhat and Mahmoud El Materi were sued.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=71}} Chedli Khalledi, a member of the Destour party, alerted [[Marius Moutet]] and [[Gaston Bergery]], chief of staff to [[Édouard Herriot]], who were friends of the nationalists and had influence in Paris. Bergery quickly interfered, contacted the head of the African-Orient department in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], and obtained an adjournment of their hearings to June 9, 1931.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=23}} Awaiting trial, the editors of ''La Voix du Tunisien'' launched a press protest campaign whose tone was both violent and revolutionary. El Materi wrote: "When we started political action, we knew in advance what was awaiting us [...] May the hand that strikes me be heavy, may the judges that charge me be ruthless [...] A cause that does not engender martyrs is lost in advance."{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=72}}

On the day of trial, the streets that led to the court were full of people. Shops and stores of the [[medina quarter]] were closed and law enforcement could not handle the turmoil. The crowd carried them in triumph as their hearings were, once again, postponed. Fearing overthrow, François Manceron, then-resident-general, met with Chedly Khairallah, manager of ''La Voix du Tunisien'', at his residence in [[La Marsa]], to find a compromise. That very afternoon, he invited the drafting committee of the newspaper and declared that he had an interview, that morning, with Khairallah. He also announced that a compromise was found. This lie made mischief within the group. Bourguiba asked Khairallah for further clarifications and he confirmed the rendezvous with the resident-general. In response the drafting committee demanded the management of the daily journal but, upon Khairallah's refusal to do so, decided to leave the newspaper.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=72}}

=== Founding of ''L'Action Tunisienne'' ===
{{main article|L'Action Tunisienne}}

After they left the newspaper, the ''La Voix du Tunisien'' team kept in touch and gathered sometimes in the Café de la Kasbah or the Baghdad restaurant to discuss news and ideas, along with French and Tunisian socialist friends, such as the pharmacist Ali Bouhageb. During these meetings, the idea of creating a new newspaper was considered as they missed expressing their ideas.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=73}} A drafting committee was formed that included Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, Bahri Guiga, Tahar Sfar, Mahmoud El Materi and Ali Bouhageb, who also managed the publishing firm. Béchir Mehedhbi, a final year student, took charge of the editorial office. As for the newspaper headquarters, they were settled in the back of the Bouhageb pharmacy.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=27}}

In the midst of an economic crisis that mainly affected lower classes, ''[[L'Action Tunisienne]]'' published its first edition on November 1, 1932.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=27}} Bourguiba, who studied public finance during his university studies of [[political science]] in Paris, devoted his first article to the budget, which he called the "Tunisian budget". He explained his idea writing: "I used to demonstrate that budget reflected the policy of the government and that it permitted to believe that the country was thrown into abyss."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.lapresse.tn/05022015/22065/lidee-est-immortelle-et-la-volonte-populaire-invincible.html|title=L'idée est immortelle et la volonté populaire invincible|work=La Presse|date=February 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150325190939/http://www.lapresse.tn/05022015/22065/lidee-est-immortelle-et-la-volonte-populaire-invincible.html|archivedate=March 25, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disappointed in the resigned moderation of their elders, the young nationalists defended lower classes. Bouhajeb devoted an entire section of the newspaper for this purpose, which he called ''La Voix du guenillard'', while the other members of the drafting committee wrote in turn in their editorials. Fed information through documents provided by administration officials, they soon became famous among the public. Bourguiba, who was increasingly known for his work, socialized with Tunisois notables and went frequently to intellectual discussion circles where he met the Boulakbeche family.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=75}} He proved himself to be clear and specific in his writings, which revealed a "talented polemist" with his strong legal arguments. He was committed to demonstrate the mechanism of colonial abuse from the effects to the causes, showing a great interest in social phenomenon, inviting workers and students to organize in order to defended themselves against abuse. He also insisted on the defence and safeguard of the Tunisian personality, writing:{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=74}} {{quote|text=Tunisia is a market for France whose products sold at low prices ruin Tunisians who are forced to close their businesses, and reduce to the unemployment thousands of workers. The drought in cereal areas worsens the consequences of the global recession, which caused a tragic slump of wine and oil production. While famine spreads in the country, employees are crushed by taxes. As long as there will be satiated and hungry at the same table, open or sneaky war is a necessity, the use of force is a duty and peace among men a chimera.|author=Habib Bourguiba|source=''[[L'Action Tunisienne]]''}}

== Reviving the National movement ==
{{see also|Tunisian national movement}}

=== The M'hamed Chenik case ===

In February 1933, a major fight within ''L'Action Tunisienne'' turned into a crisis, following the case of M'hamed Chenik, banker and chairman of the Tunisian Credit Union, which dominated the medina. In 1932, Chenik went to Paris as the vice-president of the Tunisian representatives of the Great Council, in order to alert the French government about the problems of indigenous agriculture. France decided to designate a committee chaired by Louis Tardy, manager of the National Agricultural Credit Fund, to investigate the situation in Tunisia. This move did not please the Residence which denounced the "convicted diligence" of Chenik. The colonial administration thus decided to seal his bank accounts. Despite this, there was no reaction in public opinion or among nationalists, even though the Tunisian members of the Great Council were collaborating with the protectorate. Only Bourguiba disapproved of the reaction of his friends, that he qualified as primary, writing: "I had there a first-hand witness who would give me weapons against the Protectorate and means to strengthen my position towards this regime. It was me who was winning in such a process. I did not care that some personalities improve their image at the same time."{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=76}}{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=28}}

Even though some people argued that Bourguiba acted out of personal interest, (he and his brother were tied to the bank by a loan), his aims were mainly related to reviving [[Tunisian nationalism]]. Chenik stated in an interview that any collaboration with France became impossible. Bourguiba saw in this case a victory that could rally the bourgeois class, considered to be collaborating with France, and unify the country around nationalism. He wrote: "We need to focus our attention on the event that had happened, on the argument which had been offered, so that we could widen our movement to important social classes of the nation, once indifferent or hostile to our program".{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=28}}

[[Image:M'hamed Chenik.jpg|thumb|Portrait of M'hamed Chenik]]

To achieve his goal, he used "non-orthodox approaches". He went to ''L'Action'' headquarters to remove a critical part of his brother M'hamed, written in an article by Ali Bouhajeb, whom he did not inform. Bourguiba testified about his act in 1973 saying: {{quote|My brother, Si M'hamed, had obtained a written statement of Mr M'hamed Chenik, who was a member of the Great Council. In this report of many pages, carefully typed and initialed, Mr Chenik, who had probably been in trouble with his French colleagues, violently criticized the colonial administration and the Tardi committee. As for me, it was a windfall. The opportunity to denounce the abuses of the Protectorate authorities was given to me. I had therefore published the document on our newspaper. This initiative did not please Mr Ali Bouhajeb, who tried to explain his behavior with his unwillingness to see Mr Chenik claim leadership. Thus, he had drafted a sharp criticism, addressed to my brother, and published it on the same paper. I was dismayed to see the members of a same team tear each other apart in the columns of their very newspaper [...] considering that my brother was himself part of the drafting committee. I had removed three lines before the layout. The next day, the author of the article raged against what he called censorship and expressed his will to leave us.&lt;ref name="Conférence4"/&gt;}}

Supported by Guiga and M'hedhbi, Bouhajeb judged Bourguiba's attitude and that of the journal in this case to be "unacceptable" before the three handed over their resignations. One of them later testified that: "Curiously, this excited Bourguiba. He was crushed because Bouhajeb and Mehedbi took care of all the material details, but he was a man of challenge." Bourguiba then abandoned his lawyer's office and decided to manage the newspaper on his own.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=78}}

While the Great Council gathered to adjudicate on the agricultural budget, inspired by the recommendation of the Tardi committee, Bourguiba sent out a "supreme warning", writing: "We will be particularly inexorable against the last-minute setbacks or interested jilting." His arrogance with the protectorate, and his determination to stand up to Chenik, was found to be impressive. When the draft budget favorable to French interests against which Chenik pronounced an indictment was rejected by the Great Council, Bourguiba wrote that: "The Tunisian people will remember that the delegates of the Jewish community were interested in the fate of our fellahs (farmers) much more than certain Muslim agricultural delegates of Center and South. The Tunisia we intend to free will not be a Tunisia for Muslims, for Jewish or for Christians. It will be the Tunisia of all those who, without distinction of religion or race, would like to accredit for their country and live under the protection of equal laws." This statement will gradually become his doctrine, both modernist and secular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Sophie|last=Chautard|title=''Les dictateurs du XXe siècle''|publisher=Studyrama Editions|location=Levallois-Perret|year=2006}}, {{p.|165}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=28}}

=== The Tunisian naturalization issue ===

{{main article|Tunisian naturalization issue}}

==== Leading the press campaign ====

With the economic crisis that worsened day after day, and the rising popularity acquired by Bourguiba and his friends, a new generation of nationalist leaders emerged. Preoccupied, they reckoned a good cause would be sufficient to revive the national movement on a new basis. In this context, the [[Tunisian naturalization issue]] presented itself as a motive for the movement's renewal. During the 1920s, the nationalists protested in force against the enactment of the December 20, 1923, law which favored access by non-French protectorate inhabitants to French citizenship. According to the colonial power, they had, at the time, to face the increase judged to be "too fast" of the Italian colony compared to insufficient metropolitan immigration.&lt;!--c/e tbc---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Daniel|last=Goldstein|title=''Libération on annexion. Aux chemins croisés de l'histoire tunisienne, 1914–1922''|publisher=Tunisian Publishing House|location=Tunis|year=1978}}, {{p.|484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:L'action tunisienne du 4 mai 1933.jpg|thumb|Front page of ''[[L'Action Tunisienne]]'' on May 4, 1933, regarding the press campaign opposed to French naturalization.]]

The hostility following the adoption of these measures receded gradually but resumed in the start of 1933. On December 31, 1932, upon the announcement of the death of a naturalized French Muslim living in [[Bizerte]], Mohamed Chaabane, individuals gathered in the Muslim cemetery with the firm will to oppose the interment of the dead. They obtained the support of the city's mufti who delivered a fatwa affirming that as apostates naturalized can not be buried in Muslim cemeteries.{{sfn|Casemajor|2009|p=73}}

Bourguiba decided to react and started a press campaign, led by ''L'Action Tunisienne'' and partially reprised by all the nationalist newspapers: "We then embarked on a major campaign to combat this thesis ''[naturalization]'' whose any consequence was to inevitably lead to francisation all the Tunisian people. Citing a verse of the Qur'an, we developed the argument that, by ceasing to be amenable to the Sharaa Court, the naturalized French ipso facto lost his Muslim attributes", he declared in 1973.&lt;ref name="Conférence4"/&gt; Italy, fearing a major naturalization of its citizens, brought a discreet but active support to Bourguiba, decided to discredit the French initiatives and build a reputation.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=79}}

In order to stop the turmoil that worsened in the country every time a naturalized died, the Residence demanded a fatwa, in April, from the Sharaa Court of Tunis, the highest religious body of the protectorate. The Maliki and Hanafi sheikhs in charge of the case issued a sentence that solves nothing: They maintained the apostate status of a naturalized but said that if he repented, even verbally, before his death, burial in Muslim lands will be granted. This decision angered the nationalists while riots started in [[Kairouan]] and Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Mustapha|last=Kriem|title=Mouvement national et Front populaire|publisher=Higher Institute of National Movement History|location=Tunis|year=1956}}, {{p.|75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourguiba denounced the duplicity of religious authorities, the provocations of the government, cast aspersions on naturalized and criticized the Destourian press whose "caution considered as the ultimate strategy seems overwhelmed". He invited the French people and [[Ahmad II of Tunis|Ahmad II Bey]] to intervene. Meanwhile, the Residence took a two-phased decision: Firstly, it yielded deciding that naturalized will be buried in special burial place, which appeared to be ghettos excluding them from the community. And secondly, François Manceron, resident-general at the time, enacted decrees judged "super-scoundrel" by Joachim Durel, granting him authority to imprison and arrest, at his will, any nationalist, also giving him the authority to suspend any newspaper or association "hostile to the Protectorate". Bourguiba commented this decision writing: "Repression comes too late. The atavistic fatalism of an oppressed people was shaken".{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=80}}

==== Rising popularity ====

Bourguiba's firm position increased his popularity among nationalists as he testified in 1973 saying: {{quote|The opportunity was huge, and I took it, to drum against the naturalization policy [...] I stuck only to the anathema on the French naturalized and the prohibition to bury them in Muslim cemeteries. So, I was campaigning in this direction. There was no question for me to admit the burial in a Muslim cemetery of a naturalized french [...] The people were very aware of the issue. I benefited from that to mobilize them [...] The event was a scandal and it acted in a salutary way on the mindset of the population. That was enough for me to give a definitive halt to the naturalization policy. We felt strongly embarrassed to be subject to scandal, and so much more when the protectorate authorities were pushing the precautionary measures to maintain the naturalized's graves under the spotlight, at night, in order to protect them from any profanation. Incidents on it were therefore multiplied throughout Tunisia, from North to South, East to West.&lt;ref name="Conférence4"/&gt;}}

This victory led activists to request the convening of an extraordinary Destour. The event was held on May 12 and May 13, 1933, in Tunis at Mountain Street. Bourguiba made a speech criticizing the "outdated futile methods and the illusions of the leaders and their program that does not meet the aspirations of the people, who are therefore aware of his case". He also asked for "radical solutions, a tireless and energetic action unequivocally unnecessary or exclusively harmful to achieve independence within a union treaty with France, guaranteeing its legitimate interests and the interests of all the foreign colony." He noted that: "In order to do so, we must form a front to unite all the trends of the great Tunisian Constitutional Liberal Party." Successful in their press campaign, all of the  ''L'Action Tunisienne'' team were elected unanimously as members of the executive committee of the Destour.{{sfn|Mestiri|2011|p=120}}{{,}}{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=80}}

At the time, Bourguiba and his friends of ''L'Action Tunisienne'' saw the Destour as lacking firmness. Nevertheless, it developed an organization with 90 local representatives from throughout the country. It had not grown since the arrival of Manceron at the head of the Residence. Recruiting among lower classes as well as the bourgeois classes, the new distinction among the Destour permitted them to have a strong position and influence the party in order to unify all factions of the nationalist front. Responding to the wishes of Bourguiba, many delegates supported this union. However, in 1933, it was not yet Bourguiba but Mahmoud El Materi who appeared to be the leader of ''L'Action'' group. This man who proved himself to be an active man of science in the French communist party and ended up as a delegate during the [[Tours Congress]]. He expressed his will not to become a politician. As far as he was concerned, tolerance, the sense of honour, solidarity, spirit, and justice overrode tactics, cynicism, provocation, and low blows. His qualities and charisma allowed him to forge a strong position within the Destour in which he was unanimous.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=81}}

==== Break with the Destour ====

Meanwhile, the turmoil over the naturalization issue continued in Tunis with riots that started in the countryside, affected by famine. The nationalist press thus multiplied its criticism towards the Residence, which had decided to prohibit teachers and students from attending certain lessons. It also forbade the movement of officials and suspended nationalist newspapers, including ''L'Action Tunisienne'' on May 31. In addition, the Destour party was banned. The French government feeling that Manceron acted too late to stand firm, replaced him with Marcel Peyrouton, on July 29, 1933. In this repressive context, Bourguiba was deprived of his means of expression and was a prisoner of the Destour structure that was willing to take back his autonomy.{{sfn|Bessis|Belhassen|2012|p=82}}

[[Image:Délégation naturalisés Tunisie.jpg|thumb|Habib Bourguiba leading the protest delegation.]]

On August 8, the opportunity to express himself was presented when incidents began in Monastir upon the forced interment in a Muslim cemetery of the son of a naturalized citizen. A fight erupted between the population and law enforcement, ending with one person dead and numerous injured. Bourguiba soon convinced Monastirian notables who were victims of police brutality, to choose him as their lawyer. On September 4, without informing the Destour of his initiative, Bourguiba led a protest delegation to the bey. They were welcomed by a man of confidence, who listened to their requests. Nevertheless, the party leadership, seeing in this the pretext to put a stop to activism that displeased them, decided to blame to the young nationalist: "It was he [Mahmoud El Materi] who announced me that a blame motion had been decided against me. I was outraged. Because my procedures at the head of this delegation protesting to the bey was not on the party's behalf, but on the behalf of a lawyer who intervened to defend his clients, all originating in Monastir, my birth city. Therefore, nothing justified this blame motion. My membership in the executive committee of the Destour should not prohibit me from other activity. Should it be so, there was no option left for me but to resign. Materi and the other members of ''L'Action Tunisienne'' wanted to do the same. But I dissuaded them, their presence in the executive committee could have been useful", he recalled years later.&lt;ref name="Conférence4"/&gt;

Bourguiba, who thought the Destour and its leadership to be obstacles to his ambitions, decided to resign from the party on September 9. He soon learned from this experience. The success obtained thanks to popular violent uprisings shows the failure of Destourians' favorite methods, consisting of petitions and telegrams. Only violence by determined groups could lead the Residence to step back and negotiate political solutions. That would be his guideline until 1956.{{sfn|Martel|1999|p=29}}

'''Francesco Raffaele Nitto''' (January 27, 1886 – March 19, 1943), commonly known as '''Frank Nitti''', and nicknamed "The Enforcer",  was an [[Italian Americans|Italian-American]] [[gangster]]. One of [[Al Capone]]'s top henchmen, Nitti was in charge of all money flowing through the operation.  Nitti later succeeded Capone as boss of the [[Chicago Outfit]].

==Early life and Prohibition==
Francesco Raffaele Nitto was born in the small town of [[Angri]], [[province of Salerno]], [[Campania]], Italy.&lt;ref name="AfterCapone"/&gt; He was the second child of Luigi and Rosina (Fezza) Nitto&lt;ref name="AfterCapone" /&gt; and a first cousin of Al Capone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chicago Outfit |last=Binder |first=John J |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |location= |isbn=0-7385-2326-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father died in 1888, when Frank was two years old, and within a year his mother married Francesco Dolendo.  Although two children were born to the couple, neither survived—leaving Francesco and his older sister, Giovannina, the only children. Francesco Dolendo emigrated to the United States in July 1890, and the rest of the family followed in June 1893 when Nitti was seven. The family settled at 113 Navy Street, [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]]. Little Francesco attended public school and worked odd jobs after school to support the family. His 15-year-old sister married a 24-year-old man, and his mother gave birth to his half-brother Raphael, in 1894, and another child, Gennaro, in 1896. He quit school after the seventh grade, and worked as a [[pinsetter]], factory worker, and barber. Al Capone's family lived nearby, and Nitti was friends with Capone's older brothers and their criminal gang (the Navy Street Boys).&lt;ref name="AfterCapone"/&gt;

A worsening relationship with Dolendo urged him to leave home when he was 14 in 1900 to work in various local factories. Around 1910, at the age of 24, he left Brooklyn. The next several years of his life are poorly documented, and little can be ascertained. He may have worked in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] neighborhood of Brooklyn around 1911.  He probably moved to Chicago around 1913, working as a barber and making the acquaintance of gangsters Alex Louis Greenberg and [[Dean O'Banion]]. He married Chicagoan Rosa (Rose) Levitt in [[Dallas, Texas]], on October 18, 1917.&lt;ref name="AfterCapone"/&gt; The couple's movements after their marriage remain uncertain. He is known to have become a partner in the [[Free State of Galveston|Galveston crime syndicate]] run by [[Johnny Jack Nounes|"Johnny" Jack Nounes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Galveston: a history of the island | author=Cartwright, Gary | year=1998 | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | page=210 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RFRu8kYThEcC | isbn=0-87565-190-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to have stolen a large sum of money from Nounes and fellow mobster [[Dutch Voight]], after which Nitti fled to Chicago. By 1918, Nitti had settled there at 914 South Halsted Street. Nitti quickly renewed his contacts with Greenberg and O'Banion, becoming a jewel thief, [[Rum-running|liquor smuggler]], and [[fence (criminal)|fence]]. Through his liquor smuggling activities, Nitti came to the attention of Chicago [[crime boss]] [[Johnny Torrio|Johnny "Papa Johnny" Torrio]] and Torrio's newly arrived [[soldato|soldier]], Al Capone.&lt;ref name="AfterCapone"/&gt;

Under Torrio's successor Al Capone, Nitti's reputation soared. Nitti ran Capone's liquor smuggling and distribution operation, importing [[whisky]] from [[Canada]] and selling it through a network of [[speakeasy|speakeasies]] around Chicago. Nitti was one of Capone's top lieutenants, trusted for his leadership skills and business acumen. Because Nitti's ancestry was from the same town as Capone's, he was able to help Capone penetrate the Sicilian and  [[Camorra]]  underworld in a way Capone alone never could.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | title=ISLAND EMPIRE: THE INFLUENCE OF THE MACEO FAMILY IN GALVESTON | author=Boatman, Tabitha Nicole | publisher=University of North Texas | date=August 2014 | page=59 | url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc699931/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capone thought so highly of Nitti that when he went to prison in 1929, he named Nitti as a member of a [[triumvirate]] that ran the mob in his place. Nitti was head of operations, with [[Jake Guzik|Jake "Greasy Thumb" Guzik]] as head of administration and [[Tony Accardo|Tony "Joe Batters" Accardo]] as head of enforcement. Despite his nickname ("The Enforcer"), Nitti used Mafia soldiers and others to commit violence rather than do it himself.  In earlier days, Nitti had been one of Capone's trusted personal bodyguards, but as he rose in the organization, Nitti's business instinct dictated that he must personally avoid the "dirty work", for which [[Hitman|hitmen]] were paid.{{citation needed|date= March 2010}}

Frank and Rose Nitti divorced in 1928, and shortly thereafter he married Anna Ronga Nitti, daughter of a mob doctor and former neighbor of the Nittis in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="AfterCapone" /&gt; The couple adopted a son, Joe.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, Steve and Lundstrom, John B. ''Fateful Rendezvous: The Life of Butch O'Hare.'' Annapolis, Md.: Naval Institute Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-59114-249-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Outfit under Nitti==
In 1931, both 45-year-old Frank Nitti and 32-year-old Al Capone were convicted of [[tax evasion]] and sent to prison; however, Nitti received an 18-month sentence, while Capone was sent away for 11 years. Nitti was not a troublesome prisoner, but found the year-and-a-half confinement in a cell difficult because of the closed-in space. When Nitti was released in 1932, he took his place as the new boss of the Capone Gang.&lt;ref name="AfterCapone"/&gt;

While some revisionist historians claim that Nitti was a mere "front boss" while others, namely [[Paul Ricca|Paul "The Waiter" Ricca]], were the "real" bosses of the Chicago Outfit,&lt;ref name="MafEnc"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mafia Encyclopedia |last=Sifakis |first=Carl |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1987 |publisher=Facts on File |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=0816018561 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both contemporary and modern accounts confirm that Capone's successor was indeed Frank Nitti. According to Nitti biographer Mars Eghigian, Nitti's age, brilliance, and reputation in the underworld made him Capone's personal choice for successor, rather than younger, less experienced mobsters such as Ricca or [[Murray Humphreys]]. In actuality, Paul Ricca was merely the acting boss of the Chicago Outfit for a six-month period between Capone's October 1931 imprisonment and Frank Nitti's April 1932 release. With the recently released Nitti paranoid about violating his federal parole, Ricca was acting in the capacity of emissary that same month when he was arrested with [[Lucky Luciano]], [[Meyer Lansky]], and other mobsters by Chicago police and prominently photographed. This picture would cause some to incorrectly infer that Paul Ricca was the new boss of the Chicago mob.&lt;ref name="AfterCapone"/&gt;

With Nitti calling the shots, the Chicago Outfit branched out from [[prostitution]] and [[gambling]] into other areas, including control of [[trade union|labor unions]] (which led to the [[extortion]] of many businesses). On December 19, 1932, a team of Chicago police, headed by [[Detective]] Sergeants Harry Lang and Harry Miller, raided Nitti's office in Room 554, at 221 N. LaSalle Street in Chicago. Lang shot Nitti three times in the back and neck. He then shot himself (a minor flesh wound) to make the shooting look like self-defense, claiming that Nitti had shot him first. Court testimony later insisted that the murder attempt was personally ordered by newly elected [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Anton Cermak]], who supposedly wanted to eliminate the Chicago Outfit in favor of gangsters who answered to him.&lt;ref name="MafEnc" /&gt; Nitti survived the shooting and, in February 1933, was [[Acquittal|acquitted]] of attempted murder. During that same trial, Miller testified that Lang received [[United States dollar|$]]15,000 to kill Nitti. Another uniformed officer who was present at the shooting testified that Nitti was shot while unarmed. Harry Lang and Harry Miller were both fired from the police force and each fined US$100 for [[Assault|simple assault]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Two months later, Cermak was shot and killed by [[Giuseppe Zangara]], a [[Calabria]]n [[immigrant]]. At the time, Cermak was talking to [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Most historians believe, corroborated by Zangara's own comments and a note left behind at his room, that he intended to kill Roosevelt but missed and hit Cermak instead.

==Further marriages==
Anna Nitto died on Nov. 19, 1940, in Mercy Hospital, Chicago, from an unspecified internal ailment.&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. Anna Nitto, Frank Nitti's wife, dies at 38, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', Nov. 20, 1940, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  Nitti married Annette (Toni) Caravetta on May 14, 1942; she was widowed almost a year later when he committed suicide.

==Death==
In 1943, many top members of the Chicago Outfit were indicted for [[extortion|extorting]] the [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood film industry]]. Among those prosecuted were Nitti, Phil D'Andrea, [[Louis Campagna|Louis "Little New York" Campagna]], Nick Circella, [[Charles Gioe|Charles "Cherry Nose" Gioe]], Ralph Pierce, Ricca, and [[John Roselli|John "Handsome Johnny" Roselli]]. The Outfit was accused of trying to extort money from some of the largest movie studios, including [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[RKO Pictures]], and [[20th Century Fox]]. The studios had cooperated with The Outfit to avoid [[labor union|union]] trouble (unrest itself stirred up by the mob). At a meeting of Outfit leaders at Nitti's home, Ricca blamed Nitti for the indictments. Ricca said that since this had been Nitti's scheme and that of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] informant ([[Willie Bioff]]) one of Nitti's trusted associates, Nitti should go to prison. A severe [[claustrophobia|claustrophobe]] as a result of his first prison term, Nitti dreaded the idea of another prison confinement. It was also rumored that he was suffering from terminal [[cancer]] at this time. For these or possibly other reasons, he ultimately decided to take his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=101 Things You Didn't Know About the Mafia|last=Mannion|first=James|url=|accessdate=|isbn= 978-1-59337-267-5|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day before his scheduled [[grand jury]] appearance, Nitti had breakfast with his wife in their home at 712 Selborne Road in [[Riverside, Illinois]]. When his wife left for church, Nitti told her he planned to take a walk, then began to drink heavily. He then loaded a .32 [[caliber]] [[revolver]], put it in his coat pocket, and walked five blocks to a local railroad yard. Conductor William F. Seebauer and switchmen L.M. Barnett and E.H. Moran were riding in the caboose, backing their train slowly southward over an ungated Cermak Road. The workers spotted an oblivious Nitti walking on the track away from them and shouted a warning. Nitti walked off the tracks, staggering towards the fence. Two shots rang out. The workers thought Nitti was shooting at them, then realized he was trying to shoot himself in the head. The first shot fired by Nitti's unsteady hand missed and passed through his [[fedora]]. The second bullet slammed into the right side of his jaw and exited through the top of his head, taking a lock of his hair with it and leaving the tuft protruding from the hole in the crown of the fedora. The final, fatal bullet entered behind Nitti's right ear and lodged in the top of his skull. Police Chief Allen Rose of North Riverside, rushing to the scene with a sergeant and several beat patrolmen, recognized Nitti immediately. An autopsy by William McNalley, coroner's toxicologist, showed that Nitti's blood alcohol level was 0.23. A coroner's jury ruled the following day that Nitti "committed suicide while temporarily insane and in a despondent frame of mind".&lt;ref&gt;Koziol, Ronald; Baumann, Edward (1987-06-29). "How Frank Nitti Met His Fate". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 29 June 1987. Retrieved from http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-06-29/features/8702170754_1_frank-nitti-crime-syndicate-pulled/2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Nitti died on March 19, 1943, at the age of 57.&lt;ref name="Suicide"&gt;"Gang Leader Nitti Kills Himself In Chicago After Indictment Here." ''New York Times.'' March 20, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; Nitti is buried at [[Mount Carmel Cemetery (Hillside, Illinois)|Mount Carmel Cemetery]] in [[Hillside, Illinois]]. Controversy has persisted regarding the interment of a suicide in a Catholic cemetery. Nitti's grave can be found to the left of the main Roosevelt Road entrance, about {{convert|50|ft}} from the gate. It is marked "Nitto". To the right of the gate is the family plot containing the grave of Al Capone, marked by a {{convert|6|ft|cm|adj=on}} white monument stone. Straight up from the gate are the graves of [[Dean O'Banion]] and [[Hymie Weiss]], both [[North Side Gang]] members who were killed by the Chicago Outfit under Capone.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==The Nitto name==
While the name Frank Nitti has become infamous in American criminal history, the man himself never at any point in his life referred to himself as anything other than his birth name of Frank Nitto; only the police, media, and fringe mobsters called him Nitti.&lt;ref name="AfterCapone"/&gt;

'''Gerald Majera Ssendaula''' is a retired Ugandan politician, and current banker and farmer. He is a former Cabinet Minister and MP Member of Parliament, representing Kingo sub-county, which became [[Lwengo District]].

==Background and education==
Ssendaula was born on 15 May 1943 in Kyabbogo Village, Kingo sub-county, in [[Masaka District]] at that time, to the late Edward Byansi Kalibbala and Maria Nakanwagi Nakato. He is the oldest amongst eight siblings; six brothers and two sisters. In 2010, Kingo sub-county was peeled off Masaka District to create [[Lwengo District]].

He started his education at Kyoko Primary School, and then transferred to Nkoni Primary School. He continued his studies at St. Pius Junior Secondary School. Because his father was less interested in educating children, Ssendaula's mother applied for a Buganda Government scholarship to take the young Ssendaula to a reasonable school but without success.

He later met with Aga Ssekalala of Ugachick who was then a student of Senior Four but knew some [[Buganda Kingdom]] officials. Aga Ssekalala later introduced Ssendaula to the Mengo establishment, leading to the re-activation of his scholarship application in 1963.
A scholarship of Shs905 then enabled him to join [[Namilyango College]], where he studied from Senior One to Senior Six. He later joined [[Nairobi University]] in 1969 where he graduated with the [[Bachelor of Commerce]] degree. There were about 30 other Ugandans at Nairobi University during his time, including Livingstone Okello Okello (Chua County), FDC's [[Cecilia Ogwal]] (Dokolo Woman MP), and [[Mondo Kagonyera|Professor Mondo Kagonyera]].

== Work experience ==
After his studies in [[Kenya]], Ssendaula returned to [[Barclays Bank (Uganda)|Barclays Bank]] in Uganda, where he had worked as a clerk during his S6 vacation. The two-year Barclays Bank London training known as 'Day Release' prepared him for an administrative role. He worked at the bank's [[Kabale]] branch before he was transferred to [[Nairobi]] to conduct some in-house training. He later returned to Uganda and rose to the rank of General Manager with Barclays Bank. He joined politics in 1980 and was elected MP for Bukoto, Masaka District, serving in that role until 1985, on the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]] ticket, until 1985. He was elected Chairman of Masaka District in 1988 and served as such until 1992. In 1992, he was elected as the National Resistance Council (the Parliament of that time), representative for Bukoto, Masaka. He also contemporaneously served as the Chairman of Masaka Growers Cooperative Union.

== Political life ==
In 1980 Ssendaula joined politics as a Democratic Party (DP) supporter contesting for [[Parliament of Uganda|Parliament]] MP and got elected for Bukoto Central (presently Bukomansimbi and Masaka Municipality). With UPC in power and DP in opposition, Ssendaula was shadow spokesman for Housing, while Evaristo Nyanzi was for Finance.

In 1982, Ssendula's wife, Rosemary Nanyonga Nalongo, was shot dead at their grocery in [[Mpererwe]],  5miles on Gayaza Road, opposite their home. It was 2 pm and Ssendaula was in Masaka working at his father's coffee farm in Kinoni. The crime of his wife was apparently opening her shop while Minister Samwiri Mugwisa was addressing a rally in [[Kawempe]], moreover speaking about rebel activities in the country.

Mrs. Ssendaula tried to reason with the soldiers who attacked her, that Kawempe, where the rally was being held, was far away from Mpererwe where her shop was. They didn't listen, shooting her there and then. With the murder of his wife at the back of his mind, Ssendaula left his Mpererwe home joining the [[National Resistance Army]] when the rebels started capturing territory around 1984. It was Commander Victor Bwana, who persuaded him to join [[Museveni]]'s forces and he was too angry with the UPC government to resist the temptation.

Ssendaula helped the rebels export coffee beans and hides to get some revenue since he was attached to the defunct Masaka Cooperative Union. At that time in 1984, the NRA had established a government in the captured territory as the Kampala – Masaka road was cut off by the rebels, with their headquarters in Fort Portal. Ssendaula served in this 'government' as a commissioner, the equivalent of a minister.

When the NRA captured power, he worked briefly at the [[National Resistance Movement]] (NRM) Secretariat, basically to wind up the rebels' export business as there was now a government to take care of it. In 1987, he went to Masaka, contested and got elected district chairman as its first District chairman under the NRM. He later joined the expanded National Resistance Council (NRC) legislature in 1989 as Bukoto MP.

In 1990, President Museveni appointed Ssendaula deputy minister of Commerce and Co-operatives under [[Richard Kaijuka]], another banker. In 1996, he was promoted full minister for Natural Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mineral Industry of Uganda|

publisher=Minerals.usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1998, Ssendaula became Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, a position he held until his retirement in 2005.

He joined politics representing the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]] where he was the Member of Parliament for Bukoto constituency then the largest constituency in Uganda from 1980 – 1985 which was split into, Bukoto Central, Bukoto South, Bukoto Mid West later remaining as the MP for Bukoto South in then Masaka District.

He was elected on a Democratic Party ticket switching to the political setting, NRM – Movement. He continued to become a Cabinet Minister in the Museveni Government as the Deputy Minister of Commerce and Cooperatives, which Ministry was changed and Named Ministry of Trade and Industries from 1991– 1996. He rose to full Minister as the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment from 1996–1998, where he was transferred to The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Making Public Enterprises Work: From Despair to Promise – A Turn Around Account  |last=Muhairwe |first=William T. |page=278 |year=2009 |publisher=[[International Water Association]] |isbn=978-1-84339-324-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as its head through 1998–2005, where he retired from active politics.

==Other considerations==

'''Ginés de Pasamonte''' is a fictional character in [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' novel ''[[Don Quixote]]''.

Ginés first appears as a criminal freed by Don Quixote in the 22nd chapter of the first part of the novel. After his release, he escapes Don Quixote and the guards. He later reappears as Maese Pedro, a puppet-showman who claims that he can talk to his monkey, on the 26th chapter of the second part.

He also stole Sancho's donkey, a part that was omitted from the first edition.

Prior to his release by Don Quixote, Ginés tells him that he is in the process of writing his own autobiography. Don Quixote interrogates this writer about his book;
{{cquote|"Is it so good?" said Don Quixote.

"So good is it," replied Gines, "that a fig for 'Lazarillo de
Tormes,' and all of that kind that have been written, or shall be
written compared with it: all I will say about it is that it deals
with facts, and facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match
them."

"And how is the book entitled?" asked Don Quixote.

"The ''Life of Gines de Pasamonte''," replied the subject of it.

"And is it finished?" asked Don Quixote.

"How can it be finished," said the other, "when my life is not yet
finished?|15px|15px|Literature Network: Miguel de Cervantes: ''Don Quixote''|&lt;ref name="Don Quixote"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online-literature.com/view.php/don_quixote/26?term=lazarillo |publisher= English Translation by John Ormsby, 1885 |title=Don Quixote, Chapter XXII|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This is the only reference to the popular novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' in the book, and it acts as an alterego for Don Quixote's will to be a literary hero in his own lifetime.

'''Gracia Cielo "Grace" Magno Padaca''' (born October 25, 1963)  is a Filipino politician and former broadcaster who has been the governor of the northern Luzon province of [[Isabela province|Isabela]], [[Philippines]] since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080806-152906/The-challenge-to-carve-a-Tatak-Isabelino |title=The challenge to carve a ‘Tatak Isabelino’ - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607002258/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20080806-152906/The-challenge-to-carve-a-Tatak-Isabelino |archivedate=2012-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is also the recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in 2008.

During her childhood, she survived [[polio]]; she has walked with [[crutch]]es for most of her life.

==Biography==
Padaca ran for Congress in 2001 where she lost to Faustino "Bojie" Dy, by a margin of 1,285 votes (he got 50.7 percent of the vote to her 49.3 percent). She protested the results of 151 ballot boxes. Dy countered, questioning the results not only of the 151 precincts but all 812 precincts. Padaca initiated what she called an "Adopt A Ballot Box" campaign to raise funds to cover the cost of a ballot box revision. After two and a half years, the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET), in a decision promulgated on December 18, 2003, declared Dy the winner by 48 votes. The majority of the HRET refused to count ballots with "Grace" written on them in favor of Grace Padaca.

Padaca won the [[Philippine general election, 2004|2004 gubernatorial election]] in the northern Luzon province of [[Isabela province|Isabela]] with 55% of the vote.

On December 5, 2007, [[United States]] Ambassador Kristie Kenney personally conferred to Padaca the International Women of Courage Award, an award which was also conferred to former U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]]. It was bestowed on Padaca for her continued development of [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=101285 |accessdate=July 2, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padaca, 44, on July 31, 2008 was among the eight winners of the 2008 [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]], for Government Service for "empowering Isabela voters to reclaim their democratic right to elect leaders of their own choosing, and to contribute as full partners in their own development."&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews1"&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=126931 ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padaca campaigned against [[illegal logging]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/video/27703/iWitness-Si-GOB-at-ang-mga-BUGADOR |title=iWitness: Si GOB at ang mga BUGADOR &amp;#124; I-Witness &amp;#124; GMA News Online &amp;#124; The Go-To Site for Filipinos Everywhere |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padaca reactivated the anti-illegal task force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/114671/Isabela-gov-sees-big-job-ahead-vs-illegal-logging |title=Isabela gov sees big job ahead vs illegal logging &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online &amp;#124; The Go-To Site for Filipinos Everywhere |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date=2008-08-19 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padaca, [[Eddie Panlilio]] (of Pampanga), [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]] Mayor [[Jesse Robredo]], and Mayor Sonia Lorenzo of [[San Isidro, Northern Samar|San Isidro]], [[Nueva Ecija]], launched "Kaya Natin", a group that "seeks to recruit principled local government officials to change the country's deteriorating political situation." Their 'Islands of Hope' - university campus tour, a movement for ethical leadership and good governance was launched on July 31, 2008, at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]]'s Walter Hogan Conference Center in Quezon City.&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080731-151768/Islands-of-hope-to-go-on-campus-tour |title=‘Islands of hope’ to go on campus tour - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604000443/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080731-151768/Islands-of-hope-to-go-on-campus-tour |archivedate=2012-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 election Padaca was defeated by three-term congressman Bojie Dy of the 3rd district of Isabela with a margin of 3,438 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Danny Fajardo |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/regions/17381-grace-padaca-loses-in-isabela-gubernatorial-race |title=One of the ‘ten wise men’ |publisher=Manilatimes.net |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2012-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609145952/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/regions/17381-grace-padaca-loses-in-isabela-gubernatorial-race |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parliamentary career ==
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]], O'Mara contested the constituency of Sheffield Hallam, held by [[Nick Clegg]], the former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader and former [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name=star-20170502&gt;{{cite news|first=Alex |last=Moore |url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/labour-selects-jared-o-mara-to-challenge-nick-clegg-in-sheffield-1-8522836 |title=Labour selects Jared O'Mara to challenge Nick Clegg in Sheffield |work=The Star |location=Sheffield |date=2 May 2017 |accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected in an emergency selection process for the snap election under the control of the [[National Executive Committee]] and regional boards, rather than by the local constituency party.&lt;ref name=bbc-20170422&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39658426 |title=General election 2017: Can parties select candidates in time? |work=BBC News |date=22 April 2017 |accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His campaign benefited from a national surge in the Labour vote and from university students in the constituency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/09/first-time-mp-beat-nick-clegg-bought-new-suit-tesco-shock-result/|title=First-time MP who beat Nick Clegg 'bought a new suit from Tesco' as shock result emerged|last=Horton|first=Helena|date=9 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=11 June 2017|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that Clegg was thought to be too anti-[[Brexit]] by voters, although Sheffield Hallam was estimated to have voted Remain in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 European Union Referendum]], and O'Mara supports Remain as well.&lt;ref name="Cooke"/&gt;

O'Mara's campaign focused on disabled people's rights, protecting public services and on his personal background in Sheffield.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He won the seat with a majority of 2,125 votes, overturning Clegg's previous majority of 2,353 votes. The result was considered one of the most important seat changes of the night; O'Mara had not expected to win the seat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooke"/&gt; His acceptance speech called for politicians to do more to stand up for disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/this-response-from-first-time-sheffield-mp-jared-o-mara-to-a-career-advisor-twenty-years-ago-is-inspiring-1-8590591|title=This response from first time Sheffield MP Jared O'Mara to a career advisor twenty years ago is inspiring|last=Windham|first=Dan|date=12 June 2017|website=The Star|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given his disability, the buildings of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] have presented problems for O'Mara as the terms of the [[Equality Act 2010]] are yet to be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pring|first=John|url= https://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/disabled-mp-forced-to-miss-commons-debates-because-he-has-nowhere-to-sit/|title=Disabled MP forced to miss Commons debates because he has nowhere to sit|work=Disability News Service|date=6 July 2017|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labour whip suspension over offensive online comments ===
O'Mara became a member of the [[Women and Equalities Committee|Women and Equalities]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] in September 2017.&lt;ref name="ParliamentUKbio"/&gt; Following revelations of offensive comments he had made before becoming an MP, he resigned from the committee the following month.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jared-o-mara-labour-mp-women-equalities-committee-resign-sexist-homophobic-online-a8016161.html|title=Jared O'Mara: Labour MP resigns from equalities committee after series of sexist comments revealed|work=The Independent|date=23 October 2017|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of derogatory comments about women and gay men posted by O'Mara on websites over a decade before he became an MP were revealed by the [[Paul Staines|Guido Fawkes blog]] on 23 October 2017.&lt;ref name="ITVN"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.itv.com/news/2017-10-23/labour-mp-jared-omara-quits-select-committee-role-over-offensive-online-comments/|title=Labour MP Jared O'Mara quits select committee role over offensive online comments|publisher=ITV News|date=23 October 2017|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-20171024&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/24/jared-omara-mp-has-changed-significantly-since-posting-offensive-comments |title=Labour MP who posted offensive comments 'merits second chance' |last=Elgot |first=Jessica |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 October 2017 |accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented about the [[Girls Aloud]] pop group: "I advise you to sack [[Sarah Harding|Sarah]] and the remaining four members ([[Nicola Roberts|Nicola]], [[Cheryl (entertainer)|Cheryl]], [[Nadine Coyle|Nadine]] and [[Kimberley Walsh|Kimberley]]) come have an orgy with me"; and he said that the 2003 winner of ''[[Pop Idol]]'', [[Michelle McManus]], had "only won because she was fat".&lt;ref name="Elgot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ITVN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Minelle|first=Bethany|url=http://news.sky.com/story/labour-mp-jared-omara-says-hes-ashamed-of-derogatory-remarks-about-celebrities-11095478|title=Labour MP Jared O'Mara says he's 'ashamed' of derogatory remarks about celebrities|publisher=Sky News|date=23 October 2017|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also been accused of making homophobic comments including referring to gay men as "poofters" and "fudge packers" and referring to jazz musician [[Jamie Cullum]] as a "conceited cunt" who should be "sodomised with his own piano".&lt;ref name="Elgot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maguire|first=Patrick|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/labour-mp-facing-dismissal-from-equalities-post-invited-girls-aloud-to-have-an-orgy-in-online-posts-73sjfkr97|title=Labour MP facing dismissal from equalities post invited Girls Aloud to have an orgy in misogynist online posts|work=The Times|date=23 October 2017|accessdate=23 October 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heterophobes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/10/23/labour-mp-mocked-fudge-packers-and-poofters-and-lashed-out-at-heterophobes/|title=Labour MP mocked 'fudge packers and poofters' and lashed out at gay 'heterophobes'|work=Pink News|date=23 October 2017|accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Mara apologised "if his comments caused offence" and resigned from the Women and Equalities Select Committee.&lt;ref name="Elgot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heterophobes"/&gt;

The following day, O'Mara was accused by Sophie Evans, a Sheffield bar worker whom he had met through an online dating app, on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Daily Politics]]'' of having "made transphobic slurs" towards her in March 2017, and of saying in the same incident that she was an "ugly bitch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mann|first1=Sebastian|last2=Proctor|first2=Kate|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/jared-omara-under-fire-labour-mp-called-woman-ugly-b-just-weeks-before-he-was-elected-a3666586.html|title=Jared O'Mara: Under fire Labour MP called woman 'ugly b****' just weeks before he was elected|work=London Evening Standard|date=24 October 2017|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Peter|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/24/woman-claims-she-was-verbally-abused-by-jared-omara-this-year-sophie-evans|title=Woman claims MP Jared O'Mara verbally abused her this year|work=The Guardian|date=24 October 2017|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Mara denied the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horton|first=Helena|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/24/jared-omara-refuses-resign-sexist-comments-suggests-conservatives/|title=Jared O'Mara refuses to resign over sexist comments - but suggests Conservatives who make same remarks should step down|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 October 2017|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, it also emerged that he had been posting derogatory comments about children in Sheffield and appeared to advocate corporal punishment to deal with delinquent youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/amphtml/jimwaterson/jared-omara-said-sheffield-children-are-into-smoking-crack|title=Jared O'Mara Said Sheffield Children Are Into Smoking Crack And Stealing From Charity Boxes|website=www.buzzfeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the emergence of the comments to Evans, the Labour Party announced an investigation into O'Mara's conduct, but stopped short of suspending him from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchan|first=Lizzie|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-party-jared-o-mara-investigation-verbal-abuse-claims-girls-aloud-jamie-cullum-a8017661.html|title=Labour Party announces investigation into Jared O'Mara MP over verbal abuse claims|work=The Independent|date=24 October 2017|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further revelations were made public on 25 October 2017. On a [[Morrissey]] fan site in 2002, he was found to have made [[xenophobia|xenophobic insults]], saying that [[Danes]] were "pig shaggers" who "practised [[bestiality]]" and referring to [[Spaniards]] as "[[dagos]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maguire|first=Patrick|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/labour-mp-jared-o-mara-s-sexist-abuse-of-barmaid-5663rg3tf|title=Labour MP Jared O'Mara's 'sexist abuse of barmaid'|work=The Times|date=25 October 2017|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Mara, when reviewing the [[Arctic Monkeys]] in November 2004, made several sexual comments including how "sexy little slags" danced to the band's songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://order-order.com/2017/10/25/jared-sexy-little-slags-teenage-girls-fingered/amp/|title=Jared on "Sexy Little Slags" and Teenage Girls Being "Fingered" - Guido Fawkes|website=order-order.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These revelations resulted in O'Mara being suspended from the Labour Party and therefore having the party [[Whip (politics)|whip]] withdrawn.&lt;ref name="BBC251017"/&gt;

It was reported on 15 January 2018 that O'Mara had not spoken publicly in his constituency since his apology on 23 October. After the party whip was suspended, he cancelled his constituency surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/sheffield-s-missing-mp-how-jared-o-mara-s-political-dream-became-a-nightmare-1-8959343|title=Sheffield's missing MP: How Jared O'Mara's political dream became a nightmare|last=Burn|first=Chris|date=15 January 2018|work=The Yorkshire Post|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, a press statement explained that his leave was on the advice of his GP, who had discouraged him from attending Parliament, although O'Mara continued to deal with his constituents' casework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MP Jared O'Mara advised by GP not to attend Parliament|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42336727|publisher=BBC News|date=13 December 2017|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three months' absence, O'Mara returned to the House of Commons on 17 January 2018 and voted on the report stage of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Line|first1=Harriet|last2=Lister|first2=Sam|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jared-omara-labour-mp-returns-house-of-commons-suspension-homophobic-sexist-tweets-a8164781.html|title=Jared O’Mara: Labour MP returns to Commons after suspension for homophobic and sexist tweets|work=The Independent|agency=Press Association|date=17 January 2018|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reinstatement and resignation from Labour Party ===
On 3 July 2018, it was announced that O'Mara would be readmitted to the Labour Party, following a review by its [[National Executive Committee]] disputes panel; this review had decided to issue O'Mara a formal warning with a mandatory requirement to attend training, rather than refer the issue to the National Constitutional Committee which has the power to expel members.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The decision was criticised by local Liberal Democrats, the closest challengers to Labour in Sheffield Hallam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-44698077|title=Labour reinstates suspended MP O'Mara|last=|first=|date=3 July 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=4 July 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5724">'''Jean Fox O'Barr''' (born 1942) is a leading feminist teacher, scholar, and administrator whose pioneering work helped establish [[women’s studies]] as a program of academic study and support for women in higher education.

O'Barr received her undergraduate degree from [[Indiana University]] in 1964 and her Master’s (1965) and PhD (1970) in Political Science  from [[Northwestern University]]. She also earned a certificate in African Studies from Northwestern in 1970 based on her graduate work in [[Tanzania]].

Change magazine named her among One Hundred Outstanding Young Leaders in Education in 1978, and O'Barr was selected for the Ford and Exxon Education Foundation’s study of 25 influential female leaders of the women’s movement.&lt;ref name="IUHonoree"&gt;{{cite web|title=Honoree: Jean Fox O'Barr|url=http://www.iu.edu/~uha/search-awards/honoree.shtml?honoreeID=388|work=Indiana University Honors &amp; Awards|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O’Barr is the founding director of [[Duke University]] Women’s Studies Program and led the program for almost 20 years (1983-2001). In 2000, she was named Distinguished University Service Professor at Duke University, the first woman to be named in school history.  O'Barr has won numerous awards for teaching and mentoring. In 2010,  she was awarded with one of Duke's highest awards, the University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=Keith|title=Founder's Day Convocation Sept. 30 in Duke Chapel|url=https://today.duke.edu/2010/09/founders_day.html|accessdate=20 March 2014|newspaper=Duke Today|date=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Barr has written nearly 100 articles and books,&lt;ref name="IUHonoree" /&gt; including ''Transforming Knowledge: Public Talks on Women’s Studies 1976-2011'' (2013),&lt;ref name="WUNC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Founder Of Duke's Women's Studies Department Discusses Evolution Of Women's Scholarship|url=http://wunc.org/post/founder-dukes-womens-studies-department-discusses-evolution-womens-scholarship|work=The State of Things|publisher=WUNC 91.5 North Carolina Public Radio|accessdate=26 March 2014|author=Nicole Campbell|author2=Frank Stasio|date=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Feminism in Action: Building Community and Institutions through Women’s Studies'' (1995), ''Women Imagine Change: A Global Anthology of Women's Resistance from 600 B.C.E. to Present'' (1997; with Eugenia DeLamotte and Natania Meeke), and ''Africa in the Disciplines: Contributions of the Study of Africa to the Humanities and Social Sciences'' (1993; with Robert H. Yates and Valentin Y. Mudimbe). She also served as editor-in-chief of ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]]'', the leading international journal in women's studies, and co-founded the Sallie Bingham Center for Women’s History and Culture, part of the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Duke University. Her papers are housed at the Bingham Center.

'''Jodi Sue Huisentruit''' (born June 5, 1968 – declared legally dead May 2001) was a [[television]] [[news anchor]] for [[KIMT]], based in [[Mason City, Iowa]], in the [[United States]]. She was declared missing in the early morning hours of June 27, 1995, soon after telling a colleague that she was on her way to work. As there were signs of a struggle outside her apartment, she is believed to have been [[kidnapping|abducted]], but extensive investigations have failed to uncover any clues to her disappearance.

==Early life==
Huisentruit was born in and grew up in [[Long Prairie, Minnesota]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pieper|first1=Mary|title=Search for Jodi Huisentruit continues 20 years later|url=http://globegazette.com/news/local/search-for-jodi-huisentruit-continues-years-later/article_ccb4f1f6-bf83-5c06-835c-3d27daeff8e0.html|accessdate=April 13, 2016|work=[[Globe Gazette]]|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest daughter of Maurice Nicholas Huisentruit (1920–1982) and Imogene L. "Jane" Huisentruit (née Anderson, 1923–2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Gary|title=Remembering Imogene 'Jane' Huisentruit|url=http://www.findjodi.com/remembering-imogene-jane-huisentruit/|accessdate=January 1, 2017|work=Find Jodi|date=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[high school]], she was considered to be very good at [[golf]]. Her team won the state Class A tournament in 1985 and 1986. After high school, she went on to [[St. Cloud State University]], where she studied mass communications and speech communication and graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in 1990. Her first job after graduation was with [[Northwest Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molene|first1=John|title=Family plants endowment seed|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/223293183|accessdate=January 14, 2017|work=[[St. Cloud Times]]|date=October 25, 1997|pages=3A–4A}}&lt;/ref&gt; She entered broadcasting by getting a job at [[KGAN]] in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], as the station's Iowa City bureau chief, then returned to [[Minnesota]] for a job at [[KSAX]] in [[Alexandria, Minnesota|Alexandria]] before returning to [[Iowa]] for her KIMT position.

==Disappearance==
On the day before she disappeared, Huisentruit participated in a golf tournament and, according to Mason City resident John Vansice, she went to his home to view a video tape of the birthday party that he had arranged for her earlier in the month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findjodi.com/ FindJodi.com, The search continues]&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 4:00&amp;nbsp;am on Tuesday, June 27, 1995, KIMT [[Television producer|producer]] Amy Kuns noted that Huisentruit had failed to report to work as scheduled, so she called Huisentruit's apartment. Huisentruit answered the telephone, explained that she had overslept, and said she was preparing to leave for the station. By 6:00&amp;nbsp;am, however, she had still not arrived, and Kuns filled in for her on the morning show ''Daybreak''. At about 7:00&amp;nbsp;am, KIMT staff called the Mason City [[police]].&lt;ref name="ABC2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=Community Still Haunted by Missing News Anchor|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=893514|accessdate=January 1, 2017|work=[[ABC News]]|date=July 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When police arrived at Huisentruit's apartment they found her red [[Mazda Miata]] in the parking lot, as well as evidence suggesting there had been a struggle near that car. Among other evidence, Huisentruit's personal items, including a bent car key,&lt;ref name="bent key"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jodi Huisentruit |url=https://truecrimegarage.com/listen |website=True Crime Garage |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were found strewn about the area and police reported recovering an unidentified palm print from her car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mastre|first1=Brian|title=Cold Case: News Anchor Abducted|url=http://www.wowt.com/home/headlines/Cold-Case-News-Anchor-Abducted-309934101.html|accessdate=April 13, 2016|publisher=[[WOWT]]|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=20 years later, TV anchor Jodi Huisentruit still missing|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/20-years-later-tv-anchor-jodi-huisentruit-still-missing/|accessdate=April 13, 2016|work=[[CBS News]]|date=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The ensuing investigation revealed at least three neighbors in her apartment complex who said they heard screams at about the time Huisentruit would have likely been leaving for work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials still searching for missing newswoman|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1907&amp;dat=19950629&amp;id=MOAxAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4986,3828051|accessdate=April 13, 2016|work=The Daily Reporter&lt;!-- Spencer, Iowa --&gt;|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=June 29, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Divine|first1=Mary|title=20 years later, search for Jodi Huisentruit hasn't ended|url=http://www.twincities.com/2015/06/19/20-years-later-search-for-jodi-huisentruit-hasnt-ended/|accessdate=April 13, 2016|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a neighbor who lived nearby reported seeing a white van with its running lights on parked in Huisentruit's parking lot at about the same time. This van was never positively identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The strange case of Jodi Huisentruit|url=http://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/offbeat/the-strange-case-of-jodi-huisentruit-1-6976073|accessdate=April 13, 2016|work=The Shields Gazette|date=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1995, the Huisentruit family hired [[private investigator]]s from McCarthy &amp; Associates, Investigative Services, Inc. (MAIS) in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], who in turn enlisted the assistance of [[Omaha, Nebraska]] private investigator Doug Jasa. McCarthy and Jasa appeared on several national television shows, including ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' and ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Episode Number: 364; Season: 8; First Aired: February 18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1995, they and members of Jodi's family traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to meet with three prominent [[psychics]]. This meeting was televised and served as the pilot for the ''[[Psychic Detectives]]'' television show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Psychics join search for anchorwoman|url=http://www.postbulletin.com/psychics-join-search-for-anchorwoman/article_cf1251be-5e9b-5420-b6bd-45c501cbe2e4.html|accessdate=January 1, 2017|work=[[Post-Bulletin]]|date=November 13, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although each show generated a large volume of leads, none resulted in concrete evidence or the identification of a suspect.

In May 1996, about 100 volunteers searched an area of [[Cerro Gordo County]] and left flags to mark anything that appeared suspicious. Each of these sites was then re-examined by law enforcement, but no promising evidence was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benson|first1=Josh|title=Jodi's Disappearance: 1st Year Timeline|url=http://www.findjodi.com/jodis-disappearance-1st-year-timeline/|accessdate=January 1, 2017|work=Find Jodi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Huisentruit's disappearance in 1995, police and private investigators have conducted more than 1000 interviews relating to her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Year later, TV anchor still missing|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19960630&amp;id=CElWAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6019,7908075|accessdate=April 13, 2016|work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|agency=Associated Press|date=June 30, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcci.com/news/3532941/detail.html Sheriff: Human Remains From Adult Male – Des Moines News Story – KCCI Des Moines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605230812/http://www.kcci.com/news/3532941/detail.html |date=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; None have resulted in conclusive evidence pointing towards a suspect. Huisentruit was declared legally dead in May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bob|first1=Link|title=Court declares Jodi Huisentruit legally dead|url=http://globegazette.com/news/local/court-declares-jodi-huisentruit-legally-dead/article_408d26b3-ded6-5f85-a323-505532e796cc.html|accessdate=January 1, 2017|work=[[Globe Gazette]]|date=May 15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been periodic resurgences in the story. When new cases arise that appear to bear similarities to Huisentruit's or remains are found in the area, speculation quickly leads to a connection with the missing reporter. So far, however, no suspect has been tied to Huisentruit's disappearance and all remains have proven to be from other sources. In 2005, many media outlets, including ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'',&lt;ref&gt;20/20 Episode Number: 1405; Season: 26; First Aired: Friday July 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; again focused on the story as the 10th anniversary of the disappearance approached.

In early June 2008, photocopies of the 84 pages of Huisentruit's personal journal were anonymously mailed to a local newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/20660704.html?page=1&amp;c=y |title=Journal of missing television anchor mailed to newspaper |work=Star Tribune |accessdate=March 26, 2014 |agency=Associated Press |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626222545/http://www.startribune.com/local/20660704.html?page=1&amp;c=y |archivedate=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mason City ''[[Globe Gazette]]'' received the material in a large envelope with no return address and a June 4 postmark from Waterloo, Iowa. The original journal has been in the possession of law enforcement since the investigation of Huisentruit's disappearance began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globegazette.com/articles/2008/06/22/news/local/doc485dc763e49ee406478527.txt "Jodi's Journal"], ''The Globe Gazette'', June 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 
Within days, Mason City Police reported that the sender had come forward and then identified her as the wife of the former Mason City Police Chief. Although noting that the former chief had taken a copy of the journal home when he left office, the police gave no motive for his wife sending the copy to the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wife of former police chief sent Huisentruit journal to Globe|url=http://globegazette.com/news/wife-of-former-police-chief-sent-huisentruit-journal-to-globe/article_0af9999f-4c3d-5a97-a8ba-c49b88238a0a.html|accessdate=April 13, 2016|work=Globe Gazette|date=June 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI, the Mason City Police Department, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, and MAIS's investigators are all still actively working on Huisentruit's disappearance, and the television show ''Nancy Grace: America's Missing'' spotlighted her case on February 23, 2011, and again on December 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newswoman Missing in Mason City, Iowa|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1102/23/ng.01.html|accessdate=May 16, 2017|publisher=CNN|date=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nancy Grace Mysteries: Jodi Huisentruit|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1312/06/ng.01.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 16, 2017|date=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, all 100 members of the Iowa State House of Representatives signed a letter asking for the City of Mason City to declare June 27, 2015, as Jodi Huisentruit Day in honor of her memory and that of all victims in unsolved cases.

In December 2016, retiring Iowa State Representative [[John Kooiker]] of [[Sioux County, Iowa]], described his experience with the case as a member of the Iowa State House Public Safety Committee and suggested a cover-up by Mason City officials. His opinion piece was published in ''The N'West Iowa Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kooiker|first1=John|title=Disappearance of Huisentruit remains troubling|url=http://www.nwestiowa.com/opinion/kooiker-disappearance-of-huisentruit-remains-troubling/article_2f7fbefc-cc7c-11e6-ba1c-7badde849db6.html|accessdate=March 11, 2017|publisher=The N'West Iowa Review|date=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, a search warrant was executed against person of interest John Vansice seeking GPS data for two of his vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Ashley|title=Mason City search warrant against person of interest in Huisentruit case remains sealed (with photos, video)|url=http://globegazette.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/mason-city-search-warrant-against-person-of-interest-in-huisentruit/article_f4a53f25-27fe-5f63-afa6-6cf43f17ceef.html|accessdate=March 16, 2018|work=Mason City Globe Gazette|date=March 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2018}}, Huisentruit has not been found, neither have remains been identified as hers.

A '''Korean name''' consists of a [[family name]] followed by a [[given name]], as used by the [[Korean people]] in both [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]]. In the [[Korean language]], ''ireum'' or ''seongmyeong'' usually refers to the family name (''seong'') and given name (''ireum'' in a narrow sense) together.

Traditional Korean family names typically consist of only one syllable.  There is no [[middle name]] in the English language sense.  Many Koreans have their given names made of a [[generation name|generational name]] syllable and an individually distinct syllable, though this practice is declining in the younger generations.  The generational name syllable is shared by siblings in [[North Korea]], and by all members of the same generation of an extended family in [[South Korea]]. Married men and women keep their full personal names, and children inherit the father's family name unless otherwise settled when registering the marriage.

The family names are subdivided into ''[[bon-gwan]]'' (clans), i.e. extended families which originate in the lineage system used in previous historical periods. Each clan is identified by a specific place, and traces its origin to a common [[patrilineal]] ancestor.

Early names based on the [[Korean language]] were recorded in the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period (57 BCE – 668 CE), but with the growing adoption of the [[Chinese writing system]], these were gradually replaced by names based on [[Chinese characters]] ([[hanja]]). During periods of [[Mongol]] influence, the ruling class supplemented their Korean names with [[Mongolian name]]s.

Because of the many changes in [[Korean romanization|Korean romanization practices]] over the years, modern Koreans, when using [[List of languages by writing system#Latin script|languages written in Latin script]], romanize their names in various ways, most often approximating the pronunciation in [[English orthography]]. Some keep the original order of names, while others reverse the names to match the usual [[Western world|Western]] pattern.

According to the population and housing census of 2000 conducted by the South Korean government, there are a total of 286 [[List of Korean surnames|surnames]] and 4,179 [[bon-gwan|clans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2000 인구주택총조사 성씨 및 본관 집계결과|url=http://kostat.go.kr/portal/korea/kor_nw/2/2/1/index.board?bmode=read&amp;bSeq=&amp;aSeq=46672&amp;pageNo=1&amp;rowNum=10&amp;navCount=10&amp;currPg=&amp;sTarget=title&amp;sTxt=%EB%B3%B8%EA%B4%80|website=통계청|publisher=Statistics Korea|accessdate=20 October 2017|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fewer than 300 (approximately 280)&lt;ref name=HanCinema&gt;The Korean Drama &amp; Movies Database, [http://www.hancinema.net/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-korean-surnames-20507.html Everything you ever wanted to know about Korean surnames] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060336/http://www.hancinema.net/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-korean-surnames-20507.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean family names were in use in 2000, and the three most common ([[Kim (Korean name)|Kim]], [[Lee (Korean name)|Lee]], and [[Park (Korean name)|Park]]) account for nearly half of the population. For various reasons, there is a growth in the number of Korean surnames.&lt;ref name="HanCinema"/&gt;&lt;ref name=USLC&gt;U.S. Library of Congress, [http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/38.htm Traditional Family Life.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103013030/http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/38.htm |date=November 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each family name is divided into one or more clans (''[[bon-gwan]]''), identifying the clan's city of origin. For example, the most populous clan is [[Kim (Korean name)|Gimhae Kim]]; that is, the [[Kim (Korean name)|Kim]] clan from the city of [[Gimhae]]. Clans are further subdivided into various ''pa'', or branches stemming from a more recent common ancestor, so that a full identification of a person's family name would be clan-surname-branch. For example, "Kyoungjoo Yissi" also romanized as "Kyoungjoo Leessi" (Kyoung-Joo Lee clan, or Lee clan of Kyoung-Joo) and "Yeonan-Yissi" (Lee clan of Yeonan) are, technically speaking, completely different surnames, even though both are, in most places, simply referred to as "Yi" or "Lee". This also means people from the same clan are considered to be of same blood, such that marriage of a man and a woman of same surname and ''bon-gwan'' is considered a strong taboo, regardless of how distant the actual lineages may be, even to the present day.

Traditionally, Korean women keep their family names after their marriage, but their children take the father's surname. In the premodern, patriarchal Korean society, people were extremely conscious of familial values and their own family identities. Korean women keep their surnames after marriage based on traditional reasoning that it is inherited from their parents and ancestors, and cannot be changed. According to traditions, each clan publishes a comprehensive genealogy (''[[jokbo]]'') every 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Nahm, pg.33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around a dozen two-syllable surnames are used, all of which rank after the 100 most common surnames. The five most common family names, which together make up over half of the Korean population, are used by over 20 million people in South Korea.&lt;ref name="nso"&gt;Republic of Korea. [http://kosis.nso.go.kr/cgi-bin/sws_999.cgi?ID=DT_1INOOSB&amp;IDTYPE=3 National Statistical Office.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301110942/http://kosis.nso.go.kr/cgi-bin/sws_999.cgi?ID=DT_1INOOSB&amp;IDTYPE=3 |date=March 1, 2007 }} The total population was 45,985,289. No comparable statistics are available from [[North Korea]]. The top 22 surnames are charted, and a rough extrapolation for both Koreas has been calculated {{cite web|url=http://sun-bin.blogspot.com/2005/12/chinese-and-korean-family-names.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628044808/http://sun-bin.blogspot.com/2005/12/chinese-and-korean-family-names.html |archivedate=2016-06-28 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2015 census, it was revealed that foreign-origin family names were becoming more common in South Korea, due to naturalised citizens transcribing their surnames in [[hangul]]. Between 2000 and 2015, more than 4,800 new surnames were registered. During the census, a total of 5,582 distinct surnames were collected, 73% of which do not have corresponding [[hanja]] characters. It was also revealed that despite the surge in the number of surnames, the ratio of top 10 surnames had not changed. 44.6% of South Koreans are still named Kim, Lee or Park, while the rest of the top 10 are made up of Choi, Jeong, Kang, Jo, Yoon, Jang and Lim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170109000755|title=Foreign-origin family names on rise in South Korea|date=2017-01-09|accessdate=2017-01-10|publisher=The Korea Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Given names==
{{See also|List of Korean given names}}
Traditionally, given names are partly determined by [[generation name]]s, a custom originating in China. One of the two characters in a given name is unique to the individual, while the other is shared by all people in a family generation. In both North and South Korea, generational names are usually no longer shared by cousins, but are still commonly shared by brothers and sisters.&lt;ref name="northnames"&gt;NKChosun.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harkrader|first=Lisa|title=South Korea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w1VeruSAyawC|year=2004|publisher=Enslow Pub. Inc.|isbn=978-0-7660-5181-2|page=24|quote=Many South Korean families today are relatively small, and may not include sons, so South Korean parents have begun to choose names for their sons that do not follow the traditional requirements of generation names.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given names are typically composed of ''[[hanja]]'', or Chinese characters. In North Korea, the ''hanja'' are no longer used to write the names, but the meanings are still understood; thus, for example, the syllable ''cheol'' (철, {{lang|ko-Hani|鐵}}) is used in boys' names and means "iron".

{{Infobox Korean name
| hangul = {{linktext|인명|용|추가|한자|표}}
| hanja  = {{linktext|人名|用|追加|漢字|表}}
| rr = Inmyeongyong chuga hanjapyo
| mr = Inmyŏngyong ch'uga hanchap'yo
|title = Table of (Additional) Hanja for Personal Name Use }}
In South Korea, section 37 of the Family Registry Law requires that the'' hanja'' in personal names be taken from a restricted list.&lt;ref&gt;South Korea, Family Register Law&lt;/ref&gt; Unapproved ''hanja'' must be represented by ''[[hangul]]'' in the [[family registry]]. In March 1991, the [[Supreme Court of South Korea]] published the '''Table of Hanja for Personal Name Use''', which allowed a total of 2,854 ''hanja'' in new South Korean given names (as well as 61 alternative forms).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.korean.go.kr/nkview/nklife/1991_2/2_25.html National Academy of the Korean Language (1991)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319163239/http://www.korean.go.kr/nkview/nklife/1991_2/2_25.html |date=March 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The list was expanded in 1994, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2015. Thus, 8,142 ''hanja'' are now permitted in South Korean names (including the [[Hanmun gyoyukyong gicho hanja|set of basic ''hanja'']]), in addition to a small number of alternative forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2014/10/20/2014102001300.html|script-title=ko:'인명용(人名用)' 한자 5761→8142자로 대폭 확대|publisher=Chosun Ilbo|date=2014-10-20|accessdate=2017-08-23|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of an official list is similar to Japan's use of the ''[[jinmeiyō kanji]]'' (although the characters do not entirely coincide).

While the traditional practice is still largely followed, since the late 1970s, some parents have given their children names that are native Korean words, usually of two syllables. Popular given names of this sort include [[Haneul]] ({{linktext|lang=ko-Hang|하늘}}; "Heaven" or "Sky"), [[Areum (name)|Areum]] ({{linktext|lang=ko-Hang|아름}}; "Beauty"), Iseul ({{linktext|lang=ko-Hang|이슬}}; "Dew") and [[Seulgi]] ({{linktext|lang=ko-Hang|슬기}}; "Wisdom").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://book.hani.co.kr/arti/SERIES/61/382663.html |last=Jeon |first=Su-tae |title=사람 이름 짓기 |trans-title=Making a name |work=[[The Hankyoreh]] |date=2009-10-19 |accessdate=2012-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416191823/http://book.hani.co.kr/arti/SERIES/61/382663.html |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2008 and 2015, the proportion of such names among South Korean newborns rose from 3.5% to 7.7%. The most popular such names in 2015 were Han-gyeol (한결) for boys and Sarang ({{linktext|lang=ko-Hang|사랑}}; "Love") for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1003564588&amp;plink=ORI&amp;cooper=NAVER|script-title=ko:신생아 인기 이름 '민준·서연'…드라마 영향?|trans-title=Popular names for newborns: Min-jun and Seo-yeon ... the effect of TV dramas?|publisher=Seoul Broadcasting System|date=9 May 2016|access-date=6 December 2017|quote=신생아에게 한글 이름을 지어주는 경우는 2008년 전체의 3.5%에서 지난해에는 두 배가 넘는 7.7%에 달했습니다. 가장 많이 사용된 한글 이름은 남자는 '한결', 여자는 '사랑'이었습니다.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this trend away from traditional practice, people's names are still recorded in both ''hangul'' and ''hanja'' (if available) on official documents, in family genealogies, and so on.

Originally, there was no legal limitation on the length of names in South Korea. As a result, some people registered extremely long given names composed of native Korean words, such as the 16-syllable Haneulbyeollimgureumhaennimbodasarangseureouri ({{linktext|하늘|별님|구름|햇님|보다|사랑|스러우리}}; roughly, "More beloved than the stars in the sky and the sun in the clouds"). However, beginning in 1993, new regulations required that the given name be five syllables or shorter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/399615.html|title=한국에서 가장 긴 이름은?|trans-title=What's the longest name in Korea?|work=[[Hankyoreh]]|date=18 January 2008|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

=== Forms of address ===
{{See also|Korean honorifics}}

The usage of names is governed by strict norms in traditional Korean society. It is generally considered rude to address people by their given names in [[Korean culture]]. This is particularly the case when dealing with adults or one's elders.&lt;ref&gt;The Northern Forum (2006), p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; It is acceptable to call someone by his or her given name if he or she is the same age as the speaker. However, it is considered rude to use someone's given name if that person's age is a year older than the speaker. This is often a source of [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] difficulty for learners of Korean as a foreign language, and for Korean learners of Western languages.

A variety of replacements are used for the actual name of the person. It is acceptable among adults of similar status to address the other by their full name, with the suffix ''ssi'' (氏, 씨) added. However, it is inappropriate to address someone by the surname alone, even with such a suffix.&lt;ref name="proper"&gt;Ri 2005, p.182.&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever the person has an official rank, it is typical to address him or her by the name of that rank (such as "Manager"), often with the honorific ''nim'' (님) added. In such cases, the full name of the person may be appended, although this can also imply the speaker is of higher status.&lt;ref name="proper"/&gt;

Among children and close friends, it is common to use a person's birth name.

===Traditional nicknames===
Among the common people, who have suffered from high child mortality, children were often given ''amyeong'' (childhood name), to wish them long lives by avoiding notice from the messenger of death.&lt;ref name="Daum"&gt;{{cite web|title=이름|url=http://100.daum.net/encyclopedia/view/14XXE0044126|website=다음 백과 (Daum Encyclopedia)|accessdate=22 October 2017|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sometimes-insulting [[nickname]]s are used sparingly for children today.&lt;ref&gt;Naver Encyclopedia, Nickname (별명, 別名).&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon marriage, women usually lost their ''amyeong'', and were called by a ''taekho'', referring to their town of origin.&lt;ref name="Daum" /&gt;

In addition, [[teknonymy]], or referring to parents by their children's names, is a common practice. It is most commonly used in referring to a mother by the name of her eldest child, as in "Cheolsu's mom" (철수 엄마). However, it can be extended to either parent and any child, depending upon the context.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang (1991), p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean names and gender===

Korean given names' correlation to gender is complex, and by comparison to European languages less consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Ask A Korean, [http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2008/08/its-not-just-that-they-all-look-same.html It's Not Just That They All Look The Same] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013191723/http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2008/08/its-not-just-that-they-all-look-same.html |date=October 13, 2016 }}, 4 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Sino-Korean syllables carry masculine connotations, others feminine, and others unisex.  These connotations may vary depending on whether the character is used as the first or second character in the given name.  A ''[[Generation name|dollimja]]'' generational marker, once confined to male descendants but now sometimes used for women as well, may further complicate gender identification.  Native Korean given names show similar variation.

A further complication in Korean text is that the singular pronoun used to identify individuals has no gender.&lt;ref name="Hee-Geun Yoon pp.121-126"&gt;Hee-Geun Yoon, Seong-Bae Park, Yong-Jin Han, Sang-Jo Lee, "Determining Gender of Korean Names with Context," alpit, pp.121-126, 2008 International Conference on Advanced Language Processing and Web Information Technology, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that automated translation often misidentifies or fails to identify individuals' gender in Korean text and thus presents stilted or incorrect English output.  (Conversely, English source text is similarly missing information about social status and age critical to smooth Korean-language rendering.)&lt;ref name="Hee-Geun Yoon pp.121-126"/&gt;

Children traditionally take their father’s family name.&lt;ref&gt;Nahm, Andrew C. (1988). Korea: Tradition and Transformation — A History of the Korean People. Elizabeth, NJ: Hollym International.&lt;/ref&gt; Under South Korean Civil Law effective 1 January 2008, though, children may be legally given the last name of either parent or even that of a step-parent.&lt;ref&gt;Park, Chung-a, [https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/113_4064.html Children Can Adopt Mothers Surname] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609223414/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/113_4064.html |date=June 9, 2016 }}, The Korean Times, 3 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The use of names has evolved over time. The first recording of Korean names appeared as early as in the early [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms period]]. The adoption of Chinese characters contributed to Korean names.  A complex system, including [[courtesy name]]s and [[pen name]]s, as well as [[posthumous name]]s and childhood names, arose out of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] tradition. The courtesy name system in particular arose from the ''[[Classic of Rites]]'', a core text of the Confucian canon.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hong-jik (1983), p.1134.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Three Kingdoms period, native given names were sometimes composed of three syllables like Misaheun (미사흔) and Sadaham (사다함), which were later transcribed into ''[[hanja]]'' (未斯欣, 斯多含). The use of family names was limited to kings in the beginning, but gradually spread to aristocrats and eventually to most of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Do (1999), sec. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recorded family names are apparently native Korean words, such as toponyms. At that time, some characters of Korean names might have been read not by their Sino-Korean pronunciation, but by their native reading. For example, the native Korean name of [[Yeon Gaesomun]] (연개소문; 淵蓋蘇文), the first Grand Prime Minister of [[Goguryeo]], can linguistically be reconstructed as "Eol Kasum" (/*älkasum/).&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Sekyung, ''Phonetic and phonological study on the different transcriptions of the Same personal names'', Seoul: Dongguk University (1990). {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[Silla]] names are also believed to represent [[Old Korean]] vocabulary; for example, [[Bak Hyeokgeose]], the name of the founder of Silla, was pronounced something like "Bulgeonuri" (弗矩內), which can be translated as "bright world".&lt;ref&gt;Do (1999), sec. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In older traditions, if the name of a baby is not chosen by the third trimester, the responsibility of choosing the name fell to the oldest son of the family. Often, this was the preferred method as the name chosen was seen as good luck.

According to the chronicle ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', family names were bestowed by kings upon their supporters. For example, in 33 CE, King [[Yuri of Silla|Yuri]] gave the six headmen of Saro (later [[Silla]]) the names Lee (이), Bae (배), Choi (최), Jeong (정), Son (손) and Seol (설). However, this account is not generally credited by modern historians, who hold that Confucian-style surnames as above were more likely to have come into general use in the fifth and subsequent centuries, as the Three Kingdoms increasingly adopted the Chinese model.&lt;ref&gt;Do (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a handful of figures from the Three Kingdoms period are recorded as having borne a [[courtesy name]], such as [[Seol Chong]]. The custom only became widespread in the [[Goryeo]] period, as Confucianism took hold among the literati.&lt;ref&gt;Naver Encyclopedia, 자 [字]. Seol Chong's courtesy name, Chongji (총지) is reported in the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', Yeoljeon 6, "Seol Chong".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1055, Goryeo established a new law limiting access to the civil service examination to those with family names.&lt;ref name="Daum" /&gt;

For men of the aristocratic ''[[yangban]]'' class, a complex system of alternate names emerged by the [[Joseon]] period. On the other hand, commoners typically only had a first name.&lt;ref name="Daum" /&gt; Surnames were originally a privilege reserved for the ''yangban'' class, but members of the [[jungin|middle]] and [[sangmin|common]] classes of Joseon society frequently paid to acquire a surname from a ''yangban'' and be included into a [[bon-gwan|clan]]; this practice became rampant by the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why so many Koreans are called Kim|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/09/economist-explains-5|website=The Economist|accessdate=23 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a significant growth in the ''yangban'' class but conversely diluting and weakening its social dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(3) 사회 구조의 변동|url=http://contents.history.go.kr/front/ta/view.do?levelId=ta_h62_0020_0030_0030|website=우리역사넷|publisher=National Institute of Korean History|accessdate=23 October 2017|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the region of [[Daegu]], the ''yangban'' who had comprised 9.2% of Daegu's demographics in 1690 rose to 18.7% in 1729, 37.5% in 1783, and 70.3% in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3) 양반 신분의 동향|url=http://contents.history.go.kr/front/nh/view.do?levelId=nh_039_0040_0040_0030_0010|website=우리역사넷|publisher=National Institute of Korean History|accessdate=23 October 2017|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the [[Gabo Reform]] of 1894 that members of the [[cheonmin|outcast]] class were allowed to adopt a surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=한국족보박물관 개관…‘족보 문화’의 메카 대전을 가다|url=http://biz.heraldcorp.com/view.php?ud=20100526000135|website=헤럴드경제|publisher=Herald Corporation|accessdate=23 October 2017|language=ko|date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a census called the ''minjeokbu'' (民籍簿) completed in 1910, more than half of the Korean population did not have a surname at the time.&lt;ref name="Daum" /&gt;

For a brief period after the [[Mongol invasion of Korea]] during the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean kings and aristocrats had both [[Mongolian names|Mongolian]] and [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] names. The scions of the ruling class were sent to the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] court for schooling.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p.156.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, King [[Gongmin of Goryeo|Gongmin]] had both the Mongolian name Bayan Temür (伯顏帖木兒) and the Sino-Korean name Wang Gi (王祺) (later renamed Wang Jeon (王顓)).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hong-jik (1983), p.117.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Sōshi-kaimei}}

During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|period of Japanese colonial rule]] of Korea (1910–1945), Koreans were forced to adopt [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-language names.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Library of Congress, [http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/7.htm Korea Under Japanese Rule.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103013022/http://countrystudies.us/south-korea/7.htm |date=November 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, as part of [[Governor-General of Korea|Governor-General]] [[Jiro Minami]]'s policy of cultural assimilation (同化政策; ''dōka seisaku''), Ordinance No. 20 (commonly called the "Name Order", or ''Sōshi-kaimei'' (創氏改名) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) was issued, and became law in April 1940.&lt;ref name="doka"&gt;Nahm (1996), p.223. See also Empas, "창씨개명".&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Japanese Governor-General officially prohibited compulsion, low-level officials effectively forced Koreans to adopt Japanese-style family and given names. By 1944, about 84% of the population had registered Japanese family names.&lt;ref name="doka"/&gt;

''Sōshi'' (Japanese) means the creation of a Japanese family name (''shi'', Korean ''ssi''), distinct from a Korean family name or ''seong'' (Japanese ''sei''). Japanese family names represent the families they belong to and can be changed by marriage and other procedures, while Korean family names represent paternal linkages and are unchangeable. Japanese policy dictated that Koreans either could register a completely new Japanese family name unrelated to their Korean surname, or have their Korean family name, in Japanese form, automatically become their Japanese name if no surname was submitted before the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Empas, "창씨개명".&lt;/ref&gt;

After the liberation of Korea from Japanese rule, the Name Restoration Order (조선 성명 복구령; 朝鮮姓名復舊令) was issued on October 23, 1946, by the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|United States military administration]] south of the [[38th parallel north]], enabling Koreans to restore their original Korean names if they wished.

Japanese conventions of creating given names, such as using "子" (Japanese ''ko'' and Korean ''ja'') in feminine names, is seldom seen in present-day Korea, both North and South. In the North, a campaign to eradicate such Japanese-based names was launched in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="northnames"/&gt; In the South, and presumably in the North as well, these names are regarded as old and unsophisticated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Romanization and pronunciation==
In English-speaking nations, the three most common family names are often written and pronounced as "Kim" (김), "Lee" or "Rhee" (이, 리), and "Park" (박). Despite official [[Korean romanization]] systems used for geographic and other names in North and South Korea, personal names are generally romanized according to personal preference.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Thus, a family name such as "Lee" may also be found spelled "I", "Yi", "Rhee", and "Rhie".&lt;ref&gt;Although the "I" romanization is uncommon, it does follow the strict [[Revised Romanization of Korean]], and is used by Yonhap (2004) and others due to its clear representation of the underlying 'hangul''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial sound in "Kim" shares features with both the English 'k' (in initial position, an aspirated voiceless velar stop) and "hard g" (an unaspirated voiced velar stop). When pronounced initially, Kim starts with an unaspirated voiceless [[velar stop]] sound; it is voiceless like {{IPA|/k/}}, but also unaspirated like {{IPA|/ɡ/}}. As aspiration is a distinctive feature in Korean but voicing is not, "Gim" is more likely to be understood correctly. "Kim" is used nearly universally in both North and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Yonhap (2004), 484–536 and 793–800, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family name "Lee" is pronounced as 리 (''ri'') in North Korea and as 이 (''i'') in South Korea. In the former case, the initial sound is a [[liquid consonant]]. There is no distinction between the alveolar liquids {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, which is why "Lee" and "Rhee" are both common spellings. In South Korea, the pronunciation of the name is simply the English vowel sound for a "long e", as in 'see'. This pronunciation is also often spelled as "Yi"; the Northern pronunciation is commonly romanized "Ri".&lt;ref&gt;Yonhap (2004), pp. 561–608 and 807–810, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Korean, the name that is usually romanized as "Park" has no 'r' sound, unlike in [[American English]], since the romanization was based on [[English English]], which has [[r-dropping]]. Its initial sound is an unaspirated [[voiceless bilabial stop]], like English 'b' at the beginning of words. The vowel is {{IPA-ko|a|}}, similar to the 'a' in father and so the name is also often transcribed "Pak" or "Bak."&lt;ref&gt;Yonhap (2004), pp.438–457.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean names in English==
[[File:Ban Ki-Moon Davos 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Ban Ki-moon]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]] - the usual presentation of Korean names in English, as shown here, is to put the family name first (Ban is the family name)]]
In English publications, usually Korean names are written in the original order, with the family name first and the given name last. This is the case in Western newspapers. Koreans living and working in Western countries have their names in the Western order, with the given name first and the family name last. The usual presentation of Korean names in English is similar to those of [[Chinese names]] and differs from those of [[Japanese names]], where they, in English publications, are usually written in a reversed order with the family name last.&lt;ref name=PowerpC4-2&gt;Power, John.

'''Lawrence Roger 'Larry' Fast''' (born December 10, 1951) is a [[synthesizer]] expert and composer. He is best known for ''Synergy'', his 1975–1987 series of synthesizer music albums, and for his contributions to a number of popular music acts, including [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Nektar]], and [[Hall &amp; Oates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p30338|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Synergy|last=Bush|first=John|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Fast grew up in [[Livingston, New Jersey]] and attended [[Lafayette College]] in Pennsylvania, where he obtained a degree in History. There he took his previous training in piano and violin and melded them with computer science to become interested in synthesized music and to build his own primitive sound-making electronic devices.

He was introduced to [[Rick Wakeman]], the keyboard player from the band [[Yes (band)|Yes]], during a local radio interview, and traveled to the UK to work with Yes on their 1974 album ''[[Tales from Topographic Oceans]]''.&lt;ref name="FWR_Audion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floatingworldrecords.co.uk/albums/audion/ |title=''Audion'' CD details |publisher=[[Voiceprint Records]] (''Floating World'' label) |accessdate=14 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130420091654/http://www.floatingworldrecords.co.uk/albums/audion/ |archivedate=20 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that he got a recording contract with Passport Records.

== The Synergy project ==

Fast recorded a series of pioneering synthesizer music albums under the project name Synergy.

The first album in the series, ''Electronic Realizations for Rock Orchestra'', was released as an [[gramophone record|LP]] in 1975. Like the following albums, it exclusively makes use of electronic instruments, mainly synthesizers. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Fast released eight more Synergy LPs on [[Passport Records]], all of which were later re-released on [[Compact Disc|CD]]s. The 1998 re-release of ''Semi-Conductor'', a compilation album originally released in 1984, was a remastered version of the original, and contained ten additional tracks. The eleventh album in the series, ''Reconstructed Artifacts'', was released in 2003, and contained completely new performances of select compositions from the previous albums, using modern digital synthesizers, as well as the new digital recording technologies.

At least two tracks from the album ''Audion'' (1981) were used as the basis for music in [[Commodore 64]] computer games: [[Rob Hubbard]]'s scores for the C64 version of ''[[Zoids: The Battle Begins|Zoids]]'' and ''[[Master_of_Magic_(1985_video_game)|Master of Magic]]'', which were unofficial covers of songs ''Ancestors'' and ''Shibolet''.

Synergy's first album states "..and nobody played guitar." The second album, Sequencer, says "...and still no guitars." These are rumored to be a tongue-in-cheek response to statements that appeared on albums by the rock group [[Queen (band)|Queen]] that they used no synthesizers, which were made to inform listeners who assumed otherwise. Fast's third Synergy album, Cords, states "Finally, guitars...sort of," which references the use of a Russ Hamm Guitar Synthesizer played by Pete Sobel.

In August 2013, one of Fast's newest tracks in several years, "Tower Indigo", was released on the [[Projekt Records]] compilation ''Possibilities of Circumstance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projekt.com/store/product/pro00295 |title=Various Artists: Possibilities of Circumstance |date=Aug 2013 |accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The albums by Synergy are:
* 1975: ''Electronic Realizations for Rock Orchestra'' &lt;small&gt;No&amp;nbsp;66 [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] (18 weeks)&lt;/small&gt;
* 1976: ''Sequencer'' &lt;small&gt;No&amp;nbsp;144 ''Billboard'' 200 (11 weeks)&lt;/small&gt;
* 1978: ''Cords'' &lt;small&gt;No&amp;nbsp;146 ''Billboard'' 200 (6 weeks)&lt;/small&gt;
* 1979: ''Games''
* 1981: ''Audion''
* 1981: ''Computer Experiments, Volume One''
* 1982: ''The Jupiter Menace'' (soundtrack for film ''The Jupiter Menace'')
* 1984: ''Semi-Conductor'' (compilation containing two new tracks)
* 1987: ''[[Metropolitan Suite]]''
* 1998: ''Semi-Conductor, Release 2'' (re-release of ''Semi-Conductor'', remastered and containing ten additional tracks)
* 2003: ''Reconstructed Artifacts'' (compilation consisting of re-recorded versions of old tracks)

Currently Fast is slowly developing a new Synergy album. This will be his first studio album consisting of new material in over twenty years. According to Fast's website, it will make heavy use of [[software synthesizer]]s (one of which is, fittingly, [[Sample Logic]]'s [[Synergy (software synthesizer)|Synergy synthesizer]]) rather than the hardware equipment he had been using so far. He has amassed a lot of new thematic material and plans to rework some old, as yet unreleased pieces for the new album as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://synergy-emusic.blogspot.com/2009/04/update-march-april-2009.html |title=Update March/April of 2009|date=April 2009|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other music projects ==

In addition to the ''Synergy'' albums, Fast made contributions to musical projects headed by other people:
* Worked sporadically with [[Nektar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p19532|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Nektar|last=Eder|first=Bruce|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing much of the dominating synthesizers on their 1975 album ''[[Recycled (Nektar album)|Recycled]]''.
* Also known for his work with [[Peter Gabriel]]. He played synthesizer on records and on tour, and rounded out the production team on Gabriel's albums from 1976 to 1986. He recorded parts for ''So,'' but these were not used.
* Contributed to the 1977 concept album ''[[Intergalactic Touring Band]]'' on Passport Records.
* Played the [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5|Prophet Synthesizer]] on [[Kate Bush]]'s 1980 Album ''[[Never for Ever]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prasad|first=Anil|title=Evolutionary snapshots|url=http://www.innerviews.org/inner/fast.html|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Produced Canadian progressive rock group [[FM (Canadian band)|FM]]'s 1980 album ''[[City of Fear (FM album)|City of Fear]]''.
* Contributed music to the [[Carl Sagan]] 1980 television program ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.
* Provided additional synthesizers on [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s 1981 album ''[[4 (Foreigner album)|4]]'' and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s 1984 album ''[[Agent Provocateur (musical album)|Agent Provocateur]]''.
* Played synthesizers on the 1983 [[Bonnie Tyler]] single "[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]".
* Collaborated on the 1980s pop music project [[Iam Siam]], which produced the hit "She Went Pop".
* Produced and performed synthesizer on [[Annie Haslam|Annie Haslam's]] 1989 release ''[[Annie Haslam (album)|Annie Haslam]]''.
* Along with [[David Bryan]] composed, arranged, and performed the score music to the 1992 film ''[[Netherworld (film)|Netherworld]]''.
* Helped create the music for [[Tokyo DisneySea]], a new Walt Disney theme park.
* Toured and recorded with bassist [[Tony Levin]] (himself an alumnus of Peter Gabriel's band) as part of Levin's [[Waters of Eden]] band.
* Toured with the [[Tony Levin|Tony Levin Band]] in 2006.

[[File:Hohenfriedeberg - Attack of Prussian Infantry - 1745.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Prussia]]n line infantry attack at the 1745 [[Battle of Hohenfriedberg]].]]

'''Line infantry''' was the type of [[infantry]] that composed the basis of European land armies from the middle of the 17th century to the middle of the 19th century. For both battle and parade drill, it consisted of two to four ranks of foot soldiers drawn up side by side in rigid alignment, and thereby maximizing the effect of their firepower. By extension, the term came to be applied to the regular regiments "of the line" as opposed to [[Foot Guards]], [[light infantry]], [[skirmisher]]s, [[militia]], [[Combat service support|support]] personnel, plus some other special categories of infantry not focused on heavy [[front line]] combat.&lt;ref&gt;''The Concise Oxford Dictionary'', 1984, {{ISBN|0-19-861131-5}}. p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linear tactics and function ==
Line infantry mainly used three formations in its battles: the line, the square and the column.

With the massive proliferation of [[small arms]] (firearms that could be carried by hand, as opposed to cannon) in the infantry units from the middle of 17th century, the battlefield was dominated by [[Line (formation)|linear tactics]], according to which the infantry was aligned into long thin lines and fired volleys. A line consisted of 2, 3 or 4 ranks of soldiers.

According to the instructions, the soldiers were supposed to fire at volleys at the command of officers. But in a real battle, this happened only in the first minutes of the battle. After one or two volleys, each soldier charged a musket and fired at his own discretion, without hearing the commands of the officers. Which of course brought confusion to the system, and the smoke interfered with the accurate shooting. Such a shootout in a puff of smoke could occur for a very long period of time and inflicted huge losses on both sides, and the result was unpredictable. In addition, at the time of the “hot” shootout, the soldiers were so busy and focused on shooting that they could not notice the attack of cavalry from the flank. Therefore, experienced officers tried to avoid such costly shootouts and restrained their soldiers from premature firing, in order to get closer to the enemy’s line as close as possible and solve the battle with several crushing volleys at a short distance. In some cases, it was possible to overturn the enemy with just one volley at a short distance. 
The line was considered as the fundamental battle formation as it allowed for the largest deployment of firepower. Troops in [[skirmish]] formation, though able to take cover and use initiative, were highly vulnerable to cavalry and could not hold ground against advancing infantry columns. Line infantry provided an 'anchor' for skirmishers and cavalry to retreat to if threatened.

Against surrounding enemy cavalry, line infantry could swiftly adopt [[Infantry square|square formation]]s to provide protection. Such squares were hollow (consisting of four lines), unlike the pikemen' and old-style musketeers' square.

Movement in [[Line (formation)|line formation]] was very slow, and unless the battalion was superbly trained, a breakdown in cohesion was virtually assured, especially in any kind of uneven or wooded terrain. As a result, line was mostly used as a stationary formation, with troops moving in [[Column (formation)|column formation]]s and then deploying to line at their destination. Usually, columns would be adopted for movement and melee attacks.

Line infantry was trained in the [[manual of arms]] evolutions, the main objectives of which were fast deployment of a line, rapid shooting and manoeuvre.

== Training and recruitment ==
Line tactics required a strict discipline and simple movements, practiced to the point where they became second-nature. During training, the drill and corporal punishments were widely used.

Line infantry quickly became the most common type of infantry in European countries. [[Musketeer]]s and [[grenadier]]s, formerly [[Special forces#History|elite troops]], gradually became part of the line infantry, switching to linear tactics.

Over time the use of line infantry tactics spread outside of Europe, often as a result of European imperialism. In European colonies and settlements with small populations from the home country, line infantry forces were often raised from the local population, with the British [[East India Company]]'s [[sepoys]] perhaps being the most historically significant example.

During 1814, [[the War of the Six Coalition]], regular French line infantry recruits were trained very infirmitively due to the fierce attack of the Coalition Forces. A recruit was trained by firing two cartridges and four blanks. There was also light training of forming several formations. By these examples, forming a massive extent of well trained, elite line infantry was a very complicated process.

== Arms and equipment ==
In the middle of the 16th century, the [[matchlock]] muskets of some line infantry were equipped with [[bayonet]]s. Bayonets were attached to the muzzles of muskets and were used when line troops entered [[melee]] combat. They also helped to defend against cavalry.

At the end of the 17th century, a flaw within the design of [[matchlock]] muskets became more apparent. Since the matchlock musket used a slow burning piece of twine know as a [[slow match]], the twine sometimes would accidentally set fire to the gunpowder reservoir in the musket prematurely setting off all of the gunpowder and bringing serious injury and death to the operator. During this time, matchlock muskets began to be replaced by lighter and cheaper infantry [[fusilier|fusils]] with [[flintlock]]s, weighing 5&amp;nbsp;kg with a caliber of 17.5&amp;nbsp;mm, first in France and then in other countries. In many countries, the new fusils retained the name "musket". Both muskets and fusils were [[smoothbore]], which lessened their accuracy and range, but made for faster loading, lesser amount of bore fouling and more robust, less complicated firearms.

The range and accuracy of smooth-bore muskets was in the range of 300-400 yards against the line of infantry / cavalry. In a single enemy could get from a distance of no more than 50-100 yards. It should be borne in mind that ordinary linear infantrymen were poorly trained in aimed shooting, due to the saving of gunpowder and lead (modern reenactors achieve much better results by firing smooth-bore muskets). But the line infantrymen were well trained in fast reloading muskets. The recruit should have done at least 3 rounds a minute, and an experienced soldier could have done up to 6 rounds per minute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2563593-firepower&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.books-share.com/ebook/napoleonic-infantry-napoleonic-weapons-and-warfare&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of the line infantry had no protective equipment, as armor that could provide protection from musket fire were considered too expensive and heavy. Only the former elite troops could keep by tradition some elements of protection, for example, the copper mitre caps of grenadiers.

== Line infantry and other contemporary types of infantry ==
Initially, soldiers equipped with firearms formed only a small part of the infantry branch of most armies, because of their vulnerability to hostile cavalry. [[Pikemen]] formed the majority of infantrymen and were known as heavy infantry. A significant part of infantry consisted of old-style musketeers, who did not use the linear tactics, instead skirmishing in open formation. However, by the middle of the 17th century, musketeers deployed in line formation already provided about half of the foot troops in most Western European armies. [[Maurice of Nassau]] was noted as the first large scale user of linear tactic, introducing the 'counter-march' to enable his formations of musketeers to maintain a continuous fire. After the invention of the bayonet, musketeers could finally defend themselves from the enemy's horsemen, and the percentage of pikemen fell gradually. In 1699, the Austrian army got rid of their pikes. In 1703, the French army did the same, in 1704 the British and 1708 the Dutch. In 1699–1721, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] converted almost all Russian foot-regiments to line infantry. The abandonment of the pike, together with the faster firing rate made possible by the introduction of the new [[flintlock]] [[musket]] and [[paper cartridge]], resulted in the abandonment of the deeper formations of troops more ideal for the melee-oriented pikemen. Instead, military thinking switched to shallower lines that maximized the firepower of an infantry formation.

Besides regular line infantry, there were elite troops (royal guards and other designated elite regiments) and the [[Light infantry#Modern age|light infantry]]. Light infantry operated in extended order (also known as skirmish formation) as opposed to the close order (tight formations) used by line infantry. Since the late 18th century, light infantry in most European countries mostly consisted of [[Rifleman|riflemen]] (such as the German [[Jäger (military)|Jäger]]), armed with rifled carbines and trained in aimed shooting and use of [[Enfilade and defilade|defilades]]. In England, much of the light infantry was armed with smooth-bore muskets, only a few regiments used rifled muskets. &lt;ref&gt;https://allslide.net/embed/philip-haythornthwaite-napoleonic-infantry-napo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kobo.com/fi/en/ebook/british-light-infantry-rifle-tactics-of-the-napoleonic-wars&lt;/ref&gt; In the Russian Empire, light infantry was forming at a very fast pace; by the end of the 18th century, light infantry regiments numbered 40,000 soldiers (jaeger). In the Russian army, light infantry weapons were significantly different from line infantry. Light infantrymen were armed with short, high-quality manufacturing muskets. In addition, each light infantryman was armed with a pistol with a flintlock.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.wikireading.ru/83385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://adjudant.ru/regulations/1786-eger-03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Line infantry, whose muskets with bayonets were heavier than carbines, became known as heavy infantry and were used as the main deciding force.

In France, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], the division into the Guard, while line infantry and light infantry formally continued to exist, line and "light" [[regiment]]s had identical weaponry (smooth-bore fusils) and tactics. (Napoleon preferred smooth-bore weaponry for their faster reload speeds.) However, each battalion in both line and "light" regiments included a company of [[voltigeurs]], who were expected to act as skirmishers as well being able to deploy into line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://napoleonistyka.atspace.com/French_infantry.html#_grenadiers_fusiliers_carabiniers_chasseurs_voltigeurs |title=Napoleon, His Army and Enemies. |last1=var. contributors |website=napoleonistyka.atspace.com |publisher=Zbynio Olszewski (webmaster)|access-date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the unsuccessful army reforms of Paul I, the number of light infantry in the Russian army was significantly reduced and made up only 8% of the entire field infantry. But soon the Russian army returned to the trend of increasing the number of light infantry, begun in the 18th century. By 1811, 50 light infantry regiments were formed in the Russian army. In addition, in each linear battalion it was required to have 100 of the best shooting soldiers who fought in a loose ranks and covered their battalions from the enemy skirmishers. The total number of light infantry reached 40% of the entire field infantry. Unfortunately, the sharp increase in the number of light infantry greatly influenced their quality of training and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%95%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/Drill/Russ_skirmish_Drill_1818.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian infantry of 1854 comprised 108 regiments, of which 42 were line infantry. The remainder were specialized or elite units such as Guards, Grenadiers and Jägers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert H.G.|last=Thomas|page=4|title=The Russian Army of the Crimean War 1854-56|ISBN=1-85532-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only part of the Russian light infantry were equipped with the M1854 rifle, the remainder retaining smoothbore percussion muskets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert H.G.|last=Thomas|pages=16–17|title=The Russian Army of the Crimean War 1854-56|ISBN=1-85532-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 19th century, the coming of [[mass production]] and new technologies, such as the [[Minie ball]], allowed European armies to gradually equip all their infantrymen with [[rifled]] weapons, and the percentage of line infantry equipped with muskets fell. In the American Civil War, both Northern and Confederate armies had only a few [[line regiment]]s equipped with the old-style smooth-bore muskets. However, France, due to Napoleon III, who admired Napoleon I, had 300 line battalions (comprising an overwhelming majority) even in 1870. Although the French line infantry received Chassepot rifles in 1866, it was still being trained in the use of close formations (line, column and square), which was changed only after the dethronement of Napoleon III. This was common practice in all conventional Western armies until the late 19th century, as infantry tactics and military thinking had yet to catch up with the new technological development.

== Battlefield obsolescence ==
In the years after the Napoleonic Wars, line infantry continued to be deployed as the main battle force, while light infantry provided fire support and covered the movement of units. In Russia, Great Britain, France, Prussia and some other states, linear tactics and formation discipline were maintained into the late 19th century.

With the invention of new weaponry, the concept of line infantry began to wane. The [[Minié ball]] (an improved rifle ammunition), allowed individual infantrymen to shoot more accurately and over greatly increased range. Men walking in formation line-abreast became easy targets, as evidenced in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Thomas and David Kennedy: ''The American Pageant'', p. 434. 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866 showed that [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading rifles]], which gave the individual shooter a greatly increased rate of fire, were greatly superior to muzzleloaded rifles. In the 1860s, most German states and Russia converted their line infantry and riflemen into 'united' infantry, which used rifles and skirmish tactics. After the Franco-Prussian War, both the [[German Empire]] and the [[French Third Republic]] did the same. However, Great Britain retained the name "line infantry", although it used rifled muskets from 1853, breech loading rifles from 1867, and switched from closed lines to extended order during Boer wars.

The growing accuracy and rate of fire of rifles, together with the invention of the [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] machine gun in 1883, meant that close order line infantry would suffer huge losses before being able to close with their foe, while the defensive advantages given to line infantry against cavalry became irrelevant with the effective removal of offensive [[cavalry]] from the battlefield in the face of the improved weaponry. With the turn of the 20th Century, this slowly led to infantry increasingly adopting [[skirmish]] style [[light infantry]] tactics in battle, while retaining line infantry drill for training.

While, as detailed above, linear battle tactics had become obsolete by the second half of the nineteenth century, regiments in a number of European armies continued to be classified as "line infantry" (or cavalry). This designation had come to mean the regular or numbered regiments of an army, as opposed to specialist or elite formations. Accordingly, the distinction had become one of traditional title or classification without significance in respect of armament or tactics. As an example, the 
[[Belgian Army order of battle (1914)|Belgian Army of 1914]] comprised 14 regiments of ''Infanterie de Ligne'' (line infantry), three of ''Chasseurs a pied'' (light infantry), one of ''Grenadiers'' and one of ''Carabiniers''.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Derie, ''Les Soldats de Leopold Ier et Leopold II'', D 1986/0197/03, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Pawly &amp; P. Lierneux, ''The Belgian Army in World War I'', {{ISBN|978-1-84603-448-0}}.  p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar differentiations were made in the majority of European armies of the period, although English-speaking authors sometimes use the designation "line infantry" when referring to the ordinary infantry of some other countries where the exact term was not in use.

The term was also used by US units during the Second World War, as shown by this quote from a report of the [[782nd Tank Battalion]] in late April 1945:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the 22nd of April, the Battalion moved from Oberkotzau, Germany to [[Wunsiedel]], Germany. Here the attachment of the line companies to the Regimental Combat Teams of the [[97th Infantry Division (United States)|97th Division]] was completed. We separated, not coming together again until the war was over. Company "A" joined the 303rd at Rehau, Germany: Company "B" joined the 386th at Arzburg, Germany: and Company "C" the 387th at Waldsassen, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;United States Army, "[http://digicom.bpl.lib.me.us/ww_reg_his/9 782nd Tank Batallion]" (1945). World War Regimental Histories. 9. pp. 17, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The modern [[British Army]] retains the traditional distinction between "Guards", "Line Infantry" and "the Rifles" on ceremonial occasions for historical reasons. It is linked to the [[British Army order of precedence|order of precedence]] within the British Army and regimental pride, so for example Colonel Patrick Crowley states in the "introduction" in ''A Brief History of The [[Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment]]'' (2015):

{{quote|The examples of valour, adherence to duty, and fortitude, continue to inspire the current officers and soldiers of the modern Regiment, who are proud to belong to the most senior English Regiment of the Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Colonel Patrick  |date=2015 |url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/pwrrguide2015.pdf |chapter=Introduction |title=A Brief History of The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment |publisher=army.mod.uk |page=2 (PDF 4) |access-date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Infantry of most 21st-century armies are still trained in formation manoeuvre and [[Military parade|drill]], as a way of instilling [[discipline]] and [[unit cohesion]]. Members of the US Army utilize the term "line company" (informally) in light infantry battalions to differentiate those companies (generally A–D) that perform the traditional infantry role from the support companies (generally F and HHC) charged with supporting the "line companies". The Marine Corps does the same for all its infantry units. In this vein, officers assigned to the rifle companies are referred to as "line officers" while billeted to positions such as Platoon Leaders and Commanding and Executive Officers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">'''Marie-Jeanne Lamartiniére''' (fl. 1802), known in history only as ''Marie-Jeanne'', was a Haitian soldier. She served in the Haitian army during the [[Haitian Revolution]]. 

==Haitian Revolution Service==
Lamartiniére served at the [[Battle of Crête-à-Pierrot]] in 1802. She fought in male uniform and made a great impression with her fearlessness and courage. Lamartiniére is said to have boosted the morale of her colleagues with her bravery.

==Later life==
Her life after the independence is unknown. An old story says that she, for a time, was involved in a relationship with emperor [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who admired her courage, and that she later married the officer Larose. This is unconfirmed but comes from a contemporary source, related by one of the other soldiers at Crête-à-Pierrot, and is considered trustworthy.  

==Similar Soldiers of Note==
Most women participating as soldiers during the revolution remain anonymous, and only a few, of which Lamartiniere is one, have been known in history. Other contemporary examples of women in the Haitian army are [[Victoria Montou]] and [[Sanité Belair]].

'''Mary Jane Bennett''' ({{née}} '''Hebden''', 1816 – 6 July 1885) was the first official [[lighthouse keeper]] in New Zealand, and the only woman to ever hold the role.

Hebden emigrated to New Zealand in 1840 and was soon married to George White Bennett. In 1852 he took the position of lighthouse keeper at [[Pencarrow Head]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|title=Mary Bennett|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/mary-bennett|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of her husband in 1855, she continued to operate the lighthouse. In January 1859 a proper lighthouse was built and Bennett was officially appointed as keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ellis|first=Ellen|title=Bennett, Mary Jane |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1b18/1 |work=Te Ara Dictionary of New Zealand Biography|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pencarrow Head Lighthouse|Pencarrow Lighthouse]] was the first permanent lighthouse in New Zealand.

'''Nicola Claire Blackwood'''&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=59418 |date=13 May 2010 |page=8744}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 16 October 1979) is a former Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Oxford West and Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford West and Abingdon]] who was also Chair of the Science and Technology Select Committee during the [[second Cameron ministry]] and as a junior health minister during the [[first May ministry]].  

She was elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 election]] with a majority of 176 defeating the Liberal Democrats who held the seat since 1997.  She lost her seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 election]] to the Liberal Democrats who won it back with a majority of 816.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40211291|title=Election results 2017: Lib Dems gain Oxford West and Abingdon|date=2017-06-09|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary career==
Blackwood was chosen as the Conservative [[prospective parliamentary candidate]] for [[Oxford West and Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford West and Abingdon]] at an [[open primary]] on 13 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/goldlist/2006/11/oxford_west_and.html|title=ConservativeHome's Seats &amp; Candidates blog: Oxford West and Abingdon open primary|website=conservativehome.blogs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boundary changes which came into effect in 2010 were thought to have favoured the Conservatives, with some 8,000 urban voters (including many students) being moved into the [[Oxford East (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford East]] constituency and more rural voters added.&lt;ref name=ot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/yourtown/abingdon/8152643.Tory_topples_Evan_Harris/|title=Tory topples Evan Harris|website=The Oxford Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwood won the seat at the 2010 general election by 176 votes on a 6.9% swing to the Conservatives from the Liberal Democrats. In late 2010, she was elected to serve on the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] and was secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Overseas Development. She was a member of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission,&lt;ref name="oxcon"&gt;[http://www.oxfordconservatives.com/blackwood/ Oxford City Conservatives — Nicola Blackwood&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501181923/http://www.oxfordconservatives.com/blackwood/ |date=1 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as holding a position on the Council of Advisors for ZANE, a charity which seeks to support pensioners in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="ccf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfwebsite.com/ProfileNicolaBlackwood.shtml|title=Profile of Nicola Blackwood|date=17 July 2011|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717021601/http://www.ccfwebsite.com/ProfileNicolaBlackwood.shtml|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackwood voted against the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill]] in 2013 after indicating to many students and constituents that she would support the measure, for which she was criticised by [[Oxford University Student Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Gerretsen | first=Isabelle | title=Anger as Oxford MP votes against gay marriage | url=http://www.cherwell.org/news/town/2013/05/23/anger-as-oxford-mp-votes-against-gay-marriage | newspaper=Cherwell | date=23 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwood said she had voted against the final draft of the Bill because she was not satisfied with the protection afforded religious freedoms.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], Blackwood retained her seat with a majority of 9,582 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oxford West &amp; Abingdon parliamentary constituency – Election 2015|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000874|website=BBC News|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was in part due to the national swing of voters against the Liberal Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huffington Post|first1=Josh Jacobs|title=Why Did 27 Lib Dem Seats Swing to the Conservatives?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/josh-jacobs/lib-dem-seats_b_7337110.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackwood's biggest donor in the lead up to the 2015 election was a Housing Company called Countrywide Developments Limited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/02865543|title=COUNTYWIDE DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; controlled by AC Gallagher who was also Director of Gallagher Estates No1 Limited.

'''Peter Fintan Lalor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɔː|l|ər}};&lt;ref&gt;''[[Macquarie Dictionary|Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition]]'' (2005).  Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. {{ISBN|1-876429-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5 February 1827&amp;nbsp;– 9 February 1889) was an [[Irish Australians|Irish-Australian]] rebel and, later, politician who rose to fame for his leading role in the [[Eureka Rebellion]], an event controversially identified with the "birth of democracy" in [[Australia]]. He is famous for being the only outlaw to make it to parliament.

==Early life and migration to Australia==
Peter Lalor was born into a house of 14 people in [[Raheen, County Laois|Raheen]], in [[Laois|Queen's County]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (now County Laois, [[Republic of Ireland]]), the son of [[Patrick "Patt" Lalor]], a landowner and [[Tithe War|supporter of the abolition of tithes]] who held a seat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] from 1832 to 1835. He was the first Catholic MP for Queen's County since the reign of [[James II of England|James II]]. His mother was Ann, née Dillon. They had 11 sons and daughters, of whom Lalor was the youngest.

His eldest brother was [[James Fintan Lalor]], who was involved in the [[Young Ireland]] movement and the [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|unsuccessful rebellion of 1848]]. Another brother, [[Richard Lalor]], served as a [[Irish National League|Parnellite nationalist]] in the House of Commons.  His mother died on 4 June 1835 and his father married Ellen Mary Anne Loughnan, with whom he had no children.

Lalor was educated at [[St. Patrick's, Carlow College|Carlow College]] and then trained as a [[civil engineering|civil engineer]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].&lt;ref name="adbonline.anu.edu.au"&gt;http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050059b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the Lalor brothers migrated to America and fought on both sides of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. However, Peter and his brother Richard decided to go to Australia, arriving in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in October 1852. Lalor worked first in the construction of the [[Melbourne]]&amp;ndash;[[Geelong]] railway line, but resigned to take part in the [[Victorian Gold Rush]]. He began mining in the [[Ovens River|Ovens Valley]], then moved to the [[Eureka, Victoria|Eureka Lead]] at [[Ballarat]] where he befriended [[Duncan Gillies]] (who later became Premier of Victoria). His brother Richard returned to Ireland, becoming politically active and himself a member of the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lalor-peter-3980/ Biography of Peter Lalor] at Australian Dictionary of Biography.

==Events leading to the Eureka Stockade==
The agitation against the goldfields licences (which were 30 shillings each) began at [[Bendigo]] in 1853, and was quickly taken up at Ballarat, and a [[Ballarat Reform League|Reform League]] was formed amongst the diggers on the various goldfields for the redress of grievances. In October 1854, the Government ordered the police to go out hunting for unlicensed diggers two times a week.

In the later half of 1854 a digger named [[James Scobie]] was killed in a scuffle at the Eureka Hotel, on Specimen Hill; Bentley who was the publican, was considered by the diggers to have participated in the murder. He and others were charged with the murder and arrested, but with the police court, they were discharged.

A indignation meeting was held at Ballarat on 17 October, close to the spot where Scobie was killed. At this meeting a committee was appointed, of which Peter Lalor was one. The authorities, fearing that the meeting might lead to an attack on Bentley's hotel, sent police to act as a guard over it. A youth threw a stone at the lamp in front of the building, breaking the glass. That act of violence, was the spark. With cries of "Down with the house" and "Burn it.", the angry mob stormed the hotel and set fire to it. Three people were arrested, and charged with act of incendiarism, and were committed and imprisoned.

A mass meeting was held on [[Bakery Hill, Victoria|Bakery Hill]] on 11 November 1854, to demand the release of the alleged incendiaries. It also passed resolutions affirming the right of the people to full representation, manhood suffrage, the abolition of the property qualification for members, payment of members, short Parliaments, and the abolition of the [[Gold Commissioner|Gold Commission]] and the diggers' licenses. Bentley, in the meantime, had been re-arrested on the advice of the Attorney-General [[William Stawell]] for the murder of Scobie, and convicted. He was sentenced to three years on the roads.

On 29 November a meeting of about 12,000  men was held at Ballarat. This is said to be the first public meeting that Mr. Lalor addressed. He moved one of the resolutions submitted and passed. It called for a meeting of the Reform League for the following Sunday to elect a central committee. The "insurgent flag " was hoisted on the platform. It represented the Southern Cross constellation. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting declared the license fee to be an unjustifiable imposition. A bonfire was soon kindled and the licences burnt. At this meeting, the rebellion was formally inaugurated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6221425 |title=DEATH OF MR. LALOR, M.L.A. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=11 February 1889 |accessdate=10 February 2012 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eureka Stockade==

Lalor led the miners' opposition against the incompetent and often brutal administration of the goldfields, and was elected to lead the men in the armed uprising after the meeting on Bakery Hill. The diggers formed a barricade, where they were attacked by troops and police on 3 December. Lalor was seriously wounded in the left arm, resulting in its amputation. A warrant for Lalor's arrest on charges of sedition was initially sought, but he was taken from Ballarat and hidden by his supporters in the Young Queen Hotel at [[South Geelong, Victoria|South Geelong]]. The warrant was withdrawn in June 1855 after juries had found 13 other ringleaders not guilty of sedition.

As a result of the uprising a number of the miners' complaints were resolved. Legislation was passed to give miners the right to vote. A new form of licensing of Miners Rights costing £1 per year was introduced.
The monthly gold tax was abolished. A general amnesty for the three miners arrested after the Bentley's Eureka Hotel fire and the 114 arrested at the Eureka Stockade was proclaimed.

===Lalor's escape===
&lt;blockquote&gt;While the victors of Eureka were removing them alive from the stockade, Peter Lalor, the diggers' leader, lay under the pile of slabs in which he had been hidden, bleeding from the wound in his arm. A musket ball had shattered the bone close to the shoulder, and the few who knew where he was lying saw the blood trickling from beneath the pile of slabs even while the soldiers, keen to capture him, were still in the stockade.he was angry. When the last of them had gone, Lalor was helped from his hiding place, put upon a white horse, and rode away through the bush towards Warrenheip. There he claimed shelter at the hut of a man he knew. The digger was absent, and his wife went to look for him. Lalor, however, doubted her genuineness, and believing that she had gone to communicate with the police, he took to the bush again for shelter. All that night he wandered about, with his crushed arm still swinging useless and unattended. He was greatly weakened from loss of blood, and only his indomitable pluck kept him up. Towards morning he determined to seek assistance from Stephen Cummins, an old friend whom he could trust, and who lived with his wife on Pennyweight Hill.

It was on the early morning of the Monday following the fight that Mrs. Cummins drew her husband's attention to a man walking slowly between the holes on the flat, and said, "That is Peter Lalor; I feel sure of it". "As I ran down to help him", Steve Cummins told a friend, "his face was grey and worried. He looked like a frail old man rather than a powerful young one, so greatly had pain and loss of blood during the 24 hours weakened him. I helped him into the hut, where as well as we could, my wife and I bandaged the wounded arm. I knew that my hut was no place for him. A reward of £200 had been offered for his arrest, and there were many mean spirits keen to earn it. Our friendship was well known, and I felt sure that sooner or later my place would be searched by the police. I ran at once across the gully to the Roman Catholic Presbytery and told Father Smyth that Lalor was in my tent badly wounded and in need of surgical assistance. I told him my fears as to the police visiting us, and Father Smyth said, 'He will be safer here, I think. Bring him over after dark.' So that night we took him across to the presbytery, meeting, fortunately, not a soul upon the road." Steve Cummins's intuition had served him  well, for next night the police searched his hut, just at the time when he was watching Drs. Doyle and Stewart amputating Peter Lalor's arm, for the severity of the wound and the delay in treating it precluded any possibility of the arm being saved. Through the ordeal of amputation, as in every other emergency of life, he showed that fine courage which nothing could shake!

A man employed about the Presbytery took the severed arm away as soon as the operation was over, and threw it down an abandoned shaft, but by Father Smyth's orders it was recovered later and properly buried. The first operation was not complete. A portion of the bullet remained lodged in the stump of the arm, and it was only after a second operation at Geelong that the wound healed properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9523184 |title=GOLD-SEEKERS OF THE FIFTIES. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=1 July 1899 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:lalor.jpg|thumb]]
Due to the political changes caused by the [[Eureka Stockade]],  Lalor was elected to the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] in November 1855 as Member for the new [[Electoral district of Ballaarat|district of Ballaarat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |year=1855

&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in this role until March 1856.&lt;ref name=pov-pl&gt;{{cite web|title=Re-Member (Former Members): Lalor, Peter|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/re-member/bioregfull.cfm?mid=499|work=[[Parliament of Victoria]] official site|publisher=Parliament of Victoria|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated133"&gt;"Lucky City: The First Generation at Ballarat 1851–1901" page 133, (Weston Bate, Melbourne University Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1856, under the new, more democratic constitution (featuring near-universal white male suffrage) Lalor was elected unopposed to the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of North Grenville|North Grenville]] (Ballarat West). As he was the Eureka hero his policies were not scrutinised at all before the election and his later voting record as a parliamentarian shows he once opposed a bill to introduce full white male suffrage in the colony of Victoria.&lt;ref name=pov-pl /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated133"/&gt;

During a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, "I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Communism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71303452 |title=Ballarat Revisited. |newspaper=[[The Worker (Brisbane)|The Worker]] |location=Brisbane |date=10 March 1936 |accessdate=10 February 2012 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weston Bate wrote that the role of landowner and company director seemed to suit him more than that of rebel, and that Peter Lalor "disgraced himself in democratic eyes" by trying to use Chinese as strike-breakers at the Clunes mine, of which he was a director. Some argue that he was ruthless in using low-paid Chinese workers to get rid of Australians seeking better and safer working conditions. In parliament he supported a repressive land Bill in 1857 which favoured the rich. There were 17,745 Ballarat signatures to a petition against Lalor's land Bill.&lt;ref&gt;"Lucky City: The First Generation at Ballarat 1851–1901" page 134, (Weston Bate, Melbourne University Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Withers and others were puzzled and hurt that the folk hero should prove to be a better fighter for money and political position than for the people's rights. Like many young radicals he undoubtedly became more conservative in later life. However, he was consistent in being a risk-taker and, in his later business career, undoubtedly suffered lows as well as highs, at one point narrowly avoiding having to declare bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Les Blake, Peter Lalor, the man from Eureka (Nepturne Press 1979) p136&lt;/ref&gt;  Lalor held North Grenville until August 1859, but never represented Ballarat again, and in the October 1859 election he stood for and won [[Electoral district of South Grant|South Grant]] in the Legislative Assembly instead.&lt;ref name=pov-pl /&gt;

Lalor held South Grant for over eleven years after this point, finally losing it in January 1871. In 1871 he also contested but lost the seat of [[Electoral district of North Melbourne|North Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=pov-pl/&gt; In May 1874 he was re-elected to South Grant, holding it until April 1877, then taking the Legislative Assembly seat of Grant in May 1877, which he would hold for another almost twelve years until his death in February 1889.&lt;ref name=pov-pl /&gt;

Lalor's key political postings were as Commissioner Trade &amp; Customs and [[Postmaster-General of Victoria]] from August to October 1875, then Commissioner Trade &amp; Customs from May 1877 until March 1880, as well as postmaster-general again from May to July 1877. Lalor also served as chairman of committees in the period from 1859 to 1868.&lt;ref name=pov-pl /&gt;

As successor to [[Charles Gavan Duffy|Sir Charles Gavan Duffy]], his most effective political post was probably that of [[Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly|Speaker]], a post he held from 1880 until 1887 when illness forced his retirement; he was awarded a pension of £4,000 by parliament.

== Later life and Death ==

[[File:Lalor house richmond victoria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lalor House, Joseph Lalor's medical rooms &amp; home in Richmond, is where Peter Lalor spent his later years until his death.]]

Lalor married Alicia Dunne on 10 July 1855 in [[Geelong]]. Their daughter, Anne (Annie), was born in [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]] in 1856; their son Joseph was born at Sandridge (now called [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Port Melbourne]]) on 18 December 1857. Annie Lalor married Thomas Lempriere in 1882, but died three years later of pulmonary [[Tuberculosis|phthisis]]. Joseph Lalor became a medical doctor, marrying Agnes McCormick of [[Dublin]], Ireland and leaving descendants.

Alicia Lalor died on 17 May 1887 at the age of 55 years. Following her death, Peter Lalor took leave from Parliament and visited [[San Francisco, California]].

Lalor died on Saturday, 9 February 1889 at age 62 at his son's home in Richmond and was buried at the [[Melbourne General Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article219371070 |title=Death of the Hon.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Peter lalor statue ballarat.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Peter Lalor in Ballarat's [[Sturt Street Gardens]].]]
A statue of Peter Lalor was erected at Sturt Street in Ballarat in 1893.  It was presented to the municipality by a friend of Lalor's, James Oddie, who was also first Chairman of the city, and was unveiled by another friend, the Premier, the Hon. [[Duncan Gillies]].

The Melbourne suburb of [[Lalor, Victoria]], was named after him in 1945. The suburb was originally pronounced "LAW-luh", after Peter Lalor, and although many people still pronounce it as such, in recent times the pronunciation "LAY-lor" has become predominant.

A federal electorate in the south-western suburbs of Melbourne, the [[Division of Lalor]], was named after him in 1948. It has been held successively by senior Labor figures [[Reg Pollard]], [[Jim Cairns]], [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]] and [[Julia Gillard]]. The suburb of Lalor is not in the electorate, which is pronounced "LAW-luh".

Lalor Street in [[Ballarat East]] was also named in his honour.

The [[University of Ballarat]] (now known as [[Federation University Australia]]) honoured him by naming one of the two Mt Helen campus' [[Dormitory|Halls of Residence]] after him (the other being named after [[Bella Guerin]], the first woman to graduate from an Australian university).

Portrayals of Lalor's role in the Eureka Rebellion appear in film.&lt;br&gt;
The first film to have Lalor appear in is supposed to be ''[[Eureka Stockade (1907 film)]]'', but only a seven-minute fragment thereof has survived. In 1915, Lalor was portrayed by Leslie Victor in the silent film [[The Loyal Rebel]] – this film is also considered [[Lost film|lost]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356838/?ref_=fn_al_tt_5/ ''The Loyal Rebel'' at IMDb] &lt;sub&gt;Retrieved 9 April 2013&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Next, he was played by [[Chips Rafferty]] in the 1949 British film ''[[Eureka Stockade (1949 film)|Eureka Stockade]]'' (released in United States of America under the title, ''Massacre Hill''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041340/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1/ ''Eureka Stockade (1949)'' at IMDb] &lt;sub&gt;Retrieved 9 April 2013&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;)  He was played by Australian actor [[Bryan Brown]] in ''Eureka Stockade'', a two-part television mini-series which aired on the Seven Network in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Eureka%20Stockade%20Media%3A%22FILM%22%20|%20Media%3A%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;rec=6;resCount=10/ ''Eureka Stockade (1984)'' at National Film &amp; Sound Archive]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} &lt;sub&gt;Retrieved 9 April 2013&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The last film to date to picture Lalor was the Australian documentary ''Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854'' from 2006, with Lalor played by Andrew Larkins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parham-media.com/docos/riotorr/ror_notes.htm/ ''Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854'' notes and credits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906051907/http://www.parham-media.com/docos/riotorr/ror_notes.htm/ |date=6 September 2014 }} at parham-media-com &lt;sub&gt;Retrieved 9 April 2013&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979937/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4/ ''Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854'' at IMDb] &lt;sub&gt;Retrieved 9 April 2013&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For further information about the various films depicting Peter Lalor, see: [[Eureka Rebellion#Film and television]].

Lalor has also been depicted in the commemorative [[Son et lumière (show)|Son et lumière]] "Blood Under the Southern Cross" at [[Sovereign Hill]] since 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sovereignhill.com.au/sound-light-show/ |title=Sovereign Hill Sound and Light Show |publisher=Sovereignhill.com.au |accessdate=29 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213180431/http://www.sovereignhill.com.au/sound-light-show/ |archive-date=13 December 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A caricature bollard by artist [[Jan Mitchell]] depicting Peter Lalor holding the Eureka flag was erected on the Geelong foreshore in 1999 as part of the [[Waterfront Geelong]] bollard walk.

His portrait is featured on two commemorative postage stamps, a 38c Ireland stamp released on 3 May 2001 in the "Rebel Spirit, Irish Heritage of Australia" series and a 2004 [[AUD]]2.45 Australian stamp commemorating the Eureka Stockade.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3096">Piazzolla’s Orquesta Típica (aka the 1946 Orchestra) was a [[tango music|tango]] orchestra formed in 1946 in [[Buenos Aires]] by the [[Argentine]] [[bandoneon]] player [[Astor Piazzolla]].  This was Piazzolla’s first orchestra of his own and from this spring board he would later go on to pioneer ''[[nuevo tango]]'', a new approach to the genre, with his [[Octeto Buenos Aires]].

Early in his career Piazzolla  played in a number of [[orquesta típica]]s, including that of the renowned bandoneonist [[Aníbal Troilo]] from 1939.  During this period he began to study classical orchestration with [[Alberto Ginastera]], the eminent Argentine composer, and took piano lessons with the Argentine classical pianist Raúl Spivak.  Piazzolla combined this with a gruelling performing schedule in the tango clubs at night and between 1944 and 1946 he went on to lead the orchestra of the tango singer and bandoneonist [[Francisco Fiorentino]].

Feeling restricted by the limitations of traditional tango, Piazzolla formed his ''Orquesta Típica'' in 1946 and began to experiment with a new approach to the orchestration and musical content of tango. A number of formations for the orchestra were tried including: Astor Piazzolla, [[Roberto Di Filippo]], [[Angel Genta]], and [[Fernando Tell]] (bandoneon); [[Hugo Baralis]], [[Cacho Gianni]], [[Juan Bibiloni]], and [[F. Lucero]] (violin); Atilio Stampone (piano), [[Angel Molo]] (cello) and Pepe Diaz (double bass).

Over the next two years, Piazzolla recorded 30 pieces with this orchestra, mostly new arrangements of traditional tangos such as ''Taconeando'', ''Inspiración'', ''Tierra querida'', ''La rayuela'' and ''El recodo'', but also a number of his own compositions, including  ''El disbande'' (his first formal composition), ''Pigmalion'', ''Villeguita'', and ''Se armo''.  His works would quickly become classics in the repertoire of some of the most popular tango orchestras of the day,  including those of Anibal Troilo,  [[Osvaldo Fresedo]] and [[Jose Basso]].

The young Piazzolla’s music established itself as a distinct and contemporary sound which began to provoke comment amongst traditional ''[[tanguero]]''s .  By 1950 he felt the need to disband the orchestra and to try something different, not even convinced at this stage in his life that he should make his career in tango.   He concentrated now on the study of classical music, including a year in [[Paris]] with the  French classical composition teacher [[Nadia Boulanger]], before returning to Buenos Aires where he would finally commit himself to tango with the founding of his next ensemble, [[Octeto Buenos Aires]], in 1955.  This would put him in the vanguard of ''nuevo tango'' and lead him into a head-on collision with the tango music establishment.

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2016 Birthday Honours]] for services to music and charity.&lt;ref name="knighted"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61608 |supp=y|page=B2|date=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his distinctive raspy singing voice, Stewart came to prominence in the late 1960s and the early 1970s with [[The Jeff Beck Group]], and then with [[Faces (band)|Faces]], though his music career had begun in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In October 1963, he joined [[Jimmy Powell (singer)|The Dimensions]] as a harmonica player and part-time vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined [[Long John Baldry]] and the [[All-Stars (band)|All Stars]], and in August, Stewart signed a solo contract, releasing his first single, "[[Good Morning Little Schoolgirl]]", in October. He maintained a solo career alongside a group career, releasing his debut solo album, ''[[An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down]]'' in 1969. Stewart's early albums were a fusion of rock, [[folk music]], [[soul music]], and [[R&amp;B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1564|pure_url=yes}}|title=Truth: Review|author=Eder, Bruce|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4218|pure_url=yes}}|title=Faces: Biography|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=1 May 2009|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1970s through the 1990s, Stewart's music often took on a [[New wave music|new wave]] or [[soft rock]]/[[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road]] quality, and in the early 2000s, he released a series of successful albums interpreting the [[Great American Songbook]]. In 1994, Stewart staged the largest free rock concert in history when he performed in front of 3.5 million people in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name="rio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02fdmlq|title=BBC World Service – Witness, The Biggest Rock Concert Ever|work=BBC|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine ranked him the 17th most successful artist on the "Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-artists-20.shtml|title=Billboard Hot 100 Chart 50th Anniversary|work=Billboard|accessdate=1 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929181345/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-artists-20.shtml|archivedate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] and [[Brit Award]] recipient, he was voted at #33 in ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''{{'}}s list of the Top 100 Greatest Singers of all time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage3.htm|title=The Music That Changed The World Q Magazine – 3 Special Editions Jan, Feb, March 2004|publisher=Rocklistmusic.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #59 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' 100 Greatest Singers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/rod-stewart-20101202|title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time: Rod Stewart|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a solo artist, Stewart was inducted into the US [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994, the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2006, and was inducted a second time into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Faces.&lt;ref name="soloinduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/rod-stewart|title=Rod Stewart: Inducted in 1994 – The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=Rockhall.com|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="facesinduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rod-stewart-ill-definitely-make-myself-available-for-a-faces-reunion-20111207|title=Rod Stewart: 'I'll Definitely Make Myself Available' for a Faces Reunion|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Roderick David Stewart was born at 507 Archway Road, [[Highgate, London|Highgate, North London]] on 10 January 1945, the youngest of five children of Robert Joseph Stewart (26 December 1904&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;1939 England and Wales Register&lt;/ref&gt;–1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Robert-Stewart/6000000010641917439|title=Robert Joseph Stewart|publisher=Geni}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elsie Rebecca Gilbart (14 December 1905&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;–1996).&lt;ref name="nb-53"&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Elsie-Stewart/6000000010641904390|title=Elsie Rebecca Stewart|publisher=Geni}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Scottish and had been a master builder in [[Leith]], Edinburgh, while Elsie was English and had grown up in [[Upper Holloway]] in North London. Married in 1928, the couple had two sons and two daughters while living in Scotland, and then they moved to Highgate. Stewart came after an eight-year gap following his youngest sibling; he was born at home during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="nb-53"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eh-2-3"&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group="nb"|For many years it was said that Stewart had been born a half-hour after a German [[V-2]] missile warhead fell on the local Highgate police station.&lt;ref name="eh-2-3"/&gt;

In his 2012 autobiography, Stewart said that was "just one of those legends, fables, and downright lies told in the name of publicity" and that the V-2 hit and his birth were separated by some weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, ''Rod: The Autobiography'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a deadly V-2 strike very near the southern end of the Archway Road on 5 November 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londonist.com/2009/01/london_v2_rocket_sitesmapped.php|title=London V2 Rocket Site ...

The family was mostly focused on [[Association football|football]];&lt;ref name="nb-54"/&gt; Stewart's father had played in a local amateur team and managed some teams as well, and one of Stewart's earliest memories was of the pictures of Scottish players such as [[George Young (Scottish footballer)|George Young]] and [[Gordon Smith (footballer born 1924)|Gordon Smith]] that his brothers had on the wall.&lt;ref name="eh-4-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cby-374"/&gt; Stewart was the most talented footballer in the family and was a supporter of [[Arsenal F.C.]] at the time.&lt;ref name="eh-4-5"&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rs-2004-int"/&gt; Combining natural athleticism with near-reckless aggression, he became captain of the school football team and played for Middlesex Schoolboys as [[centre-half]].&lt;ref name="eh-4-5"/&gt;

The family were also great fans of the singer [[Al Jolson]] and would sing and play his hits.&lt;ref name="nb-54"&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rs-timegoes"/&gt; Stewart collected his records and saw his films, read books about him, and was influenced by his performing style and attitude towards his audience.&lt;ref name="nb-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cby-374"&gt;Moritz (ed.), ''Current Year Biography 1979'', p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gray4-5"/&gt; His introduction to rock and roll was hearing [[Little Richard]]'s 1956 hit "[[The Girl Can't Help It (song)|The Girl Can't Help It]]", and seeing [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]] in concert.&lt;ref name="rs-timegoes"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Austin|last=Scaggs|authorlink=Austin Scaggs|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rodstewart/articles/story/5936449/as_time_goes_by|title=As Time Goes By: Rod Stewart|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=7 October 2003|accessdate=10 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910044727/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rodstewart/articles/story/5936449/as_time_goes_by|archivedate=10 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father bought him a guitar in January 1959; the first song he learned was the folk tune "It Takes a Worried Man to Sing a Worried Song"; the first record he bought was [[Eddie Cochran]]'s "[[C'mon Everybody]]".&lt;ref name="eh-9-10"/&gt; In 1960, he joined a [[skiffle]] group with schoolfriends called the Kool Kats, playing [[Lonnie Donegan]] and [[Chas McDevitt]] hits.&lt;ref name="eh-9-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gray4-5"&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart left school at age 15&lt;ref name="eh-10-11"&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; and worked briefly as a [[screen printing|silk screen printer]].&lt;ref name="gray4-5"/&gt; Spurred on by his father, his ambition was to become a professional [[association football|footballer]].&lt;ref name="rs-2004-int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eh-10-11"/&gt; In summer 1960, he went for trials at [[Brentford F.C.]],&lt;ref name="auto-19"&gt;Stewart, ''Rod: The Autobiography'', pp. 16–19.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] club at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brentfordfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10421,00.html |title=Brentford FC: History |publisher=[[Brentford F.C.]] |accessdate=4 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217112853/http://www.brentfordfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10421%2C00.html |archivedate=17 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to some longstanding accounts, Stewart states in his 2012 autobiography that he was never signed to the club and that the club never called him back after his trials.{{refn|group="nb"|Over the years, considerable backstory has accumulated about Stewart's involvement with Brentford F.C. It was said that he joined on as an apprentice with them,&lt;ref name="eh-10-11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mojo95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC04"/&gt; but disliked the early morning travel to [[London#West London|West London]] and the daily assignment to clean the [[first team]]'s [[Football boot|boots]]. His playing effectiveness at [[centre-half]] was supposedly hindered by his slight build – {{convert|5|ft|11|in}} but only {{convert|9|st}} – and he pushed himself so much that he sometimes vomited at the side of the [[Association football pitch|pitch]].&lt;ref name="eh-10-11"/&gt;

One biography claimed he was there for two months including pre-season fixtures, that he left the team to the great disappointment of his father, and that he later reflected, "I had the skill but not the enthusiasm."&lt;ref name="eh-10-11"/&gt; Another biography gave an undated Stewart quote saying he was there for three weeks, paid £8 per seven-day week, but never played in any form.&lt;ref name="nb-54"/&gt; In a 2004 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Stewart said he went three or four times a week and did play.&lt;ref name="rs-2004-int"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rodstewart/articles/story/6055929/football_and_fancy_free|title=Football and Fancy Free|last=Crandall|first=Bill|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=19 May 2004|accessdate=4 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315140449/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rodstewart/articles/story/6055929/football_and_fancy_free|archivedate=15 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Brentford Deputy President Eric White was quoted as saying, "He trained with us for a week or two, and he may even have kicked a ball around with the juniors, but there is no record of Rod Stewart ever having signed to Brentford. Unfortunately, nobody at the club remembers his time here."&lt;ref name="mojo95"/&gt; In his 2012 autobiography, Stewart attributes all of this to a tale that took on its own life, partly and deliberately helped by statements he made in interviews, such as to talk show host [[Michael Parkinson]].&lt;ref name="auto-19"/&gt;}} In any case, regarding possible career options, Stewart concluded, "Well, a musician's life is a lot easier and I can also get drunk and make music, and I can't do that and play football. I plumped for music ... They're the only two things I can do actually: play football and sing."&lt;ref name="nb-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eh-10-11"/&gt;

==Music career==
===1961–1963: Early work and The Dimensions===

Stewart became attracted to [[beatnik]] attitudes and [[left-wing politics]], living for a while in a beatnik houseboat at [[Shoreham-by-Sea]].&lt;ref name="eh-14-16"/&gt; He was an active supporter of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] at this time, joining the annual [[Aldermaston Marches]] from 1961 to 1963 and being arrested on three occasions when he took part in sit-ins at [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Whitehall]] for the cause.&lt;ref name="gray4-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eh-14-16"/&gt; He also used the marches as a way to meet and bed girls.&lt;ref name="eh-14-16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 he had his first serious relationship, with London art student Suzannah Boffey (a friend of future model and actress [[Chrissie Shrimpton]]); he moved to a [[bed-sit]] in [[Muswell Hill]] to be near her.&lt;ref name="eh-17-19"&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; She became pregnant, but neither Rod nor his family wanted him to enter marriage; the baby girl was given up for adoption and Rod's and Suzannah's relationship ended.&lt;ref name="eh-17-19"/&gt;

In 1962, Stewart began hanging around folk singer [[Wizz Jones]], [[busking]] at [[Leicester Square]] and other London spots.&lt;ref name="eh-24-28"&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart took up playing the then-fashionable harmonica.&lt;ref name="nb-58"/&gt; On several trips over the next 18 months Jones and Stewart took their act to [[Brighton]] and then to Paris, sleeping under bridges over the [[River Seine]], and then finally to [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name="eh-24-28"/&gt; Finally this resulted in Stewart being rounded up and deported from Spain for [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] during 1963.&lt;ref name="BBC04"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3964169.stm|title=Enduring career of Rod the Mod|publisher=BBC News|date= 29 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eh-24-28"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pareles|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Pareles|author2=Romanowski, Patricia|title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll|publisher=[[Rolling Stone Press]]/[[Summit Books]]|year=1983|isbn=0-671-43457-8|page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Stewart, who had been at William Grimshaw School with three of their members, was briefly considered as singer for the embryonic [[The Kinks|Kinks]].&lt;ref name="eh-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cby-375"/&gt;&lt;ref name="allday"&gt;Hinman, ''The Kinks – All Day and All of the Night'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="notlike"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RICQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|author= Thomas M.

After returning to London, Stewart joined a rhythm and blues group, the Dimensions, in October 1963 as a harmonica player and part-time vocalist.&lt;ref name="mojo95"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.willbirch.com/Rod%20Stewart%20-%20The%20Graveyard%20Shift.htm|title=Rod Stewart – The Graveyard Shift|author=Birch, Will|magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]|date=May 1995|accessdate=4 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515012107/http://www.willbirch.com/Rod%20Stewart%20-%20The%20Graveyard%20Shift.htm|archivedate=15 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray-7"/&gt; It was his first professional job as a musician, although Stewart was still living at home and working in his brother's painting and picture frame shop.&lt;ref name="eh-29-32"&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rs-intv-70"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rolling Stone Interviews: 1967–1980|first=Peter|last=Herbst|authorlink=Peter Herbst|edition=reissued|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishing]]|year=1989|isbn=0-312-03486-5|pages=118–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A somewhat more established singer from Birmingham, Jimmy Powell, then hired the group a few weeks later, and it became known as [[Jimmy Powell (singer)|Jimmy Powell &amp; the Five Dimensions]], with Stewart being relegated to harmonica player.&lt;ref name="mojo95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray-7"&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The group performed weekly at the famed [[Studio 51]] club on Great Newport Street in London, where [[The Rolling Stones]] often headlined;&lt;ref name="Gray-7"/&gt; this was Stewart's entrée into the thriving London R &amp; B scene,&lt;ref name="rshist-377"/&gt; and his harmonica playing improved in part from watching [[Mick Jagger]] on stage.&lt;ref name="nb-58"&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations soon broke down between Powell and Stewart over roles within the group&lt;ref name="eh-29-32"/&gt; and Stewart departed. Contrary to popular legend, during this time Stewart likely did not play harmonica on [[Millie (singer)|Millie Small]]'s 1964 hit "[[My Boy Lollipop]]".

Turning down Decca's recommended material as too commercial, Stewart insisted that the experienced session musicians he was given, including [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], learn a couple of [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]] songs he had just heard.&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, ''The Rod Stewart Story'', as quoted extensively in Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting single, "[[Good Morning Little Schoolgirl]]", was recorded released in October 1964; despite Stewart performing it on the popular television show ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'', it failed to enter the charts. Also in October Stewart left the Hoochie Coochie Men after having a row with Baldry.&lt;ref name="Gray-10"/&gt;

Stewart played some dates on his own in late 1964 and early 1965, sometimes backed by the [[Southampton]] R &amp; B outfit The Soul Agents.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoochie Coochie Men broke up, Baldry and Stewart patched up their differences (and indeed became lifelong friends),&lt;ref name="eh-41"&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and legendary impresario [[Giorgio Gomelsky]] put together [[Steampacket]], which featured Baldry, Stewart, [[Brian Auger]], [[Julie Driscoll]], [[Micky Waller]], [[Vic Briggs]] and [[Ricky Fenson]]; their first appearance was in support of The Rolling Stones in July 1965.&lt;ref name="Gray-14"&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was conceived as a white soul revue, analogous to [[The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue]], with multiple vocalists and styles ranging from jazz to R &amp; B to blues.&lt;ref name="nb-61"&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Steampacket toured with the Stones and [[The Walker Brothers]] that summer, ending in the [[London Palladium]];&lt;ref name="nb-61"/&gt; seeing the audience react to the Stones gave Stewart his first exposure to crowd hysteria.&lt;ref&gt;Pidgeon, ''Rod Stewart and the Changing Faces'', as quoted in Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart, who had been included in the group upon Baldry's insistence, ended up with most of the male vocal parts.&lt;ref name="nb-61"/&gt; Steampacket was unable to enter the studio to record any material due to its members all belonging to different labels and managers,&lt;ref name="nb-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amg-steam"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p20741|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Steampacket: Biography|publisher=AllMusic|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|authorlink=Richie Unterberger|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Gomelsky did record one of their Marquee Club rehearsals.{{refn|group="nb"|These later surfaced in 1971 as part of Gomelsky's ''Rock Generation'' releases on [[BYG Records]]; the poorly recorded material has been repackaged as ''Rod Stewart and Steampacket'' many times since.&lt;ref name="nb-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amg-steam"/&gt;}}

Stewart's "Rod the Mod" image gained wider visibility in November 1965, when he was the subject of a 30-minute [[Associated-Rediffusion|Rediffusion, London]] television documentary titled "An Easter with Rod" that portrayed the Mod scene.&lt;ref name="BBC04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray-15-17"&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt; His parallel solo career attempts continued on [[EMI]]'s [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia label]] with the November 1965 release of "The Day Will Come", a more heavily arranged pop attempt, and the April 1966 release of his take on [[Sam Cooke]]'s "[[Shake (Sam Cooke song)|Shake]]", with the [[Brian Auger Trinity]].&lt;ref name="Gray-15-17"/&gt; Both failed commercially and neither gained positive notices.&lt;ref&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart had spent the better part of two years listening mostly to Cooke; he later said, "I didn't sound like anybody at all ... but I knew I sounded a bit like Sam Cooke, so I listened to Sam Cooke."&lt;ref name="rs-intv-70"/&gt; This recording solidified that singer's position as Stewart's idol and most enduring influence; he called it a "crossing of the water."&lt;ref name="cby-375"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rs-intv-70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nb-61"/&gt;

Stewart departed from Steampacket in March 1966,&lt;ref name="Gray-15-17"/&gt; with Stewart saying he had been sacked and Auger saying he had quit.&lt;ref name="nb-61"/&gt; Stewart then joined a somewhat similar outfit, [[Shotgun Express]], in May 1966 as co-lead vocalist with [[Beryl Marsden]].&lt;ref name="nb-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray-15-17"/&gt; The other members included [[Mick Fleetwood]] and [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] (who would go on to form [[Fleetwood Mac]]), and [[Peter Bardens]].&lt;ref name="Gray-15-17"/&gt; Shotgun Express released one unsuccessful single in October 1966, the orchestra-heavy "I Could Feel The Whole World Turn Round", before disbanding.&lt;ref name="nb-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray-15-17"/&gt; Stewart later disparaged Shotgun Express as a poor imitation of Steampacket, and said "I was still getting this terrible feeling of doing other people's music. I think you can only start finding yourself when you write your own material."&lt;ref name="Gray-15-17"/&gt; By now, Stewart had bounced around without achieving much success, with little to distinguish himself among other aspiring London singers other than the emerging rasp in his voice.&lt;ref name="rshist-377"/&gt;

===1967–69: Jeff Beck Group period===
Guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] recruited Stewart for his new post-[[the Yardbirds|Yardbirds]] venture,&lt;ref name="carson-71"&gt;Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 1967, Stewart joined [[the Jeff Beck Group]] as vocalist and sometime songwriter.&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt; This would become the big break of his early career.&lt;ref name="cby-375"/&gt; There he first played with [[Ronnie Wood]]&lt;ref name="nb-61"/&gt; whom he had first met in a London pub in 1964;&lt;ref name="Gray-10"/&gt; the two soon became fast friends.&lt;ref name="carson-71"/&gt; During its first year, the group experienced frequent changes of drummers and conflicts involving manager [[Mickie Most]] wanting to reduce Stewart's role; they toured the UK, and released a couple of singles that featured Stewart on their B-sides.&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carson-78"&gt;Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', pp. 75, 78, 83–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart's sputtering solo career also continued, with the March 1968 release of non-hit "Little Miss Understood" on [[Immediate Records]].&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"/&gt;

The Jeff Beck Group toured Western Europe in spring 1968, recorded, and were nearly destitute; then assistant manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] booked them on a six-week tour of the United States starting in June 1968 with the [[Fillmore East]] in New York.&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt061568"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carson-81"&gt;Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart, on his first trip to America, suffered terrible stage fright during the opening show and hid behind the amplifier banks while singing; only a quick shot of [[brandy]] brought him out front.&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"/&gt; Nevertheless, the show and the tour were a big success,&lt;ref name="cby-375"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carson-81"/&gt; with [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] of ''The New York Times'' calling the group exciting and praising "the interaction of Mr. Beck's wild and visionary guitar against the hoarse and insistent shouting of Rod Stewart,"&lt;ref name="nyt061568"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40711FD38541B7B93C7A8178DD85F4C8685F9|title=Jeff Beck Group Cheered in Debut|first=Robert|last=Shelton|authorlink=Robert Shelton (critic)|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 June 1968|page=38|format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New Musical Express]]'' reporting that the group was receiving standing ovations and pulling receipts equal to those of [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Doors]].&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"/&gt;

In August 1968, their first album ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' was released; by October it had risen to number 15 on the [[Billboard 200|US albums chart]] but failed to chart in the UK.&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"/&gt; The album featured Beck's masterly guitar technique and manipulated sounds as Stewart's dramatic vocalising tackled the group's varied repertoire of blues, folk, rock, and proto-[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].&lt;ref name="rshist-377"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carson-78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amg-truth"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1564|pure_url=yes}}|title=Truth: Review|first=Bruce|last=Eder|authorlink=Bruce Eder|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart also co-wrote three of the songs,&lt;ref name="amg-truth"/&gt; and credited the record for helping to develop his vocal abilities and the sandpaper quality in his voice.&lt;ref name="rs-intv-70"/&gt; The group toured America again at the end of the year to a very strong reception, then suffered from more personnel upheaval&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; (something that would continue throughout Beck's career). In July 1969, Stewart left, following his friend Wood's departure.&lt;ref name="rs-intv-70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray-22"&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart later recalled: "It was a great band to sing with but I couldn't take all the aggravation and unfriendliness that developed.... In the two and a half years I was with Beck I never once looked him in the eye – I always looked at his shirt or something like that."&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"/&gt;

The group's second album, ''[[Beck-Ola]]'', was released in June 1969 in the US and September 1969 in the UK, bracketing the time the group was dissolving; it also made number 15 in the US albums chart and placed to number 39 in the [[UK albums chart]].&lt;ref name="cby-375"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray-22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1566|pure_url=yes}}|title=Beck-Ola: Review|first=William|last=Ruhlmann|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with the group, Stewart initially felt overmatched by Beck's presence, and his style was still developing; but later Stewart felt the two developed a strong musical, if not personal, rapport.&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Rolling Stone Record Guide'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Stewart's sense of phrasing was developed during his time with the Jeff Beck Group.&lt;ref name="rs-intv-70"/&gt; Beck sought to form a new [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] with [[Carmine Appice]] and [[Tim Bogert]] (of the similarly just-breaking-up [[Vanilla Fudge]]) joining him and Stewart, but Stewart had other plans.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', pp. 74, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1969–75: Solo career established and Faces albums===
[[Mercury Records]] [[A&amp;R]] man [[Lou Reizner]] had seen Stewart perform with Beck, and on 8 October 1968 signed him to a solo contract;&lt;ref name="Gray-18-21"/&gt; but contractual complexities delayed Stewart's recording for him until July 1969.&lt;ref name="Gray-22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', pp. 96–97, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in May 1969, guitarist and singer [[Steve Marriott]] left English band [[The Small Faces]].&lt;ref name="Gray-22"/&gt; Ron Wood was announced as the replacement guitarist in June and on 18 October 1969, Stewart followed his friend and was announced as their new singer.&lt;ref name="Gray-22"/&gt; The two joined existing members [[Ronnie Lane]], [[Ian McLagan]], and [[Kenney Jones]], who soon decided to call the new line-up [[Faces (band)|Faces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/06/arts/ronnie-lane-51-the-founder-of-small-faces-a-british-band.html|title=Ronnie Lane, the Founder Of Small Faces, a British Band|author=Jon Pareles|work=NY Times Archive|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down]]'' became Stewart's first solo album in 1969 (it was known as ''The Rod Stewart Album'' in the US). It established the template for his solo sound: a heartfelt mixture of [[folk music|folk]], rock, and [[country blues]], inclusive of a British working-class sensibility, with both original material ("Cindy's Lament" and the title song) and cover versions ([[Ewan MacColl]]'s "[[Dirty Old Town]]" and [[Mike d'Abo]]'s "[[Handbags and Gladrags]]"). The backing band on the album included Wood, Waller and McLagan, plus [[Keith Emerson]] and guitarists [[Martin Pugh]] (of [[Steamhammer (band)|Steamhammer]], and later [[Armageddon (A&amp;M band)|Armageddon]] and [[7th Order (band)|7th Order]]) and [[Martin Quittenton]] (also from [[Steamhammer (band)|Steamhammer]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-rod-stewart-album-rod-stewart/73413?ean=731455805826|title=Rod Stewart Album by Umvd Special Markets, Rod Stewart – 731455805826 – CD – Barnes &amp; Noble|author=JohnQ|date=1 October 2010|work=Barnes &amp; Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faces released their début album ''[[First Step (Faces album)|First Step]]'' in early 1970 with a rock and roll style similar to the Rolling Stones. While the album did better in the UK than in the US, the Faces quickly earned a strong live following. Stewart released his second album, ''[[Gasoline Alley (album)|Gasoline Alley]]'' that autumn. Stewart's approach was similar to his first album and [[mandolin]] was introduced into the sound. He then launched a US tour with the Faces. Stewart sang guest vocals for the Australian group [[Python Lee Jackson]] on "[[In a Broken Dream]]", recorded in April 1969 but not released until 1970. His payment was a set of seat covers for his car. It was re-released in 1972 to become a worldwide hit.

Stewart's 1971 solo album ''[[Every Picture Tells a Story]]'' made him a household name when the B-side of his minor hit "[[Reason to Believe]]", "[[Maggie May]]", (co-written with Martin Quittenton) started receiving radio play. The album and the single occupied number one in both the US and the UK simultaneously, a chart first, in September.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Greil. ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll.'' Second edition; Jim Miller, editor. New York: Random House, 1980, {{ISBN|0-394-51322-3}}, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Set off by a striking mandolin part (by Ray Jackson of [[Lindisfarne (band)|Lindisfarne]]), "Maggie May" was also named in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s ''500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll'', one of three songs by him to appear on that list. The rest of the album was equally strong, with "[[Mandolin Wind]]" again showcasing that instrument; "[[(I Know) I'm Losing You]]" adding hard-edged soul to the mix; and "[[Tomorrow Is a Long Time]]", a cover of a [[Bob Dylan]] song. But the ultimate manifestation of the early Stewart solo style was the Stewart-Wood-penned "Every Picture Tells a Story" itself: powered by Mick Waller's drumming, [[Pete Sears]]'s piano and Wood's guitar work in a largely acoustic arrangement; it is a song relating to the [[picaresque]] adventures of the singer.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The second Faces album, ''[[Long Player (album)|Long Player]]'', was released in early 1971 and enjoyed greater chart success than ''First Step''. Faces also got their only US Top 40 hit with "Stay With Me" from their third album ''[[A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse]]'' released in late 1971.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt; This album reached the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic on the back of the success of ''Every Picture Tells A Story''.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;Roberts, David (2006). [[British Hit Singles &amp; Albums]]. London: Guinness World Records Limited&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] from [[The Sex Pistols]] regarded the Faces very highly and named them as a main influence on the British [[punk rock]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/The%20Sex%20Pistols_%20Steve%20Jones|title=The Sex Pistols' Steve Jones: 'I lost everything, hit bottom, and had to work my way back up.'|publisher=Gibson.com|accessdate=11 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324183836/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/The%20Sex%20Pistols_%20Steve%20Jones_|archivedate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faces toured extensively in 1972 with growing tension in the band over Stewart's solo career enjoying more success than the band's. Stewart released ''[[Never a Dull Moment (Rod Stewart album)|Never a Dull Moment]]'' in the same year. Repeating the ''Every Picture'' formula, for the most part, it reached number two on the US album charts and number one in the UK,&lt;ref name="RockHall"/&gt; and enjoyed further good notices from reviewers. "You Wear It Well" was a hit single that reached number 13 in the US and went to number one in the UK, while "Twisting the Night Away" made explicit Stewart's debt to [[Sam Cooke]]. For the body of his early solo work Stewart earned tremendous critical praise. ''Rolling Stone'''s 1980 ''Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll'' includes this in its Stewart entry:&lt;ref name="rshist-377"&gt;Marcus, "Rod Stewart", in ''Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll'', p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rarely has a singer had as full and unique a talent as Rod Stewart; rarely has anyone betrayed his talent so completely. Once the most compassionate presence in music, he has become a bilious self-parody – and sells more records than ever [...] a writer who offered profound lyricism and fabulous self-deprecating humour, teller of tall tales and honest heartbreaker, he had an unmatched eye for the tiny details around which lives turn, shatter, and reform [...] and a voice to make those details indelible. [... His solo albums] were defined by two special qualities: warmth, which was redemptive, and modesty, which was liberating. If ever any rocker chose the role of everyman and lived up to it, it was Rod Stewart.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Rod Stewart and Ron Wood - Faces - 1975.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart (right) whilst in [[Faces (band)|Faces]], with [[Ronnie Wood]] (left)]]
The Faces released their final album ''[[Ooh La La (Faces album)|Ooh La La]],'' which reached number one in the UK and number 21 in the US in 1973.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt; During the recording of the album, the rift between Stewart and the rest of the Faces grew further, as (according to [[Ian McLagan]]), Stewart didn't participate until two weeks into the sessions, "and then complained that some songs were in the wrong key for him. So we recorded them again and waited a week for him to come back. We cut the track for 'Ooh La La' three times before he eventually passed on it, leaving it for [[Ronnie Wood|Woody]] to sing. [...] The week the album came out he did all he could to scuttle it and told anyone who would listen how useless it was.".&lt;ref name="mac-206"&gt;McLagan, Ian, ''All The Rage'' (2011), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The band toured Australasia, Japan, Europe and the UK in 1974&lt;ref name="nzentgrafwoodworks"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zentgraf|first=Nico|title=Woodworks 1957–1975|url=http://www.nzentgraf.de/books/tcw/works1.htm|accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support the album and the single "Pool Hall Richard".

In late 1974, Stewart released his ''[[Smiler (album)|Smiler]]'' album. In Britain, it reached number one, and the single "Farewell" number seven, but only number 13 on the ''Billboard'' pop album charts and the single "Mine for Me" only number 91 on the ''Billboard'' pop singles charts. It was his last original album for Mercury Records. After the release of the double album compilation ''The Best of Rod Stewart'' he switched to [[Warner Bros. Records]] and remained with them throughout the vast majority of his career (Faces were signed to Warner Bros., and Stewart's solo releases in the UK appeared on the Riva label until 1981). In 1975, Faces toured the US twice (with Ronnie Wood joining [[The Rolling Stones]]' US tour in between)&lt;ref name="nzentgrafwoodworks"/&gt; before Stewart announced the Faces' break-up at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="tioos-chronicle75"&gt;{{cite web|last=McPherson|first=Ian|title=The Rolling Stones Chronicle: 1975|url=http://www.timeisonourside.com/chron1975.html|accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1975–88: Height of fame and critical reaction===
[[File:Rod-Stewart.jpg|thumb|right|On stage in Dublin, 1981]]
In 1975, Stewart moved to Los Angeles. He released the ''[[Atlantic Crossing]]'' album for his new record company, using producer [[Tom Dowd]] and a different sound based on the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]]. ''Atlantic Crossing'' marked both a return to form and a return to the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' album charts. The first single, a cover of the [[Sutherland Brothers]] song "[[Sailing (Sutherland Brothers song)|Sailing]]", was a number-one hit in the UK, but it only reached the Top 60 of the US charts. The single returned to the UK Top 10 a year later when used as the theme music for a BBC documentary [[Sailor (TV series)|series]] about ''[[HMS Ark Royal (R09)|HMS Ark Royal]]''. Having been a hit twice over, "Sailing" became, and remains, Stewart's biggest-selling single in the UK. His [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]] cover "[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)#Rod Stewart and Ronald Isley version|This Old Heart of Mine]]" was also a Top 100 hit in 1976.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt; In 1976 Stewart covered [[The Beatles]]' song "[[Get Back]]" for the musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-this-and-world-war-ii-r230229/review|title=All This and World War II|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1976, Stewart topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for eight weeks and the Australian [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] chart with the ballad "[[Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)|Tonight's the Night]]", with an accompanying music video featuring actress [[Britt Ekland]].&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt; It came from the ''[[A Night on the Town (Rod Stewart album)|A Night on the Town]]'' album, which went to number two on the ''Billboard'' album charts and was Stewart's first album to go platinum. By explicitly marking the album as having a "fast side" and a "slow side", Stewart continued the trend started by ''Atlantic Crossing''. "[[The First Cut Is the Deepest]]", a cover of a [[Cat Stevens]] song, went number one in the UK in 1977, and top 30 in the US.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RockHall"/&gt; "[[The Killing of Georgie]] (Part 1 and 2)", about the murder of a gay man, was also a Top 40 hit for Stewart during 1977.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt;

''[[Foot Loose &amp; Fancy Free]]'' (1977) featured Stewart's own band, the original Rod Stewart Group that featured Carmine Appice, Phil Chen, Jim Cregan, Billy Peek, [[Gary Grainger]] and John Jarvis. It continued Stewart's run of chart success, reaching number two. "[[You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)|You're in my Heart]]" was the hit single, reaching number four in the US.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt;

"[[Hot Legs]]" achieved a lot of radio airplay as did the confessional "[[I Was Only Joking]]". In appearance, Stewart's look had evolved to include a [[glam rock|glam]] element, including make-up and spandex clothes. Stewart scored another UK number one and US number one single with "[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]", which was a crossover hit reaching number five on the ''Billboard'' black charts due to its [[disco]] sound.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt; This was the lead single from 1978's ''[[Blondes Have More Fun]]...or do they?,'' which went to number one on the ''Billboard'' album charts and sold 3&amp;nbsp;million albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=Rod+Stewart&amp;ti=Blondes+Have+More+Fun|title=Recording Industry Association of America}}(RIAA)®&lt;/ref&gt;

A focal point of criticisms about this period was his biggest-selling 1978 disco hit "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?", which was atypical of his earlier output, and disparaged by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t4062480|pure_url=yes}}|author=Mason, Stewart|title=Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?|publisher=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, Stewart, while admitting his accompanying look had become "tarty", has defended the lyrics by pointing out that the song is a [[third-person narrative]] slice-of-life portrayal, not unlike those in his earlier work, and that it is not about him. The song's refrain was identical to Brazilian [[Jorge Ben Jor]]'s earlier "Taj Mahal" and a lawsuit ensued. Stewart donated his royalties from "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" to [[UNICEF]], and he performed it with his band at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1979.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Stewart moved to a more [[New wave music|new wave]] direction in 1980 by releasing the album ''Foolish Behaviour''. The album produced one hit single, "[[Passion (Rod Stewart song)|Passion]]", which proved particularly popular in South Africa (reaching no. 1 on the Springbok Top 20 Charts and Radio 5 Charts in early 1981).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It also reached No. 5 on the US ''Billboard'' Charts. In August 1981, MTV was launched in the US with several of Stewart's videos in heavy rotation. Later in 1981, Stewart added further elements of new wave and [[synthpop]] to his sound for the ''[[Tonight I'm Yours]]'' album. The title song reached No. 20 in the US, while "[[Young Turks (song)|Young Turks]]" reached the Top 5 with the album going platinum.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt; On 18 December 1981, Stewart played the Los Angeles Forum, along with [[Kim Carnes]] and [[Tina Turner]], in a concert broadcast worldwide via satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1981 – Rod Stewart's concert at the Los Angeles Forum is beamed |url=http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1981-rod-stewarts-concert-at-the-los-angeles-forum-is-beamed/ |work=thisdayinrock.com |accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rod Stewart 86.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart performing in Paris, 1986]]
Stewart was criticised for breaking the widely observed cultural boycott of [[apartheid]] South Africa by performing at the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort complex in Bophuthatswana as part of his [[Body Wishes]] (1983) and [[Camouflage (Rod Stewart album)|Camouflage]] (1984) tours.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Stewart had four US Top 10 singles between 1982 and 1988, "Young Turks" (No. 5, carrying over from 1981 into 1982), "Some Guys Have All the Luck" (No. 10, 1984), "Infatuation" (No. 6, 1984) and "Love Touch" (No. 6, 1986, a Holly Knight/Mike Chapman collaboration), although "[[Baby Jane (Rod Stewart song)|Baby Jane]]" became his sixth and final UK number one in 1983. It reached No. 14 in the US.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt; The corresponding ''[[Camouflage (Rod Stewart album)|Camouflage]]'' album went gold in the UK, and the single "Infatuation" (which featured his old friend Jeff Beck on the guitar) received considerable play on MTV. The second single "[[Some Guys Have All The Luck]]" reached No. 15 in the UK and No. 10 in the US.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt;

A reunion with Jeff Beck produced a successful take on [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s "[[People Get Ready]]", but an attempt to tour together fell apart after a few dates. In the UK, "Every Beat of My Heart" reached number two in 1986. In January 1985, Stewart performed to a large audience at the [[Rock in Rio]] festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hundreds of thousands turn out for Rock in Rio festival |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110924-brazil-rock-rio-music-festival-draws-thousands-katy-perry-rihanna |accessdate=17 June 2017 |work=france24.com |date=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988–94: Out of Order Tour, ''Vagabond Heart'' and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame===
In 1988, he returned with ''[[Out of Order (Rod Stewart album)|Out of Order]]'', produced by [[Duran Duran]]'s [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]] and by [[Bernard Edwards]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]]. "Lost in You", "[[Forever Young (Rod Stewart song)|Forever Young]]", "Crazy About Her", and "[[My Heart Can't Tell You No]]" from that album were all top 15 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and mainstream rock charts, with the latter even reaching the Top Five. "Forever Young" was an unconscious revision of [[Bob Dylan]]'s song of the same name; the artists reached an agreement about sharing royalties. The song reached No. 12 in the US.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"&gt;[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=rod stewart|chart=all}} Rod Stewart Album &amp; Song Chart History]''Billboard'', 23 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1988, Stewart performed "Forever Young" at the [[1988 MTV Video Music Awards]] at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] in Los Angeles, and in 1989 he received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance|Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]] for the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/rockmale.htm|title=Grammy Awards: Best Rock Vocal Performance – Male|accessdate=26 April 2010|publisher=Rock on the Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1989, Stewart set out on the South American leg of the [[Out of Order Tour]] playing to sell-out audiences throughout Americas. There were 80,000 people at his show at Corregidora Stadium, [[Querétaro]], México (9 April), and 50,000 at Jalisco Stadium, [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]] (12 April). In [[Buenos Aires]], the audience at the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River Plate Stadium]], which seats 70,000+, was at over 90,000, with several thousand outside the stadium. Firehoses were sprayed on the crowd to avoid [[heat prostration]].

Stewart's version of the [[Tom Waits]] song "[[Downtown Train]]" went to number three on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 1990.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart" /&gt; This song was taken from a four-CD compilation set called ''[[Storyteller – The Complete Anthology: 1964–1990]]''.

Released in 1991, the ''[[Vagabond Heart]]'' album continued Stewart's renewal and inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Don McLeese|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/vagabond-heart-19910516|title=Vagabond Heart &amp;#124; Album Reviews|work=Rolling Stone|date=16 May 1991|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead single "[[It Takes Two (Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston song)|It Takes Two]]" with [[Tina Turner]], was released in 1990 in advance of the full album's release, and reached number five on the UK charts, but did not chart in the US. The follow-up songs from ''Vagabond Heart'' both reached the Billboard Hot 100 in 1991, with "[[Rhythm of My Heart]]" peaking at No. 5 and "[[The Motown Song]]" peaking at No. 10.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt; 
[[File:Rod Stewart concert ticket - 1993 - Stierch.JPG|thumbnail|Concert ticket, 1993]]

At the [[List of BRIT Awards ceremonies#1993|1993]] [[Brit Awards]] in London, Stewart picked up the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Music.&lt;ref name="Brits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1993|title=Brit Awards 1993|publisher=Brit Awards|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart brought back the Faces on stage for an impromptu reunion.&lt;ref name="Brits"/&gt; In 1993, Stewart recorded "[[All for Love (song)|All For Love]]" with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Bryan Adams]] for the soundtrack to the movie ''[[The Three Musketeers (1993 film)|The Three Musketeers]]''; the single reached number one in the US and number two in the UK.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt; Also in 1993, he reunited with Ronnie Wood to record an ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' special that included "[[Handbags and Gladrags]]", "[[Cut Across Shorty]]", and four selections from ''[[Every Picture Tells a Story]]''. The show featured an acoustic version of [[Van Morrison]]'s "[[Have I Told You Lately]]", which topped the ''Billboard'' adult contemporary chart and No. 5 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt; A rendition of "[[Reason to Believe]]" also garnered considerable airplay. The resulting ''[[Unplugged...and Seated]]'' album reached number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album charts.&lt;ref name="BillboardChart"/&gt;

Stewart was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994, presented by [[Jeff Beck]].&lt;ref name="RockHall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/rod-stewart/timeline|title=Rod Stewart: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|publisher=Rockhall.com|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 1994, Stewart played in front of 3.5&amp;nbsp;million people on [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana beach in Rio]], and made it into the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for staging the [[List of largest concerts|largest free rock concert attendance in history]].&lt;ref name="rio"/&gt;

===1995–2001: New ventures and record labels===
By the early 1990s, Stewart had mostly abandoned creating his own material, saying that he was not a natural songwriter and that the tepid response to his recent efforts was not rewarding.&lt;ref name="bbc122306"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193284.stm|publisher=BBC News|author=Young, Kevin|title=Stewart goes beneath the covers|date=23 December 2006|accessdate=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Stewart released ''[[A Spanner in the Works]]'' containing a single written by [[Tom Petty]], "[[Leave Virginia Alone]]", which reached the Top 10 of the adult contemporary charts. The latter half of the 1990s was not as commercially successful though the 1996 album ''[[If We Fall in Love Tonight]]'' went gold and hit No. 19 on the ''Billboard'' album chart.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

''[[When We Were the New Boys]]'', his final album on the [[Warner Bros.]] label released in 1998, contained versions of songs by [[Britpop]] acts such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Primal Scream]], and reached number two on the UK album charts. That same year, he recorded the song "[[Faith of the Heart]]", written by Diane Warren, for the film ''[[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]]''. In 2000, Stewart left Warner Bros. and moved to [[Atlantic Records]], another division of [[Warner Music Group]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In 2001, he released ''[[Human (Rod Stewart album)|Human]]''. The single "I Can't Deny It" went Top 40 in the UK and Top 20 in the adult contemporary. Stewart then signed to [[Clive Davis]]' new [[J Records]] label. ''[[The Very Best of Rod Stewart|The Story So Far: The Very Best of Rod Stewart]]'', a greatest hits album compiled from his time at Warner Bros., went to the Top 10 in the UK and reached number one in 2001 in, among other places, Belgium and France.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===2002–10: ''The Great American Songbook'' series and ''Soulbook''===
[[File:657105w.jpg|thumb|right|Performing in [[Zaragoza]], Spain, November 2006]]
In June 2002, Stewart performed "[[Handbags and Gladrags]]" at the [[Party at the Palace]] held at [[Buckingham Palace Garden]], a concert which celebrated the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]] and featured stars from five decades of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2024042.stm|title=Partying at the palace|publisher=BBC News|date=4 June 2002|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2002, Stewart had sold over 100&amp;nbsp;million records during his career.&lt;ref name="total-sales"/&gt; He concentrated on singing 1930s and 1940s pop standards from the [[Great American Songbook]], written by songwriters such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]], and [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], with great popular success. These albums have been released on [[Clive Davis]]'s [[J Records]] label and have seen Stewart enjoy album sales equal to the 1970s.

The first album from the songbook series, ''[[It Had to Be You: the Great American Songbook]]'', reached number four on the US album chart, number eight in the UK and number ten in Canada when released in late 2002. The track "[[These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)|These Foolish Things]]" (which is actually a British, not American, song) reached number 13 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Billboard adult contemporary chart]], and "[[They Can't Take That Away From Me]]" went Top 20.&lt;ref name="Adult"&gt;{{cite news|title=Adult Contemporary Charts|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/367145/rod-stewart/chart?f=341|publisher=Billboard|date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second series album, ''[[As Time Goes By: the Great American Songbook 2]]'', reached number two in the US, number four in the UK and number one in Canada. "[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]", a duet with [[Cher]], went Top 20 on the US adult contemporary charts. "[[Time After Time (1947 song)|Time After Time]]" was another Top 30 track on the US adult contemporary charts.&lt;ref name="Adult"/&gt; A musical called ''[[Tonight's The Night (2003 musical)|Tonight's The Night]]'', featuring many of Stewart's songs, opened 7 November 2003 at London's [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. It is written and directed by [[Ben Elton]], who previously created a similar production, ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]'', with music by [[Queen (band)|Queen]].&lt;ref&gt;''We Will Rock You The Musical by Queen and Ben Elton: The Official Book''. pp. 10–27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Stewart reunited with Ronnie Wood for concerts of [[Faces (band)|Faces]] material. A Rod Stewart and the Faces best of album, ''Changing Faces'', reached the Top 20 of the UK album charts. ''[[Five Guys Walk into a Bar...]]'', a Faces box set compilation, was released. In late 2004, ''[[Stardust: the Great American Songbook 3]]'', the third album in Stewart's songbook series, was released. It was his first US number one album in 25 years, selling over 200,000 albums in its first week. It also debuted at number one in Canada, number three in the UK and Top 10 in Australia. His version of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s "[[What a Wonderful World]]", featuring [[Stevie Wonder]], made the Top 20 of the world adult charts. He also recorded a duet with [[Dolly Parton]] for the album – "[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]". Stewart won his first ever [[Grammy Award]] for this album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=%22Rod+Stewart%22&amp;title=&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All |title=Past Winners Search |work=[[Grammy Award|Grammy.com]] |publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|The Recording Academy]] |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2005 saw the release of the fourth songbook album, ''[[Thanks for the Memory: The Great American Songbook 4]]''; it included duets with [[Diana Ross]] and [[Elton John]]. Within weeks of its release, the CD made it to number two on the Top 200 list. In late 2006, Stewart made his return to rock music and his new approach to country music with the release of ''[[Still the Same... Great Rock Classics of Our Time]]'', a new album featuring rock and southern rock milestones from the last four decades, including a cover of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s "[[Have You Ever Seen the Rain?]]", which was released as the first single. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts with 184,000 copies in its first week. The number one début was helped by a concert in New York City that was on [[MSN Music]] and an appearance on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. He performed tracks from his new album live from the Nokia Theater on 9 October. Control Room broadcast the event Live on MSN and in 117 cinemas across the country via National CineMedia. In November 2006, Stewart was inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="UKinduction"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5338196.stm|title=Led Zeppelin make UK Hall of Fame|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2007, Stewart performed at the [[Concert for Diana]] held at [[Wembley Stadium]], London, an event which celebrated the life of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] almost 10 years after her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is the Concert for Diana?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/concertfordiana/features/about.shtml|publisher=BBC|date=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6257986.stm Diana concert a 'perfect tribute'] BBC News.

==Personal life==
In May 2000, Stewart was diagnosed with [[thyroid cancer]], for which he underwent surgery in the same month. It had been previously reported he suffered from a benign vocal cord nodule.&lt;ref name=thyroid&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlight/2001-02-22-stewart-thyroid.htm|work=USA Today|title=Rod Stewart faces thyroid cancer|date=22 February 2001|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being a major health scare, the resulting surgery also threatened his voice, and he had to re-learn how to sing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/03/stewart|title=Rod Stewart's cancer battle|publisher=CNN|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he has been active in raising funds for [[City of Hope National Medical Center|The City of Hope Foundation]] charity to find cures for all forms of cancer, especially those affecting children.&lt;ref name=thyroid/&gt;

Before returning to the UK, Stewart played for his LA Exiles team made up of mostly English expatriates plus a few celebrities, including [[Billy Duffy]] of [[The Cult]], in a senior soccer league in [[Palos Verdes, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palosverdesrealty.net/462020.html Palos Verdes Football ground], palosverdesrealty.net; accessed 14 June 2016. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121055223/http://www.palosverdesrealty.net/462020.html |date=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his father being a supporter of [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFqjVjN4DDc&amp;t=29m26s|title=Rod Stewart.Loose Women.|publisher=YouTube|date=5 November 2012|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart is a supporter of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], which he mentions in "[[You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)|You're in My Heart]]". He supports the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]] and follows [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as his English side, and he explains his love affair with both Celtic and Manchester United in Frank Worrall's book, ''Celtic United''.&lt;ref&gt;Worrall, Frank (2008). "Celtic United". Mainstream Publishing, 2008&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart clarifies this more in his 2012 book (pp 163–64), ''Rod: The Autobiography'', mentioning he "only had an attachment to Manchester United in the 1970s, but that was because they had so many great Scottish players in the 1970s, including [[Denis Law]] ... When I did eventually click with a team, it was Celtic". He presented Celtic with the trophy after they won the [[2015 Scottish League Cup Final]].&lt;ref name=bbcfinal&gt;{{cite news|title=Dundee Utd 0–2 Celtic|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31785677|accessdate=15 March 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=14 March 2015|first=Richard|last=Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart is a [[model railway]] enthusiast. His {{cvt|23|x|124|ft}} [[HO scale]] [[model railroad layout|layout]] in his Los Angeles home is modeled after the [[New York Central]] and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]] Railroads during the 1940s. Called the Three Rivers City, the layout was featured in the cover story of the December 2007, December 2010, February 2014, and June 2017 issues of ''[[Model Railroader]]'' magazine. In the 2007 article, Stewart said that it meant more to him to be in a model railroad magazine than a music magazine. The layout, which has a mainline run of {{cvt|900|ft}}, uses code 70 flextrack and a [[Digital Command Control]] (DCC) system made by Digitrax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3668740/Rod-Stewart-is-a-model-railway-enthusiast.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London, UK|title=Rod Stewart is a model railway enthusiast|first=Nigel|last=Reynolds|date=24 October 2007|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swanson|first=Carl|title=Rod Stewart Reaches a Milestone|journal=Model Railroader|date=February 2014|pages=52–59|publisher=Kalmbach Publishing|location=Waukesha, WI, US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart has a second, smaller layout at his UK home, based on Britain's [[East Coast Main Line]].

In September 2002, Stewart's son, Sean, was sentenced to three months in jail for attacking a man outside a restaurant in Los Angeles. Sean Stewart was also required to pay compensation and to attend anger management, drug and alcohol treatment courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Poole |first=Oliver |title=Rod Stewart's son given jail sentence for kicking stranger |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1407196/Rod-Stewarts-son-given-jail-sentence-for-kicking-stranger.html |accessdate=17 June 2017 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=14 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rod Stewart was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 2007 New Year Honours for services to music. Collecting it in July 2007 at [[Buckingham Palace]], Stewart commented: "It's a marvellous occasion.

[[Image:Ruqun.png|thumb|500px|right|Two traditional forms of ruqun (襦裙), a type of Han Chinese clothing worn primarily by women.]] 
'''''Ruqun''''' ([[wikt:襦裙|襦裙]]) is an item of traditional Chinese attire (''[[Hanfu]]'') primarily for women but also for men. It consists of a blouse ([[wikt:襦|襦]], ''ru'') and a wrap-around skirt ([[wikt:裙|裙]], ''qun; ''also called ''[[wikt:裳|裳]], chang''). It is the eldest type of hanfu which is said to have been worn by the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:zh:周易/系辞下#第二章]]：黄帝、尧、舜垂衣裳而天下治&lt;/ref&gt; and it is said to be worn by women since the [[Warring States period]].

==History==
Ruqun is the most basic type of Hanfu. It is said to be the basic clothing up to the [[3 Sovereigns and 5 Emperors]] age. At that time, it was worn by both men and women.

Generally the blouse was tucked into the skirt. The popularity of ''ruqun'' declined during the [[Han Dynasty]]. Although the popularity of women wearing ''ruqun'' increased again during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], most men did not wear it any more. In the [[Cao Wei|Wei Dynasty]] and [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] ''ruqun'' went through a major change when women started to wear much longer upper garments which needed to be put out of the skirt.{{Dubious|date=May 2009}} This new style of ruqun was called ''shanqun (衫裙)'' and existed with ''ruqun.'' During the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty]], the skirts were tied higher and higher up the waist, until they were eventually tied above the breasts, worn with short blouses. In addition to the normal crossed-collar blouses, parallel/straight-collar (對襟) blouses were also worn in this period, thus exposing the cleavage of the breasts. During the [[Song Dynasty]], the skirts were eventually lowered from the breast level back to the normal waistline. In the early [[Ming Dynasty]], ''ruqun''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s variant, ''shanqun'', went through a major change when women stopped using the sash. This new style of ''ruqun'', also called ''aoqun'' (襖裙), became popular in the late [[Ming Dynasty]].{{Dubious|date=May 2009}}

==Late Imperial Era==
By the Ming Dynasty, ''ruqun'' became the most common form of attire for women. The sleeves of the blouse are mostly curved with a narrow sleeve cuff (琵琶袖, ''[[pipa]]'' sleeve). The collar is of the same colour as the clothing. Often, there is an optional detachable protective ''huling'' (護領, lit. "protect collar") sewn to the collar. The ''huling'' can be white or any dark colour, and is used to protect the collar from being rotten by sweat, therefore to extend the life of the clothing. Towards the start of the [[Qing Dynasty]], the skirt was mostly ''baizhequn'' (百摺裙, lit. "hundred pleats skirt") or ''mamianqun'' (馬面裙, lit. "horse face skirt").{{Dubious|date=May 2009}}

'''Ryan Coetzee''' (born 8 January 1973) is a [[South Africa]]n politician and political strategist, who has served as [[special adviser (UK government)|special adviser]] to [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Nick Clegg]]&lt;ref name="Tele01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9682476/Spads-bill-rises-to-levels-seen-under-Gordon-Brown.html |title=Spads bill rises to levels seen under Gordon Brown |date=16 November 2012 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the 2015 General Election Director of Strategy at Liberal Democrat HQ.&lt;ref name="LDV01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/ryan-coetzee-switches-from-cleggs-director-of-strategy-to-lib-dems-general-election-director-of-strategy-42021.html |title=Ryan Coetzee switches from Clegg’s Director of Strategy to Lib Dems’ General Election Director of Strategy |last=Tall |first=Stephan |date=12 August 2014 |work=Liberal Democrat Voice |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he was director of strategy for the campaign for the UK to remain in the EU.

He previously served as a Member of [[South Africa]]'s [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] between 2004 and 2008, as CEO of South Africa's official opposition party, the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] between 2004 and 2009, and as the party's general election campaign chief in 2006, 2009, and 2011.&lt;ref name="M&amp;G01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2009-06-30-navigating-the-corridors-of-power |title=Navigating the corridors of power |date=30 June 2009 |work=Mail&amp;Guardian |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as chief adviser to [[Western Cape]] Premier [[Helen Zille]] between 2009 and 2012.&lt;ref name="IOL01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/da-whizz-kid-to-be-zilles-chief-adviser-447435 |title=DA whizz kid to be Zille's chief adviser |last=du Plessis |first=Carien |date=25 June 2009 |work=IOL |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Coetzee holds a Bachelor of Arts and a Higher Diploma in Education, both from the University of Cape Town.

==Career in politics==
In 1997 Coetzee was picked by DP leader [[Tony Leon]] to head up the party's parliamentary operations at the age of 24. Leon subsequently noted Coetzee's appointment as "the most significant" he made during his 13-year tenure as leader of the party.&lt;ref name="leon"&gt;Tony Leon, ''On The Contrary'', 2008, Jonathan Ball, {{ISBN|978-1-86842-305-7}}, pg. 298&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999, Coetzee was the party's chief strategist, playing a central role in the party's election campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2011/06/27/management-strategy-is-the-political-steering-wheel "Strategy is the steering wheel"]&lt;/ref&gt; which saw the DA grow from 1.7% in 1994 to 24.2% in the 2011 local government elections.

In April 2004 Coetzee became a Member of Parliament, and was assigned the shadow health portfolio. Six months later he famously asked then President [[Thabo Mbeki]] during a Parliamentary debate whether he believed the high rate of sexual violence in South Africa contributed towards the spread of HIV, and whether the President actually believed [[AIDS denialism|HIV causes AIDS]]. Mbeki responded by accusing Coetzee of succumbing to the "disease of racism", but avoided responding directly, thus reigniting criticism of his government's response to the pandemic.&lt;ref name="IOL02"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/mbeki-refuses-to-be-drawn-on-aids-issue-224789 |title=Mbeki refuses to be drawn on Aids issue |last=Quintal |first=Angela  |date=22 October 2004 |work=IOL |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Coetzee was appointed the DA's CEO, in which role he radically reorganised the party and its finances, and designed and managed the 2006 local government election campaign and the 2009 general election campaign. In 2008, he oversaw a relaunch of the party designed to position it as a party of government, and not merely one of opposition.&lt;ref name="M&amp;G02"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2008-11-10-da-plans-relaunch-to-grow-support-base |title=DA plans 'relaunch' to grow support base |date=10 November 2008 |work=Mail&amp;Guardian |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Coetzee resigned as party CEO to become a Special Advisor to the Premier of the Western Cape and party leader Helen Zille, with a brief to co-ordinate government policy and strategy. He was succeeded as DA CEO by [[Jonathan Moakes]].

In September 2012, in a surprise move, [[Nick Clegg]] appointed Coetzee strategy director of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in Britain. In late October 2013 it was announced that Coetzee might return to South Africa and was being offered a Western Cape provincial cabinet post by the DA.&lt;ref name="ExSpinDr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/ex-spin-doctor-tipped-for-da-post-1.1594803#.UmUdGvlmim4 | title=Ex-spin doctor tipped for DA post | publisher=Cape Argus | date=21 October 2013 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Meyer, Warda}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2014 he instead switched to a job at Liberal Democrat party HQ, becoming the General Election Director of Strategy, for which he was reportedly paid a salary of £110,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/592638/Eure-Referendum-yes-campaign-Ryan-Coetzee-Lib-Dem|title=Lib Dem election 'guru' - who won the party EIGHT seats - to lead 'in' campaign for Europe|last=Henn|first=Peter|date=2015-07-21|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tele02"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/10811693/General-election-2015-the-strategists-Ryan-Coetzee-Liberal-Democrats.html |title=General election 2015 - the strategists: Ryan Coetzee, Liberal Democrats |last=Dominiczak |first=Peter |date=7 May 2014 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LDV02"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/ryan-coetzee-switches-from-cleggs-director-of-strategy-to-lib-dems-general-election-director-of-strategy-42021.html |title=Ryan Coetzee switches from Clegg’s Director of Strategy to Lib Dems’ General Election Director of Strategy |last=Tall |first=Stephen |date=12 August 2014 |work=Liberal Democrat Voice |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Democrats faired very badly in the UK 2015 General Election, losing most of their seats. Coetzee is viewed as having led the party into oblivion.&lt;ref name="INP01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/europe-or-bust-the-campaign-to-keep-the-uk-in-the-eu-is-lagging-and-needs-charismatic-leadership-a6686926.html |title=Europe or bust: Campaign to keep the UK in the EU is lagging and needs charismatic leadership |date=8 October 2015 |work=Independent |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''The Guardian'' after the result, Coetzee said, "We got routed by what I call the Fear. We presumed from the beginning that the Conservatives would try to scare voters with the prospect of a Miliband government that would risk the economy. But in the event the polls and the SNP conspired to ratchet up the Fear to Terror levels, because they showed Labour’s only path to power would be via the SNP."&lt;ref name="GRD01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/22/liberal-democrats-opposition-labour-government |title=The Liberal Democrats must reunite, rebuild or remain in opposition |last=Coetzee |first=Ryan |date=23 May 2015 |work=The Guardian |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2015, Coetzee joined Britain in Europe, the pro-European referendum campaign organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lib-dem-guru-joins-pro-eu-campaign-gqpcshblcbq |title=Lib Dem guru joins pro EU campaign |date=21 July 2015 |work=The Times |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is seen as lacking in charismatic leadership.&lt;ref name=INP01/&gt; As Director of Strategy for the 'Stronger In' campaign, Coetzee was relatively quiet, writing publicly once in a South African newspaper to comment on the 2016 UK budget and difficulties within the UK Conservative Party.&lt;ref name="BD01"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/2016/03/29/uk-conservatives-snared-by-budget-trap-set-for-labour |title=UK Conservatives snared by budget trap set for Labour |last=Coetzee |first=Ryan |date=29 March 2016 |work=BusinessDay |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the June 2016 referendum the UK voted to leave the EU, and Ryan Coetzee blamed the defeat in a tweet on "25 years of right wing tabloid propaganda".&lt;ref name="Tweet01"&gt;{{Cite tweet |number=746091317915193344 |user=RyanCoetzee |title=And we were up against 25 years of right wing tabloid propaganda. |date=23 June 2016 |access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roma, repubblica, moneta di p. satrienus, 77 ac..JPG|thumb|350px|The she-wolf on a coin of the late Roman republic (c.77 BC)]]
In the [[Founding of Rome|Roman foundation myth]], it was a '''she-wolf''' that nursed and sheltered the twins [[Romulus and Remus]] after they were abandoned in the wild by order of [[Amulius|King Amulius]] of [[Alba Longa]]. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the [[Lupercal]], until they were discovered by a shepherd, [[Faustulus]]. [[Romulus]] would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of [[Rome]] since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.&lt;ref&gt; Wiseman ''Remus'' preface pg xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy.  One legend claims that the [[Hirpini]] people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony,  they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Sabine word for wolf: ''hirpus'').&lt;ref&gt; Strabo Book V Ch.12 (''Loeb'' pg.467) &lt;/ref&gt;  The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the wolf is a sacred animal.  There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the [[Lupercalia]].

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Apollo]]'s mother [[Leto]] is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Aristotle]]|accessdate=5 December 2016|title=History of Animals|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-history_animals/1965/pb_LCL438.345.xml?rskey=9mJ3UR&amp;result=1&amp;mainRsKey=S0vjOz|doi=10.4159/DLCL.aristotle-history_animals.1965}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sources==
The 3 "canonical" versions of the myth--those of [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]--all draw heavily on [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I 79&lt;/ref&gt;  He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins.  The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius.  Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding.  Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of [[Palatine Hill]].  The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water.  In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal.  Later, they were discovered by local shepherds.

Dionysius reports that rains had raised the water level such that when Amulius' servant arrived at the appointed spot (around a dozen miles from Alba Longa), they left the twins in the floodwaters because they couldn't go any further.  The basket they were in floated along until the waters receded and it struck a stone, tossing them out into the mud.  The she-wolf arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes and licked them clean of the mud.

After a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Greek colonists]] who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].&lt;ref&gt; Dionysius I ch.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness.  The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what.  The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land.  The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.&lt;ref&gt; Livy I pp.17-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch.  After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away.  It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.99&lt;/ref&gt;

The three relay accounts wherein the term "lupa" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute.  Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment.  In one, the twins are fathered by [[Hercules]] after he wins a dice game.  Their mother is the unwitting "prize".  In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby [[Gabii]].&lt;ref&gt; Plutarch ''Romulus'' IV pp.101-105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Scan of Figurehead from Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums band 1 (1776).png|thumb|right|Figurehead from the title page of ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums''  Vol. 1 (1776) by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]].  Winckelmann was a pioneer in the study of Graeco-Roman art and [[ancient Roman art]] in particular.  He is center, with the she-wolf suckling the twins and [[Homer]] closest to him.  The [[Sphinx]] and an [[Etruscan art|Etruscan vase]] are in the background.]]

===Earliest representation===
The "Bolsena Mirror" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures.  Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features.&lt;ref&gt; Mazzoni pp173-178&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes its age.  However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340.  The famous [[Capitoline Wolf]] may be of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] or [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Old Latin]] origin.&lt;ref&gt; Tennant p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and [[radiocarbon dating]] has cast doubt on an ancient origin.&lt;ref name="laregina2006"&gt;Adriano La Regina,"[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma/lupa-scultura-roma.html ''Roma, l'inganno della Lupa è "nata" nel Medioevo]'' "Rome: the phony She-Wolf wasn't born until the Middle-ages" La Republica. 17 November 2006, accessed 1 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[stele]] from [[Bologna]], dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant.  By 269 BC, the silver [[drachm|didrachm]] is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic "turning of the she-wolf's head" backward and downward at the twins.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]], the patron deity of the city, or the [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]].  That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity.&lt;ref&gt;Rissanen p.336&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces.  She and the twins were featured on the elaborate [[Ara Pacis]], built in honor of [[Augustus]] and dedicated to [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]], the goddess of peace.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.336-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Coins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated.  They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own "Roman-ness".&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.339&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt; Rissanen p.343-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early middle ages===
The [[Franks Casket]], an ornately carved, [[Anglo-Saxon]] chest from the 8th–9th century, probably crafted in a monastery in Northern France, features the she-wolf and twins, along with a [[Rune|Runic]] account of the lupercal.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.356 fn.148&lt;/ref&gt; Other Anglo-Saxon [[Undley bracteate|artifacts]] and coins from the same period also feature them.&lt;ref&gt;Rassanen pg.357&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Byzantine]]s continued to use the image, and coins attributed to them have been found in various locations in [[central Asia]] at sites located in modern [[Tadjikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]] along with an 8th-century [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] painted mural with a she-wolf, head turned back and down, suckling two infants.&lt;ref&gt;Compareti p.304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siena She-Wolf===
The [[Siena|Sienese]] have a traditional tale that the city was founded by [[Senius and Aschius]], another pair of twins who were also suckled by a she-wolf.  They were the sons of Remus and fled Rome after his death at the hands of their uncle Romulus.  The legend cannot be attested to prior to the Renaissance.  However, depictions of a she-wolf and twins are common in the city and some can be dated earlier.

==Lupercalia==
The [[Lupercalia]] was a very ancient festival even during Roman times.  Roman historians speculated as to its origins.  It may be associated with the god [[Lupercus]], the god of [[Pastoralism|shepherds]] and protector of flocks.  Some historians link it to the she-wolf and the Lupercal.

'''Staff Benda Bilili''' are a group of street musicians in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. They used to live around the grounds of the zoo in the country's capital city, [[Kinshasa]], and play music which is rooted in [[soukous]], with elements of old-school [[rhythm and blues]] and [[reggae]]. The core of the band consists of four senior singers/guitarists, who are [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] (they had [[poliomyelitis]] when they were young) and move around in spectacularly customized [[tricycle]]s. They are backed by a younger rhythm section consisting of abandoned street children who were taken under the protection of the older members of the band. The soloist is an 18-year-old boy (2009) who plays guitar-like solos on an electrified one-stringed [[lute]] he designed and built himself out of a tin can. The group's name translates roughly from [[Lingala language|Lingala]] as "look beyond appearances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Caspar Llewellyn |title=From Kinshasa to your town: the incredible rise of Staff Benda Bilili |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/01/staff-benda-bilili-congo-interview |work=The Guardian |date=1 November 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staff Benda Bilili earned the 2009 Artist Award at [[Womex]] (World Music Expo).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WOMEX 09 Award for Artists: WOMEX is proud to announce the winners... Staff Benda Bilili (DR Congo) |url=http://www.womex.com/realwomex/award1.html |publisher=WOMEX |accessdate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801063903/http://www.womex.com/realwomex/award1.html |archivedate=1 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has sought to raise awareness about crimes against humanity in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], contributing to the [[Enough Project]] and [[Downtown Records]]' Raise Hope for Congo compilation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://raisehopeforcongomusic.org/ Raise Hope for Congo]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Staff Benda Bilili was formed by Ricky Likabu and Coco Ngambali with other paraplegic musicians, as other bands in Kinshasa would not work with them. They were later joined by a teenager, Roger Landu, who fashioned his own instrument - named a ''satongé'' - from an empty fish can, a piece of wood and a guitar string.&lt;ref name="BBC Nov 09"&gt;{{cite news |last=Denselow |first=Robin |title=Staff Benda Bilili, Africa's unlikely pop stars |url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8369900.stm |work=BBC News |date=21 November 2009 |accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Staff Benda Bilili|publisher=BBC, London |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2012/september-06/14338/programme-notes |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The band rehearsed in Kinshasa zoo, because it was a quiet location, and played the streets of Kinshasa until they were heard by [[Vincent Kenis]], a Belgian record producer specialising in Congolese music, who arranged for the band to record their debut album, ''Tres Tres Fort'' ("Very Very Strong").&lt;ref name="BBC Nov 09" /&gt;

==The "voting song"==
In 2006, Staff Benda Bilili's song "Let's Go and Vote" ("Allons Voter"), written and performed by the musicians, was played repeatedly in the run-up to the 2006 historic polls on radio and television stations; it was reported to be responsible for a 70% increase in voter turnout. The credits on the video clip say it was produced by Monuc [[UN Mission in DR Congo]] and distributed by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). The musicians were not offered contracts, but were reportedly paid $50 each. Staff Benda Bilili filed a lawsuit in the Congolese courts seeking $100,000 for Monuc's use of their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zajtman |first=Arnaud |title=Disabled Congo singers to sue UN |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6612749.stm |work=BBC News |date=2 May 2007 |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The videos and the film ==
Staff Benda Bilili were featured in the documentary film ''Jupiter's Dance'', which follows the story of  [[Jupiter Bokondji]], a musician who is also involved in Staff Benda Bilili. The film was produced by [[Renaud Barret]] and [[Florent de la Tullaye]] (aka [[Belle Kinoise]]), who have been documenting the band's progress since 2005. They shot several videos, which have become quite popular on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Morgan, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/26/jupiter-bokondji-africa-express-congo Jupiter Bokondji: 'The cultural riches of Congo are immense'], The Guardian, 26 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barret and de la Tullaye directed a feature-length documentary on the band, ''[[Benda Bilili!]]'' The film was selected by the Quinzaine des Réalisateurs (Directors' Fortnight) at the 2010 edition of the Cannes Film Festival, and premiered on May 13, 2010, with the group in attendance and performing at the opening of the Quinzaine.&lt;ref name="Steve Hochman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hochman|first=Steve|title='Benda Bilili!' documentary details the band's difficult lives|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/05/entertainment/la-et-1005-staff-benda-bilili-20111005|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career==
Entitled ''Très Très Fort'', the band's debut album was released on [[Crammed Discs]] in March 2009. It was produced over the course of three years by Crammed's [[Vincent Kenis]] (known for introducing and producing bands such as [[Konono Nº1]], [[Kasai Allstars]], and for the [[Congotronics series]]). Kenis recorded the band mostly in the Kinshasa zoo. The album also contains four of Barret &amp; de la Tullaye's videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff Benda Bilili 'Très Très Fort' |publisher=Crammed |url=http://www.crammed.be/craworld/crw51/index.htm |accessdate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309184642/http://www.crammed.be/craworld/crw51/index.htm |archivedate=March 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staff Benda Bilili's ''Très Très Fort'' album was also be released on vinyl by Crammed Discs in 2010, only as part of the limited-edition Congotronics Vinyl Box Set which includes most albums on the [[Congotronics series]]. 

Media reactions to ''Très Très Fort'' were excellent, especially in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lais |first=Johnny |title=Staff Benda Bilili Tres Tres Fort Review |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/cnp2 |work=BBC |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009 |quote=The explosive debut album from Staff Benda Bilili is perhaps an example of African street music at its finest.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 20 best new acts of 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/18/best-new-acts-2009 |work=The Observer |date=18 January 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Staff Benda Bilili - The masters of survival, the sound of the ghetto |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/staff-benda-bilili--the-masters-of-survival-the-sound-of-the-ghetto-1607949.html |work=The Independent |date=13 February 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zupko |first=Sarah |title=Staff Benda Bilili - "Polio" |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/69721-staff-benda-bilili-polio/ |work=Popmatters |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Benda Bilili, perles musicales des rues de Kinshasa |url=http://africamix.blog.lemonde.fr/2009/02/25/benda-bilili-perles-musicales-des-rues-de-kinshasa/ |work=Le Monde |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721005530/http://africamix.blog.lemonde.fr/2009/02/25/benda-bilili-perles-musicales-des-rues-de-kinshasa/ |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staff Benda Bilili have performed extensively around Europe, Japan and Australia, and were to tour the US for the first time in October 2012.   

Entitled ''Bouger Le Monde'' ('Make The World Move'), Staff Benda Bilili's second album was recorded in Kinshasa and mixed in Brussels, again by producer Vincent Kenis. The album comprises 11 new songs and features lead vocals by seven different band members. It was to be released worldwide by Crammed Discs in September 2012.

In February 2013 ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that singer and songwriter Coco Ngambali had quit, along with fellow vocalist Théo Nzonza, and a tour of top European venues scheduled for March and April had been cancelled amid accusations of mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/15/staff-benda-bilili-where-did-it-go-wrong | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Andy | last=Morgan | title=Staff Benda Bilili: where did it all go so wrong? | date=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band played some dates in Europe in the autumn of 2013 and summer of 2014. Ngambali and Nzonza now play in [[Mbongwana Star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petredis|first1=Alex|title=Mbongwana Star: From Kinshasa review – thrillingly wrong-footing Congolese music|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/14/mbongwana-star-from-kinshasa-review|accessdate=17 December 2015|work=The Guardian|date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Cobb''' (born 17 October 1952 in [[Coventry]]) is an expert on [[internet security|security]], [[privacy]], and related topics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://readwrite.com/2013/03/08/12-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-online-security/ ReadWrite interview at RSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely published as a technical author in the 1980s, Cobb became known for his efforts to educate consumers and companies in data privacy and information security. In 1996, Cobb became one of the first people to earn the Certified Information System Security Professional (CISSP) qualification. He later co-founded two information security startups, one of which developed innovative anti-spam technology that is still in use today (both firms were sold to NASDAQ listed companies).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1149825 ACM Ubiquity, Volume 2006 Issue July]&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb has been cited as an information security expert by national media and in congressional testimony.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-114hhrg94108/html/CHRG-114hhrg94108.htm Committee on Homeland Security, House Of Representatives, 114th Congress, 2/25/15]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Written work==
After authoring more than a dozen textbooks on how to use spreadsheets, databases, and other software applications, Cobb's first book on PC and LAN Security was published in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchType=7&amp;searchId=22102&amp;maxResultsPerPage=100&amp;recCount=100&amp;recPointer=0&amp;resultPointer=0&amp; Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Cobb published a primer on privacy for businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301361955_Privacy_for_Business_Web_sites_and_email Research Gate]&lt;/ref&gt; As co-author and editor of the [[Trusted Email Open Standard]] Cobb helped present this proposal for securing email to the [[Federal Trade Commission]] in 2003. After a brief hiatus from privacy and security research, during which he produced an independent documentary on racial inequality in America ([[Dare Not Walk Alone]], 2006), Cobb co-authored a peer-reviewed paper on the dangers of malicious code use by governments, which he termed "righteous malware".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6916396&amp;queryText=cycon%202014&amp;pageNumber=2&amp;newsearch=true Proceedings of CyCon 2014: 6th International Conference On Cyber Conflict]&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb's historical analysis of cybercrime surveys was presented at Virus Bulletin 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.virusbulletin.com/blog/2016/02/vb2015-paper-sizing-cybercrime-incidents-and-accidents-hints-and-allegations/ Virus Bulletin, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entrepreneurial activities==
Cobb co-founded two information security startups that were sold to NASDAQ listed companies. The first was InfoSec Labs, acquired in 1999 by [[Rainbow Technologies]], a maker of encryption products such as the CryptoSwift Hardware Security Module (HSM). The second was [[ePrivacy Group]], the company that created the [[TurnTide]] anti-spam technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100328113940/http://www.internetacceleration.com/newsletters/email-9-29-06.htm Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was acquired by [[Symantec]] in 2004 was still in use a decade later as the Symantec Traffic Shaper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.TECH123509.html Symantec]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security awareness and education==
Cobb served for four years on the IT Security Executive Council of CompTIA (2012-2015). He frequently represents Security Our eCity, a non-profit community-wide security awareness organization based in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;[http://securingourecity.org/the-new-and-expanded-cyber-boot-camp-2015 Securing Our eCity]&lt;/ref&gt; In that role, he helped organize annual Cyber Boot Camps for middle school and high school students that have received national attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/19/business/la-fi-tn-young-cybersecurity-pros-reap-rewards-20130618 Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb has been an invited speaker on information security and data privacy issues in a dozen countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himssconference.org/speaker/stephen-cobb HIMSS Conference 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a TEDx speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tedxsandiego.com/videos/2015-videos/ TEDx San Diego 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; As a security researcher with ESET, Cobb has tracked the effects of security breaches on economic activity. For example, in the wake of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|Snowden revelations]] he documented a drop in online shopping and banking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/04/03/post-snowden-some-internet-usage-is-contracting-study-finds/ Wall Street Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Cobb holds a master of science degree in security and risk management from the [[University of Leicester]] where his dissertation addressed aspects of the cybersecurity skills gap.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/project/Characteristics-of-effective-Chief-Information-Security-Officers-CISOs ResearchGate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was convicted of [[Murder in English law|murder]], later reduced to [[manslaughter]] on grounds of [[diminished responsibility]], and served three years in prison, having been denied [[parole]]. He has since lived at a secret address.

== Burglary and shooting ==

On 20 August 1999, Tony Martin, a bachelor, was living alone at his farmhouse, Bleak House, in [[Emneth Hungate]], [[Norfolk]] which he inherited from his uncle in about 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[[Real Crime]], [[ITV1]]&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have been burgled a total of ten times, losing £6,000 worth of furniture. Police sources say they are not sure that all the incidents took place.&lt;ref name="Gillan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillan|first=Audrey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/20/tonymartin.ukcrime2|title=Bleak world of the loner who killed|date=20 April 2000|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin also complained about police inaction over the burglaries and claimed that multiple items and furniture were stolen such as dinnerware and a grandfather clock.&lt;ref name="Gillan"/&gt; Martin had equipped himself with an illegally held [[pump-action]] [[Winchester Model 1300]] 12 gauge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tony-martin-free-in-a-year-6299321.html|title=Tony Martin free in a year|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[shotgun]] which he claimed to have found. [[Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988|Changes in legislation in 1988]], resulting from the [[Hungerford massacre]], had changed the licensing treatment of semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns with a magazine capacity of more than two to equate to that of a firearm, requiring a valid firearms certificate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shotgun#Legal issues]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/30/tonymartin.ukcrime2 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Steven | last=Morris | title=The killer who won a nation's sympathy | date=30 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin had his shotgun certificate revoked in 1994 after he found a man stealing apples in his orchard and shot a hole in the back of his vehicle.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/apr/20/tonymartin.ukcrime2 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Audrey | last=Gillan | title=Bleak world of the loner who killed | date=26 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 20 August 1999, two burglars&amp;nbsp;– [[Brendon Fearon]], 29, and 16-year-old Fred Barras, both [[Irish Travellers]] from [[Newark-on-Trent]], [[Nottinghamshire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11044022/Tony-Martin-15-years-on-I-dont-want-to-go-back-there-because-it-could-happen-again.html|title=Tony Martin, 15 years on: I don't want to go back there because it could happen again|first=Claire|last=Duffin|date=19 August 2014|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– broke into Martin's house.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite news|title=Timeline: The Tony Martin case|work=[[BBC News]]|date=28 July 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/3087003.stm|accessdate=13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting downwards in the dark with his shotgun loaded with [[birdshot]], Martin shot three times towards the intruders (once when they were in the stairwell and twice more when they were trying to flee through the window of an adjacent ground floor room).

On 10 January 2000, Fearon and Darren Bark, 33 (who had acted as the [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]]), both from Newark-on-Trent, admitted to conspiring to burgle Martin's farmhouse. Fearon was sentenced to 36 months in prison, and Bark to 30 months&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; (with an additional 12 months arising from previous offences). Fearon was released on 10 August 2001.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; Fred Barras, the dead youth, had already been convicted of a total of 29 offences by the time of his death at the age of 16, including seven convictions for theft and six for fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/719895.stm|title=BBC News - UK - Burglars were experienced criminals|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been sentenced to two months in a young offenders' institution for assaulting a policeman, theft and being drunk and disorderly. On the night he was killed, Barras had just been released on bail after being accused of stealing garden furniture. His elderly grandmother, Mary Dolan, stated: "It's not fair that the farmer has got all the money and he is the one that took Fred away."&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|title=Burglar's family set to sue Martin|work=The Independent|accessdate=5 February 2011|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/burglars-family-set-to-sue-martin-710851.html|first=Damien|last=Brook|date=7 August 2000|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder trial ==

On 23 August 1999, Martin was charged with the murder of Barras, the [[attempted murder]] of Fearon, "wounding with intent to cause injury" to Fearon and "possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life".&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; Martin did not hold a valid [[Gun politics in the United Kingdom#Licensing and legislation|shotgun certificate]] (licence), let alone the more restrictive Firearms Certificate he would have needed to possess the Winchester pump-action shotgun that held a maximum of five rounds.

English law permits a person to kill another in self-defence only if the person defending him or herself uses no more than "reasonable force"; it is the responsibility of the jury to determine whether or not an unreasonable amount of force was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael T.

He was sentenced to [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|life imprisonment]], with a recommended minimum term to serve of 9 years, reduced to 8 years by the Lord Chief Justice.

== Appeal ==

An appeal was considered in October 2001 by three senior judges headed by [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf LCJ]]. Submissions by the defence that Martin had fired in his own defence were rejected by the appeal court. On this occasion, the defence also submitted evidence that Martin was diagnosed with [[paranoid personality disorder]] exacerbated by depression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1382255/Tony-Martin-is-told-that-he-cannot-appeal-to-Lords.html|title=Tony Martin is told that he cannot appeal to Lords|first=Joshua Rozenberg, Legal|last=Editor|date=29 January 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that his paranoia was specifically directed at anyone intruding into his home; he was also diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turney|first=Bob|year=2005|title=Wanted!|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=978-1-906-53464-6|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; This submission was accepted by the Court of Appeal and, on the grounds of [[diminished responsibility]], Martin's murder conviction was replaced by manslaughter carrying a five-year sentence, and his ten-year sentence for wounding Fearon was reduced to three years. These sentences were to run concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2001/2245.html|title=Court of Appeal, Law Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parole applications and release ==

Martin was imprisoned in [[Highpoint South (HM Prison)|Highpoint Prison]] at [[Stradishall]] in Suffolk. When he became eligible for parole and early release in January 2003, the [[Parole Board]] rejected his application without stating a reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Martin's parole bid fails|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 January 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2662181.stm|accessdate=13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the parole board, Sir [[David Hatch]], in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' described Martin as "a very dangerous man" who might still believe his action had been right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1136392.ece "Tony Martin is a dangerous man, says parole chief"], ''The Times'', 27 May 2003. Retrieved on 16 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin challenged the decision in the High Court, where the parole board's decision was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/1512.html|title= [2003] EWHC 1512 (Admin)|publisher=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probation officers on Martin's cases said there was an "unacceptable risk" that Martin might again react with excessive force if other would-be burglars intruded on his Norfolk farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Martin loses parole appeal|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 May 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/martin/article/0,,951953,00.html|accessdate=13 February 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July 2003, Martin was released after serving three years of his five-year sentence,&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; the maximum period for which he could be held following good behaviour.

== Compensation claim ==

During 2003, Fearon applied for, and received, an estimated £5,000 of [[legal aid]] to sue Martin for loss of earnings due to the injuries he had sustained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Steven|title=Legal aid for burglar shot by Tony Martin|work=The Guardian|date=6 June 2002|url=https://www.theguardian.com/martin/article/0,,751000,00.html|accessdate=13 February 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the case was thrown into doubt when photographs were published in [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']], showing him "cycling and climbing with little apparent difficulty" suggesting that Fearon's injuries were not as serious as had been claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allison|first=Rebecca|title=Legal action by burglar 'in doubt'|work=The Guardian|date=20 August 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1021965,00.html|accessdate=13 February 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the case was pending, Fearon was recalled to jail after being charged with the theft of a vehicle while on probation on a conviction for dealing heroin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Morris|title=Martin burglar back in custody|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/sep/05/tonymartin.ukcrime|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=5 September 2003|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearon later dropped the case when Martin agreed to drop a counter-claim. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Steven|title=Martin expected to end legal dispute with burglar|work=The Guardian|date=22 September 2003|url=https://www.theguardian.com/martin/article/0,,1046851,00.html|accessdate=13 February 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick Makin, Martin's solicitor, said: "It is appalling that the family of someone who has a criminal record for burglary and assault should attempt to claim any damages of criminal injury when he was shot while burgling the dwelling of an innocent person... It is also appalling that they may get legal aid while his victim is in prison and patently unable to work and equally cannot get legal aid... There is something wrong and perverse with our legal system that it permits this."&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

== Threats, interviews, and political activity ==

The BBC reported in 2003 that Fearon's supporters put a bounty on Martin's head of several tens of thousands of pounds.&lt;ref name="TMCC" /&gt; In July 2003, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that a cousin of Barras had said that a £60,000 bounty had been put on Martin's head.&lt;ref name=cousin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1437256/Tony-Martin-is-going-to-get-it-warns-cousin-of-the-boy-he-shot.html|title=Tony Martin is 'going to get it', warns cousin of the boy he shot|author1=Thair Shaikh|author2=Daniel Foggo|date=27 July 2003|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=16 October 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2003, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' paid Martin £125,000 for an exclusive interview on his release from prison. After investigation, the [[Press Complaints Commission]] ruled that the payment was justified and in the public interest because Martin "had a unique insight into an issue of great public concern".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/payment-to-tony-martin-was-justified-says-pcc-89575.html|title=Payment to Tony Martin was justified, says PCC|author=Ian Burrel|date=3 October 2003|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=16 October 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent years ==
In August 2014, it was revealed that Martin's house had been boarded up since his imprisonment and he had subsequently lived both with friends and in his car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11044022/Tony-Martin-15-years-on-I-dont-want-to-go-back-there-because-it-could-happen-again.html|title=Tony Martin, 15 years on: I don't want to go back there because it could happen again|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2015, the media reported that Martin had been arrested on suspicion of possessing an illegal firearm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35206113 "Tony Martin held over gun possession"] [[BBC News]] 31 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Martin was not charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Norfolk farmer Tony Martin faces no charges over firearms arrest|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-35558263|date=12 February 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|access-date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, he won the [[Nastro d'Argento for Best Score|Nastro d'Argento for the Best Score]] for the score of ''[[Brothers Blue]]''.&lt;ref name=premi&gt;{{cite book|last=Enrico Lancia|title=I premi del cinema|publisher=Gremese Editore, 1998|isbn=8877422211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tricia Devereaux''' (born January 12, 1975)&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; is the [[stage name]] of an American former [[pornographic actress]], [[XRCO Hall of Fame]] inductee, and co-owner of [[Evil Angel (studio)|Evil Angel]] studios.

==Career==
Devereaux was introduced to the [[adult industry]] when her then husband, Patrick, got a job working as a bouncer in a strip club and Devereaux would occasionally visit him there. The other dancers encouraged her to enter the club's amateur contest which she won; this led to her working there to make extra money.&lt;ref name=oh /&gt;{{rp|554}} A number of established porn stars visited the club as feature dancers—names such as [[Victoria Paris]], [[Jeanna Fine]], and [[Samantha Strong]].&lt;ref name=oh /&gt;{{rp|555}}

Seeing the extra money that the features made, Devereaux sent pictures of herself to ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine for their "Beaver Hunt" feature, which was published. At the same time Devereaux came in fifth in [[Déjà Vu (company)|Déjà Vu]]'s national Stripper of the Year. She then flew out to [[Los Angeles]] at [[Joey Silvera]]'s request (he had seen pictures Devereaux had sent of herself to [[Jim South]]), where she made her first on-camera scene with Silvera in ''Fashion Sluts 7''.&lt;ref name=oh556&gt;{{cite book|title=The Other Hollywood|page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Devereaux was infected with [[HIV]] during a scene with [[Marc Wallice]].&lt;ref name=ABCNews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AIDS/hiv-actors-positive-test-unsettles-hub-us-porn/story?id=11892877&amp;page=3|title=HIV: Actor's Positive Test Unsettles Hub of U.S. Porn Industry  - ABC News|last=Jane E. Allen|date=2010-10-15|work=[[ABC News]]|page=3|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now known as Karen Stagliano, she is also the co-owner of [[Evil Angel (studio)|Evil Angel]], a production company, with her husband [[John Stagliano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kernes|first=Mark|title=Free Speech Coalition Benefits From Hustler's Freedomfest Not so much actual sex, but plenty of drinks and rock 'n' roll|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Free-Speech-Coalition-Benefits-From-Hustler-s-Freedomfest-354197.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
