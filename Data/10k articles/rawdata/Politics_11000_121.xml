APFOs take into account the availability of infrastructure. They can affect growth, but are considered separate from growth controls such as building [[moratorium (law)|moratoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing Community Growth|author =Eric D. Kelly|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Gazette|title=Gardner says moratorium will not hurt building industry|date=10 January 2008|author =Sherry Greenfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APFO regulations take into affect some or all of a jurisdiction's infrastructure requirements, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adequate Public Facilities Ordinances and Transportation Management|author =S. Mark White|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Service Level Standards

==Scope==
APFO regulations are typically applied to a jurisdiction which has legislative control of a given area. In America, this can be at a state, county, or city level. A conflict can occur when APFO regulations differ in scope between jurisdictions where there is shared funding and legislative authority (such as a city located inside a county that funds schools).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Gazette|title= Calvert County finds northern school populations inadequate Multiple schools closed to future district development|author =Sara Newman|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While APFOs are intended to mitigate infrastructure shortcomings for a particular area, the mitigation may apply to areas offsite of the development project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Driveway Regulation Practices|author =Kristine Williams|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; APFO regulations usually apply to individual projects on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Land Use Law|author =Daniel R.

==Criticism==
[[File:Parris Glendening speaking, September 2006.jpg|right|thumb|Maryland Governor Parris Glendening advocating Smart Growth in 2006]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5535">The '''Batallón Único de Inteligencia y Contrainteligencia''' ({{lang-en|Battalion of Intelligence and Counterintelligence}}) of the [[Colombian National Army]]. The BINCI has also been referred to as the "Charry Solano battalion," after its original chief, Brigadier General Ricardo Charry Solano.

It has also been known as the '''Twentieth Brigade''' or '''Brigade XX'''.&lt;ref name="NSA1"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Truth about Triple-A |publisher=National Security Archives |date=2007-07-01 |author=Michael Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Colombia's Killer Networks: Glossary |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Triple A===
{{main|Alianza Americana Anticomunista}}
During the years of its operation, the BINCI was considered the Colombian National Army's primary [[counter-intelligence]] unit and under direct operational control of the E-2 Army intelligence directorate in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].

A [[declassified]] 1979 report from the United States Embassy in Bogotá, published in 2007 by the [[National Security Archive]], mentioned that there was a plan for the BINCI to form a [[paramilitary]] operation under the guise of the [[Alianza Americana Anticomunista]] (AAA). The report describes the goal of the formation of the AAA as "to create the impression that the American Anti-communist Alliance has established itself in Colombia and is preparing to take violent action against local [[communism|communists]]." The BINCI, acting as the AAA, has been linked to the December 1978 [[Bombing#Delivery|bombing]] of the [[Colombian Communist Party]] Headquarters, the bombing of the Communist Party newspaper ''Voz Proletaria''. It has also been accused of engaging in other [[kidnapping]]s, bombings and [[assassination]]s against [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] targets and guerrilla detainees.&lt;ref name="NSA1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. cable ties Colombian military to rights abuses |date=2007-07-01 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forced Disappearance===
On August 30, 1987, Nydia Erika Bautista de Arellana was kidnapped by a group of undercover operatives identified as part of Brigade XX.&lt;ref name="Amnesty1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Colombia: Human Rights and USA Military Aid to Colombia III |publisher=Amnesty International |date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nydia Erika was 30 years old and had previously been detained due to her student activism and membership in the [[19th of April Movement|Movimiento 19 de Abril]] ({{lang-en|19th of April Movement}}) (M-19) guerrilla group. On September 12, 1987, her body was found, showing signs that she had been shot once in the head [[Execution-style murder|execution style]]. On July 9, 1995, Colombia's Procurator-Delegate for Human Rights, Hernando Valencia Villa, announced the conclusions of a disciplinary investigation into the 1987 "[[forced disappearance|disappearance]]", [[torture]] and [[murder]] of Nydia Erika Bautista and called for Brigadier General Álvaro Hernán Velandia Hurtado and an army sergeant to be expelled from the armed forces. It was found that the then commander of Brigade XX for which the "Charry Solano" Army Battalion was attached, was fully aware of the capture, disappearance, torture and murder of Nydia Erika Bautista by men under his command and that he had had the "duty, power and opportunity to prevent this serious crime from being committed".&lt;ref name="Amnesty2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Colombia: Selected Cases for Campaigning Against Human Rights Violations |publisher=Amnesty International |date=March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty3"&gt;{{cite news|title=Day of the "disappeared" 2004 |publisher=Amnesty International |year=2004 |url=http://news.amnesty.org/pages/2004dofd_americas |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811165734/http://news.amnesty.org/pages/2004dofd_americas |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assaults===
On February 27, 1998, the BINCI was implicated by Colombian government investigators in the murders of human rights workers; lawyer Jesús María Valle, president of the "Héctor Abad Gómez" Permanent Committee for Human Rights in [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and human rights lawyer Eduardo Umaña. In May 1998 the Twentieth Brigade assaulted the offices of Justicia y Paz ({{lang-en|Justice and Peace}}) where they were reported to have ransacked the offices and forced nuns and human rights workers to their knees and placed guns to their heads.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch interviews with government investigators, Santafé de Bogotá, May 7–8, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1999 |publisher=House of Representatives |date=September 17, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW1"&gt;{{cite book|title=War Without Quarter: Colombia and International Humanitarian Law |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 1998, the BINCI was disbanded pending a reorganization, in part due to their participation in human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="HRW1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2"&gt;{{cite book|title=HRW: World Report 1999: Colombia: Human Rights Developments |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bridge loan''' is a type of short-term [[loan]], typically taken out for a period of 2 weeks to 3 years pending the arrangement of larger or longer-term [[financing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bridgeloan.asp|title=Investopedia Definition: Bridge Loan |publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/bridge+loan|title=Financial Dictionary: Bridge Loan}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually called a '''bridging loan''' in the United Kingdom, also known as a "caveat loan," and also known in some applications as a '''swing loan.''' In South African usage, the term '''bridging finance''' is more common, but is used in a more restricted sense than is common elsewhere.

A bridge loan is interim financing for an individual or business until permanent financing or the next stage of financing is obtained. Money from the new financing is generally used to "take out" (i.e. to pay back) the bridge loan, as well as other [[Capital expenditure|capitalization]] needs.

Bridge loans are typically more expensive than conventional financing, to compensate for the additional risk. Bridge loans typically have a higher interest rate, [[Point (mortgage)|points]] (points are essentially fees, 1 point equals 1% of loan amount), and other costs that are amortized over a shorter period, and various fees and other "sweeteners" (such as equity participation by the lender in some loans). The lender also may require [[cross-collateralization]] and a lower [[loan-to-value ratio]]. On the other hand, they are typically arranged quickly with relatively little documentation.

==Real estate==

Bridge loans are often used for commercial real estate purchases to quickly close on a property, retrieve real estate from foreclosure, or take advantage of a short-term opportunity in order to secure long-term financing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ft.com/content/eca790f4-6663-11e3-aa10-00144feabdc0 Guide to bridging loans] ''[[Financial Times]]''. 3 February 2014. Retrieved 27 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.finance-monthly.com/2018/06/what-is-a-bridging-loan/ What Is a Bridging Loan?] ''Finance Monthly Magazine''. 21 June 2018. Retrieved 27 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Bridge loans on a property are typically paid back when the property is sold, refinanced with a traditional lender, the borrower's creditworthiness improves, the property is improved or completed, or there is a specific improvement or change that allows a permanent or subsequent round of mortgage financing to occur.  The timing issue may arise from project phases with different cash needs and risk profiles as much as ability to secure funding.

A bridge loan is similar to and overlaps with a [[hard money loan]]. Both are non-standard loans obtained due to short-term or unusual circumstances.  The difference is that hard money refers to the lending source, usually an individual, investment pool, or private company that is not a bank in the business of making high-risk, high-interest loans, whereas a bridge loan is a short-term loan that "bridges the gap" between longer-term loans.

===Characteristics===

For typical terms of up to 12 months, 2–4 points may be charged. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridge Loans - Terms of bridge loans|url=http://izmcreditservices.net/bridge-loans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios generally do not exceed 65% for commercial properties, or 80% for residential properties, based on appraised value.

A bridge loan may be closed, meaning it is available for a predetermined time frame, or open in that there is no fixed payoff date (although there may be a required payoff after a certain time).&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/8839404/Bridging-loans-increase-45pc-due-to-new-landlord-appetite.html Bridging loans increase 45pc due to new landlord appetite] ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''. 21 October 2011. Retrieved 29 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

A first charge bridging loan is generally available at a higher LTV than a second charge bridging loan due to the lower level of risk involved, many UK lenders will steer clear of second charge lending altogether.

Lower LTVs may also attract lower rates, again representing the lower level of underwriting risk, although front-end fees, lenders legal fees, and valuation payments may remain fixed.

===Examples===

*A bridge loan is often obtained by developers to carry a project while permit approval is sought.  Because there is no guarantee the project will happen, the loan might be at a high interest rate and from a specialized lending source that will accept the risk.  Once the project is fully entitled, it becomes eligible for loans from more conventional sources that are at lower-interest, for a longer term, and in a greater amount.  A [[construction loan]] would then be obtained to take out the bridge loan and fund completion of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.mortgagemagazine.com.au/detail_article.cfm?articleID=1010| title=Short-term loans| date=November 2006| accessdate=2007-03-09| publisher=Mortgage Professionals Australia| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620170631/http://www.mortgagemagazine.com.au/detail_article.cfm?articleID=1010| archivedate=2007-06-20| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A consumer is purchasing a new residence and plans to make a down payment with the proceeds from the sale of a currently owned home.  The currently owned home will not close until after the close of the new residence.  A bridge loan allows the buyer to take equity out of the current home and use it as down payment on the new residence, with the expectation that the current home will close within a short time frame and the bridge loan will be repaid.
*A bridging loan can be used by a business to ensure continued smooth operation during a time when for example one senior partner wishes to leave whilst another wishes to continue the business. The bridging loan could be made based on the value of the company premises allowing funds to be raised via other sources for example a management buy in.
*A property may be offered at a discount if the purchaser can complete quickly with the discount offsetting the costs of the short term bridging loan used to complete. In auction property purchases where the purchaser has only 14–28 days to complete long term lending such as a buy to let mortgage may not be viable in that time frame whereas a bridging loan would be.

==Corporate finance==

Bridge loans are used in [[venture capital]] and other [[corporate finance]] for several purposes:
*To inject small amounts of cash to carry a company so that it does not run out of cash between successive major private equity financings&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ft.com/content/5a4c68fe-e573-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da Private equity turns to early loans to boost returns] ''[[Financial Times]].'' 1 January 2018. Retrieved 29 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
*To carry distressed companies while searching for an acquirer or larger investor (in which case the lender often obtains a substantial equity position in connection with the loan)
*As a final debt financing to carry the company through the immediate period before an [[initial public offering]] or an acquisition.

==South Africa==

In [[Law of South Africa|South African law]] [[real estate|immovable property]] is transferred via a system of registration in public registries known as [[Recorder of deeds|Deeds Offices]].&lt;ref&gt;Badenhorst, PJ et al. Silberberg &amp; Schoeman's The Law of Property. Fourth Edition. Butterwoths. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deeds Registries Act, 47 of 1937&lt;/ref&gt; Given the delays resulting from the transfer process, many participants in property transactions require access to funds which will otherwise only become available on the day that the transaction is registered in the relevant Deeds Office.

Bridging finance companies provide finance that creates a bridge between the participant's immediate [[cash flow]] requirement and the eventual entitlement to funds on registration in the Deeds Office. Bridging finance is typically not provided by [[bank]]s.

Various forms of bridging finance are available, depending on the participant in the property transaction that requires finance. Sellers of fixed property can bridge sales proceeds, [[estate agent]]s bridge estate agents' commission, and [[Mortgage law|mortgagors]] bridge the proceeds of further or switch bonds. Bridging finance is also available to settle outstanding property taxes or municipal accounts or to pay [[transfer tax|transfer duties]].

==United Kingdom==

===History===

Short term finance similar to modern bridging loans was available in the UK as early as the 1960s, but usually only through high street banks and building societies to known customers.&lt;ref name="History 1"&gt;[https://www.kisbridgingloans.co.uk/all-about-bridging/a-brief-history-of-bridging-loans/ History of bridging loans and how bridging has evolved] KIS Finance. 26 September 2018. Retrieved 27 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mortgagefinancegazette.com/features/brief-history-of-the-bridging-finance-sector-04-08-2016/ Brief history of the bridging finance sector] ''Mortgage Finance Gazette''. 4 August 2016. Retrieved 27 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The bridging loan market remained small into the millennium, with a limited number of lenders.&lt;ref name="History 1"/&gt;

Bridging loans became increasingly popular in the UK after the [[great recession|2008–2009 global recession]], with gross lending more than doubling from £0.8 billion in the year to March 2011 to £2.2 billion in the year to June 2014.&lt;ref name="West One"&gt;August 2014 Bridging Index. West One. Retrieved on 1 Jun 2015 from [https://archive.fo/20130707070216/http://www.westoneloans.co.uk/publications/bridging-index/ http://www.westoneloans.co.uk/publications/bridging-index/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs?|date=February 2017}} This coincided with a marked decline in mainstream [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] lending in the same period, as [[bank]]s and [[building society|building societies]] grew more reluctant to grant home loans.&lt;ref name="MSM guide"&gt;[http://www.moneysupermarket.com/loans/bridging-loans-guide/ Bridging loans guide]. Money Supermarket. Accessed on 1 Jun 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

The overall value of the residential loan amounts outstanding in Q1 2016 was £1,304.5billion, an increase of 1.0% compared with Q4 2015 and an increase of 3.4% over the past four quarters.&lt;ref name="WW"&gt;{{cite web|title=MLAR statistics|url=https://www.fca.org.uk/your-fca/documents/mlar-statistics-june-2016-commentary|website=www.fca.org|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the popularity of bridging loans increased, so too did the controversy around them. In 2011, the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) warned homebuyers against using bridging loans as substitutes for ordinary mortgages, expressing fears that some mortgage brokers might be misrepresenting their suitability.&lt;ref&gt;Powley, T. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4ceef468-16be-11e1-bc1d-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3bXZJNdLj Borrowers warned on bridging loans]. Financial Times. 25 Nov 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the bridging market has been monitored by the West One Bridging Index, and has seen a consistent increase in popularity and prevalence coinciding with a consistent drop in average monthly interest rates.&lt;ref name="West One" /&gt;{{rs?|date=February 2017}}

===Usage===

In the United Kingdom, bridging loans are used in both business and [[real estate]]. In the former, they are typically used to free [[equity (finance)|equity]] in order to boost [[cash flow]]. In the latter, they are used by home-movers to ‘break’ property chains by providing a short-term source of finance when there is a delay between sale and completion dates, by buyers bidding on property at [[auction]], and by landlords and property developers to secure renovation finance for quick sale&lt;ref name="MSM guide" /&gt; or to refurbish a property that is considered uninhabitable prior to obtaining ordinary mortgage finance.

===Characteristics===

Bridging loans can be secured as a first or second charge against real property, including [[commercial property|commercial real estate]], buy-to-let property, dilapidated property and land or building plots. Loan terms typically run up to 18 months, with compound interest charged monthly; as such, they are often more expensive than other types of secured home loan.&lt;ref name="MSM guide" /&gt;

Bridging loans are defined as either ‘opened’ or ‘closed’. A loan is closed if the borrower has a clear and credible repayment plan or exit strategy in place, such as the sale of the loan [[security (finance)|security]] or longer-term finance.&lt;ref&gt;Haill, O. [http://www.ftadviser.com/2013/04/18/mortgages/mortgage-products/types-of-bridging-loan-and-how-they-compare-to-alternatives-cUlvzccwX01VKZ4xCiaCLO/article.html Types of bridging loan and how they compare to alternatives]. FT Adviser. Apr 18 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Open bridging loans are riskier to both the borrower and [[creditor]] due to the greater likelihood of [[default (finance)|default]].

===Regulation===
{{Update|section|date=November 2018}}

Bridging loans secured by first charge against a property in which the borrower or a close family member will reside are considered regulated mortgage contracts, and are therefore regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/financial-services-products/mortgages/bridging-loans |title=Archived Document |accessdate=2015-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602015847/http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/financial-services-products/mortgages/bridging-loans |archivedate=2015-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bridging loans sold to landlords and property developers are generally not regulated; however, if the occupant of the rental property against which the loan is secured is or will be a close family member of the borrower, FCA regulation will still apply.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fshandbook.info/FS/html/FCA/PERG/4/4#D319 Financial Conduct Authority Handbook PERG 4.4.1]. Accessed on 1 Jun 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception currently exists in the case of mixed-use properties, where the borrower or a close relative will occupy less than 40% of the property. In March 2016, however, the UK will be forced to bring its existing legislation in line with that of Europe, under the pan-European Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD). As the MCD does not recognise usage thresholds when defining a regulated contract, it is currently unclear whether the ‘40% rule’ will continue to apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economicvoice.com/how-will-the-mortgage-credit-directive-affect-mixed-use-properties/ How will the Mortgage Credit Directive affect mixed-use properties?] Economic Voice. 27 Mar 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Democratic Party''', commonly known as the '''British Democrats''', is a British [[far-right]] political party. It was launched in 2013 in a village hall in [[Leicestershire]] by a ten-member steering committee which included former members of several political parties including the [[British National Party]] (BNP), Democratic Nationalists, [[Freedom Party (United Kingdom)|Freedom Party]] and [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP).&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;

The party's inaugural president was [[Andrew Brons]], a then [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP).&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/02/neo-nazi-former-bnp-members-launch-new-far-right-party|title=Neo-Nazi former BNP members launch new far-right party |work=[[New Statesman]]|author=Collins, Matthew|date=8 February 2013|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brons had been a member of the BNP and a leading member of the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] (NF). The steering committee included a number of others with a history of membership in [[fascism|fascist]] and [[neo-Nazi]] groups,&lt;ref&gt;Ray Mount, [http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/archive/british-democratic-party-launches-and-promises-it-will-belong-to-its-members "British Democratic Party launches and promises it will belong to its members"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703024415/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/archive/british-democratic-party-launches-and-promises-it-will-belong-to-its-members |date=3 July 2013 }}, ''Searchlight'', 1 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; who believed that the BNP had been corrupted and watered-down.&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;

==History==
Brons resigned from the BNP in October 2012, after a failed campaign to unseat [[Nick Griffin]] as leader of the party in 2011. A number of other disillusioned BNP members have joined him, including Kevin Scott, founder and director of [[Civil Liberty (UK)|Civil Liberty]], who is acting as the interim chairman of the BDP, and who used to be a party organiser for the British National Party in the North East. Other prominent members of the party include:
* [[Adrian Davies (barrister)|Adrian Davies]], a longstanding critic of Griffin and a former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] member and former [[Freedom Party (United Kingdom)|Freedom Party]] chairman, who wrote the party's constitution and registered the party name,
* [[John Bean]], the former editor of the British National Party magazine ''Identity'',
* James Lewthwaite, a former [[Bradford Metropolitan District Council|Bradford councillor]], who along with others established the Democratic Nationalists in 2010, and who stood for the Democratic Nationalists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Lewthwaite|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/news_elections/general_election_2010/constituencies/145.bradford_south/candidates/2540._james_lewthwaite/|newspaper=[[Telegraph and Argus]]|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick Lowles, of [[Hope not Hate]], believes the party will be a serious threat to the BNP. "The BDP brings together all of the hardcore Holocaust deniers and racists that have walked away from the BNP over the last two to three years, plus those previously, who could not stomach the party’s image changes.... They and the BNP already have a mutual hatred of each other and neither party will stop until they’ve killed the other one off. The gloves will be off and it will be toxic".&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; Mathew Collins, also of Hope not Hate, predicted that the party would espouse policies of [[scientific racism]] and [[Holocaust denial]], ideas from which the BNP, under Griffin, distanced themselves.&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt;

Andrew Brons has been the leader of the British Democratic Party since its foundation on 9 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Electoral Commission: [http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP1765 Registration summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policies ==
The British Democrats support putting the reintroduction of the death penalty to a referendum/people's vote.

They are committed to "ending all immigration" and wish to repeal laws that they perceive as mandating preferential treatment for immigrants and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name=BDP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishdemocraticparty.org.uk/|title=British Democratic Party| accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party wishes to withdraw the UK from the [[European Union]], citing the cost and what it sees as a lack of democracy within EU institutions.&lt;ref name=BDP/&gt;

==Electoral performance==
The party fielded three candidates in the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2013|2013 English County Council elections]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://efp.org.uk/election-preview-2013/|newspaper=Heritage and Destiny|title=Election preview 2013|date=5 April 2013|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;br&gt;- ''[[Newsnight]]'' (10 April 2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3195">'''Bruno Vogel'''  (1898–1987) was a German pacifist and writer.

==Biography==
Bruno Vogel was born on September 29, 1898 in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="glr"&gt;Raimund Wolfert, 'Get to Know Bruno Vogel', in ''[[The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide]]'', Jan-Feb 2010, pp. 29-31&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his childhood in [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref name="glr"/&gt; In 1916, he fought in the [[First World War]], first on the border of the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], then in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], and in [[Flanders]] by 1917.&lt;ref name="glr"/&gt;

In 1922, he founded the gay group [[Gemeinschaft Wir]] ("We the Community") under the aegis of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]].&lt;ref name="glr"/&gt; It was the local chapter in [[Leipzig]] of the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]], one of the largest gay groups in Germany from 1896 to 1933.&lt;ref name="glbtq"&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/literature/vogel_b.html glbtq] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140549/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/vogel_b.html |date=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-20s, after his parents put him out on the streets for being gay, he moved to [[Berlin]], and he founded the [[Revolutionary Pacifists Group]] with [[Kurt Hiller]].&lt;ref name="glr"/&gt; In 1928, he became a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], but soon left.&lt;ref name="glr"/&gt;

In 1938, he moved to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] with [[Otto Bohlmann]].&lt;ref name="glr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="glbtq"/&gt;  From 1942 to 1944, he worked in the [[South African Army]].&lt;ref name="glr"/&gt; Later, he wrote for ''Forward'', ''Common Sense'' and ''[[Jewish Affairs]]''.&lt;ref name="glr"/&gt; In 1953, he moved to [[London]], from where he was involved in the anti-[[apartheid]] movement.&lt;ref name="glr"/&gt;

He died on April 5, 1987 in London.&lt;ref name="glr"/&gt; His novel ''Alf'' from 1929 was first translated into English in 1992.

In August 2012 someone put Bruno Vogel's unpublished works, such as the novel ''Mashango'' and the short stories he had collected under the title ''Slegs vir Blankes'' ("Only for Whites"), on the Internet anonymously.&lt;ref name="brunovogel.co.uk/index.htm"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150103220511/http://www.brunovogel.co.uk/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8728">'''Carbon leakage''' occurs when there is an increase in [[carbon dioxide]] emissions in one country as a result of an [[emissions reduction]] by a second country with a strict climate policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Emissions Loophole Stays Open in E.U. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/business/energy-environment/emissions-loophole-stays-open-in-eu.html |accessdate=1 April 2015 |author=Andrés Cala |publisher=The New York Times |date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon leakage may occur for a number of reasons:
* if the emissions policy of a country raises local costs, then another country with a more relaxed policy may have a trading advantage. If demand for these goods remains the same, production may move offshore to the cheaper country with lower standards, and global emissions will not be reduced.
* if environmental policies in one country add a premium to certain fuels or commodities, then the demand may decline and their price may fall. Countries that do not place a premium on those items may then take up the demand and use the same supply, negating any benefit.

There is no consensus over the magnitude of long-term leakage effects.&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;{{cite book

Carbon leakage may occur through changes in trading patterns, and that is sometimes measured as the balance of emissions embodied in trade (BEET).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Jiahua Pan |author2=Jonathan Phillips |author3=Ying Chen |title=China’s balance of emissions embodied in trade: approaches to measurement and allocating international responsibility |journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy |volume=24, Number 2, 2008, pp.354–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coal, oil and "backstop" technologies==

The issue of carbon leakage can be interpreted from the perspective of the reliance of society on coal, oil, and "backstop" (less polluting) technologies, e.g., [[biomass]]. This is based on the theory of nonrenewable resources.&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; The potential emissions from coal, oil and gas is limited by the supply of these nonrenewable resources. To a first approximation, the total emissions from oil and gas is fixed,{{clarify|reason=what does "fixed" mean?|date=April 2015}} and the total load of carbon in the atmosphere is determined by coal usage.

A policy that sets a [[carbon tax]] only in developed countries might lead to leakage of emissions to developing countries. However, a negative leakage (i.e., leakage having the effect of reducing emissions) could also occur due to a lowering in demand and price for oil and gas. This might lead coal-rich countries to use less coal and more oil and gas, thus lowering their emissions.&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; While this is of short-term benefit, it reduces the insurance provided by limiting the consumption of oil and gas. The insurance is against the possibility of delayed arrival of backstop technologies. If the arrival of backstop technologies is delayed, the replacement of coal by oil and gas might have no long-term benefit. If the backstop technology arrives earlier, then the issue of substitution becomes unimportant. In terms of climate policy, the issue of substitution means that long-term leakage needs to be considered, and not just short-term leakage.&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt;

== Current schemes ==
Estimates of leakage rates for action under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] ranged from 5 to 20% as a result of a loss in price competitiveness, but these leakage rates were viewed as being very uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year=2007

|accessdate=2010-04-05|display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; For energy-intensive industries, the beneficial effects of Annex I actions through technological development were viewed as possibly being substantial. This beneficial effect, however, had not been reliably quantified. On the empirical evidence they assessed, Barker ''et al''. (2007) concluded that the competitive losses of then-current mitigation actions, e.g., the [[EU ETS]], were not significant.

Recent North American emissions schemes such as the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] and the [[Western Climate Initiative]] are looking at ways of measuring and equalising the price of energy 'imports' that enter their trading region&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rggi.org/docs/rggi_workplan_6_14_06.pdf RGGI Imports and Emissions Leakage Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chief learning officer''' ('''CLO''') is the highest-ranking [[corporate officer]] in charge of learning management. CLOs may be experts in corporate or personal training, with degrees in education, instructional design, business or similar fields.

Qualified CLOs should be able to drive the corporate strategy and align the development of people with the business goals of the organization. A full complement of skills, including business analytics, technology, learning theory, performance consulting and scientific inquiry, are important for success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bersin.com/blog/post.aspx?id=de0e7229-d688-4746-8736-5817482885c8 Bersin by Deloitte: Today's World-Class Chief Learning Officer]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The CLO may report directly to the [[CEO]], but may also report to the Head of [[Human Relations|HR]] or Chief Talent Officer.

==Background==
In the 1990s, [[Jack Welch]], then CEO of [[GE]], made Steve Kerr his CLO, making GE the first company to have such an officer.&lt;ref&gt;"Steve Kerr and His Years with Jack Welch at GE", ''Journal of Management Inquiry'', December 2002, 11: 343-350&lt;/ref&gt; Kerr also became the CLO and Managing Director for [[Goldman Sachs]]

=== Promotion ===
In 2012, Emma Cunis, executive director of the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] spoke at a CLO summit held in [[Mumbai]]. Cunis was part of a panel that discussed the cost of not investing in executive [[Training and development|learning and development]]. She quoted former General Electric CEO Jack Welch to make her case: "The Jack Welch of the future cannot be like me. I spent my entire career in the United States. The next head of General Electric will be someone who spent time in Bombay, in Hong Kong, in Buenos Aires…. We have to send our best and brightest overseas and make sure they have the training that will allow them to be global leaders who will make GE flourish in the future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/india/article.cfm?articleid=4716 Wharton University: "India Learns the Value of the Chief Learning Officer"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning techniques==
There are four types of learning techniques that may be employed by CLOs (Elkeles &amp; Phillips, 2007):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jack, Tamar|first1=Phillips, Elkeles|title=The Chief Learning Officer|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vb8JBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ko&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Coaching
: Coaching refers to the training and development process wherein the CLO will support and train an individual or team in achieving a specific skill, competence, or goal. The individual or team receiving the coaching may be referred to as the coachee(s) (Flaherty, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flaherty|first1=James|title=Coaching: Evoking Excellence in Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Nfv94keo5cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22James+Flaherty%22&amp;hl=ko&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ObVSVNGaF83xavS5gvAM&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|website=Google e-book|publisher=Elsevier Inc|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The higher value for a CLO, relative to coaching, is to create a culture of coaching. All managers should become proficient coaches, and data on personal performance and contribution should be available to them. The more informed they are, the better coaches they can be.
; Engagement
: Engagement refers to the process of being psychologically invested in the learning process. It is often seen as an indicator of success in learning and the CLO will often attempt to maximize engagement of students and measure engagement during a variety of different learning tasks in order to rate their effectiveness (Christenson et.al., 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christenson, Wylie, Reschly|first1=Sandra, Cathy, Amy|title=Handbook of Research on Student Engagement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LSxRvDF-RgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ko&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media.|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Many CHROs have found the engagement surveys to be less than useful, because: they capture only a point in time, you tend to only find out what's wrong, the cycle time from survey to action is often long enough to make taking action irrelevant. 
; Mentoring
: Mentoring refers to a personal development relationship in which one more experienced individual will assist a less experienced learning in acquiring a new skill, ability, or competency. This process involves communication and is relationship based. It may be said to include formal transfers of knowledge, social capital, and psychological support (Clutterbuck &amp; Garvey, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clutterbuck, Garvey|first1=David, Bob|title=Mentoring in Action: A Practical Guide for Managers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9IO4CgMVREC&amp;pgis=1&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Management training
: Management training activities are those activities which specifically relate to improving the management of people. CLOs may also be responsible for providing training and measuring success of skills and competencies related to management functions (Bonner, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonner|first1=Ded|title=Leading Knowledge Management and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISWqgaRpaAwC&amp;pgis=1&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=American Society for Training and Development|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement techniques==
Measurement techniques refer to how CLOs measure learning outcome success. These may take several forms and can include standardized tests, one-to-one interviews and discussions with individuals receiving learning assistance, surveys and questionnaires, and measured competency at various tasks before and after the learning activity (Rani, 2004; Rauner &amp; Maclean, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rani|first1=T. Swarupa|title=Educational Measurement and Evaluation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CRt893qk8c4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ko&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The aim of the use of these measurement techniques is to quantify the success of the learning activity. This allows the CLO to adapt learning activities in future to increase the level of successful outcomes (Jonassen et al., 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jonassen, Spector, Driscoll, Merrill, Merrienboer|first1=David, Michael, Marcy, M.David, Jeroen|title=Handbook of Research for Educational Communications and Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GgCPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pgis=1&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology used==
A wide variety of different technologies may be used by CLOs in order to meet their learning objectives. Popular technologies used include the use of computer software to deliver lessons and tests. Additionally, internet based learning may be used to provide learning at remote locations and enable students to engage with lessons remotely (Iskander, 2008; Facer, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iskander|first1=Magued|title=Innovative Techniques in Instruction Technology, E-learning, E-assessment and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngQH8S7Zx0gC&amp;pgis=1&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media.|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctoral Program==
The [[University of Pennsylvania]] has their own Doctoral Program under their Graduate School of Education called the PennCLO Executive Doctoral Program. It specially prepares the Chief Learning Officers and other senior-level Human Capital Executives for success in their role as learning and talent development leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pennclo.com/ PennCLO: Executive Doctoral Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CLO Data==
There is scant data when it comes to the CLO position, considering that the position has only existed since 1991. In terms of salary, [[Indeed.com]] reports that the average salary is roughly  $81,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=Chief+Learning+Officer&amp;l1=]&lt;/ref&gt; per year, as of May 2015. According to a CLO survey conducted in April 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[http://elearningmind.com/chief-learning-officer/ Chief Learning Officer Industry Survey 2015: Infographic]&lt;/ref&gt; roughly 45% of CLOs are female, which is a remarkably strong number for female representation in the c-suite. As a comparison, just  3%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/media/file/Strategyand_The-2013-Chief-Executive-Study.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; of CEOs are female, according to Pricewaterhouse Coopers.

==Role within the C-Suite==
The chief learning officer often works alongside the CEO and collaborates on his or her vision for instituting learning and development initiatives throughout the company. Occasionally the CLO will work closely with the [[chief technology officer]], because much of L&amp;D involves technological advancement. The [[chief knowledge officer]] will also assist the CLO in disseminating knowledge for employees to learn and apply. The chief culture officer will assist the CLO with any culture-based programs or initiatives, though most companies do not have a CCO at the moment.

The '''Christian Heritage Party of New Zealand''' (CHP, known for a time simply as '''Christian Heritage New Zealand''') was a [[New Zealand]] political party espousing [[Christianity|Christian]] values and conservative views on social policy. Although it never won seats in an election, it came close to doing so in 1996 as part of the Christian Coalition and briefly had a member in [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]].

On 3 October 2006, the Party said it would disband to allow "new things to arise in Christian politics in New Zealand". This came after a highly publicised scandal which resulted in its leader, [[Graham Capill]], going to jail for committing sex crimes.

== Policies==
According to Christian Heritage New Zealand's self-description, the party aimed "to provide [[leadership]] that takes the initiative in building a culture that affirms [[marriage]], strengthens families, and celebrates [[life]] as a precious gift of [[God]].  We believe these are the key issues that need to be addressed if we are to make an impact for the next generation."

It described its three key policies as "Affirming Marriage, Building Families and Celebrating Life", i.e. opposition to [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] and support of [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]].

The party espoused strongly [[Social conservatism|conservative]] views on [[social policy]]. It favoured law changes to strengthen heterosexual [[marriage]]&lt;!-- could there be an example? or is this just right-wing slang for "preventing same-sex marriage," which is already in the article? --&gt; and to prevent [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil unions]]&lt;!-- all civil unions or just same-sex civil unions? --&gt;.  The CHP had an [[anti-abortion]] stance, but for most of its existence, the Party supported the re-introduction into New Zealand of [[capital punishment]] (abolished in 1989). Christian Heritage NZ supported restrictions on [[prostitution]], as well as mandatory standards for [[television]] with a view to reducing &lt;!-- broadcast? --&gt;[[violence]] and &lt;!-- broadcast? --&gt;[[pornography]].

In [[economic policy]], Christian Heritage espoused moderately [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] views, and stressed that "economic policy cannot be viewed in isolation" from social matters. In [[education]] the Party emphasised parental influence over the [[curriculum]] and parents' rights to choose the school their child attended. The Party supported [[victims' rights]].

CHP supported [[Monarchy in New Zealand|New Zealand's constitutional monarchy]]. In foreign affairs, the party supported New Zealand's alliance with [[Australia]] and a resumption of its alliance with the [[United States]]. From the [[New Zealand general election, 1999]], the CHP supported New Zealand's anti-nuclear policy, whereas beforehand it had endorsed return to the ANZUS alliance, but not necessarily the return of nuclear-armed ships.

CHP supported the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] and the work of the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] and urged settlement of [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|Māori land claims]] and racial reconciliation.

Christian Heritage NZ claimed broad-based support from members of various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations and from the [[Roman Catholic Church]], although many of its past members appeared to have held membership of the tiny [[Reformed Churches of New Zealand]], composed largely of conservative [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Dutch immigrants.  The party had long required its members to publicly declare themselves as Christians.  Some commentators{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} criticised this rigid [[confessionalism (religion)|confessional]] policy for supposedly limiting the party's base.

== History==

===Founding ===
The [[Christian Heritage Party of Canada]] was part of the inspiration behind the formation of New Zealand's Christian Heritage Party, and other influences also existed. Many of the party's founding members had Dutch ancestry and familiarity with the history of the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]], which functioned as an influential political party in Netherlands governments between 1888 and 1980, and many of the party's founding members belonged to the [[Reformed Churches of New Zealand]].

Dirk Vanderpyl noted in his book ''Trust and Obey'' (1994) that many Reformed Churches of New Zealand members came from a narrow slice of Netherlands society, centred in [[Zeeland]], [[Veluwe]] and [[Overijssel]]. In those Netherlands provinces, the Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij (SGP or [[Political Reformed Party]] in English) had existed since 1922, and stood as a model for separatist Reformed fundamentalist political activism. The SGP differs from the Christian Heritage Party in that it restricts its membership to certain Reformed denominations, while Christian Heritage membership stood open to all [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians, although at first many of its office-holders had some association with the Reformed Churches. However, the SGP has only ever existed as a '[[testimonial party]]'.

Also inspired by the Christian Heritage Party of Canada, the Christian Heritage Party of New Zealand emerged in 1989 to promote "[[Bible|Biblical]] principles" in politics, although the party's leadership generally claimed that its policies advantaged even non-Christians. Bill van Rij founded the party and became its first President; former National Party candidate John Allen became its initial leader.

===1990 election ===
The party's first convention took place in 1990 and established the group's structure.  In 1991 the party confirmed [[Graham Capill]], a Reformed Churches of New Zealand [[pastor]], as its leader. During the 1990s, some non-Reformed evangelical Christians repeatedly complained{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} that the CHP took too long to transcend this initial base.

Eighteen Christian Heritage candidates contested seats in the [[New Zealand general election, 1990|1990 general election]]. The Party did not gain any seats, but did secure over 10,000 votes across the country. In 1992 the party's candidate, Clive Thomson, finished fourth in a [[by-election]] in the electorate of [[Tāmaki (New Zealand electorate)|Tamaki]].

=== 1993 election===
In the [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993 elections]] the Christian Heritage party stood 97 candidates and polled 2.02% of the overall vote, making it easily the largest party outside parliament, a position the party retained in the 1996, 1999 and 2002 general elections.

The Christian Heritage Party supported the ultimately successful campaign to change New Zealand's [[electoral system]] from [[Plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] to [[Mixed member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] (MMP). (New Zealand endorsed MMP in 1993 and has used the system in general elections from 1996 onwards.)

===Christian Coalition and the 1996 election ===
In 1994, the Christian Heritage Party gained new competition when [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] MP [[Graeme Lee (politician)|Graeme Lee]] formed the [[Christian Democrat Party (New Zealand)|Christian Democrats]] (originally named the "United Progressives"). Lee had originally considered joining Christian Heritage, but eventually declined because of the party's requirement that all members declare themselves Christians.

Later, however, Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats reached an agreement to contest the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 elections]] together. This resulted in the formation of the [[Christian Coalition (New Zealand)|Christian Coalition]], with Capill and Lee as its co-leaders.  Lee held the first slot on the group's "[[party list]]", since he already had a seat in Parliament.

Shortly before the election, much speculation occurred {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} as to whether the Christian Coalition would reach the "five percent threshold" necessary to gain proportional representation in New Zealand's MMP electoral system. If the party gained more than five percent of the vote, it would gain entitlement to a share of parliamentary seats equivalent to its support, expected to amount to five or six MPs.  Although the Coalition polled as high as 6.7% in polls before the election, in the final tally the Coalition won only 4.4% support.

===1997–1999 ===
In May 1997 the Christian Coalition collapsed, with the two component parties going their separate ways. Debate continues{{Citation needed| date=August 2007}} on the causes of this breakdown. According to the Christian Heritage Party, the Christian Democrats left the alliance; but other accounts disagree (either blaming Christian Heritage or blaming both){{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. Points of contention included the extent to which the coalition would admit non-Christians who shared compatible views – after the split, the Christian Democrats would conceal the explicitly religious nature of their party, which they eventually renamed "[[Future New Zealand]]".

Shortly afterwards, Bill van Rij left Christian Heritage and joined the Christian Democrats, blaming Capill for the collapse of the Coalition.  A number of other senior Christian Heritage members, led by a former Deputy Leader, Geoff Hounsell, also resigned or suffered expulsion from the Party: they joined the Christian Democrats following their unsuccessful attempt to have Christian Heritage agree to a merger with the Christian Democrats.

Christian Heritage stood [[Ewen McQueen]] as its candidate in the 1998 [[Taranaki-King Country by-election, 1998|Taranaki-King Country by-election]]. McQueen outpolled candidates for the larger [[New Zealand First]] and [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green]] parties.

Six months before the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 elections]], [[Frank Grover]], leader of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party (1992)|Liberal Party]], a component of  [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|the Alliance]], defected to Christian Heritage, giving it one seat in Parliament.  Grover had entered Parliament as an Alliance [[list MP]].  High-profile broadcaster Philip Sherry also joined the Christian Heritage Party in 1999 and stood in the number 2 position on the party list

=== 1999 election===
In the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 general election]], Christian Heritage gained 2.4% of the vote, well short of the 5% threshold for entering Parliament, although enough to make it easily the largest party outside parliament.

===2002 election ===
In the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 election]], Christian Heritage had high hopes. It appointed Australian political consultant (now New South Wales assembly MP for the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]) [[David Elliott (politician)|David Elliott]], who is prominent campaigner against [[Republicanism in Australia]], as its campaign-manager. Party strategists hoped that by focusing on a single electorate, [[Wairarapa]], CHP could gain entry to Parliament and bypass the 5% threshold-requirement. However, the result proved disappointing to supporters – the party itself gained only 1.35% of the vote,&lt;ref name= "2002 election"&gt;{{cite web | work = Official Count Results | title = Overall Status |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2002/partystatus.html |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its Wairarapa candidate, deputy-leader [[Merepeka Raukawa-Tait]], came third in the Wairarapa poll.&lt;ref name= "Wairarapa, 2002"&gt;{{cite web | work =Official Count Results | title = Wairarapa |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2002/electorate-56.html |publisher=Electoral Commission |accessdate= 7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Heritage's support defected{{Citation needed| date=August 2007}} to [[United Future New Zealand]], a political party which had formed from the merger of [[Future New Zealand]] (a successor to the Christian Democrats) and [[Peter Dunne]]'s [[United New Zealand]] Party in 2000.

===Aftermath of the 2002 election ===
In the aftermath of the 2002 election, considerable tension existed between the party's central leadership and the Wairarapa branch. People alleged{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} financial mismanagement against both sides, and Raukawa-Tait criticised Graham Capill's leadership of the party.  Capill, in turn, criticised Raukawa-Tait, and rebuked her for her comments. Raukawa-Tait and the entire Wairarapa Electorate Committee eventually resigned.

Not long after the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002 election]] Capill announced his retirement as party leader and took up a job as a police prosecutor.  When Capill's retirement came into effect in August 2003, the Party appointed [[Ewen McQueen]] to replace him.  The Party also re-affirmed its determination to carry on contesting elections (rather than remove itself from the list of parties and become a [[pressure group|pressure-group]]).  In 2003 the party adopted the name "Christian Heritage New Zealand", or CHNZ, replacing the original "Christian Heritage Party", or CHP.

In November 2004 Graham Capill resigned from the Party, citing differences of opinion about the Party's direction such as the dropping of capital punishment.

=== Graham Capill sex scandal ===
In March 2005, newspapers reported that a "prominent New Zealander" was "punched and left whimpering on the ground" outside the Christchurch High Court, where he was defending sex charges.  The papers could not name the man because of a court suppression-order. On 1 April 2005 the court lifted name-suppression and the press revealed the man as Graham Capill.

Capill admitted the indecent assault of an eight-year-old girl on four occasions in 2001 and 2002, while he led Christian Heritage.  Further charges of rape and [[indecent assault]] against girls aged under 12 (committed during the 1990s) followed.

As Capill had strongly condemned "sexual perversion" throughout his political career, the charges had a strong impact both on Capill and on Christian Heritage, which swiftly condemned his conduct. Newspaper-reports described Capill as "a sexual predator". Before sentencing, Capill emailed supporters asking that they pray for a light sentence and claiming the sex with one of the young girls as "consensual".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Binning | first = Elizabeth | title = Capill a broken man at the stand | work = [[The New Zealand Herald]] | date = 2005-07-15 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10335923 | accessdate = 17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005 election and aftermath ===
In the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 general elections]], Christian Heritage saw its support collapse even further.  The party stood only seven candidates, and only won 2,821 votes (out of more than 2 million cast) or 0.2 percent.  It appears that much of its support bled over{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} to [[New Zealand National Party|National]], United Future, and the newly formed [[Destiny New Zealand]].  The loss of support to Destiny proved somewhat surprising&lt;!-- to whom? why? --&gt;, since Destiny has its base in a [[Pentecostal]] organisation, the [[Destiny Church (New Zealand)|Destiny Church]], and McQueen himself has Pentecostal affiliations.

A campaign organised by the conservative Christian-influenced [[Maxim Institute]] called "New Zealand Votes 2005" may have become a factor in the Party's disappointing performance in the 2005 general election.  The Maxim Institute portrayed the campaign as designed to inform voters.  However, some commentators saw it as an ultimately successful attempt to persuade Christian voters not to vote for Christian Heritage New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzarh.org.nz/fundy/thepost016.htm NZarh.org.nz] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107201753/http://www.nzarh.org.nz/fundy/thepost016.htm |date=7 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the election, controversy arose when former CHNZ Policy Director Mark Munroe defended Capill in a private email, arguing that his serial paedophile offenses did not fit the "biblical definition of rape".  Ewen McQueen and the CHNZ Board pressured Munroe for his resignation, which ultimately occurred.

CHNZ detailed the party's submission to Parliament's Electoral Law [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] in May 2006. The Party urged the reduction of MMP's five per-cent threshold for list party representation without electorate seats, and abolition of MMP's one seat/list representation rule, which allows parties that have an anchoring constituency seat to gain parliamentary representation without having to clear the five-percent threshold. Following a further review of MMP, the reduction of the 5% threshold to 4% and abolition of the one seat/list representation rule was recommended to parliament, which has to date not adopted the suggested changes.

=== Disbanding and legacy of the party ===
On 3 October 2006, the Party announced that it would close down following a postal vote in which 97% of its members endorsed the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0610/S00018.htm | newspaper = Scoop | title = Christian Heritage NZ Closing Down | place = [[New Zealand|NZ]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Party leader Ewen McQueen said shutting down would allow a new Christian party to form. He blamed Capill's conviction and disgrace for the party's demise.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10404090"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10404090 | title= Capill blamed as Christian Heritage closes down | date= 3 October 2006 | work =[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main legacy of the party is the adoption by New Zealand of the [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] representation electoral system, which the party supported. In addition the party was a catalyst for the formation of other niche religious or [[conservative]] political parties in New Zealand such as the [[Christian Democrat Party (New Zealand)|Christian Democrat Party]].

{{update section|date=June 2018}}Although the party has been disbanded, it has continued to appear sporadically in opinion polls as recently as April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10872574  | newspaper = NZ Herald | title= Labour Rises at Expense of allies | date= 21 March 2013 | place = [[New Zealand|NZ]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Development economics''' is a branch of [[economics]] which deals with economic aspects of the development process in low income countries. Its focus is not only on methods of promoting [[economic development]], [[economic growth]] and [[structural change]] but also on improving the potential for the mass of the population, for example, through health, education and workplace conditions, whether through public or private channels.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Clive (1987). "development economics," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 1, pp. 818, 825.&lt;/ref&gt;

Development economics involves the creation of theories and methods that aid in the determination of policies and practices and can be implemented at either the domestic or international level.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, H. W. (1981). "Economic Development: A Semantic History," ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'', 29(3), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1153704 pp. 457]–66. Chicago: The Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may involve restructuring market incentives or using mathematical methods such as intertemporal [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] for project analysis, or it may involve a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Clive (1987). "development economics," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 1, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in many other fields of economics, approaches in development economics may incorporate social and political factors to devise particular plans.&lt;ref name="Economic Development"&gt;Todaro, Michael and Stephen Smith.  ''Economic Development''. 9th ed. Addison-Wesley series in economics, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Also unlike many other fields of economics, there is no consensus on what students should know.&lt;ref name="Leading Issues"&gt;Meier, Gerald M. and James E. Rauch.  ''Leading Issues in Economic Development''. 8th ed. Oxford University Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Different approaches may consider the factors that contribute to economic [[Convergence (economics)|convergence]] or non-convergence across households, regions, and countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Debraj Ray (economist)|Ray, Debraj]] (2008).

==Theories of development economics==

=== Mercantilism and physiocracy ===
[[File:Historic world GDP per capita.svg|thumb|World GDP per capita, from 1400 to 2003&amp;nbsp;CE]]{{Main article|Mercantilism}}
The earliest Western theory of development economics was [[mercantilism]], which developed in the 17th century, paralleling the rise of the [[nation state]]. Earlier theories had given little attention to development. For example, [[scholasticism]], the dominant school of thought during medieval feudalism, emphasized reconciliation with Christian theology and ethics, rather than development. The 16th- and 17th-century [[School of Salamanca]], credited as the earliest modern school of economics, likewise did not address development specifically.

Major European nations in the 17th and 18th century all adopted mercantilist ideals to varying degrees, the influence only ebbing with the 18th-century development of [[physiocrats]] in France and [[classical economics]] in Britain. Mercantilism held that a nation's prosperity depended on its supply of capital, represented by bullion (gold, silver, and trade value) held by the state. It emphasised the maintenance of a high positive trade balance (maximising exports and minimising imports) as a means of accumulating this bullion. To achieve a positive trade balance, protectionist measures such as tariffs and subsidies to home industries were advocated. Mercantilist development theory also advocated [[colonialism]].

Theorists most associated with mercantilism include [[Philipp von Hörnigk]], who in his ''Austria Over All, If She Only Will'' of 1684 gave the only comprehensive statement of mercantilist theory, emphasizing production and an export-led economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author1=Ekelund, Robert B., Jr.  |author2=Hébert, Robert F.

  | year=1997
  | isbn=1-57766-381-0
  | pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, mercantilist policy is most associated with 17th-century finance minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], whose policies proved influential in later American development.

Mercantilist ideas continue in the theories of [[economic nationalism]] and [[neomercantilism]].

=== Economic nationalism ===
[[File:Alexander Hamilton.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], credited as Father of the National System]]
{{Main article|Economic nationalism}}
Following mercantilism was the related theory of [[economic nationalism]], promulgated in the 19th century related to the development and industrialization of the United States and Germany, notably in the policies of the [[American School (economics)|American System]] in America and the [[Zollverein]] (customs union) in Germany. A significant difference from mercantilism was the de-emphasis on colonies, in favor of a focus on domestic production.

The names most associated with 19th-century economic nationalism are the American [[Alexander Hamilton]], the German-American [[Friedrich List]], and the American [[Henry Clay]]. Hamilton's 1791 ''[[Report on Manufactures]],'' his magnum opus, is the founding text of the American System, and drew from the mercantilist economies of Britain under Elizabeth I and France under Colbert. List's 1841 ''Das Nationale System der Politischen Ökonomie'' (translated into English as The National System of Political Economy), which emphasized stages of growth, proved influential in the US and Germany, and nationalist policies were pursued by politician Henry Clay, and later by [[Abraham Lincoln]], under the influence of economist [[Henry Charles Carey]].

Forms of economic nationalism and neomercantilism have also been key in Japan's development in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the more recent development of the [[Four Asian Tigers]] (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore), and, most significantly, China.

Following [[Brexit]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2016]], some experts have argued a new kind of "self-seeking capitalism" popularly known as [[wikt:Trumponomics|Trumponomics]] could have a considerable impact on cross-border investment flows and long-term capital allocation&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Weltman: [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1157nr86h8byh/country-risk-review-2016-populism-is-risky 'Country Risk Review: Populism Is Risky’, Euromoney Global Capital, January 6 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

=== Post-WWII theories ===
{{See also|Industrial development|Ragnar Nurkse's balanced growth theory}}

The origins of modern development economics are often traced to the need for, and likely problems with the industrialization of eastern Europe in the aftermath of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Meier, G.M. and Seers, D. (Eds) (1984). ''Pioneers in Development''. New York: Oxford University Press for the World Bank. [http://hope.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/19/3/503 Review extract.]&lt;/ref&gt; The key authors are [[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstein-Rodan, P. "Problems of Industrialization in Eastern and South Eastern Europe." ''Economic Journal'' 53 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Mandelbaum]],&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbaum (Martin), K. (1945). ''The Industrialisation of Backward Areas''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell. Second Edition, (1955).
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ragnar Nurkse]],&lt;ref&gt;Nurkse, Ragnar (1953) ''Problems of Capital Formation in Underdeveloped Countries'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hans Singer|Sir Hans Wolfgang Singer]]. Only after the war did economists turn their concerns towards Asia, Africa and Latin America. At the heart of these studies, by authors such as [[Simon Kuznets]] and [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|W. Arthur Lewis]]&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, W.A. (1954). ''Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour. The Manchester School'', XXII(2), pp. 139–91.  [ftp://ftp.uic.edu/pub/depts/econ/wpaper/cchis/old%20docs533%20S07/Economic%20Development%20with%20Unlimited%20Supplies%20of%20Labour%20-%20Arthur%20Lewis.pdf Reprint.]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an analysis of not only economic growth but also structural transformation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pranab Bardhan|Bardhan, Pranab K.]] and [[Christopher Udry]] (2000) ''Development Microeconomics'', Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear-stages-of-growth model===
An early theory of development economics, the linear-stages-of-growth model was first formulated in the 1950s by [[Walt Whitman Rostow|W. W. Rostow]] in ''The Stages of Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto,'' following work of Marx and List.  This theory modifies Marx's stages theory of development and focuses on the accelerated accumulation of capital, through the utilization of both domestic and international savings as a means of spurring investment, as the primary means of promoting economic growth and, thus, development.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;  The linear-stages-of-growth model posits that there are a series of five consecutive stages of development which all countries must go through during the process of development.  These stages are "the traditional society, the pre-conditions for take-off, the take-off, the drive to maturity, and the age of high mass-consumption"&lt;ref&gt;Rostow, W.W. "The Five Stages of Growth". ''Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality''. 3rd ed. pp. 123–31. Eds. Seligson, Mitchell and John Passe-Smith.  Boulder, CO: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simple versions of the [[Harrod–Domar model]] provide a mathematical illustration of the argument that improved capital investment leads to greater economic growth.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

Such theories have been criticized for not recognizing that, while necessary, [[capital accumulation]] is not a sufficient condition for development. That is to say that this early and simplistic theory failed to account for political, social and institutional obstacles to development.  Furthermore, this theory was developed in the early years of the [[Cold War]] and was largely derived from the successes of the [[Marshall Plan]].  This has led to the major criticism that the theory assumes that the conditions found in developing countries are the same as those found in post-WWII Europe.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

===Structural-change theory===

Structural-change theory deals with policies focused on changing the economic structures of developing countries from being composed primarily of subsistence agricultural practices to being a "more modern, more urbanized, and more industrially diverse manufacturing and service economy."  There are two major forms of structural-change theory: W. Lewis' ''two-sector surplus model'', which views agrarian societies as consisting of large amounts of surplus labor which can be utilized to spur the development of an urbanized industrial sector, and Hollis Chenery's ''patterns of development'' approach, which holds that different countries become wealthy via different trajectories.  The ''pattern'' that a particular country will follow, in this framework, depends on its size and resources, and potentially other factors including its current income level and comparative advantages relative to other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Chenery, H.B. (1960). "Patterns of Industrial Growth," [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1812463 ''The American Economic Review'', 50(4), pp. 624–54]. American Economic Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chenery, H.B. and Taylor, L. (1968). "Development Patterns: Among Countries and Over Time," [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1926806 ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', 50(4), pp. 391–416]. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Empirical analysis in this framework studies the "sequential process through which the economic, industrial and institutional structure of an underdeveloped economy is transformed over time to permit new industries to replace traditional agriculture as the engine of economic growth."&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

Structural-change approaches to development economics have faced criticism for their emphasis on urban development at the expense of rural development which can lead to a substantial rise in inequality between internal regions of a country.  The two-sector surplus model, which was developed in the 1950s, has been further criticized for its underlying assumption that predominantly agrarian societies suffer from a surplus of labor.  Actual empirical studies have shown that such labor surpluses are only seasonal and drawing such labor to urban areas can result in a collapse of the agricultural sector.  The patterns of development approach has been criticized for lacking a theoretical framework.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===International dependence theory===
International [[dependency theory|dependence theories]] gained prominence in the 1970s as a reaction to the failure of earlier theories to lead to widespread successes in [[international development]].  Unlike earlier theories, international dependence theories have their origins in developing countries and view obstacles to development as being primarily external in nature, rather than internal.  These theories view developing countries as being economically and politically dependent on more powerful, developed countries which have an interest in maintaining their dominant position.  There are three different, major formulations of international dependence theory: [[neocolonial dependence]] theory, the false-paradigm model, and the dualistic-dependence model.
The first formulation of international dependence theory, neocolonial dependence theory, has its origins in [[Marxism]] and views the failure of many developing nations to undergo successful development as being the result of the historical development of the international capitalist system.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

===Neoclassical theory===
First gaining prominence with the rise of several conservative governments in the developed world during the 1980s, neoclassical theories represent a radical shift away from International Dependence Theories.  Neoclassical theories argue that governments should not intervene in the economy; in other words, these theories are claiming that an unobstructed free market is the best means of inducing rapid and successful development.  Competitive [[free markets]] unrestrained by excessive government regulation are seen as being able to naturally ensure that the allocation of resources occurs with the greatest efficiency possible and the economic growth is raised and stabilized.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

It is important to note that there are several different approaches within the realm of neoclassical theory, each with subtle, but important, differences in their views regarding the extent to which the market should be left unregulated.  These different takes on neoclassical theory are the ''free market approach'', ''public-choice theory'', and the ''market-friendly approach''.  Of the three, both the free-market approach and public-choice theory contend that the market should be totally free, meaning that any intervention by the government is necessarily bad.  Public-choice theory is arguably the more radical of the two with its view, closely associated with [[libertarianism]], that governments themselves are rarely good and therefore should be as minimal as possible.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

Academic economists have given varied policy advice to governments of developing countries. See for example, [[Economy of Chile]] ([[Arnold Harberger]]), [[Economic history of Taiwan]] ([[Sho-Chieh Tsiang]]). [[Anne Krueger]] noted in 1996 that success and failure of policy recommendations worldwide had not consistently been incorporated into prevailing academic writings on trade and development.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

The market-friendly approach, unlike the other two, is a more recent development and is often associated with the [[World Bank]]. This approach still advocates free markets but recognizes that there are many imperfections in the markets of many developing nations and thus argues that some government intervention is an effective means of fixing such imperfections.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

==Topics of research==
Development economics also includes topics such as [[Debt of developing countries|third world debt]], and the functions of such organisations as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]].  In fact, the majority of development economists are employed by, do consulting with, or receive funding from institutions like the IMF and the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Daniel B. and DiCola, Therese. "[http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/KleinDiColasInvestigatingAugust2004.pdf Institutional Ties of ''Journal of Development Economics'' Authors and Editors]". (August 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many such economists are interested in ways of promoting stable and sustainable growth in poor countries and areas, by promoting domestic self-reliance and education in some of the lowest income countries in the world. Where economic issues merge with social and political ones, it is referred to as [[development studies]].

===Economic development and ethnicity===
A growing body of research has been emerging among development economists since the very late 20th century focusing on interactions between [[Multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]] and economic development, particularly at the level of the [[Nation state|nation-state]]. While most research looks at empirical economics at both the macro and the micro level, this field of study has a particularly heavy sociological approach. The more conservative branch of research focuses on tests for causality in the relationship between different levels of ethnic diversity and economic performance, while a smaller and more radical branch argues for the role of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal economics]] in enhancing or causing [[ethnic conflict]]. Moreover, comparing these two theoretical approaches brings the issue of [[Endogeneity (economics)|endogeneity]] (endogenicity) into questions. This remains a highly contested and uncertain field of research, as well as politically sensitive, largely due to its possible policy implications.

====The role of ethnicity in economic development====
Much discussion among researchers centers around defining and measuring two key but related variables: '''ethnicity''' and '''diversity'''. It is debated whether [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] should be defined by culture, language, or religion. While conflicts in [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]] were largely along tribal lines, [[Nigerian Civil War|Nigeria's string of conflicts]] is thought to be – at least to some degree – religiously based.&lt;ref&gt;Salawu, B. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhammad_Kamaldeen_IMAM-TAMIM/publication/235892778_ejss_13_3_02/links/0912f513ea7151f611000000/ejss-13-3-02.pdf Ethno-Religious Conflicts in Nigeria: Casual Analysis and Proposal for New Management Strategies]". ''European Journal of Social Sciences'' 13.3 (2010): 345–53. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have proposed that, as the [[Salience (language)|saliency]] of these different ethnic variables tends to vary over time and across geography, research methodologies should vary according to the context.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"&gt;Alesina, Alberto and [[Eliana La Ferrara]]. "Ethnic Diversity and Economic Performance". ''Journal of Economic Literature'' 43 (2005): 762–800. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Somalia]] provides an interesting example. Due to the fact that about 85% of its population defined themselves as [[Somali people|Somali]], Somalia was considered to be a rather ethnically-homogeneous nation.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; However, [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] caused ethnicity (or ethnic affiliation) to be redefined according to [[clan]] groups.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt;

There is also much discussion in academia concerning the creation of an [[Index (economics)|index]] for "ethnic heterogeneity". Several indices have been proposed in order to model ethnic diversity (with regards to conflict). Easterly and Levine have proposed an ethno-linguistic fractionalization index defined as FRAC or ELF defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;1 - \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i^2,&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is size of group ''i'' as a percentage of total population.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; The ELF index is a measure of the probability that two randomly chosen individuals belong to different ethno-linguistic groups.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; Other researchers have also applied this index to religious rather than ethno-linguistic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D. "Ethnic and Cultural Diversity by Country". ''Journal of Economic Growth'' 8 (2003): 195–222. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Though commonly used, Alesina and La Ferrara point out that the ELF index fails to account for the possibility that fewer large ethnic groups may result in greater inter-ethnic conflict than many small ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; More recently, researchers such as Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, have put forward the ''Q'' [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] index as a more appropriate measure of ethnic division.&lt;ref name="Montalvo, Jose G 2005"&gt;Montalvo, Jose G. and Marta Reynal-Querol. "[http://www.econ.upf.edu/~Montalvo/wp/jde_marta_jose.pdf Ethnic Diversity and Economic Development]". Journal of Development Economics 76 (2005): ''293–323''. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a simplified adaptation of a polarization index developed by Esteban and Ray, the ''Q'' index is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;Q = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(\frac{\tfrac{1}{2} - s_i}{\tfrac{1}{2}}\right)^2 \times s_i,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' once again represents the size of group ''i'' as a percentage of total population, and is intended to capture the social distance between existing ethnic groups within an area.&lt;ref name="Montalvo, Jose G 2005"/&gt;

Early researchers, such as Jonathan Pool, considered a concept dating back to the account of the Tower of [[Tower of Babel|Babel]]: that linguistic unity may allow for higher levels of development.&lt;ref name="Pool, Jonathan 1972"&gt;Pool, Jonathan. "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/95c8/f417dd91510787a4d20ee5c429ffdafabc56.pdf National Development and Language Diversity]". ''Advances in the Sociology of Language'' 2 (1972): 213–30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While pointing out obvious oversimplifications and the subjectivity of definitions and data collection, Pool suggested that we had yet to see a robust economy emerge from a nation with a high degree of linguistic diversity.&lt;ref name="Pool, Jonathan 1972"/&gt; In his research Pool used the "size of the largest native-language community as a percentage of the population" as his measure of linguistic diversity.&lt;ref name="Pool, Jonathan 1972"/&gt; Not much later, however, Horowitz pointed out that both highly diverse and highly homogeneous societies exhibit less conflict than those in between.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D.L. ''Ethnic groups in conflict.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Collier and Hoeffler provided evidence that both highly homogenous and highly heterogeneous societies exhibit lower risk of civil war, while societies that are more polarized are at greater risk.&lt;ref name="Collier 1998"&gt;Collier, Paul and Anke Hoeffler. "[https://asso-sherpa.org/sherpa-content/docs/programmes/GDH/Campagne_RC/War.pdf On Economic Causes of Civil War]". ''Oxford Economic Papers'' 50 (1998): 563–73. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of fact, their research suggests that a society with only two ethnic groups is about 50% more likely to experience civil war than either of the two extremes.&lt;ref name="Collier 1998"/&gt; Nonetheless, Mauro points out that ethno-linguistic fractionalization is positively correlated with corruption, which in turn is negatively correlated with economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro, Paolo. "Corruption and Growth". ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 110.3 (1995): 681–712. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in a study on economic growth in African countries, Easterly and Levine find that linguistic fractionalization plays a significant role in reducing national income growth and in explaining poor policies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Montalvo, Jose G. and Marta Reynal-Querol. "[http://www.econ.upf.edu/~Montalvo/wp/jde_marta_jose.pdf Ethnic Diversity and Economic Development]". ''Journal of Development Economics'' 76 (2005): 293–323. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dincer, Oguzhan C. and Fan Wang. "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/53b8/d0147314c05e56c847a13a28bb9721ad5d8f.pdf Ethnic Diversity and Economic Growth in China]". ''Journal of Economic Policy Reform'' 14.1 (2011): 1–10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Empirical evidence|empirical research]] in the [[United States|U.S.]], at the [[Municipality|municipal]] level, has revealed that ethnic fractionalization (based on race) may be correlated with poor [[Fiscal policy|fiscal management]] and lower investments in [[public good]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alesina, Alberto, Reza Baqir and William Easterly. "Public Goods and Ethnic Divisions". ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 114.4 (1999): 1243–84. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, more recent research would propose that ethno-linguistic fractionalization is indeed negatively correlated with economic growth while more polarized societies exhibit greater public consumption, lower levels of investment and more frequent civil wars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Economic development and its impact on ethnic conflict====
Increasingly, attention is being drawn to the role of economics in ''spawning'' or ''cultivating'' '''ethnic conflict'''. Critics of earlier development theories, mentioned above, point out that “ethnicity” and ethnic conflict cannot be treated as exogenous variables.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub"&gt;Prasch, Robert E. "[http://rrp.sagepub.com/content/44/3/298 Neoliberalism and Ethnic Conflict]". ''Review of Radical Political Economics'' 44.3 (2012): 298–304. Web. Retrieved February 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a body of literature which discusses how economic growth and development, particularly in the context of a [[Globalization|globalizing world]] characterized by [[free trade]], appears to be leading to the extinction and homogenization of languages.&lt;ref&gt;De Grauwe, Paul. "[http://www.econ.kuleuven.be/ew/academic/intecon/Degrauwe/PDG-Publications_recent.htm Language Diversity and Economic Development]". ''University of Leuven'' (January 2006). Working Paper. Web. Retrieved Feb 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Castells asserts that the "widespread destructuring of organizations, delegitimation of institutions, fading away of major social movements, and ephemeral cultural expressions" which characterize globalization lead to a renewed search for meaning; one that is based on identity rather than on practices.&lt;ref&gt;Castells, Manuel. "The Rise of the Network Society". ''The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture''. Vol. 1. Malden: Blackwell Publishers Inc., 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barber and Lewis argue that culturally-based [[Resistance movement|movements of resistance]] have emerged as a reaction to the threat of [[modernization]] (perceived or actual) and [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] development.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. "[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1990/09/the-roots-of-muslim-rage/304643/ The Roots of Muslim Rage]". ''Atlantic Magazine'' (September 1990). Web. Retrieved February 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Benjamin R. "[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1992/03/jihad-vs-mcworld/303882/ Jihad vs. McWorld]". ''Atlantic Magazine'' (March 1992). Web. Retrieved February 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a different note, Chua suggests that ethnic conflict often results from the envy of the majority toward a wealthy minority which has benefited from trade in a neoliberal world.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub" /&gt; She argues that conflict is likely to erupt through political manipulation and the vilification of the minority.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub" /&gt; Prasch points out that, as economic growth often occurs in tandem with increased [[Economic inequality|inequality]], ethnic or religious organizations may be seen as both assistance and an outlet for the disadvantaged.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub" /&gt; However, empirical research by Piazza argues that economics and unequal development have little to do with [[Rebellion|social unrest]] in the form of [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Piazza, James A. 2006"&gt;Piazza, James A. "Rooted in Poverty?: Terrorism, Poor Economic Development, and Social Cleavages". ''Terrorism and Political Violence'' 18.1 (2006): 159–77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "more diverse societies, in terms of ethnic and religious [[demography]], and political systems with large, complex, multiparty systems were more likely to experience terrorism than were more homogeneous states with few or no parties at the national level".&lt;ref name="Piazza, James A. 2006"/&gt;

====Recovery from conflict (civil war)====
Violent conflict and economic development are deeply intertwined. Paul Collier&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Paul. "[[The Bottom Billion]]." ''The Bottom Billion'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; describes how poor countries are more prone to civil conflict. The conflict lowers incomes catching countries in a "conflict trap." Violent conflict destroys physical capital (equipment and infrastructure), diverts valuable resources to military spending, discourages investment and disrupts exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Paul "[http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/1/168.abstract On the consequences of civil war]." ''Oxf. Econ. Pap.'' (1999) 51 (1): 168–83. doi: 10.1093/oep/51.1.168&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery from civil conflict is very uncertain. Countries that maintain stability can experience a "peace dividend," through the rapid re-accumulation of physical capital (investment flows back to the recovering country because of the high return).&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Paul. "[http://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/workingpapers/pdfs/9508text.pdf Civil War and the Economics of the Peace Dividend]" Working Paper. Centre for the Study of African Economies (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, successful recovery depends on the quality of legal system and the protection of private property.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Colin [http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ces/journal/v56/n1/full/ces201328a.html "Investment and Institutions in Post Civil War Recovery]". ''Comparative Economic Studies'' 56, 1–24 (March 2014) | doi:10.1057/ces.2013.28&lt;/ref&gt; Investment is more productive in countries with higher quality institutions. Firms that experienced a civil war were more sensitive to the quality of the legal system that firm similar firms that had never been exposed to conflict.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Colin "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2484629 Firm Investment Decisions in the Post Conflict Context]" forthcoming ''The Economics of Transition''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth indicator controversy==
Per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP per head) is used by many developmental economists as an approximation of general national well-being. However, these measures are criticized as not measuring economic growth well enough, especially in countries where there is much economic activity that is not part of measured financial transactions (such as housekeeping and self-homebuilding), or where funding is not available for accurate measurements to be made publicly available for other economists to use in their studies (including private and institutional fraud, in some countries).

Even though per-capita GDP as measured can make economic well-being appear smaller than it really is in some developing countries, the discrepancy could be still bigger in a developed country where people may perform outside of financial transactions an even higher-value service than housekeeping or homebuilding as gifts or in their own households, such as counseling, [[lifestyle coaching]], a more valuable home décor service, and time management. Even free choice can be considered to add value to lifestyles without necessarily increasing the financial transaction amounts.

More recent theories of Human Development have begun to see beyond purely financial measures of development, for example with measures such as medical care available, education, equality, and political freedom. One measure used is the [[Genuine Progress Indicator]], which relates strongly to theories of [[distributive justice]]. Actual knowledge about what creates growth is largely unproven; however recent advances in [[econometrics]] and more accurate measurements in many countries is creating new knowledge by compensating for the effects of variables to determine probable causes out of merely correlational statistics.

==Recent developments==
{{see also|Fair trade movement}}

The most prominent contemporary development economist is perhaps the [[Nobel laureate]], [[Amartya Sen]].

Recent theories revolve around questions about what variables or inputs correlate or affect economic growth the most: elementary, secondary, or higher education, government policy stability, tariffs and subsidies, fair court systems, available infrastructure, availability of medical care, prenatal care and clean water, ease of entry and exit into trade, and equality of income distribution (for example, as indicated by the [[Gini coefficient]]), and how to advise governments about macroeconomic policies, which include all policies that affect the economy.
Education enables countries to adapt the latest technology and creates an environment for new innovations.

The cause of limited growth and divergence in economic growth lies in the high rate of acceleration of technological change by a small number of developed countries. These countries' acceleration of technology was due to increased incentive structures for mass education which in turn created a framework for the population to create and adapt new innovations and methods. Furthermore, the content of their education was composed of secular schooling that resulted in higher productivity levels and modern economic growth.

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] also highlight the importance of using economic growth to improve the human condition, raising people out of poverty and achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Claire Melamed, Kate Higgins and Andy Sumner (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4892&amp;title=millennium-development-goals-equitable-growth-policy-brief Economic growth and the MDGs] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite research showing almost no relation between growth and the achievement of the goals 2 to 7 and statistics showing that during periods of growth poverty levels in some cases have actually risen (e.g. Uganda grew by 2.5% annually between 2000–2003, yet poverty levels rose by 3.8%), researchers at the ODI suggest growth is necessary, but that it must be equitable.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; This concept of inclusive growth is shared even by key world leaders such as Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]], who emphasises that:
:"Sustained and equitable growth based on dynamic structural economic change is necessary for making substantial progress in reducing poverty. It also enables faster progress towards the other Millennium Development Goals. While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty."&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
Researchers at the ODI thus emphasise the need to ensure [[social protection]] is extended to allow universal access and that active policy measures are introduced to encourage the private sector to create new jobs as the economy grows (as opposed to [[jobless growth]]) and seek to employ people from disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

'''Dialogue for Hungary''' ({{lang-hu|Párbeszéd Magyarországért}}, '''Párbeszéd''') (also known in its shortened form '''Dialogue''' since September 2016), is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[Green|green]] [[political party]] that was formed in February 2013 by eight MPs who left the [[Politics Can Be Different]] (LMP) party.

The LMP party had formed a coalition with the [[Together (Hungary)|Together 2014]] party; together, they won four seats in the national assembly and one seat in the [[European Parliament]]. Dialogue for Hungary has taken one seat from the four in the Hungarian parliament and has one representative in Brussels.

On 24 August 2016, spokesperson Bence Tordai announced that the shortened form of the party's name would change to "Dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alfahir.hu/a_pm_bol_kivalik_magyarorszag|title=A PM-ből kiválik Magyarország|date=2016-08-24|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, the party's logo was changed to Párbeszéd (Dialogue), instead of "PM".

==Arrests, trials, and legal motions==
Forchion has been arrested several times and has mounted many legal challenges to his arrest and trials.&lt;ref name="njcomweedman"/&gt;

Forchion was arrested for "intent to distribute" on November 24, 1997 in [[Bellmawr, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Forchion | first=Ed |title=NJ Weedman |work=Dope Magazine |date=November 3, 2015 | url=http://www.dopemagazine.com/nj-weedman/ | accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Riley |first=Clint |title=Three men arrested on Marijuana Charges | publisher=Courier Post |date=November 25, 1997 |url=http://www.njweedman.com/arrest.htm | accessdate = 27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forchion accepted a plea bargain for a 10-year state prison sentence in September 2000. In April 2002 he was released and admitted to New Jersey's intensive parole supervision program. State authorities claimed he violated terms of probation by filming several public service announcements advocating changes to New Jersey's drug laws and Forchion was held in jail. A federal judge later held that expulsion from the program and additional incarceration violated his free speech protections.&lt;ref name="njcomweedman"/&gt;

In 2010 Forchion was arrested in [[Mount Holly, New Jersey]] after a traffic stop. He was charged with possession with intent to distribute and convicted of possession and sentenced to two years probation and a $2,500 fine. However, the jury couldn't reach a verdict on intent to distribute. A separate trial was convened.&lt;ref name="highcourt" /&gt; and Forchion urged the jury to employ [[jury nullification]] to overturn an unjust law. The defense which proved effective and resulted in Forchion receiving a 12-0 verdict of acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite |title=Jury upends marijuana law, NJWEEDMAN walks free |date=October 20, 2012 |author=Jeff Edelstein |publisher=[[The Trentonian]] |url=http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20121020/OPINION03/121029999 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6rYJLUpgw?url=http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20121020/OPINION03/121029999 |archive-date=June 28, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this victory, his conviction for possession led Forchion to later be convicted for violating the terms of probation, a sentence for which the judge jailed him for nine months, and for which he lost his appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://november.org/thewall/cases/forchion-a/forchion-a.html|title=Ed Forchion the New Jersey Weedman, prisoner of the war on drugs|website=november.org|date=April 18, 2011|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2015/08/nj-weedman-loses-appeal-of-marijuana-conviction-091624|title=NJ Weedman loses appeal of marijuana conviction|publisher=|work=[[Politico]]|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=21 May 2017|author=Friedman, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="highcourt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2015/08/nj_weedman_taking_marijuana_conviction_to_high_cou.html|title=NJ Weedman taking marijuana conviction to high court|publisher=|work=[[NJ.com]]|date=August 8, 2015|accessdate=21 May 2017|author=Spoto, MaryAnn}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was allowed out of custody intermittently to go to California for treatment of bone tumours (20 20-day periods of incarceration separated by 10-day periods of release).

'''Ernst Roets''' is a political activist, writer and filmmaker in [[South Africa]]. He is Deputy CEO of the civil rights organisation [[AfriForum]] and the CEO of the film production company Forum Films.

== Education ==
Roets grew up in the agricultural town of Tzaneen where he matriculated in 2003 from the Merensky High School. He obtained his LLB degree in 2009 from the [[University of Pretoria|University of Pretoria (UP)]]. During his student years he served in various leadership structures, including the Student Representative Council (SRC) and the Senate, at this university.

During his student years Roets served as founding member and the first National Chairperson of Solidarity Youth. In 2008 Solidarity Youth changed its name and the organisation was converted to AfriForum Youth. In 2016, Roets obtained his LLM degree in Public Law with distinction from the [[University of Pretoria|UP]]. The title of his dissertation was ''’n Peiling van die middele kragtens die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet, ter afdwinging van die basiese regte van minderheidsgemeenskappe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roets|first=Ernst|date=2016|title='n Peiling van die middele kragtens die Suid-Afrikaanse Grondwet, ter afdwinging van die basiese regte van minderheidsgemeenskappe|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/53186|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Roets was arrested in 2010 after he attempted to install a billboard with the words “Welcome to Pretoria” next to the N1 highway. This action was in protest against the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality|Tshwane Metropolitan]] Municipality’s use of the word “Tshwane” to refer to the capital during the 2010 Fifa Soccer World Cup, while the city’s name is in fact [[Pretoria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/3-held-for-violating-ad-by-law-20100709|title=3 held for violating ad by-law|last=|first=|date=2010-07-09|website=News24|archive-url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/3-held-for-violating-ad-by-law-20100709|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2011 Roets was appointed as Deputy CEO of AfriForum. He testified on behalf of [[AfriForum]] in 2011 in the case of AfriForum vs. [[Julius Malema|Malema]]. On behalf of AfriForum he submitted a charge of hate speech against Julius Malema after Malema sang the song “Dubula I’Bhunu” (Shoot the Boer) at various political gatherings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Afriforum-takes-Malema-to-Equality-Court-20150430|title=Afriforum takes Malema to Equality Court|last=|first=|date=11 March 2010|work=News24|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The court found Malema guilty of hate speech&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAEQC/2011/2.html|title=Afri-Forum and Another v Malema and Others (20968/2010) [2011] ZAEQC 2; 2011 (6) SA 240 (EqC); [2011] 4 All SA 293 (EqC); 2011 (12) BCLR 1289 (EqC) (12 September 2011)|last=|first=|date=12 September 2011|website=South Africa: Equality Court|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Roets addressed various conferences of the United Nations (UN), especially on farm murders and the state of minority rights in South Africa. In 2015, at the UN’s offices in Genève, he reacted sharply to an accusation by the South African government that those who are asking for the prioritisation of farm murders only did so because they were steering a racial agenda and wanted to bring back apartheid&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AfriForum|title=AfriForum kap regering by VN|date=2015-11-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5oFBek4e2E|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the same year Roets submitted a complaint of discrimination against the South African government with the UN’s Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders after the South African government politically interfered at the UN to prevent AfriForum from registering as a non-government organisation at the UN&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politicsweb.co.za/politics/dirco-guns-for-afriforum-at-un--ernst-roets|title=DIRCO guns for AfriForum at UN - Ernst Roets - POLITICS {{!}} Politicsweb|website=politicsweb.co.za|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Farm murders ==
Since 2012 Roets has led AfriForum's campaign to raise awareness about farm attacks.

=== Tainted Heroes ===
Tainted Heroes is a [[South Africa|South African]] documentary film that was produced by Forum Films under direction of Elrich Yssel, with Roets and Beatrice Pretorius as producers. The film is about the violent battle of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) against [[apartheid]] in South Africa between 1976 and 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://taintedheroes.co.za/|title=Tainted Heroes|website=taintedheroes.co.za|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The documentary is based on the book ''People’s War: New Light on the Struggle for [[South Africa]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://irr.org.za/reports/books/copy_of_peoples-war-new-light-on-the-struggle-for-south-africa|title=People's War: New Light on the Struggle for South Africa|last=Jonathan|first=Ball|date=|website=SAIRR (South African Institute of Race Relations)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Anthea Jeffery. 

Max du Preez described the film as “crude” and “reckless”, but afterwards admitted that he hasn’t seen the film yet. The journalist Pieter du Toit said that Roets played with fire. Even though the ANC did not want to comment on the contents of the film, the party characterised it as propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/anc-scoffs-at-propaganda-film-claims-1980960|title=ANC scoffs at ‘propaganda’ film claims {{!}} IOL News|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Kill the Boer (book) ===
Roets is the author of the book ''Kill the Boer'' that was published in June 2018. ''Kill the Boer'' is about farm attacks in [[South Africa]]. In the book Roets argues that the South African government, due to a number of reasons, is complicit in the attacks.&lt;ref name="Hlatshaneni"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hlatshaneni |first1=Simnikiwe |title=Outrage surrounds book claiming top ANC officials ‘killed the boer’ |url=https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1964479/outrage-surrounds-book-claiming-top-anc-officials-killed-the-boer/ |accessdate=24 November 2018 |publisher=The Citizen |date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He characterises the events as [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.killtheboerbook.com|title=Home - Kill the Boer Book|website=Kill the Boer Book|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roets argues that in 2017 [[South African farm attacks]] took place at an unusual frequency" and that the killings "were unusually cruel."&lt;ref name="JordaanAttacks"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jordaan |first1=Nomahlubi |title=AfriForum concerned about 'sharp' increase in farm attacks |url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2018-06-28-afriforum-concerned-about-sharp-increase-in-farm-attacks/ |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=[[The Times (South Africa)]] |date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Please do not add every protest of the group you just saw on TV or the internet here. Important/notable actions of FEMEN are covered in the article and Wikipedia articles (per [[WP:NOTEVERYTHING]]) should not be a complete exposition of all possible details (on FEMEN).

In September 2013 [[Inna Shevchenko]] responded to the documentary stating that Sviatsky "did lead the movement some time ago. ...We accepted this because we did not know how to resist and fight it. ...This is when I decided to leave Ukraine for France to build a new Femen".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/the-man-who-made-femen-new-film-outs-victor-svyatski-as-the-mastermind-behind-the-protest-group-and-its-breastbaring-stunts-8797042.html "The man who made Femen: New film outs Victor Svyatski as the mastermind behind the protest group and its breast-baring stunts"], ''[[The Independent]]''. 3 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=InnaSviatsky&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/05/victory-svyatski-femen-man "Femen let Victor Svyatski take over because we didn't know how to fight it"], ''[[The Guardian]]''. 5 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Femen member Inna Shevchenko discussed Sviatsky with ''[[The Independent]]'' in January, 2014, and, while not using the word 'founder' said: "I will never deny that he is a smart person.

Initially, Femen gained attention by demonstrating in skimpy or erotic clothing. For example, on 21 September 2008 in front of the Turkish embassy,{{where?|date=April 2014}} a dozen Femen members were dressed as nurses with smudged makeup and high pink heels; however, at the 24 August 2009 demonstration on Ukrainian independence day, [[Oksana Shachko]] went topless.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.parismatch.com/Actu-Match/Monde/Actu/Femen-Les-feministes-venues-du-froid-377710/ Femen Les féministes venues du froid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110061537/http://www.parismatch.com/Actu-Match/Monde/Actu/Femen-Les-feministes-venues-du-froid-377710/# |date=10 January 2013 }}, ''[[Paris Match]]'' (18 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Since this approach obtained such great publicity, it rapidly became FEMEN's signature approach.

On 3 October 2012, French activists Éloïse Bouton, Elvire Duvelle-Charles, Miyabi K., Julia Javel, Jenny Bah, Nathalie Vignes and Inna Shevchenko protested against [[rape]] by standing topless in front of the [[Venus de Milo]] statue in the [[Louvre Museum]]. The Femen activists shouted, "We have hands to stop rape". They stated they chose the Venus de Milo because it has no arms, arguing this best symbolizes a woman’s helplessness and vulnerability. This protest followed an incident in [[Tunisia]] where a woman faced charges of indecency after she said she was raped by police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/art-and-culture/news/topless-louvre-rape-protest-575/ |title=Topless at the Louvre: FEMEN activists stage anti-rape protest — RT |publisher=Rt.com |accessdate=2012-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013005315/http://rt.com/art-and-culture/news/topless-louvre-rape-protest-575/ |archivedate=13 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An action the group took was amid the opening of the [[Barbie]] Dream House in Berlin's [[Alexanderplatz]].  Right before the pink plastic building opened, a Femen member emerged topless from a model high-heel shoe burning a Barbie doll, in protest of what was widely seen as giving girls an unrealistic view of life.

In June 2014, Femen opened a branch in Israel with 15 women. Femen notes, "our numbers are growing from week to week."

In August 2016, a branch of Femen launched in the United States of America, based in Seattle, Washington and led by Jordan Robson. To date, their most publicized action has been a protest held at the polling station used by [[Donald Trump]] in New York City on November 8, 2016. &lt;ref&gt;http://q13fox.com/2016/11/08/topless-protesters-crash-donald-trumps-manhattan-polling-place/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Amina Tyler}}
'''Amina Tyler''' (real name Amina Sboui), a [[Tunisia]]n Femen activist, was arrested on 19 May 2013 in [[Tunis]]. International protests followed for her release from detention.

]] --&gt;
The '''Council of Europe Film Award (FACE)''' is presented at the [[Istanbul International Film Festival]] by the [[Council of Europe]] to the director whose entry to the festival raises public awareness and interest in [[human rights]] issues and promotes a better understanding of their significance.

==Philosophy==

The presentation of the FACE award is destined to honour an artistic or documentary film that raises the profile of human rights in accordance with the values of the Council of Europe and the principles it stands for: individual freedom, political liberty and the [[rule of law]]. The philosophy underlying the award's creation is the belief in the ability of film to transport its own message of human rights, tolerance and social inclusion to a wide audience. Cinema is not only an important expression of European culture, it is also a compass that can help to map out a route towards the Europe of the future – one that celebrates diversity and difference, that promotes equal opportunities for all its citizens, and that challenges abuse and intolerance.

==Procedure and prize==

The contribution winning the FACE award is selected by a jury from the entries in the "Human Rights in Cinema" section of the festival. This includes both [[documentary film|documentaries]] and [[feature film]]s investigating social change and individual dramas.

The FACE award consists of a sculpture in bronze (created by Freddy Ruhlman, entitled "Spirale de l'élévation") and a cash prize of 10000 €, which is offered in association with [[Eurimages]], the Council of Europe fund for the co-production, distribution and exhibition of European cinematographic works.

On 17 April 2010, [[Maud de Boer-Buquicchio]], Deputy Secretary General of the Council of Europe, presented the fourth Film Award of the Council of Europe (FACE) to  Scandar Copti and Yaron Shani, during the closing ceremony of the 29th  international film festival in Istanbul. ''The reason why we decided to team up with the prestigious Istanbul Film Festival is simple: while we believe that films cannot change the world, they can make us reflect and challenge us to change the world ourselves. This is all the more true when human rights are at stake,'' she emphasised.

In 2009, [[Maud de Boer-Buquicchio]] presented the third Film Award of the Council of Europe (FACE) to Marco Bechis on 18 April.

The 2008 Council of Europe Film Award was presented on April 19, by [[Maud de Boer-Buquicchio]], Deputy Secretary General of the Council of Europe.&lt;ref name="fest"&gt;{{cite web

==The Council of Europe and the Istanbul International Film Festival==

[[Turkey]], a long-standing member of the 47 nation Council of Europe, has a long and proud tradition of film making. Between 1950 and 1970 it topped the league of the world’s most prolific film industries. Many of the films have reflected the changes in Turkish society, holding up a mirror to topics as diverse as domestic violence and the role of women, the problems of migration from the countryside and poverty in the cities. These films have served to boost inclusiveness and respect for human rights.

At the same time, [[Cinema of Turkey|Turkish film makers]] have suffered the same problems in recent years as their colleagues elsewhere; the drying up of funding, increased competition from the big players and the challenges of new technology. The Council of Europe manages Eurimages, the body that funds the co-production and distribution of films and fosters co-operation between professionals. It is also home to the European Audiovisual Observatory, the only centre of its kind to gather and circulate information on the audiovisual industry in Europe, including cinema, television and radio.

==Award holders==

* 2010: ''[[Ajami (film)|Ajami]]'' by Scandar Copti and Yaron Shani. The decision of the Human Rights Jury was announced by its President [[Marco Bechis]], winner of FACE in 2009 for “Birdwatchers”, who described ''[[Ajami (film)|Ajami]]'' as an “original tale of a multilayered society where different religions, beliefs, traditions and interests have to co-exist”. “The two directors have skilfully found the right cinematographic language to tell this powerful story,” the jury said. ''[[Ajami (film)|Ajami]]'' takes its name from a multi-ethnic neighbourhood in Jaffa, Israel. The film starts with a revenge killing, a case of mistaken identity whose repercussions lead to tragic results. The Jury Special Mention went to Philippe Van Leeuw for “The Day God Walked Away”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dc/files/events/2007_prix_film_istanbul/default_en.asp Council of Europe Film Award (FACE)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709174616/http://www.coe.int/t/dc/files/events/2007_prix_film_istanbul/default_en.asp |date=2010-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2009: ''[[BirdWatchers (film)|Birdwatchers]]'' by [[Marco Bechis]]: “In today’s expanding world, respect for native populations and minorities is essential. By conveying this important message in a very well constructed story, ''Birdwatchers'' describes the complexities of changing society”; Jury members also decided to reward [[Nandita Das]] with a Special Jury Prize, for her film ''[[Firaaq]]'' which “courageously deals with the highly sensitive theme of religious intolerance and sectarian strife: showing its terrible consequences, ''Firaaq'' also conveys a message of hope and demonstrates that people can make choices.”
* 2008: ''[[Blind Mountain|Mang Shan / Blind Mountain]]'' by [[Li Yang (director)|Li Yang]] "for its powerful message against all violence, no matter its form to women all over the world, because this message is both universal and timeless." ''Blind Mountain'' tells the story of a young student travelling to the north of China in pursuit of employment. The girl is abducted and sold as bride in an isolated village located deep in the mountains. Through her story, the film highlights the torment caused by human trafficking and violence against women.&lt;ref name="fest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fest08"&gt;{{cite web

* 2007: ''[[Bamako (film)|Bamako / ''The Court'']]'', directed by [[Abderrahmane Sissako]], a [[Mali]]an director, whose film explored the exploitation of Africa by other world powers. ''Bamako'' shows a community “court” where the people of Mali can find justice. “''Equality, full respect for human rights and the active involvement of ordinary citizens are needed to ensure social justice, and are necessary for any social and economic development. For this reason the jury has decided to award the FACE award to Bamako / The Court''”&lt;ref name="coe2007"/&gt;

'''Food testing strips''' are products that help determine whether or not food contains bacteria that can cause [[foodborne illness]]. These products can typically be used on food, water, and hard surfaces, and are often designed for quick and easy home and commercial use.

==Categories==
Currently, there are two categories of food testing strips on the market.

One type of food testing strip is an assay enzyme reactant test. This test requires the food testing strip to be dipped into a blended mixture of food or test samples, distilled water and a reagent. These strips are designed specifically to detect those strains of ''[[Escherichia coli|E.coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' that are harmful to humans.

A second type of food testing strip is a gram-negative swab, which is usually administered directly to the food itself. Gram-negative swabs generally work faster than enzyme reactant strips, but they differ in that the gram-negative swabs are designed to detect a broad group of organisms, not just those that can cause foodborne illness in humans.

&lt;!-- images currently missing: [[Image:Salmonella strip wiki.JPG|thumb|220px|left|Sample Salmonella Test Strip]][[Image: E-Coli_strip_wiki.JPG|thumb|220px|Sample E.coli Test Strip]] --&gt;

== Usage ==
The enzyme reactant test strips react when the buffer solution breaks the bacterial wall. This breach releases enzymes, which react upon contact to the enzyme test strips.

The gram-negative reactant activates when components of the gram-negative cell wall or specific enzymes are present, causing the swab itself to change color.  This is not directly indicative of the presence or absence of human pathogen in the test sample. 

People are now working on new ways to enhance these pathogen strips with silk pills and new nano-fiber technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2234">The '''Forum on Early Warning and Early Response (FEWER)''' was established in 1997 as a [[non-profit organization]] in response to the [[Rwandan genocide]] in 1994. Focusing on [[conflict early warning]], the brainchild of [[Kumar Rupesinghe]], Howard Adelman, and Sharon Rusu, became a network of 35 organisations worldwide and catalysed the creation of early warning and response networks in the [[Caucasus]] (led by EAWARN/[[Russian Academy of Sciences]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eawarn.ru EAWARN - Network for Ethnic Monitoring and Early Warning of Conflict&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes region of Africa]] (led by the Africa Peace Forum),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amaniafrika.org Africa Peace Forum&lt;/ref&gt; and [[west Africa]] (led by [[West Africa Network for Peacebuilding]] (WANEP).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wanep.org West Africa Network for Peacebuilding&lt;/ref&gt;

FEWER and its network members publish regular early warning reports from these regions, host strategic roundtables for integrated responses to conflict, and implemented a conflict-sensitive development research programme with Saferworld, [[International Alert]], Africa Peace Forum, [[Consortium of Humanitarian Agencies]], and Center for Conflict Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conflictsensitivity.org/content/about-us Conflict Sensitivity Consortium - About Us&lt;/ref&gt;

The FEWER Secretariat was first hosted by International Alert&lt;ref&gt;http://www.international-alert.org International Alert&lt;/ref&gt; in London with funding from the Winston Foundation for World Peace and the [[Swedish Foreign Ministry]]. It then moved to independent premises on Brick Lane and was headed until May 2003 by [[David Nyheim]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.incasconsulting.com INCAS Consulting&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Georg Frerks and Marcel Smits. In June 2004, the FEWER Board oversaw the closure of the London Secretariat and the decentralisation of early warning activities to FEWER's [[Moscow]] and [[Nairobi]] offices.

The '''Fund for Peace''' is a [[US]] [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] research and educational institution. Founded in 1957, FFP "works to prevent violent conflict and promote sustainable [[International security|security]]."

The Fund for Peace works towards sustainable security and development in [[failed state]]s by focusing on conflict assessment and early warning, transnational threats, [[peacekeeping]], and security and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Fund for Peace [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=435&amp;Itemid=598 "Mission"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fund for Peace maintains programs in [[Nigeria]], [[Uganda]], [[Liberia]], and works with private business in conflict zones to better secure the interests of businesses, local populations, and their governments.

FFP publishes the annual [[Failed States Index|Fragile States Index]], used by researchers, educators, and governments across the world.

==History==
The Fund for Peace was founded in 1957 by Randolph Compton. The organization was created in the memory of Randolph Compton's youngest son, John Parker Compton, who was killed in [[World War II]]. At a young age, John Parker wrote an essay, discussing the effects of war and the need for human civilization to embrace other methods of conflict resolution. After John Parker's death, Compton created the Fund for Peace, an organization based on the ideals of justice, environment, peace, and population.&lt;ref&gt;Fund for Peace [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=96 "History"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant programs==

===The Fragile States Index===
The [[Failed States Index|Fragile States Index]] assesses the pressures experienced by nations based on social, economic, and political indicators such as demographic pressures, refugee flows, uneven economic development or severe economic decline, and human rights, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/fundforpeace/docs/cr-10-97-ca-conflictassessmentindicators-1105c/2 |title=Conflict Assessment Indicators Pocket Guide |publisher=Issuu.com |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Failed States Index" debuted in 2005 with a limited assessment of approximately 75 countries; this was expanded to 146 countries in 2006, and then to 177 countries the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fsi.fundforpeace.org/faq-01-how-many-countries-in-fsi|title=How Many Countries are Included in the Fragile States Index?|website=fsi.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Sudan was added to the assessment in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.fundforpeace.org/fsi12-southsudan|title=An Inauspicious Welcome to South Sudan|website=library.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, The Fund for Peace announced that the ranking would be renamed "''Fragile'' States Index", claiming that the controversial term 'failed' had "[become] a distraction away from the point of the Index, which is to encourage discussions that support an increase in human security and improved livelihoods."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.fundforpeace.org/blog-20140528-fsirenamed|title=Renaming the Failed States Index|website=library.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fragile States Index uses color-coded maps, tables, and a four level-ranking system ("Alert," "Warning," "Moderate," "Sustainable") to determine the current conditions and negative potential in the future. All four nations on high "Alert" are a part of the African continent: [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. At the "Warning" level were many Latin American or former Soviet nations, including [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Mexico]]. At "Moderate" were the [[United States]] and several European states, such as [[Latvia]], [[Poland]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]]. Only a few nations, such as the Scandinavian countries, [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] were rated as "Sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundforpeace.org/global/?q=fsi-grid2011 |title=The Failed States Index 2011 Interactive Grid |publisher=The Fund for Peace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fragile States Index is subject to criticism, in part, because it takes institutions and data to draw its conclusions, as opposed to the Human Development Index or other more telling signs. The FSI is checked against human analysis.

===UNLocK===
UNLocK  links global information technologies with local social networks for the benefits of stakeholders.  FFP conducts workshops in the conflict-affected countries of [[Liberia]], [[Uganda]], and [[Nigeria]], training local participants in the Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST).  They train others at the community level.  Data collected from field reports by the participants are analyzed for signs of early-warning conflict.  The aggregate data is privately disseminated back to the participants and used to resolve disputes, identify priority issues at the community level, and as a way to obtain more immediate early warning and conflict prevention information.

While the recent elections in [[Nigeria]] were widely recognized as a major step forward in the difficult journey toward democracy, UNLocK Nigeria provided a ground-level view of challenges that remained, including incidents of ballot box snatching, vote-buying, abductions, and violence.  This report focuses on the [[Niger Delta|Niger Delta Region]], with a particular emphasis on the [[Akwa Ibom State|Akwa Ibom]] and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundforpeace.org/global/library/cr-11-18-ul-unlocknigeria-1106a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

CSTC performs ground research in the [[Black Sea]]/[[South Caucasus|South Caucasus region]], the [[Triple Frontier|Tri-border area of Latin American]], [[East Africa|East]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], and [[Southeast Asia]].  It partners with regional and sub regional organizations like [[NATO]], the [[European Union|EU]], and [[african union|the African Union]].

The Center for the Study of Threat Convergence is funded by the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], and the [[Ploughshares Fund]].

===Business and FFP===
Created in 1997, the '''Human Rights and Business Roundtable''' brings together businesses and human rights organizations to ensure compliance with international standards, particularly in regard to the conduct of security forces in and around industrial operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundforpeace.org/global/?q=program-hrbrt |title=Human Rights and Business Roundtable |publisher=The Fund for Peace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It recognizes the challenges faced, particularly in the extractive industries, in balancing human rights and security.  FFP works with various private companies in the oil, mining, agribusiness, renewable energy, and infrastructure sectors in both stable and conflict zones around the world. The '''Sustainable Development &amp; Security''' program supports companies in their development of human rights and security policies, conflict and human rights assessments, community relations and stakeholder engagement, and monitoring and reporting mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sds.fundforpeace.org/sds|title=Sustainable Development &amp; Security {{!}} The Fund for Peace|website=sds.fundforpeace.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; FFP is a long-standing civil society participant of the [[Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|Voluntary Principles on Security &amp; Human Rights]] initiative, and currently serves on the initiative's Steering Committee and Board of Directors.

===CAST===
For [[Conflict analysis|conflict assessment]], the Fund for Peace utilizes the Conflict Assessment System Tool (CAST). CAST was created in 1996 as a system of locating and analyzing potential conflicts in [[failed states]]. It works by incorporating "theoretical rationale, a conceptual framework, quantitative and qualitative indicators...and a rating system for trend analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundforpeace.org/cast/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Conflict Assessment System Tool - About CAST |publisher=The Fund for Peace |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; "  However, CAST may be criticized for putting too much emphasis on technology and equations, and not enough on the human analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jennifer [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=241795 "From Nation State to Failed State"], Columbia Human Rights Law Review, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, CAST is a tool that remains static, despite the specific conflict at hand. Each case is unique, and CAST does not have the mathematical ability to assess the uniqueness and specific needs of varying failed states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=145], The Fund for Peace, CAST.&lt;/ref&gt;

FFP maintains relationships with the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[South Korea]]n government, among others.

==Past programs==

===Genocide prevention===
As the Fund for Peace works in regions prone to genocide, the organization developed a relationship with the [https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/index.shtml Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/index.shtml "Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Mission Statement"] UN Official Website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Adviser played a role in researching and delivering information to aid the Special Adviser in his responsibilities. The Special Adviser and the Fund for Peace were involved in researching human rights violations, sharing information and giving warnings to the Secretary General and the Security Council on matters of genocide, and making recommendations on courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=444&amp;Itemid=892], The Fund for Peace, Genocide Prevention.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace and Stability Operations Project===
Originally called the Regional Responses to Internal War Project, the program looks to shed light on regional organizations and their "political will" to maintain peaceful relations. The Peace and Stability Operations Project also serves to form relationships with actors in other sectors, such as scholars, research institutions, journalists, and experts. The Fund for Peace believes that, through these extended relationships, the international community can work together to maintain peace in typically violent areas. The Fund for Peace has been successful in advancing the international dialogue on peacekeeping by holding public meetings with international representatives, performing research missions in over thirty-five countries, and holding workshops. By collaborating with actors in other sectors, the Fund for Peace is able to gather the ideas and opinions of other experts and publish them in their issues of [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=125&amp;Itemid=173 Reality Check: Diverse Voices on Internal Conflict].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=208&amp;Itemid=257], The Fund for Peace, Peace and Stability Operations Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States foreign policy===
The second initiative is the Use and Purpose of American Power. The goal of this initiative is to promote ongoing dialogue and debate on the role of the United States in the international arena. It does so by asking four questions:
* What are our interests and values as we act in the world?
* What are the specific goals we should set and the things we should do?
* What tools do we use to achieve these?
* How as Americans do we influence events as they so obviously affect us?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=309&amp;Itemid=566], the Fund for Peace, Use and Purpose of American Power.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Use and Purpose of American Power also has three main components. The first is the National Dialogue forums. In 2008 and 2009, the Fund for Peace partnered up with local organizations, such as chambers of commerce and universities, across the country and organized "'traveling town halls.'" The purpose of these were to discuss topics relating to the presidential election, and the condition of the United States and its population. The format of the forums were designed to encourage participation and dialogue on behalf of Americans to actively and critically think about their role, their country's condition, and the government's responsibility. Throughout two years, the National Dialogue forums took place in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Mexico, Alabama, Idaho, Florida, and California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=328&amp;Itemid=563], The Fund for Peace, National Dialogue Forums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second component is the American Conversation. While the National Dialogue forums were designed to spark interest and discussion, the purpose of the American Conversation is an online discussion hosted by [https://groups.google.com/group/american-conversation?hl=en Google Groups] to continue conversations that began at the National Dialogue forums. The American Conversation is an effort by the Fund for Peace to encourage ongoing critical thinking in the minds of Americans and their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=331&amp;Itemid=879], The Fund for Peace, American Conversation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third component of the Use and Purpose of American Power is the Final Report. The Final Report is a summary of the National Dialogue forums and the ideas and concepts presented at the forums. The Final Report, titled [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/images/pdf/use_and_purpose_of_american_power_final_report.pdf The Use and Purpose of American Power in the 21st Century] highlights five main points:
* "Economic security is vital to American national security; but America’s structural economic problems prevent it from operating from a position of strength in the world."
* "National leaders should first ‘take care of their own’ because of the gravity of the economic challenges; however, America’s welfare is also closely tied to the world economy."
* "Nation-building and democracy-building projects are a mission impossible; still, the U.S. should promote good governance, human rights, and equitable development."
* "Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) are lesser threats than America’s economic problems."
* "U.S. leaders’ inability to adapt to new global realities poses the greatest challenge to America’s standing in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=448&amp;Itemid=897], The Fund for Peace, Final Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund for Peace's efforts in United States foreign policy is based on the fear of "spillover" and the influence and multiplication of failed states.&lt;ref&gt;Mallaby, Sebastian [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/57800/sebastian-mallaby/the-reluctant-imperialist-terrorism-failed-states-and-the-case-f "The Reluctant Imperialist"], Foreign Affairs, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Dialogue forums were sponsored by the Fund for Peace. The Final Report was funded by the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=448&amp;Itemid=897], The Fund for Peace, Funding.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
Another initiative to promote human rights is the Globalization and Human Rights Series. This consists of publications dedicated to discussing pertinent topics relating to human rights, the impact of failing states, and corruption. Four issues have been published since 2005 in an effort to continue to educate the industries and the public on the harmful effects of failing governments, and the need for the recognition of, and commitment to, human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=112&amp;Itemid=156], The Fund for Peace, Globalization and Human Rights Series.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Fund for Peace is a supporter of the [[Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights]], which guides businesses who voluntarily participate on how to align their security practices with human rights considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/ "Voluntary Principles"] The Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights|Voluntary Principles]] are important because of the potentially harmful impacts security practices can have when operating in a failed state or conflict zone, but also because the international community is putting increasing emphasis on the rights of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=438&amp;Itemid=601], The Fund for Peace, Civil Society and Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other collaboration==
The Fund for Peace does not limit its partnerships to select sectors. The organization has collaborated with [[Georgetown University]]'s Center for Peace and Security Studies and the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]. Together, the three institutions developed a [http://www.press.georgetown.edu/book/georgetown/peace-operations thesis on the increased participation of regional organizations] and their member states in promoting peacekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=209&amp;Itemid=248], The Fund for Peace, ''Peace Operations: Trends, Progress, and Prospects''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund for Peace partnered with the [[Centre for International Governance Innovation]] in 2007. From September 4–6, thirty participants from varying Middle Eastern countries, as well as Australia, the United States, and Canada, met in Istanbul, Turkey. The participants came from academia, international organizations, the Arab League, the United Nations, governments, and human rights organizations. The representatives were faced with the task of determining what steps should be taken to efficiently protect civilians. The conference promoted a sense of international unity by asking the representatives to leave aside their political ideologies and keep the welfare of human beings as their priority. The conference ended with the unanimous support of [[International Humanitarian Law]] and the [http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/images/pdf/the%20bosphorous%20consensus%20final%2011.07.07.pdf Bosphorous Consensus].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=192&amp;Itemid=252], The Fund for Peace, the Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund for Peace has also partnered with Logos Technologies, the [[United States Institute of Peace]], the [[PKSOI|United States Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute]], the [[Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization|U.S. State Department Office of the Coordinator for Stabilization and Reconstruction]], and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] to create a metrics framework for peacekeeping. The project includes concepts from the book ''The Quest for Viable Peace'' with the theoretical approach of the Fund for Peace's CAST methodology. The organizations involved are interested in helping governments determine the outcome of Stabilization and Reconstruction Operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=191&amp;Itemid=253], The Fund for Peace, Metrics for Stability.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Sylvester Viereck''' (December 31, 1884 – March 18, 1962) was a German-American poet, writer, and pro-Nazi propagandist.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Phyllis (1971). "George Sylvester Viereck: The Psychology of a German-American Militant", ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 59–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
George Viereck was born in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], to a German father and American-born mother. His father Louis, born out of wedlock to German actress Edwina Viereck, was reputed to be a son of [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]]. Another relative of the [[Hohenzollern]] family assumed legal paternity of the boy. In the 1870s, Louis Viereck joined the [[Marxist]] socialist movement. George Viereck began writing poetry when he was eleven. His heroes were Jesus Christ, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Oscar Wilde. In 1896, Louis Viereck emigrated to the United States; his U.S.-born wife Laura and their twelve-year-old son George followed in 1897.

While still in college, in 1904, George Sylvester Viereck, with the help of literary critic [[Ludwig Lewisohn]], published his first collection of poems.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, Phyllis (1979). ''States of Belonging: German-American Intellectuals and the First World War'', Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]] in 1906. The next year his collection ''Nineveh and Other Poems'' (1907) won Viereck national fame. A number were written in the style of the [[Uranian poetry|Uranian male love poetry]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Mader, D. H. (2005). "The Greek Mirror: Uranians and their use of Greece", in Verstraete and Provencal, (ed.) ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity'', Psychology Press, p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; 
''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' called Viereck "the most widely-discussed young literary man in the United States today".&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, Tom (2005). ''The Orientalist. Solving the Mystery of a Strange and Dangerous Life''. New York: Random House, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1907 and 1912, Viereck turned into a [[Germanophile]]. In 1908, he published the best-selling ''Confessions of a Barbarian''. Viereck lectured at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] on American poetry in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Gertz, Elmer (1978). ''The Odyssey of a Barbarian: The Biography of George Sylvester Viereck'', Prometheus Books, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; For his support of Germany and pacifism, Viereck was expelled from several social clubs and fraternal organizations, and had a falling out with a close friend, poet [[Blanche Shoemaker Wagstaff]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/07/26/98269833.pdf "Viereck Expelled by Author's League"], ''The New York Times'', July 26, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/08/16/97018266.pdf "N.Y.A.C Expels Viereck"], ''The New York Times'', August 16, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wagstaff"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://viereckproject.wikispaces.com/Blanche+Shoemaker+Wagstaff |title=Blanche Shoemaker Wagstaff |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-03-13 |website=ViereckProject |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313023059/http://viereckproject.wikispaces.com/Blanche+Shoemaker+Wagstaff |archivedate=March 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]] he edited a German-sponsored weekly magazine, ''[[The Fatherland]]'' with a claimed circulation of 80,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffery|first1=Keith|title=1916: A Global History|date=26 January 2016|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|location=5736|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 1918, a lynch mob stormed Viereck's house in Mount Vernon, forcing him to seek refuge in a New York City hotel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=h-shgape&amp;month=0003&amp;week=a&amp;msg=b%2BurRQGOLUJM0%2B/LR3n0tw&amp;user=&amp;pw= American National Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, shortly after the Great War, he was expelled from the [[Poetry Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Monroe, Harriet (1919). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20572006 "The Viereck Incident"], ''Poetry'', Vol. 13, No. 5, pp. 265–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International success===
In 1923, Viereck published a popular-science book entitled ''Rejuvenation: How [[Eugen Steinach|Steinach]] Makes People Young'', which drew the attention of [[Sigmund Freud]],&lt;ref&gt;Gertz (1978), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote Viereck asking if he would write a similar book about psychoanalysis. Viereck traveled to Vienna to interview Freud, and then went to Munich to interview [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Niel M. (1972). ''George Sylvester Viereck: German-American Propagandist'', University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-1920s, Viereck went on several additional tours of Europe, interviewing Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]], [[Georges Clemenceau]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Albert Moll (German psychiatrist)|Albert Moll]], [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], and [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Reiss (2005), pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt; Viereck became close friends with [[Nikola Tesla]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Margaret &amp; Robert Uth (2001). ''Tesla: Master of Lightning''. Barnes &amp; Noble Books, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife. He dedicated his poem "[[Fragments of Olympian Gossip]]" to Viereck, a work in which Tesla ridiculed the scientific establishment of the day.

===Support for Hitler===
Viereck founded two publications, ''The International'' (of which the notorious poet and mage [[Aleister Crowley]] was a contributing editor for a time) and ''[[The Fatherland]]'', which argued the German cause during [[World War I]]. Viereck became a well-known supporter of National Socialism. In 1933, Viereck again met with Hitler, now Germany's leader, in Berlin, and in 1934, he gave a speech to twenty thousand "Friends of the New Germany" at New York's Madison Square Garden, in which he compared Hitler to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and told his audience to sympathize with National Socialism without being antisemites. His Jewish friends denounced him as "George Swastika Viereck", but he continued to promote National Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss (2005), pp. 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, he was indicted in the U.S. for a violation of the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] when he set up his publishing house, Flanders Hall, in [[Scotch Plains, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Neil M. (1968). [http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/bai/johnson2.htm ''George Sylvester Viereck: Poet and Propagandist''] in ''Books at Iowa'', no. 9, pp. 22–36.&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted in 1942 for this failure to register with the [[U. S. Department of State]] as a National Socialist agent.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, John Roy (1943). ''Under Cover''. Philadelphia: The Blakiston Company.&lt;/ref&gt; He was imprisoned from 1942 to 1947.

===Post war===
Viereck's memoir of life in prison, ''Men Into Beasts'', was published as a paperback original by [[Fawcett Publications]] in 1952. The book is a general memoir of discomfort, loss of [[Human dignity|dignity]], and brutality in prison life. The front matter and backcover text focuses on the [[situational homosexuality]] and [[male rape]] described in the book (witnessed, not experienced, by Viereck). The book, while a memoir, is thus the first original title of 1950s [[gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]], an emerging genre in that decade.

Viereck also published a [[vampire]] novel, ''The House of the Vampire'' (1907), which is one of the first [[psychic vampire]] stories where a vampire feeds off more than just blood.&lt;ref&gt;Lampert-Weissig, Lisa (2013).

==Family==
His son, [[Peter Viereck]], was a historian, political writer and poet. A 2005 ''[[The New Yorker]]'' article discusses how the younger Viereck both rejected and was shaped by the ideologies of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, Tom (2005).

==Reception==
The poem "Slaves" published in the 1924 collection ''The Three Sphinxes and Other Poems'' inspired the title of the 1968 psychothriller ''[[Twisted Nerve]]'', and is quoted several times in the film:
:''A twisted nerve, a ganglion gone awry,
:''Predestinates the sinner and the saint.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8486">'''Germ theory denialism''' is the belief that [[Microorganism|germs]] do not cause infectious disease, and that the [[germ theory of disease]] is wrong.{{R|"novella"}} It usually involves arguing that [[Louis Pasteur]]'s model of infectious disease was wrong, and that [[Antoine Béchamp]]'s was right. In fact, its origins are rooted in Béchamp's empirically disproved (in the context of disease) theory of [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphism]]. {{R|"gorski"}} Another obsolete variation is known as [[terrain theory]] and postulates that diseased tissue attracts germs rather than being caused by it.{{R|"brock"}}

== About ==

Germ theory denialism (GTD) is as old as germ theory itself beginning with the rivalry of Pasteur and Béchamp. Pasteur's work in preventing beverage contamination led him to discover that it was due to [[microorganisms]] and led him down the path to be the first scientist to show the theory was valid and popularize it in Europe.{{R|"gorski"}} Although he was not the first to have the idea and scientists such as [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] (had the idea that [[fomites]] could harbor the seeds of contagion), [[Agostino Bassi]] (discovered the [[muscardine]] disease of silkworms was caused by a fungus that was named [[Beauveria bassiana]]), [[Friedrich Henle]] (developed the concepts of contagium vivum and contagium animatum), and others had earlier proposed ideas similar to germ theory.{{R|"contagion"}}{{R|"guthrie"}}

Béchamp strongly contested this view offering up a competing idea known as the pleomorphic theory of disease. This theory says that all life is based on forms that a certain class of organisms take during stages of their life-cycles and that germs are attracted to the environment of diseased tissue rather than being the cause of it.{{R|"bechamp"}} Proponents of this idea insist microbes that live in an organism go through the same stages of their development. According to [[Günther Enderlein]] they are as follows: [[Colloid]] — [[microbe]] (primitive phase), [[bacteria]] (middle phase), and [[fungus]] (end phase).{{R|"synth"}}

Earlier non-germ theories, in addition to the earlier idea of [[Miasma theory|miasma]], focused on [[spontaneous generation]] - the idea that living matter could arise from non-living - and the terrain theory variation of Béchamp's ideas. Pasteur disproved spontaneous generation with a series of experiments in the 1870s.{{R|"contagion"}} However, understanding the cause of a sickness does not always immediately lead to effective treatment of sickness and the great decline in mortality during the 19th century is mostly associated with improvement in hygiene and cleanliness. In fact, one of the first movements to deny the germ theory was the Sanitary Movement, and was nevertheless central in developing America's [[public health]] infrastructure. By providing clean water and sanitation there was less of an environment for [[pathogens]] to develop and [[mortality rates]] fell dramatically.{{R|"pizzi"}}

GTD has significant overlap with [[chiropractic]] practice. Many [[chiropractor]]s believe [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to be a function of spine alignment and the brain's ability to communicate efficiently with the body and that it has little to nothing to do with external [[pathogen]]s.{{R|"barrett"}}

A common thread among many alternative medicine proponents is [[Anti-vaccine movement|opposition to vaccines]] and many use GTD to justify their claims.{{R|"crislip"}} Germ theory deniers make many claims about the biological underpinnings of the theory and the historical record{{R|"fielder"}}{{R|"arizona"}} that are at odds with what is accepted by most modern scientists and historians.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"gorski"}}{{R|"contagion"}}{{R|"hodkinson"}} Another popular claim from the anti-vaccine community is that all diseases are caused by [[Bacteremia|toxemia]] due to inadequate diet and health practices.{{R|"hall"}}

== Criticism ==

[[Harriet Hall]] published an article in ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' where she describes her experience arguing with germ theory deniers.{{R|"hall"}}

Members of the medical community that are also skeptics, such as [[David Gorski]] and [[Steven Novella]], point out that denying germ theory is counter to years of experiments and the prevailing opinion of most doctors and scientists.{{R|"novella"}}{{R|"gorski"}}{{R|"orac"}}

}}'''Glenys Ann Tomasetti''' (1929 &amp;ndash; 2003), known as Glen Tomasetti, was an Australian [[singer-songwriter]], author and political activist. During the 1960s she appeared weekly on commercial television, performing satirical political songs. She became a household name in 1967 after refusing to pay a portion of her taxes in protest against Australia's involvement in the war in Vietnam. Although best known for her folk music and political activism, she was also an esteemed novelist and poet.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Glen Tomasetti was born in Melbourne on 21 May 1929.

=== Musical career ===
Tomasetti began performing as a singer-songwriter and guitarist in the late 1950s. In the early 1960s she organised folk music concerts at the Emerald Hill Theatre in [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]], a centre of the 1960s Melbourne folk scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://folkstream.com/reviews/glen/|title=Australian Folk Songs: Glen Tomassetti|website=folkstream.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1960s she appeared weekly on Channel Seven TV, performing a topical political song after the general news broadcast.&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/30/1056825338016.html|title=Singer-writer Tomasetti dies, aged 74|website=The Age|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-war activism and 1967 court case ===
[[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia]] entered the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]] in 1962 in support of the USA, and in 1965 began sending conscripted servicemen to Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/event/vietnam|title=Vietnam War 1962–75 {{!}} The Australian War Memorial|website=www.awm.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasetti became involved in the [[Save Our Sons]] organisation, a group of women opposed to [[Conscription in Australia|military conscription]], and in December 1965 she helped to organise the "Songs of Peace and Love" protest concert at the Sidney [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl|Myer Music Bowl]] in Melbourne, described as "the first major response of the folk scene" to Australia's military involvement in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.warrenfahey.com.au/the-great-folk-revival5/|title=THE GREAT FOLK REVIVAL5 {{!}} Warren Fahey|website=www.warrenfahey.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 Tomasetti was prosecuted after refusing to pay one sixth of her taxes on the grounds that one sixth of the federal budget was funding Australia's military presence in Vietnam. In court she argued that Australia's participation in the Vietnam War violated its international legal obligations as a member of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Public figures such as [[Joan Baez]] had made similar protests in the USA, but Tomasetti's prosecution was "believed to be the first case of its kind in Australia", according to a contemporary news report.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article237359734|title=VIETNAM: PROTEST AND TRAGEDY|date=29 November 1967|newspaper=[[Tribune]]|accessdate=24 February 2018|issue=1537|location=New South Wales, Australia|page=4|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasetti was eventually ordered to pay the unpaid taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article107035022|title=Singer's tax protest rejected|date=2 December 1967|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|accessdate=24 February 2018|issue=11,861|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=42,|page=8|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist activism ===
Many of Tomasetti's songs dealt with feminism and the situation of Australian women. Perhaps the best known is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_zb7OQogXw "Don't be too polite, girls"], a call for [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]] and a feminist call to arms. Sung to the tune of a classic 19th century Australian [[shearing]] ballad ("All among the wool, boys"), it was inspired by the first ruling on equal pay in Australia, a 1969 Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration ruling that granted equal pay to only 18% of Australian women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/647833031|title=Making women count : a history of the Women's Electoral Lobby|first=Marian|last=Sawer|date=2008|publisher=UNSW Press|others=Radford, Gail.|year=|isbn=9780868409436|location=Sydney|pages=195|oclc=647833031}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was still being sung by the Melbourne Trade Union Choir at the time of Tomasetti's death in 2003.&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;

'''Grameen Bank''' ({{lang-bn|গ্রামীণ বাংক}}) is a [[microfinance]] organisation and [[community development bank]] founded in [[Bangladesh]]. It makes small loans (known as [[microcredit]] or "grameencredit")&lt;ref name="What is Microcredit" /&gt; to the impoverished without requiring [[collateral (finance)|collateral]].

Grameen Bank originated in 1976, in the work of Professor [[Muhammad Yunus]] at [[University of Chittagong]], who launched a [[research project]] to study how to design a credit delivery system to provide banking services to the rural poor. In October 1983 the Grameen Bank was authorised by national legislation to operate as an independent bank.

The bank grew significantly between 2003 and 2007. As of January 2011, the total borrowers of the bank number 8.4&amp;nbsp;million, and 97% of those are women.&lt;ref name="grag"/&gt; In 1998 the Bank's "Low-cost Housing Program" won a [[World Habitat Award]]. In 2006, the bank and its founder, Muhammad Yunus, were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/press.html |title=The Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 |publisher=The Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Muhammad Yunus]] was inspired during the [[Bangladesh famine of 1974]] to make a small loan of US$27 to a group of 42 families as start-up money so that they could make items for sale, without the burdens of high interest under [[predatory lending]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Anand Giridharas |author2=Keith Bradsher |date=13 October 2006 |title=Microloan Pioneer and His Bank Win Nobel Peace Prize |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/13/business/14nobelcnd.html |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=13 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yunus believed that making such loans available to a larger population could stimulate businesses and reduce the widespread rural poverty in Bangladesh.
[[File:Muhammad yunus at weforum.jpg|thumb|Nobel Laureate [[Muhammad Yunus]], the bank's founder]]
Yunus developed the principles of the Grameen Bank from his research and experience. ''Grameen Bank'' is [[Bengali language|Bengali]] for "Rural" or "Village" Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grameen-info.org/history/|title=History|website=Grameen Bank |accessdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to expand microcredit as a research project together with the Rural Economics Project at Bangladesh's [[University of Chittagong]] to test his method for providing credit and banking services to the rural poor. In 1976, the village of Jobra and other villages near the University of Chittagong became the first areas eligible for service from Grameen Bank.&lt;ref name="p4"&gt;{{cite book |last= Rahman |first= Aminur |date=2001 |title=Women and Microcredit in Rural Bangladesh: Anthropological Study of Grameen Bank Lending |location=[[Boulder, Colorado]] |publisher=[[Westview Press]] |page=4 |isbn=0-8133-3930-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proving successful, the Bank project, with support from [[Bangladesh Bank]], was extended in 1979 to the [[Tangail District]] (to the north of the capital, [[Dhaka]]).&lt;ref name="p4"/&gt; The bank's success continued and its services were extended to other districts of Bangladesh.

By a Bangladeshi government ordinance on 2 October 1983, the project was authorised and established as an independent bank.&lt;ref name="p4"/&gt; Bankers [[Ron Grzywinski]] and [[Mary Houghton]] of [[ShoreBank]], a community development bank in Chicago, helped Yunus with the official incorporation of the bank under a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brandon Glenn |date=16 October 2006 |title=ShoreBank leaders had hand in Nobel prize |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20061016/NEWS01/200022455 |newspaper=Chicago Business News |accessdate=15 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank's repayment rate suffered from the economic disruption following the 1998 flood in Bangladesh, but it recovered in the subsequent years. By the beginning of 2005, the bank had loaned over USD&amp;nbsp;4.7&amp;nbsp;billion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Papa |first=Michael J. |author2=Arvind Singhal |author3=Wendy H.

Retrieved 22 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; to the poor.

In 2011, the [[Government of Bangladesh|Bangladesh Government]] forced Yunus to resign from Grameen Bank, saying that at age 72, he was years beyond the legal limit for the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Polgreen, Lydia |author2=Bajaj,  |date=2 March 2011 |title=Microcredit Pioneer Ousted, Head of Bangladeshi Bank Says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/world/asia/03yunus.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, the Bank had about 2,600 branches and nine million borrowers, with a repayment rate of 99.6%. 97% of the borrowers were women. The Bank has been active in 97% of the villages of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosic|first1=Miriam|title='We are all entrepreneurs': Muhammad Yunus on changing the world, one microloan at a time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/mar/29/we-are-all-entrepreneurs-muhammad-yunus-on-changing-the-world-one-microloan-at-a-time|website=Guardian|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.grameen-info.org/about-us/|website=Grameem Bank|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success has inspired similar projects in more than 40 countries around the world, including a World Bank initiative to finance Grameen-type schemes.&lt;ref name="P.S"&gt;{{cite book |last=Khandker |first=Shahidur R. |author2=Baqui, M.

Grameen Bank is now expanding into wealthy countries, as well. As of 2017, [[Grameen America]] had 19 branches in eleven US cities. Its nearly 100,000 borrowers were all women.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

==Funding==

The bank has gained its funding from different sources, and the main contributors have shifted over time. In the initial years, donor agencies used to provide the bulk of capital at low rates. By the mid-1990s, the bank started to get most of its funding from the central bank of Bangladesh. More recently, Grameen has started bond sales as a source of finance. The bonds are implicitly subsidised, as they are guaranteed by the Government of Bangladesh, and still they are sold above the bank rate.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal

== Application of microcredit ==
Grameen Bank is founded on the principle that loans are better than charity to interrupt poverty: they offer people the opportunity to take initiatives in business or agriculture, which provide earnings and enable them to pay off the debt.

The bank is founded on the belief that people have endless potential, and unleashing their creativity and initiative helps them end poverty.&lt;ref name="What is Microcredit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=108 |title=What is Microcredit ? |publisher=Grameen Bank |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Grameen has offered credit to classes of people formerly underserved: the poor, women, illiterate, and unemployed people. Access to credit is based on reasonable terms, such as the group lending system and weekly-instalment payments, with reasonably long terms of loans, enabling the poor to build on their existing skills to earn better income in each cycle of loans.&lt;ref name="What is Microcredit"/&gt;

Grameen's objective has been to promote financial independence among the poor. Yunus encourages all borrowers to become savers, so that their local capital can be converted into new loans to others. Since 1995, Grameen has funded 90 percent of its loans with interest income and deposits collected, aligning the interests of its new borrowers and depositor-shareholders. Grameen converts deposits made in villages into loans for the more needy in the villages (Yunus and Jolis 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yunus |first=Muhammad |date=2003 |title=Halving poverty by 2015—We can actually make it happen |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0035853032000111099.pdf |format=PDF |journal=The Round Table: The Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=92 |issue=370 |pages=363–375 |doi=10.1080/0035853032000111099 |quote=Financially, [Grameen Bank] is self-reliant—it has stopped taking donor money since 1995, stopped taking loans from the domestic market since 1998. It has enough deposits to carry out its lending programme.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It targets the poorest of the poor, with a particular emphasis on women, who receive 95 percent of the bank's loans. Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high compared to that of traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.&lt;ref name="NF"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding and Dealing with High Interest Rates on Microcredit – A Note to Policy Makers in the Asia and Pacific Region|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240640108_Understanding_and_Dealing_with_High_Interest_Rates_on_Microcredit|format=PDF|last= Fernando|first= Nimal A.|date=May 2006 |publisher=[[Asian Development Bank|ADB]] |location=[[Manila]], [[Philippines]]|page=8|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grameen has diversified the types of loans it makes. It supports hand-powered wells and loans to support the enterprises of Grameen members' immediate relatives. It has found that seasonal agricultural loans and lease-to-own agreements for equipment and livestock help the poor establish better agriculture. The bank has set a new goal: to make each of its branch locations free of poverty, as defined by benchmarks such as having adequate food and access to clean water and latrines.

Grameen Bank is best known for its system of [[solidarity lending]].&lt;ref name="P.S"/&gt; The Bank also incorporates a set of values embodied in [[Bangladesh]] by the ''Sixteen Decisions''.&lt;ref&gt;Siddiqui, Kamal, ''An Evaluation of the Grameen Bank Operation'' (Dhaka: National Institute of Local Government, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; At every branch of Grameen Bank, the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow to follow them. As a result of the Sixteen Decisions, Grameen borrowers have been encouraged to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by sending them to school. Since the Grameen Bank embraced the Sixteen Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This in turn helps bring about social change, and educate the next generation.

Solidarity lending is a cornerstone of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group is not required to give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hossain |first=Mahabub  |title=Credit for Alleviation of Rural Poverty: The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh |origyear=1988 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GkrRrt_ao50C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=grameen+bank |edition= |series= |date= February 1988|publisher=Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI |page=7|language= |isbn=0-89629-067-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[legal instrument]] (i.e. no written contract) is made between Grameen Bank and its borrowers; the system works based on trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oneworldonepeople.org/articles/World%20Poverty/Grameen.htm|title=Grameen Micro-Credit &amp; How to End Poverty from the Roots Up |author=Sinclair, Paul  |date=22 December 2007 |work= |publisher=One World One People  |accessdate=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement the lending, Grameen Bank requires the borrowing members to save very small amounts regularly in a number of funds, designated for emergency, the group, etc. These savings help serve as an insurance against contingencies.&lt;ref name="P.S"/&gt;

In a country in which few women may take out loans from large commercial banks, Grameen has focused on women borrowers; 97% of its members are women.&lt;ref name="grag"/&gt; While a [[World Bank]] study has concluded that women's access to microcredit empowers them through greater access to resources and control over decision making, some other economists argue that the relationship between microcredit and women-empowerment is less straightforward.&lt;ref name="D&amp;S"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Feiner | first = Susan F. | last2 = Barker | first2 = Drucilla K. | title = Microcredit and Women's Poverty | url = http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2006/1106feinerbarker.html | journal = Dollar &amp; Sense, The magazine of Economic Justice | publisher = Economic Affairs Bureau, Inc. | location = Boston, US | publication-date = November–December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, Grameen has had very high payback rates—over 98 percent. However, according to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', in 2001 a fifth of the bank's loans were more than a year overdue.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/pearl112701.htm | title= Grameen Bank, Which Pioneered Loans For the Poor, Has Hit a Repayment Snag |author1=Daniel Perl |author2=Michael M. Phillips | publisher= Wall Street Journal | date= 27 November 2001 | accessdate=25 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grameen says that more than half of its borrowers in Bangladesh (close to 50 million) have risen out of acute poverty thanks to their loan, as measured by such standards as having all children of school age in school, all household members eating three meals a day, a sanitary toilet, a rainproof house, clean drinking water, and the ability to repay a 300 [[taka]]-a-week (around 4 USD) loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.social-capital.net/articles/view.php?viewid=151 |title=Microfinance comes of age |last=Fraser |first=Ian |date=3 August 2007 |work=Cover Story |publisher=Scottish Banker magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007072846/http://www.social-capital.net/articles/view.php?viewid=151 |archivedate=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank is also engaged in social business and entrepreneurship fields. In 2009, the Grameen Creative Lab collaborated with the [[Yunus Centre]] to create the Global Social Business Summit. The meeting has become the main platform for social businesses worldwide to foster discussions, actions and collaborations to develop effective solutions to the most pressing problems plaguing the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Challenge conventional economic models|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/business/challenge-conventional-economic-models-52404|website=The Daily Star|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202015926/http://www.thedailystar.net/business/challenge-conventional-economic-models-52404|archivedate=2 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Village phone program===
The bank has diversified among different applications of microcredit. In the Village Phone program, women entrepreneurs can start businesses to provide wireless payphone service in rural areas. This program earned the bank the 2004 Petersburg Prize worth EUR 100,000, for its contribution of Technology to Development.&lt;ref name="PP04"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.developmentgateway.org/download/249636/Petersberg_winner.pdf|title=Grameen Bank-Village Phone Wins Global Competition for Contribution of Technology to Development |date=27 July 2004 |format=PDF |work= |publisher=Development Gateway Foundation (Washington, DC) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050804020340/http://www.developmentgateway.org/download/249636/Petersberg_winner.pdf |archivedate=4 August 2005 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the press release announcing the prize, the Development Gateway Foundation noted that through this program:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Grameen has created a new class of women entrepreneurs who have raised themselves from poverty. Moreover, it has improved the livelihoods of farmers and others who are provided access to critical market information and lifeline communications previously unattainable in some 28,000 villages of Bangladesh. More than 55,000 phones are currently in operation, with more than 80 million people benefiting from access to market information, news from relatives, and more.&lt;ref name="PP04"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Struggling members program ===
In 2003, Grameen Bank started a new program, different from its traditional group-based lending, exclusively targeted to the beggars in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grameen-info.org/bank/BeggerProgram.html |title=Grameen Bank's Struggling (Beggar) Members Programme |author=[[Muhammad Yunus|Yunus, Muhammad]] |date=July 2005 |publisher=Grameen Communications |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125101333/http://www.grameen-info.org/bank/BeggerProgram.html |archivedate=25 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program is focused on distributing small loans to beggars. The loans are completely interest-free, the repayment period can be arbitrarily long, and the borrower is covered under life insurance free of cost. For example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay back only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barua |first=D.

===Housing loans===

In 1984, Grameen applied to the Central Bank for help setting up a housing loan program for its borrowers. Their application was rejected on the grounds that the $125 suggested loan could not possibly build a suitable living structure.{{sfn|Yunus|2007|p=128|ps=: "In 1984 ... the Grameen Bank applied to the Central Bank for help in introducing a housing program to its borrowers ... The Central Bank rejected our application [because] whatever one built for $125 ... would not add to the 'housing stock of the country.'"}} So Grameen instead proposed the idea of "shelter loans". They were again rejected, this time on the grounds that their borrowers could not afford non-income generating loans. Grameen changed tactics and applied a third time, this time to make "factory loans", the explanation being that borrowers worked from home, so the home was also a factory that made it possible for borrowers to earn income. Grameen was rejected for a third time.{{sfn|Yunus|2007|p=129|ps=: "We sent in a second application [to make] 'shelter loans.' ... [The Central Bank] argued that our borrowers ... could not afford loans that did not generate income to help them pay off their debt ... We said we wanted to offer our borrowers 'factory loans' ... their homes are places of work, we choose to call them factories ... [The Central Bank] rejected our application for a third time."}}

After this third rejection, Yunus, the bank's founder, met personally with the Central Bank governor to plead for their application. When asked if he thought the borrowers would repay the loans, he replied, "Yes, they will. They do. Unlike the rich, the poor cannot risk not repaying. This is the only chance they have." Grameen was then allowed to add housing loans to their range of services.{{sfn|Yunus|2007|p=129-130|ps=: "I arranged for a personal meeting with the Central Bank governor to ask him to override his bureaucrats. 'Are you sure the poor will repay?' the governor asked. 'Yes, they will. They do. Unlike the rich, the poor can't risk not repaying. This is the only chance they have' ... The governor [allowed] Grameen to introduce a housing loan program."}}

As of 1999, Grameen has made housing loans totalling $190&amp;nbsp;million to build over 560,000 homes with near-perfect repayment. By 1989, their average housing loan had grown to  $300. That year, the Grameen housing program received the Aga Khan International Award for Architecture.{{sfn|Yunus|2007|p=130|ps=: "We have extended a total of $190&amp;nbsp;million in loans to build more than 560,000 houses with near-perfect repayment ... Grameen's housing program was chosen in 1989 ... to receive the Aga Khan International Award for Architecture ... By 1989, the size of our typical housing loan had grown to $300."}}

== Grameen Bank's perception of people with economic disadvantages ==

When Muhammad Yunus took the first steps toward establishing Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and began to provide micro-credit loans to those living in abject poverty in the rural area surrounding Jobra, he adopted and maintained two basic premises. First, that credit is a human right; second, that the poor are those who know best how to better their own situation.&lt;ref name="Banker to the poor"&gt;[[Banker to the poor]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty, Muhammad Yunus shows the outlook behind why Grameen Bank runs the way it does, saying, “ When you hold the world in your palm and inspect it only from a birds eye view, you tend to become arrogant, you do not realize things become blurred when viewed from an enormous distance. I opted instead for the” worms eye view.” …  The poor taught me an entirely new economics. I learned about the problems they face from their own perspective. “&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Banker to the Poor|last=Yunus|first=Muhammad|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2007|isbn=978-1-58648-198-8|location=United States of America|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we see his willingness to immerse himself with the people he is aiming to help.   We get our first look at Muhammad Yunus's perception of the absolute poor when he meets Sufiya Begum, a bamboo stool maker who was trapped in poverty's vicious cycle due to a lack of 27 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Banker to the Poor|last=Yunus|first=Muhammad|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2007|isbn=978-1-58648-198-8|location=United States of America|pages=46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is where we find that what will become Grameen bank, is founded upon one man's heart for those that society and big corporations could or would not help.  Taking productive action, Yunus worked with the banks and community around to empower people like Sufiya to be able to apply for credit, and use it in the best and most productive way that she knows how in her unique situation.  Grameen Bank would need to be a bank of unusual standards. It would have to be, as Yunus put it, "an institution that would lend to those that had nothing. "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Banker to the Poor|last=Yunus|first=Muhammad|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2007|isbn=978-1-58648-198-8|location=United States of America|pages=51, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as time progressed, more situations would arise, such as battling for those who were landless, or small-time farmers such as those in Jobra who could not use a deep tube-well that was available to them.

As Grameen bank has developed and expanded in the years since its beginning, it continues to operate on those same two principles. Today, Grameen bank still assumes that when individuals are provided credit, they will be able to initiate upward social mobility for themselves through entrepreneurial endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=128|title=What is Microcredit|date=2 March 2012|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that it does not include intensive rehabilitation training programs for the disadvantaged persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.&lt;ref name="Banker to the poor"/&gt;

The Grameen Bank encourages its members to create a positive impact by becoming actively involved in the politics of their country. According to Muhammad Yunus's book, Banker to the Poor, Yunus commissioned his bank staff to encourage Grameen borrowers to vote; however, the staff were not to influence the voters' decisions on which political party to support. While all Grameen groups are required to exhibit a form of democracy (such as electing a chairperson and secretary), the Grameen staff were surprised to find that borrowers were thrilled with the opportunity to display their voting rights as citizens of Bangladesh in the 1991 national election. The work of the Grameen staff initiated a sharp increase in political activity which continued into the 1992, 1996, and 1997 elections. Since the Grameen Bank caters to women, the 1996 elections received more women voting than men, which led to the removal of political parties opposing women's rights. Not only did more women participate in political activism, but over 1,750 Grameen members, 268 male and 1,485 female, were elected to local offices in 1997.&lt;ref name="Banker to the poor" /&gt;

In an interview with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and an opportunity for the poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/enterprisingideas/Muhammad-Yunus.html|title=Muhammad Yunus on Microfinance .

== Operational statistics ==
Grameen Bank is owned by the borrowers of the bank, most of whom are poor women. Of the total equity of the bank, the borrowers own 94%, and the remaining 6% is owned by the Bangladesh government.&lt;ref name="grag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=175 |title=Grameen Bank at a Glance |publisher=Grameen Communications |pages=  |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank grew significantly between 2003 and 2007. As of January 2011, the total borrowers of the bank number 8.4&amp;nbsp;million, and 97% of those are women.&lt;ref name="grag"/&gt;
The number of borrowers has more than doubled since 2003, when the bank had 3.12&amp;nbsp;million members.&lt;ref name="gra2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grameen-info.org/bank/hist2003.html|title=Grameen Bank Historical Data Series 2003  |date=21 July 2004 |work= |publisher=Grameen Communications |pages= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080115104725/http://www.grameen-info.org/bank/hist2003.html |archivedate=15 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=17 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar growth can be observed in the number of villages covered. As of October 2007, the Bank has a staff of more than 24,703 employees; its 2,468 branches provide services to 80,257 villages,&lt;ref name="grag"/&gt; up from the 43,681 villages covered in 2003.&lt;ref name="gra2003"/&gt;

The bank has distributed BDT 1.437&amp;nbsp;trillion (USD&amp;nbsp;20.92&amp;nbsp;billion) in loans, out of which BDT 1.317&amp;nbsp;trillion (USD&amp;nbsp;19.02&amp;nbsp;billion) has been repaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grameen.com/monthly-report-2016-2/ |title=Grameen Bank 2017-01 Monthly Report in BDT |accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grameen.com/monthly-report-2016/ |title=Grameen Bank 2017-01 Monthly Report in USD |accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank claims a loan recovery rate of 96.67%,&lt;ref name="grameen-info.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=452&amp;Itemid=526 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708185819/http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=452&amp;Itemid=526 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2008 |title=Grameen Bank 2011-10 Monthly Report |accessdate=20 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; up from the 95% recovery rate claimed in 1998.&lt;ref name="grameen-info.org"/&gt; David Roodman has critiqued the accounting practices that Grameen used to determine this rate.&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt;

The global number of potential micro-borrowers is estimated to be 1&amp;nbsp;billion, with a total loan demand of $250&amp;nbsp;billion. The present microfinance model is serving 100 million people with $25&amp;nbsp;billion of loans.&lt;ref name="DB Research"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microfinance:An emerging investment opportunity|url=http://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD/PROD0000000000219174.pdf|publisher=DB Research |accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grameen Bank is 95% owned by the local poor and 5% by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grameen Bank at A Glance|url=http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=175|publisher=Grameen Bank |accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff training==
The Grameen Bank staff often work in difficult conditions.&lt;ref name="Banker to the poor" /&gt; Employees receive 6 months of on-the-job training while shadowing qualified and experienced individuals from various branches of Grameen. The goal of this training is for the trainee to "appreciate the unexplored potential of the destitute" and to discover new ways to solve problems that arise within the Grameen branch. After completing the 6-month period, trainees return to Dhaka headquarters for review and critique before appointment to a bank branch.

==Honours==
* 1994, Grameen Bank received the [[Independence Day Award]] in 1994, which is the highest government award.
* 13 October 2006, the Nobel Committee awarded Grameen Bank and its founder, Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] "for their efforts to create economic and social development from below."&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/press.html |title=The Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 |date=13 October 2006 |publisher=The Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 |accessdate=13 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award announcement also mentions that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
From modest beginnings three decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed micro-credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty. Grameen Bank has been a source of ideas and models for the many institutions in the field of micro-credit that have sprung up around the world.&lt;ref name="Nobel"/&gt;

On December 10, 2006, Mosammat Taslima Begum, who used her first 16-euro (20-dollar) loan from the bank in 1992 to buy a goat and subsequently became a successful entrepreneur and one of the elected board members of the bank, accepted the Nobel Prize on behalf of Grameen Bank's investors and borrowers at the prize awarding ceremony held at [[Oslo]] City Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], Oslo |date= 11 December 2006 |title= Yunus unveils vision to end global poverty | url= http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/12/11/d6121101011.htm | publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grameen Bank is the only business corporation to have won a Nobel Prize. Professor Ole Danbolt Mjøs, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, in his speech said that, by giving the prize to Grameen Bank and Muhammad Yunus, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wanted to encourage attention on achievements of the [[Muslim world]], on the women's perspective, and on the fight against poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/presentation-speech.html |title=The Nobel Peace Prize for 2006: Presentation Speech |author=Mjøs, Ole Danbolt |date=13 October 2006 |publisher=The Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 |accessdate=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2005 the Grameen Mutual Fund One (GMFO), approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Bangladesh, was listed as an [[Initial Public Offering]].  One of the first mutual funds of its kind, GMFO will allow the more than four million Grameen bank members, as well as non-members, to buy into Bangladesh's capital markets. The Bank and its constituents are together worth over USD&amp;nbsp;7.4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 14 October 2006 | title = Credit where credit is due: The banker who changed the world | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article1870835.ece | publisher = [[The Independent]] | location = London | accessdate = 17 January 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070322024256/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article1870835.ece | archivedate = 22 March 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some analysts have suggested that microcredit can bring communities into debt from which they cannot escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sharma |first=Sudhirendar |date=25 September 2002 |title=Is micro-credit a macro trap? |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2002/09/25/stories/2002092500810900.htm |work=The Hindu Business Line |accessdate=2 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sharma |first=Sudhirendar |date=5 January 2002 |title=Microcredit: Globalisation unlimited |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2002/01/05/stories/2002010500111200.htm |work=The Hindu |accessdate=2 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[France 24]] |date=6 April 2008 |title=The crushing burden of microcredit |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080404-bangladesh-burden-microcredit-caring-grameen-bank-mohammed-yunnus |publisher=[[France 24]] |accessdate=26 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315142122/http://www.france24.com/en/20080404-bangladesh-burden-microcredit-caring-grameen-bank-mohammed-yunnus |archivedate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have noted instances when microloans from the Grameen Bank were linked to exploitation and pressures on poor families to sell their belongings, leading in extreme cases to humiliation and ultimately suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mikrolånen har blivit en skuldfälla för fattiga (Swedish) |url=http://svt.se/2.151554/1.2329694/mikrolanen_har_blivit_en_skuldfalla_for_fattiga |publisher=SVT.se |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225110607/http://svt.se/2.151554/1.2329694/mikrolanen_har_blivit_en_skuldfalla_for_fattiga |archivedate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mises Institute]]'s [[Jeffrey Tucker]] suggests that microcredit banks depend on subsidies to operate, thus acting as another example of welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Jeffrey Tucker|last=Tucker |first=Jeffrey |title=The Micro-Credit Cult. ''The Free Market'' |publisher= [[Mises Institute]] |date=November 1995| url=https://mises.org/freemarket_detail.aspx?control=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yunus believes that he is working against the subsidised economy, giving borrowers the opportunity to create businesses. Some of Tucker's criticism is based on his interpretation of Grameen's "16 decisions," seen as indoctrination, without considering what they mean in the context of poor, illiterate peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/library/microcredit-or-macrowelfare-myth-grameen|title=Microcredit or Macrowelfare: The Myth of Grameen|first=|last=anne|date=3 November 2006|publisher=|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maulana Ibrahim, an [[imam]] in Bangladesh, spoke out against the Grameen Bank in 1993 for fostering  "un-Islamic ways." He alleged that the lenders' pledge required women to say they would not obey their husbands and would not live in poverty any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=YS_FlaACPgMC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=grameen+bank+against+men#v=onepage&amp;q=grameen%20bank%20against%20men&amp;f=false | title = Women and Islam in Bangladesh: Beyond subjection and tyranny | isbn = 978-0-312-22219-2 | author1 = Hashmi | first1 = Taj ul-Islam | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian documentary, ''Caught in Micro debt'', said that Grameen evaded taxes. The Spanish documentary, ''Microcredit,'' also suggested this. The accusation is based on the unauthorised transfer of approximately US$100&amp;nbsp;million, donated by The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), from one Grameen entity to another in 1996, before the expiry of the Grameen Bank's tax exemption. However, NORAD published a statement in December 2010 clearing Yunus and the Bank of any wrongdoing on this point, following a comprehensive review of NORAD's support commissioned by the Minister of International Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/report_grameen/id627366/|title=Report on Norwegian assistance to Grameen Bank|last=Affairs|first=Ministry of Foreign|date=2010-12-07|website=Government.no|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yunus denies that this is tax evasion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no question of tax evasion here. The Government has provided organisations with opportunities; we have made use of these opportunities with aim of benefitting our shareholders who are the rural poor women of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muhammadyunus.org/In-the-Media/a-full-transcript-from-the-press-conference-held-on-december-12-2010/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218002413/http://www.muhammadyunus.org/In-the-Media/a-full-transcript-from-the-press-conference-held-on-december-12-2010/ |date=18 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, poor rural families have suffered debt spirals, harassment by microfinance debt collectors, and in some cases suicide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">A '''habendum clause''' is a clause in a [[deed]] or [[lease]] that defines the type of interest and rights to be enjoyed by the grantee or lessee.  

In a deed, a habendum clause usually begins with the words "to have and to hold". This phrase is the translation of the [[Latin language|Latin]] {{lang|la|habendum et tenendum}} that historically commenced these clauses in deeds. Technically speaking, the "to have" ({{lang-la|habendum|links=no}}) is separate from the "to hold" ({{lang-la|tenendum|links=no}}), such that the [[tenendum clause]] is sometimes considered a separate concept. Historically, the habendum clause dealt with "the quantity of interest or estate which the grantee was to have in the property granted", while the tenendum clause addressed "the tenure upon or under which it was to be held".&lt;ref name=burdick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burdick|first1=William Livesey|title=Handbook of the Law of Real Property|date=1914|publisher=West Publishing Co.|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|page=766|oclc=1727418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put differently, the habendum deals with the relationship between the possessor and the land—how the land is to be had—while the tenendum deals with the relationship between the possessor and his immediately superior lord—how the land is to be held. The obsolescence of [[land tenure]], however, renders this distinction mostly historical and academic.&lt;ref name=burdick /&gt;

The provisions of the habendum clause must agree with those stated in the [[granting clause]]. For example, if the grantor conveys a [[time share]] interest or an interest less than [[fee simple]] absolute, the habendum clause would specify the owner's rights as well as how those rights are limited (a specific time frame or certain prohibited activities, for instance). Many states, such as Pennsylvania, require a deed to have a habendum clause in order for the deed to be officially recorded and recognized by the [[Recorder of Deeds]].

Habendum clauses are also found in leases, particularly [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] leases. The habendum clause can define how long the interest granted will extend. Most oil and gas leases provide for a primary and secondary term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oil-gas-leases.com/oil-gas-lease-terms.html Oil and Gas Lease Terms Defined]&lt;/ref&gt; During the primary term the lessee can hold the lease without producing. The secondary term is usually "so long thereafter as oil and gas is produced in paying quantities."

He is best known, jointly with [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy Spencer]], for the first successful development of a [[satellite temperature record]].&lt;ref name="christybio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nsstc.uah.edu/atmos/christy_bio.html | title=Dr. John R.

==Early life and education==
A native of [[Fresno, California]], Christy became interested in the weather when he was a child. He became curious why the weather in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] was so different from that of the [[Sierra Madre Mountains (California)|Sierra Mountains]]. He has recalled that "I built my first climate datasets when I was 12, using a mechanical pencil, graph paper, and long-division (no calculators back then.) I've been a climate nerd ever since."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsstc.uah.edu/users/john.christy/ John Christy]&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[B.A.]] in Mathematics from [[California State University, Fresno]] in 1973, and an [[M.S.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in [[Atmospheric Sciences]] from the [[University of Illinois]] in 1984 and 1987.&lt;ref name=christybio /&gt; His doctoral thesis was titled, ''An investigation of the general circulation associated with extreme anomalies in hemispheric mean atmospheric mass''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/investigation-of-the-general-circulation-associated-with-extreme-anomalies-in-hemispheric-mean-atmospheric-mass/oclc/18286111 | title=An investigation of the general circulation associated with extreme anomalies in hemispheric mean atmospheric mass | year=1987 | publisher=[[University of Illinois]] | accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his scientific career, Christy taught physics and chemistry as a missionary teacher in [[Nyeri]], Kenya from 1973 to 1975. After earning a [[Master of Divinity]] degree from [[Golden Gate Baptist Seminary]] in 1978 he served four years as a bivocational mission-pastor in [[Vermillion, South Dakota]], where he also taught college math.&lt;ref name=christybio /&gt;

==Career==
He is the Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science and Director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. He was appointed [[Alabama]]'s state climatologist in 2000. For his development of a global temperature [[data set]] from satellites he was awarded [[NASA]]'s Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, and the [[American Meteorological Society]]'s "Special Award."&lt;ref name=christybio/&gt; In 2002, Christy was elected [[Fellow]] of the American Meteorological Society.&lt;ref name=fellowams&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.ametsoc.org/memdir/fellowslist/get_listoffellows.cfm |title = List of AMS Fellows |publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] |accessdate = October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1989 Christy, along with Roy Spencer, has maintained an atmospheric temperature record derived from satellite [[microwave]] sounding unit measurements, commonly called the "[[UAH satellite temperature dataset|UAH]]" record (see also [[satellite temperature record]]). This was once quite [[Global warming controversy|controversial]]: From the beginning of the satellite record in late 1978 into 1998 it showed a net global cooling trend, although ground measurements and instruments carried aloft by balloons showed warming in many areas. Part of the cooling trend seen by the satellites can be attributed to several years of cooler than normal temperatures and cooling caused by the eruption of the [[Mount Pinatubo]] volcano. Part of the discrepancy between the surface and atmospheric trends was resolved over a period of several years as Christy, Spencer and others identified several factors, including orbital drift and decay, that caused a net cooling bias in the data collected by the satellite instruments.&lt;ref name=usccsp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-execsum.pdf |title=Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere – Executive Summary |author=Tom M.

From November 1978 through March 2011, Earth's atmosphere has warmed at an average rate of about 0.14 C per decade, according to the UAHuntsville satellite record.

Christy was a lead author of a section of the 2001 report by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/index.php?idp=558 |title = Appendix III – Contributors to the IPCC WGI Third Assessment Report |year = 2001  |publisher =[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] |accessdate = April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.S. [[Climate Change Science Program|CCSP]] report ''Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere – Understanding and Reconciling Differences''.&lt;ref name="usccsp"/&gt; Christy also signed the 2003 [[American Geophysical Union]] statement on climate change.&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/12/18/MNGNV3PH9D1.DTL&amp;type=printable |title = Earth warming at faster pace, say top science group's leaders |author = David, Perlman |date = December 18, 2003 |accessdate = April 4, 2007 |publisher = San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christy has also performed detailed reconstruction of surface temperature for [[Central California]]. He found that recorded temperature changes there were consistent with an altered surface environment caused by increased irrigation for agriculture, which changed "a high-[[albedo]] desert into a darker, moister, vegetated plain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI3627.1 |title = Methodology and Results of Calculating Central California Surface Temperature Trends: Evidence of Human-Induced Climate Change? |author1=John R.

== Views ==
In a 2003 interview with [[National Public Radio]] about the 2003 American Geophysical Union (AGU) statement, he said he is "a strong critic of scientists who make catastrophic predictions of huge increases in global temperatures and tremendous rises in sea levels".  He added, though, that "it is scientifically inconceivable that after changing forests into cities, turning millions of acres into irrigated farmland, putting massive quantities of soot and dust into the air, and putting extra [[greenhouse gases]] into the air, that the natural course of climate has not changed in some way."&lt;ref name=sfgate /&gt;

In a 2009 interview with Fortune Magazine about signing the 2003 American Geophysical Union (AGU) statement, he said: "As far as the AGU, I thought that was a fine statement because it did not put forth a magnitude of the warming. We just said that human effects have a warming influence, and that's certainly true. There was nothing about disaster or catastrophe. In fact, I was very upset about the latest AGU statement [in 2007]. It was about alarmist as you can get."&lt;ref name=fortune2009&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://archive.fortune.com/2009/05/14/magazines/fortune/globalwarming.fortune/index.htm |title = What if global-warming fears are overblown? |author = Jon Birger |date = May 14, 2009 |publisher = Fortune Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 editorial in the [[Wall Street Journal]], he wrote: "I'm sure the majority (but not all) of my IPCC colleagues cringe when I say this, but I see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see."&lt;ref name=WSJ2007&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119387567378878423 |title=My Nobel moment |author=John Christy |date=November 1, 2007 |website=[[Wsj.com]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 ruling in a trial relating to automobile emission regulation in Vermont, U.S. District Court Chief Judge William K. Sessions wrote, "Plaintiffs’ own expert, Dr. Christy, agrees with the IPCC’s [2001] assessment that in the light of new evidence and taking into account remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is likely to have been due to the increase in [[Greenhouse gases|GHG]] concentrations." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2007/VermontDecision_20070912.pdf |title = Case No. 2:05-cv-302 |pages = 44–45 |date = September 12, 2007 |publisher = United States District Court for the District of Vermont |accessdate = February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Christy said in his testimony was, "You know, it's a statement that has lots of qualifications in it, so it's hard to disagree with." and "You saw me pause a long time because — this was six years ago. And the question was about what I thought six years ago." When then asked if he presently agreed with that IPCC assessment Christy responded, "As I answered here, because of the qualifications in that statement, I don't have significant concerns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pawalaw.com/assets/docs/pavley_christy_cross.pdf |title = Civil File No. 05-302 &amp; 304 |pages = 46–48 |date = May 4, 2007 |publisher = United States District Court for the District of Vermont |accessdate = March 7, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715054230/http://www.pawalaw.com/assets/docs/pavley_christy_cross.pdf | archive-date=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 written testimony to the [[U.S. House Ways and Means Committee]], he wrote: "From my analysis, the actions being considered to 'stop global warming' will have an imperceptible impact on whatever the climate will do, while making energy more expensive, and thus have a negative impact on the economy as a whole. We have found that climate models and popular surface temperature data sets overstate the changes in the real atmosphere and that actual changes are not alarming."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/111/ctest.pdf |title = House Ways and Means Committee –  Written Testimony |author = John Christy |date = November 25, 2009 |publisher = U.S. House Ways and Means Committee |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100710170540/http://waysandmeans.house.gov/media/pdf/111/ctest.pdf |archivedate = July 10, 2010 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Christy and his UAH colleague Richard McNider wrote a commentary piece in the Wall Street Journal, arguing that [[climate model]]s projected temperatures consistently higher than real-world satellite and balloon data. The authors also pointed to past instances where scientific consensus turned out to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/richard-mcnider-and-john-christy-why-kerry-is-flat-wrong-on-climate-change-1392847415 | title=McNider and Christy: Why Kerry Is Flat Wrong on Climate Change | work=Wall Street Journal | date=19 February 2014 | accessdate=6 April 2014 | author=Christy &amp; McNider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of '''[[land sales]]''', an '''overage''' (also called “claw back”) is used to describe a sum of money in addition to the original sale price which a seller of land may be entitled to receive following completion if and when the buyer complies with agreed conditions.

Overage is often written into a contract of sale where land or property is being sold at an undervalued rate, or there is a clear process which can be undertaken to improve the value of the land over and above the cost of the process to improve the value. [[Planning permission]] is often an example of a process which can significantly enhance the value of land over and above the cost of gaining the permission.

Overage does not solely relate to land and property and could be written into any contract for a sale of goods. Therefore, if an old [[classic car]] in poor condition was to be sold to someone with the intent of refurbishing it and then selling it on, the original seller may choose to sell the car at a very low value and contract to receive a percentage of the uplift from the next sale as well.

==Example==
A typical scenario would be:
On completion, a buyer pays a given price for a piece of land and the seller is aware of the buyer’s intention to develop the land. Overage provisions are negotiated into the contract of sale to ensure that once planning is obtained, the seller receives a proportion of the increase in the value of the land.

'''Land reform''' is an important political and economic topic in [[Namibia]]. It consists of two different strategies: resettlement, and transfer of commercially viable agricultural land. Resettlement is aimed at improving the lives of displaced or dispossessed previously disadvantaged Namibians. Farms obtained by government for resettlement purposes are usually split into several sections, and dozens of families are being resettled on what had previously been one farm. Transfer of commercial agricultural land is not directly conducted by government. Would-be farmers with a previously disadvantaged background obtain farms privately or through [[affirmative action]] loans. In both cases, the "Willing buyer, willing seller" principle applies.

Namibia contains about 4,000 commercial farms. Almost 1000 of them have been obtained by previously disadvantaged Namibians since independence, some by means of private transactions, and some through government-facilitated loans. Until 2020, a further 15 Mio hectares of commercial agricultural land are to be transferred to blacks, a third of this area for resettlement purposes, two thirds for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Background==
Land ownership in pre-colonial central and southern [[South West Africa]] was intermittent; [[Herero people]] and [[Nama people]] claimed the land they were currently using. [[Heinrich Vedder]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Vedder
|first=Heinrich
|authorlink=Heinrich Vedder
|title=Das alte Südwestafrika. Südwestafrikas Geschichte bis zum Tode Mahareros 1890
|trans-title=South West Africa in Early Times. Being the story of South West Africa up to the date of Maharero's death in 1890

|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As the Nama said: Where the foot of our hunter sets there is Namaland, so said the Herero: wherever my cattle grassed there is Hereroland.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The notion of permanent ownership of land in the territory of South West Africa was only introduced in the wake of colonialisation. Consequently, the dispossession of land by European settlers from Africans began in the nineteenth century with the coming of [[German Empire|German]] colonists and traders as the area was incorporated as [[German South-West Africa]].

Namibia gained independence in March 1990. Upon independence, the country inherited a colonial division of land in which 3,500 farmers, who were almost entirely [[Whites in Namibia|White]], owned approximately 50% of the country's agricultural land. These farmers constituted about 0.2% of the total national population. Land reform was one of the biggest goals for many who participated in Namibia's liberation struggle.&lt;ref name="Tapscott"&gt;[http://www.africafiles.org/article.asp?ID=4015 Land reform in Namibia: Why not?] by Chris Tapscott, Southern Africa Report, January 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform Strategies==
Prior to the [[Namibian parliamentary election, 1989|first democratic election in 1989]], liberation movement leader [[SWAPO]] committed itself to "transfer[ing] some of the land from the few with too much of it to the landless majority".&lt;ref name="Tapscott"/&gt;

Namibia's land reform process is based on three strategies, outlined by the Agricultural (Commercial) Land Reform Act of 1995:&lt;ref name="Fruits"&gt;{{cite news

# Resettlement: The Namibian government buys farms from commercial farmers allocates them to previously disadvantaged people. 
# Loans: [[AgriBank (Namibia)|AgriBank]], a state-owned bank, grants loans with interests below market level to the previously disadvantaged population.
# Communal land: Communal land, which all belongs to the state, is parcelled into small units and distributed by [[tribal chief|traditional leaders]].

===Resettlement===
Farms obtained by government for resettlement purposes are usually split into several sections, and dozens of families are being resettled on what had previously been one farm. From 1990 to 2007, an independent report said that the government had resettled approximately 800 Black farmers on land bought for redistribution. It was approximately 12% of commercial farmland in the country, or less than 1% per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=75333 Land reform reproducing poverty] IRIN News, 15 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Namibian citizens may obtain a portion of a farm for resettlement if they do not yet own farm land, and if they belong to the previously disadvantaged population. In the allocation process, females score higher than males, people 25 years of age or older score higher than those below 25, and people with farming experience score higher than those without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Willing buyer, willing seller==
The government generally has avoided expropriating farms. Farms to be reallocated to  previously disadvantaged people are mainly bought from farm owners that wish to sell their farms. This is called the ''Willing buyer, willing seller'' principle. Any farm that is to be sold on the free market must first be offered to government. However, in 2005, government began expropriating commercial farms. Although only five farms had been expropriated in 2008, and a further 30 farm owners had received letters asking them to sell to government, this move has instilled fears in the white farming community and discouraged further investment.&lt;ref name="Fruits"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7817">'''Left Group of Finnish Workers''' ({{lang-fi|Suomen työväen vasemmistoryhmä}}) was a [[socialist]] [[political party]] in [[Finland]]. The party was active in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The group was founded by activists who had previously cooperated with the [[Communist Party of Finland]] (SKP). [[Niilo Wälläri]], [[Eino Pekkala]], [[Erkki Härmä]] and [[Kusti Kulo]] were some of the well-known leaders of the group.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony F. Upton]]: ''Kommunismi Suomessa'' (Kirjayhtymä 1970), p. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; The group had supporters mainly in the southern industrial cities of Finland.&lt;ref name="paastela"&gt;Jukka Paastela: Finnish Communism under Soviet Totalitarianism (Kikimora 2003), p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

The communists – who followed [[Comintern]]'s [[Third Period]] policy – had a very negative attitude to the Left Group, whose members were branded "vacillators" ({{lang-fi|Hoipertelijat}}). The group was considered more dangerous than [[social democracy|social democrats]] or the [[far right]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony F. Upton: Kommunismi Suomessa (Kirjayhtymä 1970), p. 75, 100–101, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; The Left Group called their communist critics fanatical "beaters in the air" ({{lang-fi|Huitojat}}).&lt;ref name="paastela"/&gt; The [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]] was also critical of the Left Group and they avoided cooperation. It was tactically important for the SDP to maintain an image that considered their left-wing opponents as a single Moscow-led entity.&lt;ref&gt;Jorma Virtanen: ''Suomen ammattijärjestö poliittisen työväenliikkeen eri suuntausten toimintakenttänä 1928–1930''. Series F: 1 (Department of Contemporary History, University of Turku 1983), p. 5 &amp; 25 {{ISBN|951-642-307-8}} / ISSN 0359-0593&lt;/ref&gt;

The Left Group published the paper ''Suomen Työmies'' in 1930. In [[Vaasa]], ''Työn Ääni'' was also briefly in the hands of the Left Group.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony F. Upton: ''Kommunismi Suomessa'' (Kirjayhtymä 1970), p. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schisms of the far left ==

In the 1920s, the underground communist party worked with left socialists in various legal coalitions. Schisms between the partners began to intensify in the mid-1920s. The problematic relations between communists in Finland and those who had emigrated to [[Soviet Union]] was the main question. The socialists outside SKP criticized the Soviet-residing leadership and Comintern for excessive intervention in activities inside Finland. A pamphlet called ''Away with the emigrants'' ({{lang-fi|Irti emigranteista}}) was published in April 1925. Conflicts escalated when the SKP adopted the uncompromising third period program of Comintern in 1928. Critical attitude to other leftist parties was now emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony F. Upton: ''Kommunismi Suomessa'' (Kirjayhtymä 1970), p. 75, 100–101, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="virtanen"&gt;Jorma Virtanen: ''Suomen ammattijärjestö poliittisen työväenliikkeen eri suuntausten toimintakenttänä 1928–1930''. Series F: 1 (Department of Contemporary History, University of Turku 1983) {{ISBN|951-642-307-8}} / ISSN 0359-0593&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist opposition gained support especially in the [[trade union]] movement, in which the social democrats were in minority, and the conflict became pronounced in the 8th congress of [[Suomen Ammattijärjestö]], the Finnish Trade Union centre, in May 1929. The communists tried to gather support for the so-called Copenhagen treaty according to which the cooperation between Finnish, Norwegian and Soviet trade unions was to be increased. In addition, they wanted to end cooperation with the [[International Labour Organization]] and to intensify fight against [[social fascism]]. The socialist majority of the left-wing majority, however, thought it was not wise to exacerbate the relations with the social democrats further and the initiatives were rejected. Still, the social democrats left the SAJ after the congress as a protest to communists.&lt;ref name="virtanen"/&gt;

The SKP was not happy with the outcome of the SAJ congress and the stance was supported by Comintern. This was made clear in summer 1929 when the communists openly attacked their socialist comrades. Following Comintern orders, the SKP began to oust socialists from leading positions in trade unions. In autumn, the objective was put into practice, and the SKP regained control of the SAJ executive committee. The majority was temporarily lost in 1928 after many leading communists were arrested by the [[Valtiollinen Poliisi|state police]]. The policy was strongly objected by the socialist trade union leaders including [[Matti Väisänen (politician)|Matti Väisänen]] and [[Erkki Härmä]]. The socialists tried to gain support for an extraordinary SAJ congress but the effort was not successful.&lt;ref name="virtanen"/&gt;

== Left Group gets organized ==

Left Group of Finnish Workers was founded in December 1929. The first central committee consisted of [[Eino Pekkala]] (chairman), [[Uno Nurminen]] (vice chairman), [[Hugo M. Ahokanta]] (secretary), [[Emil Tuomi]], [[Kusti Kulo]] and [[August Raatikainen]]. [[Matti Väisänen (politician)|Matti Väisänen]], Nurminen and [[Niilo Wälläri]] formed the important trade union committee. To clarify its policies, the new group released a three-page pamphlet in which the extremist communist line was rejected. In January 1930, the group organ ''Suomen Työmies'' hit the newsstands. In its first issue the paper emphasized independence of the Finnish workers' movement and demanded that the union statutes should be respected.&lt;ref&gt;Jorma Virtanen: ''Suomen ammattijärjestö poliittisen työväenliikkeen eri suuntausten toimintakenttänä 1928–1930''. Series F: 1 (Department of Contemporary History, University of Turku 1983), p. 24–27 {{ISBN|951-642-307-8}} / ISSN 0359-0593&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring the Left Group acted against SAJ policy of founding new trade unions to sectors controlled by the social democrats who had left the central organization. Meanwhile, the communist strengthened their positions in the SAJ and three prominent socialist leaders, Wälläri (Kuljetustyöläisten liitto), Nurminen (Rakennustyöläisten liitto) and Nestori Ahonen (Puuteollisuustyöväen liitto), were purged. Nurminen resigned from the SAJ executive committee. Kusti Kulo, who was in charge of the SAJ education work, was expelled in June. Still, the Left Group tried to work with the communists. It was suggested that the left, including social democrats, should unite against the far-right [[Lapuan liike]] movement which was terrorizing the organized workers. The SKP did not agree.&lt;ref name="virtanen29"&gt;Jorma Virtanen: ''Suomen ammattijärjestö poliittisen työväenliikkeen eri suuntausten toimintakenttänä 1928–1930''. Series F: 1 (Department of Contemporary History, University of Turku 1983), p. 29–30 {{ISBN|951-642-307-8}} / ISSN 0359-0593&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, all activities of the SAJ and its organizations were banned by the state.&lt;ref name="virtanen29"/&gt; Left-wing newspapers were closed and politicians arrested, including members of the Socialist Parliamentary Group of Workers and Smallholders, a joint effort of left socialists and communists. The socialist left, however, participated in the formation of a new SDP-controlled trade union [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions|SAK]],&lt;ref&gt;Niilo Wälläri: ''Antoisia vuosia'' (Weilin+Göös 1967), p. 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt; which, in its early years, was boycotted by the SKP.

The '''livery companies''' of the [[City of London]], currently 110 in number, comprise London's ancient and modern [[trade association]]s and [[guild]]s, almost all of which are styled the "Worshipful Company of..." their respective craft, trade or profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Local_history_and_heritage/Livery/linklist.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418190325/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Leisure_and_culture/Local_history_and_heritage/Livery/linklist.html |archivedate=18 April 2012 |title=Alphabetical list |publisher=City of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|last=Engel|first=Matthew|title=British institutions: livery companies|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/e42e19a0-47da-11e2-a899-00144feab49a.html#slide0|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=ft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; London's livery companies play a significant part in [[City of London|City]] life, not least by providing charitable-giving and networking opportunities. Liverymen retain voting rights for the senior civic offices, such as the [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]], [[Sheriffs of London|Sheriffs]] and [[City of London Corporation]], its ancient municipal authority with extensive local government powers.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

The term ''livery'' originated in the specific form of dress worn by retainers of a nobleman and then by extension to special dress to denote status of belonging to a trade. Livery companies evolved from London's medieval [[guild]]s, becoming [[corporation]]s under [[Royal Charter]] responsible for training in their respective trades, as well as for the regulation of aspects such as wage control, labour conditions and industry standards. Early guilds often grew out of [[parish]] fraternal organizations, where large groups of members of the same trade lived in close proximity and gathered at the same church.&lt;ref name="bowyers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bowyers.com/liveryMovement.php|title=The Worshipful Company of Bowyers|website=www.bowyers.com|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most organisations during the [[Middle Ages]], these livery companies had close ties with the [[Catholic Church]] (before the [[Protestant Reformation]]), endowing religious establishments such as [[chantry]] [[chapel]]s and [[Church (building)|church]]es, observing religious festivals with hosting ceremonies and well-known [[mystery play]]s.  Most livery companies retain their historical religious associations, although nowadays members are free to follow any faith or none. Companies often established a guild or meeting hall, and though they faced destruction in the [[Great London Fire]] of 1666 and during [[World War II]], thirty-nine companies maintain their sometimes elaborate and historic halls.&lt;ref name="bowyers.com"/&gt; 

Most livery companies still maintain contacts with their original trade, craft or professional roles. Some still exercise powers of regulation, inspection and enforcement, while others are awarding bodies for professional qualifications. The [[Worshipful Company of Scriveners|Scriveners' Company]] admits senior members of [[lawyer|legal]] and associated professions, the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|Apothecaries' Company]] awards post-graduate qualifications in some medical specialties, and the [[Worshipful Company of Hackney Carriage Drivers|Hackney Carriage Drivers' Company]] comprises licensed taxi drivers who have passed the "[[The Knowledge|Knowledge of London]]" test. Several companies restrict membership only to those holding relevant professional qualifications, ''eg.'' the [[City of London Solicitors' Company]] and the [[Worshipful Company of Engineers]]. Other companies, whose trade died out long ago, such as the [[Worshipful Company of Bowyers|Longbow Makers' Company]], have evolved into being primarily [[charitable organization|charitable foundations]].&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

After the [[Worshipful Company of Carmen|Carmen]] received City livery status in 1746 no new companies were established in London for 180 years until the [[Honourable Company of Master Mariners|Master Mariners]] in 1926 (granted livery in 1932).&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; Post-1926 creations are known as ''modern livery companies''. [[Worshipful Company of Arts Scholars|The Worshipful Company of Arts Scholars]], the newest, was granted livery status on 11 February 2014, making it the 110th City livery company in order of precedence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsscholars.org/|title=The Worshipful Company of Arts Scholars|first=ATG Media|last=Ltd|website=www.artsscholars.org|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Honourable Company of Air Pilots]] is exceptional among London's livery companies in having active overseas committees in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and North America.

==Purpose==

===Training and industry===
The companies were originally formed, starting in the 12th century, to guarantee that a member was trustworthy and fully qualified, and that the goods they produced were of reputable quality, the two-fold aim being to protect the public and to protect members from charlatans. Many were formed up until the 17th century, when political upheaval and the growth of London around the City meant the companies, which only controlled trade in the City itself, began to struggle to compete.

From the 1870s however, there was a revival, with the companies extending their original educational purpose to technical education, supporting new industries and providing the training necessary to them, most notably the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]].&lt;ref name=citylivery&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/history/Pages/livery-companies.aspx |title=Livery companies |publisher=City of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
From the start, the companies cared for their members in sickness and old age. Today, they support both their members, and wider charitable aims and activities, including those supporting education and training.&lt;ref name=citylivery/&gt;

===Support to the armed forces===
Most livery companies have affiliations with regular and reserve units in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.steppingforwardlondon.org/livery-company-affiliations-with-the-armed-forces.html |title=Livery Company Affiliations with the Armed Forces (Regular and Reserve) |publisher=Stepping Forward London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City of London governance===
Finally, the companies have always been essential to the [[#Governance|governance of the City of London]]. The senior members of the livery companies, i.e, the liverymen, elect the City's sheriffs, Bridge Masters, Ale Conners, auditors, the members of the City Livery Committee, and approve the aldermanic candidates for election to the office of Lord Mayor of London.&lt;ref name=citylivery/&gt;

==Entry==
Entry to a livery company may be by one of four routes:
* By apprenticeship. This is now rare. In earlier days, someone wishing to enter such a trade would bind themselves apprentice to a member of their chosen trade. As such, he was required to do precisely as he was instructed, and it was almost a form of slavery – but the apprentice did learn his trade, and his master was required to provide such training that, at the end of the apprenticeship (usually seven years) the apprentice would be sufficiently knowledgeable to become a member – and he became a free man of the [[City of London]] – free of the obligations of apprenticeship.  
* By patrimony. Generally, a member's sons born after he became a member were entitled to become members; most livery companies also allow the same privilege to daughters.
* By redemption. This is the path to the freedom for all others, and requires the payment of a fine, as well as an interview or other admission procedure.
* By invitation. This is rare, and is said to be a great honour.

Regardless of method of entry, membership carries the same duties and benefits. Membership of a livery company conveys the [[Freedom of the City of London]], now little more than a formality, though in the past the freedom carried benefits, such as being able to take a flock of sheep across [[London Bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.farminguk.com/News/Mary-Berry-leads-flock-of-sheep-over-London-Bridge-_47479.html|title=Mary Berry leads flock of sheep over London Bridge to promote wool industry - Farming UK News|website=www.farminguk.com|accessdate=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at no charge.

==Governance==
Livery companies are governed by a master (alternatively styled prime warden in some companies, or Upper Bailiff of the Weavers' Company), a number of wardens (holding various titles such as the upper, middle, lower, or renter wardens), and a [[court of assistants]] (board of directors), responsible for company business and electing its master and wardens. The ''[[clerk]] to the company'' is invariably its most senior permanent member of staff, who as [[chief executive officer]] runs its day-to-day activities.

Membership generally falls into two categories: [[Freedom of the City|freemen]] and liverymen. One may become a freeman, or acquire the "freedom of the company", upon fulfilling certain criteria: traditionally, by "patrimony", if either parent were a liveryman of the company; by "servitude", if one has served a requisite number of years as an apprentice to a senior company member; or by "redemption", upon paying a fee. Most livery companies reserve the right to admit distinguished people, particularly in their sphere of influence, as [[List of Honorary Freemen of the City of London|honorary freemen]]. Freemen may advance to become liverymen, after obtaining the freedom of the City of London, and with their court of assistants' approval. Only liverymen are eligible to vote in the annual election of the [[Lord Mayor of London]], the [[Sheriffs of the City of London|sheriffs]] and various other City civic offices, including the [[Ale conner|Ale Conners]] and [[Tower Bridge#Bridge Master|Bridge Masters]].

The livery companies elect a majority of the members of the Livery Committee, a body administered at [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]]. The committee oversees the elections of sheriffs and the Lord Mayor, educates liverymen regarding the City and its activities, represents the livery companies in communications with the City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://democracy.cityoflondon.gov.uk/mgCommitteeDetails.aspx?ID=383 |accessdate=2015-03-12 |title=Livery Committee |website=City of London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverycompanies.info/livery-committee/ |accessdate=2015-03-12 |title=Livery Committee |website=Livery Companies of the City of London |publisher=Nigel Pullman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liverymen==
[[File:War Memorial to London's Liverymen.jpg|thumb|War Memorial to London's liverymen lost in WW1 (on Stationers Hall, west of Paternoster Square)]]
A '''liveryman''' is a full member of their respective company.

When a freeman becomes a liveryman, the candidate is said to be 'enclothed': indeed, a ''livery gown'' is placed on them at the court and they are seen at the next formal or social occasion wearing it. Thereafter only the master, wardens and assistants in companies are seen wearing these at company events. The masters wear them at the City's formal events, e.g. the two Common Halls and the United Guilds Service, and Lord Mayor's Show, wherever they may participate. Ordinarily, liverymen wear ties at formal functions and each company differs by allowing women to wear distinct items subject to the occasion, such as a scarf or brooch.

Freemen are expected to advance to become liverymen by a vote of the court of the company. Liverymen no longer have any local authority franchise in the City, but retain the exclusive right of voting in the election of the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] (Michaelmas 'Common Hall' 29 September) and for the sheriffs (Mid-Summer 'Common Hall' 24 June) held in Guildhall as a ceremonial occasion. The votes are made by 'acclamation' subject to a challenge/demand from the floor for a ballot which would be held a week later. Any two liverymen may nominate a candidate for the Freedom of the City.

===Former parliamentary election rights===
Before the [[Reform Act 1832]] the liverymen had the exclusive right to elect the four [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] representing the City. Between 1832 and 1918 being a liveryman was one of a number of possible franchises which could qualify a parliamentary elector in the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London constituency]], as it was a preserved ancient borough franchise under the terms of the 1832 Act.

See also [[City of London (elections to the Parliament of England)]] for further details of the history of the involvement of liverymen in parliamentary elections.

==Livery halls==
{{see also|Mottos and halls of the Livery Companies}}
[[File:Grocers' Hall, Prince's Street - geograph.org.uk - 1537101.jpg|thumb|250px|Grocers' Hall, in Princes Street, is home to the [[Worshipful Company of Grocers]].]]
Today 39 out of 110 City livery companies own premises in London, as well as the Watermen and Lightermen which although not strictly a livery company, retains headquarters still in regular use. Among the earliest companies known to have had halls are the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylors]] and [[Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths|Goldsmiths]] in the 14th century, and, uniquely, the kitchen and the crypt of Merchant Taylors' Hall survived both the [[Great Fire of London]] and [[the Blitz]], the kitchen now having been in uninterrupted use for over 600 years.

Besides surviving parts of Merchant Taylors’ Hall, the oldest hall interiors now extant are those of the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]], dating from 1668-71; significant portions of the fabric of this building are also medieval, from the 13th-century priory part of which became the Apothecaries’ Hall. Several companies that do not have a hall of their own share office premises within the hall of another company on a semi-permanent basis, examples being the [[Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers|Spectacle Makers' Company]], which uses part of Apothecaries' Hall, and the [[Worshipful Company of Shipwrights]], which co-habits with the [[Worshipful Company of Ironmongers|Ironmongers]].&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; Many livery halls can be hired for business and social functions, and are popular for weddings, commercial and society meetings, luncheons and dinners.

Three livery companies (the [[Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Painters of Glass|Glaziers and Painters of Glass]], [[Worshipful Company of Launderers|Launderers]], and [[Worshipful Company of Scientific Instrument Makers|Scientific Instrument Makers]]) share a hall in [[Southwark]], just south of and outside the City of London, while the [[Worshipful Company of Gunmakers]] has long been based at Proof House, in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] and the Master Mariners' "hall" is an historical ship, [[HMS Wellington (U65)|HQS ''Wellington'']], moored on the Thames which is shared by the [[Scriveners]]' Company.  Companies without halls customarily book use of another livery hall for their formal gatherings, giving members and guests the opportunity to visit and enjoy different City livery halls by rotation.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

[[Blue plaque]]s throughout the City of London indicate where companies formerly had halls.  Whilst several livery companies may aspire to owning or regaining their own hall it is appreciated that any increase in the overall number of livery halls would inevitably lead to some dilution of use of the existing halls. There is also attraction in belonging to a company which is [[wikt:peripatetic|peripatetic]].&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

==Precedence==
In 1515, the [[Court of Aldermen]] of the City of London settled an [[order of precedence]] for the 48 livery companies then in existence, based on those companies' contemporary economic or political power.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; The 12 highest-ranked companies remain known as the Great Twelve City Livery Companies. Today there are 110 City livery companies, all post-1515 companies being ranked by seniority of creation.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

The [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylors]] and the [[Worshipful Company of Skinners|Skinners]] have long disputed their precedence, so once a year (at Easter) they swap between sixth and seventh places. This mix-up is a favourite theory for the origin of the phrase "[[at sixes and sevens]]", as has been pointed out by at least one Master Merchant Taylor; however, it is possible that the phrase may have been coined before these two companies (Taylors and Skinners) resolved their dispute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-six1.htm "At Sixes and Sevens": ''Master Merchant Taylor'']&lt;/ref&gt; which arose from their both receiving Charters in 1327 with no proof surviving as to which was granted first.

===&lt;span id="Company without livery"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; City companies without grant of livery===

''Companies without Livery'' is a status which applies during the period between when a [[Guild]] is recognised by the Court of Aldermen and when it is granted the rights of a livery. A guild initially applies to be a ''London Guild'', and may later apply to the Court to become ''A Company of the City of London''. After an indefinite period, such ''A Company of the City of London'' can apply to the Aldermen for livery status; if granted, they can thereafter use the honorific prefix ''Worshipful Company''.

====Guilds and companies aiming to obtain the grant of Livery====
* [[Guild of Entrepreneurs]]
* [[Guild of Human Resource Professionals]]
* [[Guild of Nurses]]
* [[Guild of Investment Managers]]
* [[Company of Public Relations Practitioners]]

===Other companies===

* [[Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks]]
* [[Company of Watermen and Lightermen]]

Neither the ''Company of Parish Clerks'' nor the ''Company of Watermen'' have had or intend to apply for livery status, which remains a long-standing City tradition. This is granted by the City Corporation in effect to control a company. The Watermen and Parish Clerks are governed by statutes and Royal Charters with responsibilities outside the City. The Company of Watermen and Lightermen was established by [[Act of Parliament]] in 1555 to regulate the [[watermen]] on the [[River Thames]] responsible for the movement of goods and passengers and remains the only ancient City Guild to be formed and governed by Act of Parliament. They are then strictly not 'Companies without Livery' at all but simply 'companies'.

The ''City Livery Club'', ''The Guild of Young Freemen'' and the ''Guild of Freemen of the City of London'', whilst not being livery companies, are popular clubs amongst the City fraternity.

===The Southwark Manors===
The City Corporation of London remains [[Lord of the manor|lord]] of three [[manor]]s at [[Southwark]] ([[Guildable Manor|Guildable]], [[King's Manor, Southwark|King's]] and [[Great Liberty]]). These are membership organisations for those areas which are the jurors of their [[manor]]ial [[court]]s. They are not in any way ''Guilds'' as are not related to trading and occupational activities. These courts retain legal-standing under the [[Administration of Justice Act 1977]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4326">'''MDRC''' is a nonprofit, nonpartisan education and social policy research organization based in New York City and Oakland, CA. MDRC mounts large-scale demonstrations and uses randomized controlled trials to measure the effects of social and educational policy initiatives. MDRC is led by President Gordon Berlin and Senior Vice Presidents Jesús Amadeo and Robert Ivry.

== History ==
In 1974 the Ford Foundation and six government agencies together created the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation. Its purpose was to implement and document the results of new programs intended to help the poor.&lt;ref name=Manpower&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohler|first=Scott|title=Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation |url=http://cspcs.sanford.duke.edu/sites/default/files/descriptive/manpower_demonstration_research_corporation.pdf |publisher=Center for Strategic Philanthropy and Civil Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s and 1990s, it became well known for its evaluations of state welfare-to-work programs.&lt;ref name=Manpower /&gt;  It formally adopted "MDRC" as its registered corporate identity in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About MDRC: MDRC History|url=http://www.mdrc.org/about/about-mdrc-history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
MDRC evaluates and pilot-tests programs in six main areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solutions We're Working On|url=http://www.mdrc.org/solutions-were-working|work=MDRC website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matt DeHart''' is an American citizen and former [[U.S. Air National Guard]] [[Intelligence analysis|intelligence analyst]] known for his involvement with the [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous hacker group]] and [[WikiLeaks]] and claims to have received classified documents alleging serious misconduct by the [[CIA]].&lt;ref name="anthrax" /&gt;

He was indicted for alleged possession of [[Child pornography|indecent images]] from under-aged boys in 2010,&lt;ref name="buzzfeed.com"&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidkushner/matt-dehart#.lhxx95VyB “I Might Have Some Sensitive Files”, David Kushner, March 20, 2015, BuzzFeed]&lt;/ref&gt; but claims that this was a ruse in order to punish him for his online activities. A judge ruling on the case found this credible. He was, however, imprisoned for 21 months without access to proofs for these allegations.&lt;ref name=Hacker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/matthew-paul-dehart-anonymous-canada_n_3915547.html|title=Matthew Paul DeHart, Self-Described Anonymous Member, Says Child Porn Charges Are Government Ruse|first=Hunter|last=Stuart|publisher=Huffington Post|date=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After being released on bond in 2012, he unsuccessfully sought asylum in Canada, claiming he had been tortured by the [[FBI]] with regards to the classified documents. In November 2015 he struck a plea bargain to serve a 7 and a half year sentence.&lt;ref name=plea /&gt;

Former [[whistleblower]] [[Jesselyn Radack]], his supporters and DeHart himself purport the allegations are a ruse by the FBI to discredit him over the information he has released.&lt;ref name=Hacker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/matt-dehart-claims-hes-wanted-for-working-with-anonymous/|title=Hacker, Creeper, Soldier, Spy|first=Adrian|last=Humphreys|date=May 2014|publisher=National Post|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Early life and education==
As Matt DeHart's parents, Paul and Leann (married in 1978), were both members of the [[U.S. military]], he lived and grew up in many different places: [[Fort George G. Meade|Fort Meade, Maryland]] (age 1-2); [[Wheeler Air Force Base]], [[Hawaii]] (age 2-4); [[Prattville, Alabama]] (K–3rd grade), Fort Meade (4th grade); Prattville (5th grade); [[Birdsboro, Pennsylvania]] (6th grade); [[Randolph, New Jersey]] (7th – 11th grades); Washington Township, Pennsylvania (12th grade); [[Elmira, New York]] (2002–2005); and [[Newburgh, Indiana]] (2005–2010). The DeHart family is based on military tradition and Christian and conservative beliefs.&lt;ref name="np1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Humphreys|first1=Adrian|title=Hacker, creeper, soldier, spy|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/matt-dehart-claims-hes-wanted-for-working-with-anonymous|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an early age, DeHart was a tech geek. He started a group called KAOS (Kaos Anti-Security Operations Syndicate) in 2000. He graduated from high school in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-QkgbBZ6svikno57g/227044191-FBI-Document_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; He took classes through [[Corning Community College]];&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt; BOCES, Horseheads New York;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gstboces.org/ BOCES, Horseheads New York]&lt;/ref&gt; and IVY Tech Indianapolis, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivytech.edu/indianapolis/ IVY Tech Indianapolis]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he spent time on [[4chan]], a message board which gave birth to [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. Besides socializing and gaming online, DeHart developed interests in [[encryption]], [[internet]] freedom and privacy. In 2008, he took part in [[Project Chanology]], Anonymous' anti-[[Scientology]] campaign.&lt;ref name="np1" /&gt;

==Career==
In 2008, DeHart enlisted in the [[U.S. Air National Guard]], becoming an intelligence analyst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/2/will-matt-dehart-be-the-next-victim-of-the-war-on-leaks.html "Will Matt DeHart be the next victim of the war on leaks?", Janus Kopfstein, February 25, 2015], [[Al Jazeera America]]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, he was discharged from the National Guard, with an honorable discharge, as a consequence of a diagnosis of [[Depression (clinical)|depression]]. DeHart says after his superiors had learned about his activism he had been offered a lump sum if he resigned but he had refused to do so.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/227044191/FBI-Document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/matt-dehart-claims-hes-wanted-for-working-with-anonymous/ "Hacker, creeper, soldier, spy", Adrian Humphreys, National Post, April 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/spionage-vorwurf-fbi-verlangt-matthew-deharts-auslieferung-a-1019667.html US-Dissident DeHart: Vom Elitekämpfer zum Staatsfeind, Holger Stark], [[Spiegel Online]], February 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of events==

=== Receipt of documents ===
DeHart was involved in online activities with a small group '[[Operation AntiSec|Anonymous Anti-Security]]' using the anonymity network [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. As a part of these activities, DeHart ran a [[dead drop]] server named 'The Shell', on a computer in his bedroom. In September 2009, while monitoring the server, DeHart found an unencrypted folder containing hundreds of documents, including one detailing what looked like an [[FBI]] investigation into some particularly shady deeds by the [[CIA]]. He deleted the unencrypted folder from the server, but kept screenshots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2015/05/29/porn-run-333599.html The Case Against Matt DeHart, By Bethany Horne, May 20, 2015, Newsweek]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards he found an encrypted version of the same file placed on another hidden server he believes was meant for [[WikiLeaks]].

DeHart also claims "a document dropped onto his Tor server included details of FBI's investigation into CIA's possible role in the [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax attack]]".&lt;ref name="anthrax"&gt;[https://www.emptywheel.net/2015/03/20/is-matt-dehart-being-prosecuted-because-fbi-investigated-cia-for-the-anthrax-leak/  “Is Matt DeHart Being Prosecuted Because FBI Investigated CIA for the Anthrax Leak?”,  by emptywheel, Marc 20, 2015, emptywheel]&lt;/ref&gt;

January 22, 2010 he received a 'pretty detailed tip' from an associate who claims they were asked about the server by the FBI related to the file from a few months previously. At this point he shut down his server entirely and destroyed its hard drives.&lt;ref name=Hacker /&gt;

=== Initial charges and indictment ===
On January 22, 2010, the State of [[Indiana]] issued a [[search warrant]] for the DeHart's home in [[Newburgh, Indiana|Newburgh]] in with the expressed purpose of searching for [[child pornography]]. The search was executed in January 25, seizing DeHart's computers and every data storage capable device that could be found. However, two encrypted [[IronKey]] USB devices with the sensitive server data were stored in the family gun case at the time and were overlooked. DeHart suggests the drive may have also contained documents from his former military unit. During the forensic analysis of the evidence seized, officers stated child pornography was found.

Following these seizures, DeHart drove to [[Mexico]] where he mailed one drive to a contact in the [[United Kingdom]] and the other to a contact in the United States. Shortly after he would travel with his father to the [[Russian Embassy]] in [[Washington DC]] to seek asylum. The request would be denied, as would a subsequent request at the [[Venezuela]]n embassy.

In March 2010 DeHart applied for a US updated passport, which he got in less than a month. The following month, April 2010, DeHart moved to [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada and started an eight-week French immersion course with ILSC-Montreal, staying at a home with other international students. DeHart planned to take a [[welding]] class at [[Holland College]] in [[Prince Edward Island]], and his parents settled him into a studio apartment in [[Charlottetown]], near Holland College campus. Whilst applying for a [[student visa]] at US border patrol office and after handing over his US passport, DeHart was arrested and taken into custody by FBI agents. US authorities contacted police in Charlottetown, asking for his studio apartment to be searched as part of a child pornography investigation. The material seized from DeHart's apartment was not sent to [[Tennessee]] but to the FBI's field office in Washington DC, [[U.S. Department of Justice]].

Dehart was placed in a cell at Calais' Large International Avenue Immigration and Customs Enforcement Detention Center for questioning. He claims he was drugged and describes the treatment he received as "[[torture]]". He was taken unconscious in an ambulance from the Penobscot County Jail, Bangor, ME to the Eastern Maine Medical Center before 1am on August 7.  The records from the Eastern Maine Medical Center show he was diagnosed with eye pain and a [[psychotic break]].  He was released in "guarded" condition to unnamed officials and sent back to the jail. He was further interrogated by the FBI that same day while suffering from a psychotic break.  The results of that interrogation are classified. He was questioned about his military unit, Russian Embassy, Anonymous, and WikiLeaks.

{{Quote|text=They started with people in my military unit, what the connection was between them, me and the Russian embassy; and then started asking me about connections between people in my military unit and Anonymous. They also asked about WikiLeaks|author=DeHart}}

Later DeHart was transferred and kept in segregation at the [[Penobscot County]] jail in [[Bangor, Maine]]. Until his first hearing ([[Habeas Corpus]] hearing), he was incommunicado.

On August 9, 2010 DeHart was brought before U.S. Court Judge Margaret Kravchuk who branded his court appearance that day as "odd". On August 18, 2010, DeHart signed consent forms (such as the permission for any FBI agent and "any Canadian law enforcement", to record his phone calls with his old military colleagues) and authorized agents to assume his online identity, giving the FBI his aliases, and passwords to his e-mail accounts. Among the accounts was a [[Hushmail]] account in the name of "Fawkes".

DeHart was then transferred to Tennessee, where he spent 21 months in jail, allegedly because of the child pornography charges against him. In May 2012, Judge Aleta Trauger who was allowed to read classified documents about DeHart and heard the evidence on the child pornography charges, ordered DeHart releasing to a jail, with a curfew monitored via an ankle bracelet, pending trial. Judge Trauger said in her ruling:

{{Quote|text=He thought that the search for child pornography was really a ruse to try to get the proof about his extracurricular national security issues. I found him very credible on that issue. Obviously, child pornography charges are serious offenses. I have learned several aspects of this case which, in the court's mind, indicate the weight of the evidence is not as firm as I thought it was|author=Judge Trauger}}

Indecent videos were reported to be found on DeHart's computer seized in January 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States of America vs Matthew DeHart|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1689522-det-kniss-crmnl-complaint-8-6-2010.html#document/p2/a208676|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they were not sent to Tennessee but to the FBI's field office. Two years after DeHart's arrest in Canada, the US Department of Justice admitted there were classified reports on him which confirmed he was arrested "for questioning in an espionage matter"; it was a "national security investigation" but made no mention of pornography.&lt;ref name=np3&gt;{{cite news|last1=Humphreys|first1=Adrian|title='I was gone.

From May 2012 until April 2013 Matt DeHart was on bond living with his parents in a rented duplex in Newburgh Indiana.  His travel was restricted to the US Southern District of Indiana and was monitored with a curfew.

=== Deportation to the United States ===
He was deported to the US on 1 March 2015&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/2015/03/01/matt-dehart-the-alleged-anonymous-hacker-deported-to-u-s-after-canada-refused-to-grant-him-asylum/ "Matt DeHart, the alleged Anonymous hacker, deported to U.S. after Canada refused to grant him asylum", Adrian Humphreys, March 1, 2015, National Post]&lt;/ref&gt; and handed over to FBI agents at the Peace Bridge border crossing.  He was housed at the Niagara County Jail, [[Lockport, New York|Lockport]], New York, then transferred to a [[Corrections Corporation of America]] (CCA) private jail in northeast Ohio at [[Youngstown]], then transferred to the Grady County Jail in [[Chickasha]], Oklahoma; then transferred to another  CCA private jail in Mason, Tennessee. On 23 Mar 2015 he was transferred back again to the Warren County Jail, [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]], Kentucky, where he had already spent 21 months in pre-trial detention. He will remain there until the disposition of the US case against him.

On 11 June 2015 an [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] group arranged for supporters to send him gifts for his birthday in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raincoaster|title=#Anonymous Wishes Matt DeHart a Happy Birthday|url=http://thecryptosphere.com/2015/06/11/anonymous-wishes-matt-dehart-a-happy-birthday/|accessdate=23 August 2015|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plea and sentence ===
On November 13, 2015 in Tennessee, DeHart pleaded guilty to "two charges of receiving child pornography and a charge of failing to appear as ordered in court."&lt;ref name=plea&gt;{{cite news|last1=Humphreys|first1=Adrian|title='Extremely rational' Anonymous hacktivist Matt DeHart avoids 70-year prison term with child porn plea deal|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/extremely-rational-anonymous-hacktivist-matt-dehart-avoids-70-year-prison-term-with-child-porn-plea-deal|accessdate=15 November 2015|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 2016, U.S. District Judge [[Aleta Arthur Trauger]] of the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee]] sentenced DeHart to 72 months for the porn charges and an additional 18 months for fleeing the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/23/matt-dehart-us-vet-linked-anonymous-and-wikileaks-/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Model Parliament''' (also referred to as a '''Mock Parliament''') is a simulation of  the [[Parliamentary procedure|parliamentary proceedings]] of a [[legislature]] or other [[deliberative assembly]], often based upon the [[Westminster system|Westminster Parliamentary system]]. Model Parliaments are usually held as an educational tool to promote understanding of the working of [[government]].

Model Parliaments have also been established to promote the activities of [[community service]] programmes or to advocate social or political change. The [[:Category:Canadian youth parliaments|Canadian youth parliament]] movement was founded for the purpose of advancing [[youth]] programmes in [[Canada]]. [[Oxfam]] sponsors an "International Youth Parliament" to promote youth-led social change. As an example of the latter purpose, in 1914 the [[women's suffrage]] movement in [[Canada]], under the leadership of [[Nellie McClung]], organized a mock parliament to parody the refusal of the government of [[Manitoba]] to grant women the right to vote.

== Facebook Mock Parliaments ==
A number of mock parliaments have appeared on social media site [[Facebook]].

A global collective of World Mock Parliaments has been established, more commonly referred to as the World Federation of Mock Parliaments. The aim of The World Federation of Mock Parliaments is to link and interact with as many online mock parliaments from all over the world. Interaction and reaction is encouraged between each parliament, to replicate real life reactions, to mimic such actions such as domestic and international policy.

The '''Police and Border Guard Board''' ({{lang-et|Politsei- ja Piirivalveamet}}) is a unified governmental agency within the Estonian Ministry of Interior and is responsible for law enforcement and homeland security in the Republic of Estonia.

The main tasks of the agency are to ensure and protect the integrity of the Estonian state and, since May 1, 2004, also the European Union border within the territories of the Republic of Estonia; to secure the state borders and the European Union outer border within the territories of the Republic of Estonia, to monitor and identify citizenship, along with handling the documentation, to preserve law and civil order within the borders of the Republic of Estonia and to detect and prevent crime.

==History==
[[Andrus Ansip's cabinet|Andrus Ansip's Government Cabinet]] which was established after the [[Elections in Estonia|2005 parlamental elections]], stated in its 2007–2011 coalition programme the need for a unified homeland security agency in order to reduce operating costs and upkeep&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postimees.ee/?id=197788 Eesti Postimees: The Police and Border Guard Board hopes to earn back its unification costs within 4&amp;nbsp;years]&lt;/ref&gt; between the ministry and its organizations.&lt;ref name="siseministeerium.ee"&gt;[http://www.siseministeerium.ee/37644 Ministry of Interior: The overview of the establishment of the Police and Border Guard Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117055636/http://www.siseministeerium.ee/37644/ |date=2010-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 13, 2007 the Ministry of the Interior established a working group&lt;!--töögrupp; avid task group and task force.--&gt; in order commence research about possible unification of the Estonian Police and Estonian Border Guard agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siseministeerium.ee/index.php?id=903&amp;t_id=&amp;asutus_id=1&amp;dok_id=486840 Ministry of Interior: Public information: Public documents: Directive nr. 57]&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the unified Police and Border Guard Boards formally begins with the establishment of the Police and Border Guard Board in 2010.

The final study presented by the working group proposed to unite three main law enforcement organizations, including the Police, Border Guard, and the Citizenship and Migration Board into a single structure capable of carrying out all the tasks. In October 2007, the Ministry of the Interior created another working group with an operational task to start the unification process.&lt;ref name="siseministeerium.ee"/&gt; On August 31, 2008, the Cabinet approved the creation of a new government organization within the Ministry of the Interior with the unification of these three agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valitsus.ee/?id=8106 The Government of the Republic of Estonia: The unification of the Police, Border Guard and the Citizenship and Migration Boards]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2009, the Estonian Parliament recognized the agency unification idea with the adoption of the ''Police and Border Guard Board Law'', and changes into other laws regarding the area of competency of the Ministry. In June, the Cabinet appointed [[Raivo Küüt]] to be the first Director General of the organization. On January 1, 2010, the Police and Border Guard Board officially started work.

'''Real socialism''' (also '''actually existing socialism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire |author=Victor Sebestyen |isbn=978-0-7538-2709-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''developed socialism''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brezhnev on the Theory of Developed Socialism|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1980-2/our-little-father/our-little-father-texts/brezhnev-on-the-theory-of-developed-socialism/|website=Macalester College|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an ideological catchphrase popularized during the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Interia"&gt;[http://encyklopedia.interia.pl/haslo?hid=103753 Socjalizm Realny (Real Socialism)] ''Encyklopedia Interia''. {{pl icon}} Retrieved November 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term referred to the [[Soviet-type economic planning]] enforced by the ruling communist parties at that particular time.&lt;ref name="Interia"/&gt; From the 1960s onward, countries such as [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]],
[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] began to argue that their policies represented what was realistically feasible given their level of productivity, even if it did not conform to the [[Socialism (Marxism)|Marxist concept of socialism]].

The concept of real socialism alluded to a future highly developed socialist system. However, the lagging productivity growth and insufficient standard of living in the [[Comecon]] countries caused the phrase "real socialism" to be increasingly perceived as dishonest and unreal.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The actual party claims of nomenclatory socialism began to acquire not only negative, but also sarcastic meanings. In later years and especially after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the term began to be remembered as only one thing, i.e. as a reference for [[Soviet socialism|Soviet-style socialism]].{{#tag:ref|See definitions and descriptions of "real socialism" in the following:

==Definition==
After [[World War II]], the terms "real socialism" or "really existing socialism" gradually became the predominating euphemisms used as self-description of the [[Eastern Bloc]] states' political and economical systems and their society models.&lt;ref name=Hey31/&gt; ''De jure'' often referred to as "(democratic) people's republics", these states were ruled by a single Soviet-aligned [[Marxism–Leninism]] party, some of which were ruled autocratically and had adapted a form of [[planned economy]] and propagated socialism and/or [[communism]] as their ideology.&lt;ref name=Hey31/&gt; The term "real (-ly existing) socialism" was introduced to explain the obvious gap between the propagated ideological framework and the political and economical reality faced by these states' societies.&lt;ref name=Hey31&gt;{{cite book|last=Hey|first=Patrizia|title=Die sowjetische Polenpolitik Anfang der 1980er Jahre und die Verhängung des Kriegsrechts in der Volksrepublik Polen. Tatsächliche sowjetische Bedrohung oder erfolgreicher Bluff?|series=Studien zu Konflikt und Kooperation im Osten|volume=19|publisher=LIT|location=Münster|year=2010|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DaNNMuv3EsC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22real+existierender+sozialismus%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NQW7UJ_0D5DLtAbujoCwDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22real%20existierender%20sozialismus%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of the Sino-Soviet split==
Another aspect of the term real socialism contained elements of the [[Sino-Soviet split]] and other "disagreements", which were actually ideological gulfs, between the Soviet Union and its [[satellite states]] on one side and the [[People's Republic of China]] and the followers of a more [[Maoist]] brand of communist ideology on the other. The Soviets wished to enforce the idea that their version of socialism was "real" and the Chinese and their followers were not, precisely because the Maoist-inspired communist movement, which had grown so rapidly worldwide as a "radical left" alternative to Soviet ideas, had consistently claimed that the Soviet Union was no longer socialist and had betrayed the [[world revolution|revolution]]. To counter this claim of [[Marxist revisionism]], the Soviets defiantly claimed that their socialism was "real socialism", implying that other models of socialism were unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Sarnov" /&gt;

==Soviet popular culture==
The term was also used in an ironical criticism. The "reality" of "real socialism" was used against it. In particular, the term became a target of numerous [[Russian jokes|political jokes]] in the Soviet Union, the following being typical examples.&lt;ref name="Sarnov"&gt;[[Benedikt Sarnov]], ''Our Soviet [[Newspeak]]: A Short Encyclopedia of Real Socialism'' (Наш советский новояз. Маленькая энциклопедия реального социализма). "Real Socialism", pages 472-474. Moscow: 2002, {{ISBN|5-85646-059-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*"Do you know the boundary between real socialism and [[communism]]?" – "The border runs along the [[Kremlin]]'s wall" [hinting that only rulers of the Soviet Union live in the bright communist future promised by Karl Marx].
*"What is real socialism?" – "This is when you cannot yet get everything without money, but you already cannot buy anything for your money" [hinting at the long lines and frequent shortages of consumer goods in the Soviet stores].
*[[Radio Yerevan jokes|Armenian Radio]] was asked: "Is it possible to build real socialism in [[Armenia]]?". Armenian Radio answers: "Yes, but it would be better to do it in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]".

==In the West==
The term "actually existing socialism" was often used by orthodox communists in the West to attack either their external (typically [[Trotskyist]]) opponents or their internal (typically [[Eurocommunist]]) critics. The achievement of "actual" socialism being used as a counter to these groups' critiques of repression inside the "socialist countries".

The '''rise of Rome''' covers the period in which the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]] came to dominate [[Europe]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Near East]]. The rise of the [[Roman Republic]] began with the overthrow of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus|Lucius Tarquinius]] in 753 BC and ended with the formation of the [[Roman Empire]] in 27 BC. The rise of the Roman Empire continued growth started with the Republic. Roman imperialism peaked during the reign of [[Trajan]], the last Roman emperor to add significant territory to the Empire. It is the subject of a great deal of analysis by historians, military strategists, political scientists, and increasingly also some economists.

==Roman expansion==
The exact causes and motivations for Rome's military conflicts and expansions during the republic are subject to wide debate. While they can be seen as motivated by outright aggression and [[imperialism]], historians typically take a much more nuanced view.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', pp. 42-44.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that Rome's expansion was driven by short-term defensive decisions and the new contingencies that these decisions created.&lt;ref name="luttwakP38"&gt;Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its early history, Rome defended itself against foreign threats in central and northern Italy. City-states that the Romans defeated began to make alliances with the Romans. As such, early republican Rome was not an "empire" or "state" in the modern sense, but an alliance of independent city-states with varying degrees of independence engaged in an alliance of mutual self-protection led by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; With some important exceptions{{Which one|date=November 2018}}, wars Rome's early history led not to annexation or military occupation, but to the restoration of the way things were because of this. However, the defeated city-state would be weakened and less able to resist [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]]. It was also less able to defend itself against its enemies. As a result, the city-state was more likely to seek an alliance with Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Madden, ''Empires of Trust'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

This growing coalition expanded the potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers.&lt;ref&gt;Madden, ''Empires of Trust'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was more alliance-seeking, on the part of both the Roman confederacy and city-states seeking membership. While there were exceptions to this (such as military rule of [[Sicily]] after the [[First Punic War]]),&lt;ref&gt;Madden, ''Empires of Trust'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until after the [[Second Punic War]] that these alliances started to harden into something more like an empire.

In contrast, Roman expansion into [[Hispania]] and [[Gaul]] occurred as a mix of alliance-seeking and military occupation. In the 2nd century, Roman involvement in the Greek east remained a matter of alliance-seeking, but this time in the face of major powers that could rival Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', pp. 23, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Polybius]], who sought to trace how Rome came to dominate Greece in less than a century, this was mainly a matter of several Greek city-states seeking Roman protection against the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]] and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]]. In contrast to the west, the Greek east had been dominated by empires for centuries, and Roman influence and alliance-seeking led to wars with these empires.&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein, ''Rome Enters the Greek East'', pp. 40, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This had some similarities to the events in Italy but on a global scale.

==Description==

The 43 men who as of 2010 had served as President of the United States are gathered in a park in front of the White House, above which the American flag can be seen, at half mast. In general, the 18th and 19th century presidents are on the left, the later ones on the right, some appear lost in thought while others, [[Bill Clinton]] and the two Roosevelts, are applauding. The only non-president in the painting is a young white man, who sits alone on a park bench, hunched over in despair, contemplating his future. Some of the presidents, including [[George Washington|Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] reach out to him, while looking toward [[Barack Obama]] who stands in the foreground right. [[James Madison]], the Father of the Constitution, is outraged by Obama's actions, for beneath Obama's foot is the U.S. Constitution. Scattered on the ground are dollar bills, laws and amendments that form part of the Bill of Rights.

==Reception and influence==

The painting gained initial notoriety in 2010 when it was featured on [[MSNBC]] television host [[Rachel Maddow]]'s blog as part of a caption contest.&lt;ref name="anikamehta1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ibtimes.com/forgotten-man-jon-mcnaughton-painting-shows-obama-standing-us-constitution-photo-405530 | title = The Forgotten Man: Jon McNaughton Painting Shows Obama Standing on US Constitution [PHOTO] | date = 2 March 2012 | accessdate = 25 April 2018 | publisher = ''International Business Times'' | author = Anika Mehta }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, it drew satirical praise during an episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' from [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert's conservative persona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sltrib.com/news/2017/08/26/utah-artist-who-found-fame-and-controversy-for-religious-and-political-works-releases-first-trump-painting/ | title = Utah painter who found fame and controversy for religious and political art releases first Trump piece | date = 13 September 2017 | accessdate = 25 April 2018 | publisher = ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' | author = Brennan Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being purchased by conservative commentator [[Sean Hannity]] in 2016, ''The Forgotten Man'' was rumored to have been bought as a gift for then President-elect [[Donald Trump]], though a spokesperson for [[Fox News]] (Hannity's employer) later clarified that the painting was never intended to be given as a gift.&lt;ref name="jimnewell"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/16/did_sean_hannity_buy_donald_trump_this_painting.html | title = Did Sean Hannity Buy Donald Trump This Anti-Obama Painting to Hang in the White House? | date = 17 November 2016 | accessdate = 25 April 2018 | publisher = ''Slate'' | author = Jim Newell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.politico.com/blogs/donald-trump-administration/2016/11/sean-hannity-buys-anti-obama-painting-231544 | title = Update: Mystery solved! Hannity bought the anti-Obama painting for himself | date = 17 November 2016 | accessdate = 25 April 2018 | publisher = ''Politico'' | author = Henry C. Jacson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has drawn comparisons to a 1934 [[Maynard Dixon]] painting of the same name.&lt;ref name="peterschjeldahl1" /&gt;

A '''tortilleria''', or '''tortilla bakery''' is a shop that produces and sells freshly made [[tortillas]].  Tortillerias are native to Mexico and Central America, and some are being established in some areas of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060619/BUSINESS/606190584&amp;template=printpicart |title=Tortilla bakeries feed need &amp;#124; HeraldTribune.com &amp;#124; Sarasota Florida &amp;#124; Southwest Florida's Information Leader |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tortillerias usually sell corn tortillas by weight.  The recipe for tortilla dough, called [[masa]], has not changed since ancient times;  it is corn which has been treated with [[slaked lime]] and water.&lt;ref name="urlNYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/04/world/mexico-city-journal-tortilla-rises-must-belts-tighten.html |title=Mexico City Journal; Tortilla Rises: Must Belts Tighten? - The New York Times |work= |accessdate=2009-09-11 | first=Ginger | last=Thompson | date=1999-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of production==

Some tortillerias produce tortillas from pre-made masa dough, others produce masa dough in-house from dried masa flour called [[masa harina]], and others use the traditional method of soaking corn with lime.

==Effect of corn subsidies==

Corn was subsidized in Mexico from 1974 to 1999, and the price of tortillas was capped by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/EB01O10003A.pdf |title=Economics Bulletin: Are tortillas a Giffen Good in Mexico? |format= |work= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When subsidies and price controls ended, tortillerias had to adapt.  The end of the subsidy was met with mixed reception.  Some tortilleria owners saw the move as an opportunity to retain jobs and increase profits, while others expressed concern that higher tortilla prices would hurt low-income families who relied on tortillas as a staple food.&lt;ref name="urlNYT" /&gt;  

Before the end of subsidies many local tortillerias purchased prepared fresh masa dough from centralized mills, since government-subsidized corn was provided directly to these mills.  After the end of subsidies dried masa harina flour was used, as dough mills lost their price advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-780802.html |title=Flipping Over the Tortilla &amp;#124; Article from The Washington Post &amp;#124; HighBeam Research |work= |accessdate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dried masa harina keeps much better than prepared masa.  To encourage the switch to dry masa harina, manufacturers such as [[Maseca]] offered credits to tortillerias to upgrade to equipment capable of processing masa harina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1998/b3604209.arc.htm |title=BW Online &amp;#124; November 16, 1998 &amp;#124; WHO'LL FLATTEN WHOM IN THE TORTILLA WARS?

A '''treasury''' is either
*A government department related to finance and taxation.
*A place or [[Schatzkammer]] where currency or precious items like [[gold]], [[diamonds]] etc. are kept.

The head of a treasury is typically known as a [[treasurer]]. This position may not necessarily have the final control over the actions of the treasury, particularly if they are not an elected representative.

The adjective for a treasury is normally '''treasurial'''. The adjective "tresorial" can also be used, but this normally means pertaining to a ''treasurer''.

The term ''treasury'' was first used in [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] times to describe the votive buildings erected to house [[Sacrifice|gifts to the gods]], such as the [[Siphnian Treasury]] in [[Delphi]] or many similar buildings erected in [[Olympia, Greece]] by competing city-states to impress others during the [[ancient Olympic Games]].  In [[Ancient Greece]] treasuries were almost always physically incorporated within religious buildings such as temples, thus making state funds sacrosanct and adding moral constraints to the penal ones to those who would have access to these funds.

==Examples of treasuries==

===Treasury===
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Her Majesty's Treasury]] is overseen by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].  The traditional honorary title of [[First Lord of the Treasury]] is held by the [[Prime Minister]].  [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]] administers the [[taxation]] system.

In the [[United States]], the [[Treasurer of the United States|Treasurer]] reports to an executive-appointed [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]. The [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] is the revenue agency of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Department of the Treasury]].

===Ministry of finance===
In many other countries, the treasury is called the "[[ministry of finance]]" and the head is known as the finance minister. Examples include [[the Bahamas]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[New Zealand]], Ghana, [[Canada]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[India]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

===Both===
In some other countries, a "Treasury" will exist alongside a separate "Ministry of Finance", with divided functions.

The [[government of Poland]] includes the Ministry of Finance as well as the Ministry of State Treasury, as does the [[government of Ukraine]]. It was the same in [[government of Italy|Italy]] before the creation of the united Ministry of Economy.

In the [[Australian federal government]] a treasurer and a finance minister co-exist. The [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|Department of the Treasury]] is responsible for drafting the government budget, economic policy (except [[monetary policy]]), some market regulation and revenue policy (which is administered by the [[Australian Taxation Office]]). The Finance Minister, who manages the [[Department of Finance and Deregulation]], is responsible for budget management, government expenditure and market deregulation.

The '''Vienna Literary Agreement''' ([[Serbo-Croatian]] [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latin]]: ''Bečki književni dogovor'', [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Бечки књижевни договор) was the result of a meeting held in March 1850, when writers from [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], and one from [[Slovenia]] met to discuss the extent to which their literatures could be conjoined and united, and to standardize a [[Serbo-Croatian]] language. The agreement recognized the commonality of South Slavic dialects and enumerated a basic set of [[grammar]] rules which they shared.

==Historical context==
The first half of 19th century proved to be a turning point in [[Illyrian movement|Illyrian]] language conceptions. Around this time, Illyrians held individual debates with their opponents, and [[Zagreb]], as the center of Croatian cultural and literary life, served as a stronghold for their implementation and propagation. However, with the years some of their adherents came to recognize the infeasibility of linguistic and literary unification of all [[South Slavs]], realizing that the only real option left would be the creation of a common literary language for Croats and Serbs, which have in common both the [[Shtokavian dialect]] and [[Ijekavian accent]].&lt;ref name="Malić 1997"&gt;{{Harv|Malić|1997|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The agreement==
In March 1850, the meeting was organized and attended by the self-taught Serbian linguist and folklorist [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]], his close follower [[Đuro Daničić]]; the most eminent [[Slavic studies|Slavist]] of the period, Slovene [[Franc Miklošič]], and Croatians represented by [[Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski]], [[Dimitrije Demeter]], [[Ivan Mažuranić]], [[Vinko Pacel]], and [[Stjepan Pejaković]].

General guidelines for the conceived development of the common literary language for Croats and Serbs were agreed on; these were in accordance with Karadžić's basic linguistic and orthographic premises, and they partly corresponded with the fundamental Croatian Neo-Shtokavian pre-Illyrian literary language which the concept of Illyrian suppressed at the expense of South-Slavic commonality.

The signatories agreed on five points:
# They decided not to merge existing [[dialect]]s, instead creating a new one, and that they should, following German and Italian models, pick one of the peoples' dialects and choose this as the literary basis according to which all text would be written.
# They unanimously accepted the selection of the "southern dialect"&lt;ref&gt;The term ''southern dialect'' refers to the Montenegrin Neo-Shtokavian dialect of the region from which Vuk Karadžić originated, and to the language of Serbs of Eastern Herzegovina.&lt;/ref&gt; as the common literary language for all Serbs and Croats, and to write ''ije''&lt;ref&gt;The text of the agreement itself lists many examples of disyllabic ''ije'', such as "ovijeh dana", "narodnijeh narječja", "nijesu gradili novijeh",  "na onijem mjestima", "ovijem", kojijem", "po ostalijem današnjijem jezicima slavenskijem" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; where this dialect had the disyllabic reflex of long ''[[yat|jat]]'', and ''je'', ''e'', or ''i'' where the reflex is monosyllabic (i.e. Ijekavian, Ekavian, or Ikavian). In order to ascertain precisely where the aforementioned dialect has two syllables and where only one, [[Vuk Karadžić]] was asked to write  "general rules for the southern dialect" (''opća pravila za južno narječje'') on this issue, which he did.
# They agreed that Serbian and Montenegrin writers should write ''h'' (/x/) everywhere it belongs etymologically, as Croatian writers do, and as some people in southern regions use in speech.
# They all agreed that the [[genitive case|genitive]] [[grammatical number|plurals]] of nouns and adjectives should not have ''h'' at the end because it doesn't belong there by etymology, because it is not necessary as a distinction from other cases in the paradigm, and because many writers don't write it at all.
# It was agreed that before syllabic /r/, one should write neither ''a'' or ''e'' as some Croatian writers do, but only ''r'', such as in the word ''prst'' ('finger'), because this is the spoken form, and the much more prevalent written form elsewhere.

During the second half of the 19th century, these conclusions were publicly called a "declaration" (''objava'') or "statement" (''izjava''). The title ''Vienna Literary Agreement'' dates from the 20th century.

==Implications and influence==
The Vienna Literary Agreement was variously interpreted and referred to throughout the history of Croats, Slovenes, and Serbs. During the history of the [[Yugoslavia]]s, especially the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], the official doctrine was that the agreement set firm grounds for the final codification of the [[Croatian language]] and the [[Serbian language]] that soon followed. With the advent of [[standard language|national standard languages]], i.e. [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] in the 1990s, criticism emerged on the relevance of the agreement.

For example, according to Malić,&lt;ref name="Malić 1997" /&gt; the event had no critical influence for the Croatian cultural milieu, but "managed to indicate developmental tendencies in the formation of the Croatian literary language which won out by the end of the century". Malić argues that it was only during the 20th century, in the framework of "unitarist language conceptions and language policy", that the meeting was given critical influence in the formation of a common Croatian and Serbian literary language.

Since the agreement was not officially organized, no one was bound by it, and thus it was not initially accepted by either the Croatian or the Serbian press. Croatia still had a very lively Illyrian conception of language, and the conservative Serbian cultural milieu was not ready to accept Karadžić's views of folk language being literary. It was only in 1868 that his reform was accepted in Serbia, and not to a complete extent (the Ekavian accent was accepted as standard, rather than Ijekavian), and urban colloquial speech was tacitly given great influence in forming the standard language.

[[Dame]] '''Vivienne Isabel Westwood''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DBE|RDI}} (née '''Swire'''; born 8 April 1941) is a British fashion designer and businesswoman, largely responsible for bringing modern [[Punk fashion|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] fashions into the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vivw/hd_vivw.htm|last=Bell-Price|first=Shannon|title=Vivienne Westwood (born 1941) and the Postmodern Legacy of Punk Style Source: Vivienne Westwood (born 1941) and the Postmodern Legacy of Punk Style|publisher=Metmuseum.org|accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westwood came to public notice when she made clothes for [[Malcolm McLaren]]'s boutique in the [[King's Road]], which became known as "[[Sex (boutique)|SEX]]". It was their ability to synthesise clothing and music that shaped the 1970s UK punk scene, dominated by McLaren's band, the [[Sex Pistols]]. She was inspired by the shock-value of punk—"seeing if one could put a spoke in the system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=All-TIME 100 Fashion Icons: Vivienne Westwood|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2110513_2110512_2110755,00.html|agency=Time magazine|date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westwood went on to open four shops in [[London]], eventually expanding throughout the United Kingdom and the world, selling an increasingly varied range of merchandise, some of it linked to her many political causes such as the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], [[climate change]] and [[civil rights]] groups.

==Life and career==

===Early years===

Westwood was born in the village of [[Tintwistle]], [[Cheshire]],{{#tag:ref|Westwood was born in [[Tintwistle]], but at the time of her birth in 1941 Tintwistle was in the county of [[Cheshire]]. Since 1974, Tintwistle has fallen in [[Derbyshire]].|group=N}} on 8 April 1941,&lt;ref name="grande dame"&gt;{{cite news|author=Susannah Frankel|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/meet-the-grande-dame-of-glossop-743124.html|title=Meet the grande dame of Glossop|work=The Independent|date=20 October 1999|accessdate=30 March 2010|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of Gordon Swire and Dora Swire ([[née]] Ball), who had married two years previously, two weeks after the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="detective"&gt;{{cite news|author=Nick Barratt|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3631589/Family-detective.html|title=Family detective|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 February 2007|accessdate=30 March 2010|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Vivienne's birth, her father was employed as a storekeeper in an aircraft factory; he had previously worked as a [[greengrocer]].&lt;ref name="detective"/&gt;

She attended Glossop Grammar School. In 1958, her family moved to [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], [[Middlesex]]. She studied silversmithing at Harrow School of Art&lt;ref&gt;The Harrow School of Art was incorporated into the [[University of Westminster]], 1992&lt;/ref&gt; but left after one term, saying later, "I didn't know how a working-class girl like me could possibly make a living in the art world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1231_vivienne_westwood/text_panel_r1_01.html |title=Vivienne Westwood – The Early Years|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|date=|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking up a job in a factory and studying at a teacher-training college, she became a [[primary school]] teacher. During this period, she created her own jewellery, which she sold at a stall on [[Portobello Road]].&lt;ref name="grande dame"/&gt; While she continued teaching and simultaneously making jewellery, this led to her discovering design when she met Malcolm McLaren who became a major inspiration to her designs in punk fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Uglow|first1=Jennifer|title=The Palgrave MacMillan Dictionary of women's biography.|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Ltd.|location=Basingstoke, United Kingdom|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, she met Derek Westwood, a [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] factory apprentice, in Harrow.&lt;ref name="disgracefully yours"&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/vivienne-westwood-disgracefully-yours-the-queen-mother-of-fashion-178866.html|title=Vivienne Westwood: Disgracefully yours, the Queen Mother of Fashion|work=The Independent|date=2 June 2002|accessdate=31 March 2010|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married on 21 July 1962; Westwood made her own wedding dress.&lt;ref name="disgracefully yours"/&gt; In 1963, she gave birth to a son, Benjamin (Ben) Westwood.&lt;ref name="disgracefully yours"/&gt;

===Malcolm McLaren===

Once she met [[Malcolm McLaren]], it meant the end of Westwood's marriage to Derek. Westwood and McLaren moved to a [[council flat]] in [[Clapham]], and while living there, they had a son together in 1967, Joseph Corré.&lt;ref name=i20020729&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/joe-correacute-and-serena-rees-sex-and-the-city-649844.html|work=The Independent|title=Joe Corré and Serena Rees: Sex and the City|date=29 July 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412135859/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/joe-correacute-and-serena-rees-sex-and-the-city-649844.html |archivedate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Westwood continued to teach until 1971; she created clothes which McLaren designed. McLaren became manager of the punk band the Sex Pistols and subsequently the two garnered attention as the band wore Westwood's and McLaren's designs.

===Punk era===

Westwood was one of the architects of the [[punk fashion]] phenomenon of the 1970s, saying "I was messianic about punk, seeing if one could put a spoke in the system in some way".&lt;ref name="disgracefully yours"/&gt;

===Fashion collections===

[[File:Vivienne Westwood Mini Crini.jpg|thumb|The 'Mini-Crini,' 1985-87]]

Westwood was the designer who often let her clothes speak for themselves, as independent designs and as her own statements of culture.  This idea that she uses her clothing as a statement of her own is a motif consistent throughout her time as a designer. Although this is also a factor as to why she was ridiculed as a designer, it was such a strong proclamation to his and her designs that she remained this way within her collections. This idea partially was attributed to her past collaborations with Gary Ness, who assisted Westwood throughout her designing with inspirations and titles for her collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Neill|first1=Alistair|title=Exhibition Review: Vivienne Westwood: 34 Years in Fashion|journal=Fashion Theory The Journal of Dress, Body and Culture|date=21 April 2015|pages= 381–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLaren and Westwood's first fashion collection to be shown to press and potential international buyers was Pirate. Subsequently, the partnership of McLaren and Westwood - which was underlined by the fact that both their names appeared on all labelling - showed collections in Paris and London with the thematic titles Savages (shown late 1981), Buffalo/Nostalgia Of Mud (shown spring 1982), Punkature (shown late 1982), Witches (shown early 1983) and Worlds End 1984 (later renamed Hypnos, shown late 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.viviennewestwood.com/history/early-years|title=Vivienne Westwood: the early years|accessdate=21 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215223730/http://www.viviennewestwood.com/history/early-years|archivedate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the partnership with McLaren was dissolved, Westwood showed one more collection featuring the Worlds End label: "Clint Eastwood" (late 1984-early 1985).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

She dubbed the period 1981-85 "New Romantic" and 1988–91 as "The Pagan Years" during which "Vivienne's heroes changed from punks and ragamuffins to 'Tatler' girls wearing clothes that parodied the upper class". From 1985-87, Westwood took inspiration from the ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' to design the mini-crini, an abbreviated version of the Victorian [[crinoline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Vivienne Westwood designs|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/vivienne-westwood-designs|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its [[miniskirt|mini-length]], bouffant silhouette inspired the puffball skirts widely presented by more established designers such as [[Christian Lacroix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Caroline|editor1-last=Breward|editor1-first=Christopher|editor2-last=Ehrman|editor2-first=Edwina|editor3-last=Evans|editor3-first=Caroline|title=The London look: fashion from street to catwalk|date=2004|page=149|publisher=Yale University Press/Museum of London|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300103991|chapter=Cultural Capital 1976-2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mini-crini was described in 1989 as a combination of two conflicting ideals - the crinoline, representing a "mythology of restriction and encumbrance in woman's dress", and the miniskirt, representing an "equally dubious mythology of liberation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Caroline|last2=Thornton|first2=Minna|title=Women and Fashion: A New Look|date=1989|publisher=Quartet Books|location=London, UK|isbn=9780704326910|pages=148–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Westwood was called upon to design an academic gown of a prestigious academic institution. She was approached by [[Patricia Rawlings, Baroness Rawlings]], then Chairperson of [[King's College London]] after King's successfully petitioned the [[Privy Council]] for its own right to award degree-awarding powers in its own right.&lt;ref name="kcl.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/publications/comment-archive/pdfs/2008/comment-183.pdf|format=PDF|title=Comment: The College Newsletter: Westwood unveils gowns|date=September 2008|website=Kcl.ac.uk|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Westwood-designed academic dresses for [[King's College London]] have been unveiled. On the gowns, Westwood commented: "Through my reworking of the traditional robe I tried to link the past, the present and the future. We are what we know."&lt;ref name="kcl.ac.uk"/&gt;

In July 2011, Westwood's collections were presented at the catwalk of [[The Brandery]] fashion show in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;The Brandery, Catwalk, [http://www.thebrandery.com/portal/appmanager/efiraSalones/S094011?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=P75201021481310034214819&amp;profileLocale=en TV Fashion Runway Show] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903012646/http://www.thebrandery.com/portal/appmanager/efiraSalones/S094011?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=P75201021481310034214819&amp;profileLocale=en |date=3 September 2011 }}, thebrandery.com; accessed 20 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Westwood’s first immersion into the fashion world began during the punk era, where she dabbled in both men’s and women’s design, specifically in uniforms which combined her forties dressmaking with touches of [[Savile Row]]. She closely worked with [[Richard Branson]] on this collection. These pieces were more functional designs of Westwood, as they were primarily for work but still contained her flair as a designer. Clothes for the female crew included a red suit, accentuating the women’s curves and hips, and strategically places darts around the busts. Contrary to the men’s grey and burgundy three-piece suit with various details in lapels and pockets.
These two designers also focused on impacting the environment, as they were both passionate about using sustainable materials throughout their designs. As they worked with [[Virgin Atlantic]] on the functional crew designs, each look featured Closed Loop Recycling and maximum sustainability in recycled polyester. Before fully launching the designs, Westwood and Branson released some for a trial period with the pilot and cabin crew to allow for design changes to be made accordingly. This project was important to these two designers because this project shared the spirit of adventure that these two employed, as this challenged them to create something even more memorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karimzadeh|first1=Marc|title=Vivienne Westwood Takes Flight With Richard Branson On Virgin Atlantic|journal=Trade Journals|date=2 May 2013|volume=205|issue=90|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1349800397?accountid=2909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vivienne Westwood companies==

In August 2011 Westwood's company Vivienne Westwood Ltd agreed to pay almost £350,000 in tax to HM Revenue &amp; Customs for significantly underestimating the value of her brand. Her UK business had sold the rights to her trademarks to Luxembourg-based Latimo, which she controls, for £840,000 in 2002. After examining the deal HMRC argued that Westwood's brand had been undervalued, and, after negotiation, the two sides agreed that her trademarks were worth more than double that amount. The £2m valuation triggered an additional tax bill of £348,463 plus interest of £144,112, which fell due in 2009.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tyler|first=Richard|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8728580/Vivienne-Westwood-undervalues-itself.html|title=Vivienne Westwood undervalues itself|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Vivienne Westwood Group reached agreement to end a long-standing UK franchise relationship with Manchester-based Hervia. The deal brought to a conclusion a legal wrangle which included Hervia issuing High Court proceedings for alleged breach of contract, after Westwood sought to end the franchise deal before the agreed term. It was reported that a financial settlement was reached between the parties. Hervia operated seven stores for the fashion chain on a franchise basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/business-news/vivienne-westwood-group-hervia-agree-683290|title=Vivienne Westwood Group and Hervia agree to settlement|newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]]|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the transition of some of the Hervia stores to Westwood, along with cost-savings, was credited for a jump in Vivienne Westwood Ltd's pre-tax profits to £5 million from £527,6783 the previous year, with annual group sales of £30.1 million up from £25.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2427873/Cost-cuts-Vivienne-Westwood-fashions-profit-rise.html|title=Cost cuts at Vivienne Westwood fashions a profit rise|publisher=This is Money|date=21 September 2013|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the company results showed “disappointing” sales with a dip of 2% to £29.5 million and a fall of 36% in pre-tax profits to £3.2 million in 2013, according to accounts posted at Companies House. The company announced: “Over the last year margins have been under pressure due to the nature of wider retail conditions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Russell Lynch|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/vivienne-westwood-profits-fall-after-disappointing-year-9656589.html|title=Vivienne Westwood profits fall after 'disappointing' year|website=Standard.co.uk|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013 Westwood announced she was shunning further expansion of her business as a way of tackling environmental and sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Binnie|first=Isla|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/24/us-milan-fashionweek-westwood-idUSBRE95N1F320130624|title=Designer Vivienne Westwood shuns expansion, big wardrobes|publisher=Reuters|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the company announced that it is opening a three-storey outlet in midtown Manhattan in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Khanh T.L.

In 2015, Vivienne Westwood Ltd operated 12 retail outlets in the UK, including an outlet store in [[Bicester Village]]. There are currently 63 Westwood outlets worldwide including 9 in China; 9 in Hong Kong; 18 in South Korea; six in Taiwan; two in Thailand; and two in the US: one in Los Angeles and the other in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viviennewestwood.com/store-locator|title=Store Locator|publisher=VivienneWestwood.com|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Vivienne Westwood Ltd reported a profits dip from £3.2m to £2.9m in 2014, despite an 8.4% jump in sales to £32m. VWL paid  £1.6m in licence fees to Latimo in 2014 and £646,033 in UK corporation tax last year, a 17% fall from the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Armstrong|first=Ashley|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11702387/Vivienne-Westwood-sales-rise-while-profits-wilt.html|title=Vivienne Westwood sales rise while profits wilt|publisher=Telegraph|date=27 June 2015|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several media outlets reported in 2015 that the latest accounts for Vivienne Westwood Ltd showed the company pays £2 million a year to [[offshore company]] Latimo, which was set up in Luxembourg for the right to use her name on her own fashion label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/green-party/11457076/Vivienne-Westwood-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-offshore-tax-base.html|title=Vivienne Westwood accused of hypocrisy over offshore tax base|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latimo, which Westwood controls as the majority shareholder in her companies, was set up in 2002.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

Such arrangements, while legal, are against the Green Party policy to crack down heavily on usage of tax havens such as Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nicola Woolcock|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/money/tax/article4376311.ece|title=Vivienne Westwood accused of £2m tax avoidance|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=9 March 2015|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westwood stressed that she paid income tax though did not address the issue of her corporate tax arrangements: "It is important to me that my business affairs are in line with my personal values. I am subject to UK tax on all of my income," she said in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2015/03/11/vivienne-westwood-responds-to-tax-avoidance-claims|title=Vivienne Westwood Responds To Tax Avoidance Claims|website=Vogue.co.uk|date=11 March 2015|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She published a statement which indicated that her corporate tax arrangements are being restructured as a result of the expose.&lt;ref name="climaterevolution.co.uk"/&gt;

===''Sex and the City''===

Westwood's designs were featured in the [[Sex and the City (film)|2008 film adaptation]] of the television series ''[[Sex and the City]]''. In the film, [[Carrie Bradshaw]] becomes engaged to long-term lover [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]]. Being a writer at ''Vogue'', she is invited by her editor to model wedding dresses, including a design made by Westwood. The dress is subsequently sent to Carrie as a gift, with a handwritten note from Westwood herself, and Carrie decides to use the Westwood gown. The wedding dress has been described as one of the movie's most iconic features, leading Westwood to approach the producers about being involved in making a sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/090107-vivienne-westwood-to-write-satc-seq.aspx|last=Barnett|first=Leisa|title=Sex And The Dame)|publisher=Vogue.co.uk|date=7 January 2009|accessdate=30 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430204550/http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/090107-vivienne-westwood-to-write-satc-seq.aspx|archivedate=30 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political involvement==

In April 1989 Westwood appeared on the cover of ''[[Tatler (1901)|Tatler]]'' dressed as then-Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The suit that Westwood wore had been ordered for Thatcher but had not yet been delivered.&lt;ref name="Thatcher Tatler"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/livingicons/bio10.shtml|title=Biography: Dame Vivienne Westwood|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thatcher Tatler"/&gt; The cover, which bore the caption "This woman was once a punk", was included in ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s list of the best ever UK magazine covers.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2008/aug/08/pressandpublishing?picture=336315461|title=Are these the best ever UK magazine covers?|work=The Guardian|date=8 August 2008|accessdate=13 February 2010|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dame Vivienne stated on television in 2007 that she had transferred her long-standing support for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], over the issues of civil liberties and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/2007-11/071129-viviennes-christmas-speech.aspx |title=New Conservative Vivienne Westwood has something to get off her chest |publisher=Vogue.co.uk |date=29 November 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430204545/http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/2007-11/071129-viviennes-christmas-speech.aspx |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since early 2015, she has been a supporter of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/sep/20/vivienne-westwood-we-will-all-be-migrants-soon-climate-change|title=Vivienne Westwood: ‘We’ll all be migrants soon’|date=20 September 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Easter Sunday]] 2008, she campaigned in person at the biggest [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] demonstration in ten years, at the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]], [[Aldermaston]], [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/vogue_daily/story/story.asp?stid=51620&amp;date=&amp;sid=|title=Vivienne Westwood rallies at CND's Easter Monday demonstration in Berkshire|publisher=Vogue.co.uk|date=25 March 2008|accessdate=30 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, Westwood joined forces with the British [[civil rights]] group [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] and launched exclusive limited design T-shirts and baby wear bearing the slogan ''I AM NOT A TERRORIST, please don't arrest me''. She said she was supporting the campaign and defending [[habeas corpus]]. "When I was a schoolgirl, my history teacher, Mr. Scott, began to take classes in civic affairs. The first thing he explained to us was the fundamental rule of law embodied in ''habeas corpus''. He spoke with pride of civilisation and democracy. The hatred of arbitrary arrest by the ''[[lettres de cachet]]'' of the French monarchy caused the storming of the Bastille. We can only take democracy for granted if we insist on our liberty", she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4287446.stm|first=Anna|last=Browning|title=The power of T-shirt slogans|publisher=BBC News|date=28 September 2005|accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of the [[pound sterling|£]]50 T-shirts raised funds for the organisation.

In June 2013, Westwood dedicated one of her collections to [[Chelsea Manning]] and at her fashion show she and all of her models wore large image badges of Manning with the word "TRUTH" under her picture. In 2014, she cut off her hair to highlight the dangers of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Olivia Bergin, [http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/news-features/TMG10681391/Vivienne-Westwood-cut-off-her-hair-to-promote-climate-change.html Vivienne Westwood Cut Off Her Hair To Promote Climate Change], Telgraph.co.uk, 6 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in a [[PETA]] ad campaign to promote [[World Water Day]] and [[vegetarianism]], drawing attention to the meat industry's water consumption.&lt;ref name=peta&gt;{{cite web|first=Bibby |last=Sowray|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG10704917/Vivienne-Westwood-takes-a-shower-to-promote-World-Water-Day.html| title=Vivienne Westwood Takes a Shower To Promote World Water Day|website=[[Telegraph.co.uk]]|publicationdate=18 March 2014|accessdate=7 September 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318223906/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG10704917/Vivienne-Westwood-takes-a-shower-to-promote-World-Water-Day.html|archivedate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Westwood became ambassador for clean energy [[Trillion Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climateactionprogramme.org/news/vivienne_westwood_becomes_ambassador_for_clean_energy_trillion_fund|title=Vivienne Westwood becomes ambassador for clean energy Trillion Fund|publisher=Climate Action Programme|date=17 February 2016|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Westwood endorsed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK general election]]. She said, "I'm excited about the Labour Party manifesto because it's all about the fair distribution of wealth."

===Support of Green Party and exclusion from UK election campaign tour===

In January 2015, Westwood announced her support of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]]: "I am investing in the Green Party because I believe it is in the best interests of our country and our economy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivienne Westwood: Vote Green 2015!|url=http://greenparty.org.uk/news/2015/01/23/vivienne-westwood-vote-green-2015!|website=News|publisher=Green Party of England and Wales|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that she had donated £300,000 to fund the party's election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cowburn|first1=Ashley|title=Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood to donate £300,000 to the Green party|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/01/fashion-designer-vivienne-westwood-donate-300000-green-party|accessdate=23 February 2015|work=New Statesman|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Westwood was announced as the special guest on the Greens' ''We Are The Revolution'' campaigning tour of English universities in such cities as Liverpool, Norwich, Brighton and Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherriff|first1=Lucy|title=Vivienne Westwood To Tour Universities To Promote Green Party To Students|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/02/20/vivienne-westwood-tour-universities-promote-green-party-students_n_6719348.html|accessdate=23 February 2015|work=Huffington Post UK|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the tour, Westwood was excluded from appearing by the youth wing of the Green Party on the basis that her corporate avoidance of UK tax contravenes party policy on usage of off-shore havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/green-party/11487630/Vivienne-Westwood-defrocked-by-Greens-over-tax-avoidance.html|title=Vivienne Westwood defrocked by Greens over 'tax avoidance'|publisher=Telegraph|date=21 March 2015|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later condemned this as "a wasted opportunity" for the Greens. "I wasn't pure enough for them", she wrote in her online diary.&lt;ref name="climaterevolution.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climaterevolution.co.uk/wp/2015/06/09/viviennes-diary-april-2015|title=Climate Revolution|publisher=Climate Revolution|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Westwood switched her support to campaigning on behalf of Nigel Askew, the [[Reality Party]] candidate opposing [[UKIP]] leader [[Nigel Farage]] in the Kent constituency of Thanet South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climaterevolution.co.uk/wp/hero-post/viviennes-diary-may-2015|accessdate=25 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626115402/http://climaterevolution.co.uk/wp/hero-post/viviennes-diary-may-2015|archivedate=26 June 2015|title=Vivienne's Diary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Askew polled 126 votes in the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000948|title=Thanet South parliamentary constituency - Election 2015|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active Resistance manifesto===

In a 2007 interview Westwood spoke out against what she perceive as the "drug of [[consumerism]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/12/shopping.fashion1|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|title=All hail the Queen|first=Emma|last=Brockes|date=11 May 2007|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009 she attended the première of ''[[The Age of Stupid]]'', a film aimed at motivating the public to act against [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2009/mar/16/the-age-of-stupid-climate-change?picture=344648772|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|title=Age of Stupid premiere: the green carpet treatment|date=16 March 2009|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She later created a manifesto called ''Active Resistance to Propaganda'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activeresistance.co.uk|title=Climate Revolution : Vivienne's Diary|website=Activeresistance.co.uk|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she says deals with the pursuit of art in relation to the human predicament and climate change.&lt;ref name="observer-dec-07"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/02/fashion.women|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|title=I don't feel comfortable defending my clothes.

We have the choice to become more cultivated and therefore more human – or by muddling along as usual we shall remain the destructive and self-destroying animal, the victim of our own cleverness."&lt;ref&gt;Vivienne Westwood, [http://activeresistance.co.uk/getalife/manifesto.html Manifesto], activeresistance.co.uk; accessed 20 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the claim that [[anti-consumerism]] and fashion contradict each other, she said in 2007: "I don't feel comfortable defending my clothes. But if you've got the money to afford them, then buy something from me. Just don't buy too much."&lt;ref name="observer-dec-07"/&gt; She faces criticism from eco-activists who claim that despite her calls to save the environment she herself makes no concessions to making her clothing or her business eco-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eluxemagazine.com/magazine/vivienne-westwoods-climate-revolution-charter-criticized|title=Vivienne Westwood's Climate Revolution Charter: A Critique|publisher=Eluxe Magazine|date=28 March 2013|accessdate=2 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403150015/http://eluxemagazine.com/magazine/vivienne-westwoods-climate-revolution-charter-criticized/|archivedate=3 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions over sustainability of Westwood clothing==

In 2013, sustainable luxury fashion publication Eluxe Magazine accused Westwood of using the green movement as a marketing tool on the basis that certain Westwood fashion and accessories lines are made in China. These were found to include PVC, polyester, rayon and viscose, all derived from harmful chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Lyons|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/People/article1531160.ece|title=Westwood’s anti-fracking frock turns toxic |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=15 March 2015|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eluxe also pointed out that, in spite of Westwood's statements that consumers should 'buy less', her company produces nine collections a year (compared to the average designer's two) Vivienne Westwood was also accused of using unpaid interns in her fashions house and making them work over 40 hours per week, some interns have complained about how they had been treated by the fashion house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eluxemagazine.com/magazine/vivienne-westwood-is-not-eco-friendly|title=Why Vivienne Westwood is Not Eco Friendly |publisher=Eluxe Magazine|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, as part of her Spring/Summer 15 collection, Westwood collaborated with the [[nonprofit organization]] Farms Not Factories. Unveiled at [[Milan Fashion Week]], the T-shirts and tote bags were produced using ethically sourced organic cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christian Madsen|first=Anders|title=vivienne westwood spring/summer 15 menswear|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/gyggwj/vivienne-westwood-springsummer-15-menswear|website=I-d|language=en-us|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westwood is also a noted author of books, such as ''Fashion in art'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openbibart.fr/item/display/10068/925032|title=Fashion in art : the Second Empire and impressionism - OpenBibArt|website=www.openbibart.fr|access-date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she explores the worlds of fashion and arts, the untimely interlinking of both worlds.

==Recognition==

In 1992, Westwood was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], which she collected from [[Queen Elizabeth II]] at [[Buckingham Palace]]. At the ceremony, Westwood was [[panties|knicker]]-less, which was later captured by a photographer in the courtyard of Buckingham Palace. Westwood later said, "I wished to show off my outfit by twirling the skirt. It did not occur to me that, as the photographers were practically on their knees, the result would be more glamorous than I expected,"&lt;ref name="You ask"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/vivienne-westwood-you-ask-the-questions-692758.html|title=Vivienne Westwood: You ask the questions|work=The Independent|date=21 February 2001|accessdate=31 March 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and added: "I have heard that the picture amused the Queen."&lt;ref name="You ask"/&gt; Westwood advanced from [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] to [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] in the 2006 New Year's Honours List "for services to fashion", and has twice earned the award for [[British Designer of the Year]].

In 2012, Westwood was among the [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural icons]] selected by artist Sir [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New faces on Sgt Pepper album cover for artist Peter Blake's 80th birthday|url= https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/02/peter-blake-sgt-pepper-cover-revisited|agency=The Guardian|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Peter Blake's new Beatles' Sgt Pepper's album cover|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17583026|agency=BBC|date=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2012, Westwood was chosen as one of ''[[The New Elizabethans]]'' to mark the [[diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II]]. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named Westwood among a group of 60 people in the UK "whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands and given the age its character".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jxs2c/features/about|publisher=BBC|title=The New Elizabethans - Vivienne Westwood|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, the authorised biography ''Vivienne Westwood'' by [[Ian Kelly (actor)|Ian Kelly]] was published by [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]]. [[Paul Gorman]] described it as "sloppy" and "riddled with inaccuracies" on the basis of multiple errors in the book including misspelling the names of popular rock stars [[Jimi Hendrix|“Jimmy” Hendrix]] and [[Pete Townshend|Pete “Townsend”]] and misidentifying the date of the Sex Pistols’ first concert and McLaren’s age when he died in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Adam Sherwin |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/vivienne-westwood-accused-of-plagiarism-over-book-on-her-life-9799821.html|title=Vivienne Westwood accused of plagiarism over book on her life|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=16 October 2014|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picador publisher Paul Baggaley told [[The Bookseller]]: “We always take very seriously any errors that are brought to our attention and, where appropriate, correct them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Coben, Harlan|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/gorman-claims-westwood-biography-plagiarism|title=Gorman claims Westwood biography plagiarism|publisher=The Bookseller|date=17 October 2014|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Pan MacMillan, which published an Australian edition of the biography, confirmed that the matter was being handled by the publisher's lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Steger|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/legal-action-looms-over-vivienne-westwood-biography-20141108-11iuzd.html|title=Legal action looms over Vivienne Westwood biography|website=Smh.com.au|date=9 November 2014|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Westwood was featured in a Canadian-made television documentary called ''Vivienne Westwood's London'' in which she takes the viewer through her favourite parts of London, including the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], the [[Wallace Collection]], [[Whitechapel]] (accompanied by [[Sarah Stockbridge]]), [[Hampton Court]], the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Brixton Market]] and [[Electric Avenue]], and the [[National Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;Heather Toskan, QMI Agency, [http://www.canoe.ca/Travel/Activities/CelebrityTravel/2011/01/14/16887796.html Vivienne Westwood's London]; accessed 6 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 a documentary film about her, called ''Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist'', premiered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weaver |first=Hilary |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/vivienne-westwood-documentary |title=The Vivienne Westwood Documentary Vivienne Westwood Doesn’t Want You to See |publisher=Vanity Fair |date=2018-03-08 |accessdate=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Westwood is married to her former fashion student, Austrian Andreas Kronthaler. For 30 years she lived in an ex-[[council flat]] in Nightingale Lane, [[Clapham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharkey|first1=Alix|title=Westwood ho!|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/apr/08/life1.lifemagazine|accessdate=18 August 2014|work=The Observer|date=8 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; until, in 2000, Kronthaler convinced her to move into a [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] house built in 1703, which once belonged to the mother of [[Captain Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cathy Horyn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/t-magazine/womens-fashion/18westwood.html|title=The Queen V|work=The New York Times|date=31 December 2009|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is a keen [[gardener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Piers Beeching|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/5983691/Me-and-my-garden-Vivienne-Westwood.html|title=Me &amp; my garden: Vivienne Westwood|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=6 August 2009|accessdate=30 March 2010|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Westwood is [[vegetarian]] as well.&lt;ref name=peta/&gt;

The '''Walloon Rally''' ({{lang-fr|Rassemblement wallon}}; '''RW''') is a [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]]&lt;ref name="StarkeKaasch2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Starke|author2=Alexandra Kaasch|author3=Franca Van Hooren|title=The Welfare State as Crisis Manager: Explaining the Diversity of Policy Responses to Economic Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtMQsESYcWwC&amp;pg=PA192|date=7 May 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-31484-0|pages=192–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political parties in Belgium|political party in Belgium]], active in [[Wallonia]] since 1968. The party favoured [[federalism]] and since 1985 independence.

Founded on 7 March 1968, the party contested the [[Belgian general election, 1968|Belgian general election]] of 1968 in a cartel with the [[Democratic Front of Francophones|FDF]], a [[Brussels]]-based [[francophone]] political party, receiving 5.9% of the vote nationally. The party's own results in elections to the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]] were as follows.
{|  border="1"
| Election || [[Belgian general election, 1968|1968]] || [[Belgian general election, 1971|1971]] || 1974 || 1977 || 1978 || 1981
|-
| Percentage of&lt;br /&gt;national vote || 3.35 || 6.69 || 5.86 || 2.96 || 2.86 || 1.71
|-
| Seats || 5 || 14 || 13 || 5 || 4 || 2
|}

The increasing federalisation of Belgium, and the adoption of some of the party's policies by the traditional francophone parties, resulted in a sharp decline in electoral support from 1977 onwards. A split in the early 1980s created the [[Walloon Popular Rally]], a more left-wing grouping, which later merged with the [[Socialist Party (francophone Belgium)|Socialist Party]]. The [[Wallonia-France Rally]], which supports the union of Wallonia and [[France]], was formed by the rump of the party's membership in 1999. Afterwards, the Walloon Rally left the WFR and formed Union For Wallonia with the France Party, Wallonia Social Democracy, Get Up Wallonia and the Brussels' Walloons.

In 2010, Union For Wallonia, which took part in June federal elections under the name '''W+''', was renamed '''Walloon Rally''', which was its largest component.
