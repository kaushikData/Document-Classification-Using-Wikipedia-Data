The '''Algerian Six''' were six Bosnian men (five of whom had dual nationality), all born in Algeria, who were imprisoned without charges at [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in Guantanamo Bay, [[Cuba]] from January 2002. They later filed for ''habeas'' corpus in United States federal court and their case reached the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 2008. It ruled in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' that detainees and foreign nationals had rights to file for ''habeas corpus'' in federal courts. Following his review of their cases, a US District Court judge ordered five of the Bosnians to be released based on insufficient evidence.

In 2009, the US released the men. Three were flown to Bosnia to reunite with their families under 'protective custody.' The US refused to let Boudmediene return to Bosnia and he feared returning to Algeria because of potential retaliation; France offered to let him settle there. He was joined in [[Provence]] by his wife and children.

District Judge Leon recommended the continued detention of Belkacem, but his attorneys appealed his case. In 2010, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals overturned Leon's decision. They determined that Belkacem was not a member of [[al Qaeda]] and should be released.

After the men initially fell under U.S. suspicion, the government of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] arrested them in 2001 and tried them, but later released them for lack of evidence. They were illegally turned over to US intelligence officials in January 2002 in [[Sarajevo]] and transported to Guantanamo. They were detained there without charges by the US for the years following. The Bosnian authorities were formally condemned for their actions by the [[Human Rights Chamber of Bosnia Herzegovina]], the relevant Bosnian court at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrc.ba/database/decisions/CH02-8679%20BOUDELLAA%20et%20al.%20Admissibility%20and%20Merits%20E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2004, the six men had been sent before [[Combatant Status Review Tribunals]] (CSRTs) of three United States military officers. The CSRTs concluded that each of the six men was properly classified as an "[[enemy combatant]]" based on classified evidence. The CSRTs were criticized for applying a definition of "enemy combatant" that was so broad that it could include a "little old lady in Switzerland," who donated money to a charity in Afghanistan that, without her knowledge, funded al Qaeda.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian20070422&gt;

[[Wolfgang Petritsch]], a [[United Nations|UN]] diplomat and former [[High Representative]] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, said the US had threatened the UN to withdraw their men from the mission in 2002 if he protested against the transfer of the six men out of Bosnia at that time.&lt;ref name=R89&gt;{{cite web |first= Marc |last=Perelman |url=http://www.rue89.com/2007/11/27/sarajevo-guantanamo-temoins-a-charge-contre-washington |title=Sarajevo-Guantanamo: témoins à charge contre Washington |publisher= ''[[Rue 89]]'' |date= 27 November 2007 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States chargé d'affaires reportedly told the prime minister of Bosnia that the U.S. would withdraw its personnel and cut diplomatic relations if Bosnia did not arrest and investigate the Algerian Six.&lt;ref name="MarcPerelman"/&gt; The Algerian Six were arrested by Bosnian authorities within the week, were investigated fully, and tried for the alleged plot to bomb the U.S. and British embassies in Sarajevo.&lt;ref name="MarcPerelman"/&gt; The Supreme Court of Bosnia released all six men for lack of evidence against them.&lt;ref name="MarcPerelman"/&gt;

The Human Rights Chamber of the Bosnian Judiciary explicitly ruled that the government must take all steps to prevent forcible deportation of the men.&lt;ref name="MarcPerelman"/&gt; But, upon being released from jail, they were handed over to U.S. military police and transported overseas to its [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] in Cuba.&lt;ref name="CraigWhitlock"/&gt; [[Wolfgang Petritsch]], the international community's top official in Bosnia at the time, recalls being told by Bosnian leaders that the U.S. applied a lot of pressure on Bosnia to be allowed to take the Algerian Six to Guantanamo.&lt;ref name="MarcPerelman"/&gt; Petritsch said that the US officials had told him they would remove their support for an international mission he was leading if Bosnia did not comply with their request.&lt;ref name="MarcPerelman"/&gt; According to documents filed by the detainee's American lawyers in their U.S. federal court habeas action, Christopher Hoh, the then U.S. charge d'affaires, had told then Bosnian Prime Minister [[Alija Behmen]] that the U.S. would cut all diplomatic relations if the men were not arrested.&lt;ref name="McCl" /&gt; [[Amnesty International]] recalled in 2002 that the Bosnian Supreme Court explicitly opposed this transfer of the men to US authorities.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630032002?open&amp;of=ENG-2M4 "Bosnia-Herzegovina: Letter to the US Ambassador regarding six Algerian men"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041201062056/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR630032002?open&amp;of=ENG-2M4 |date=2004-12-01 }}, [[Amnesty International]], Public statement: 18 January 2002, AI Index EUR 63/003/2002 - News Service Nr. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Tipton Three]]", three British citizens detained in Guantanamo who were released in March 2004, wrote a 131-page account of their experiences.&lt;ref name=Tipton3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/september_11th/docs/Guantanamo_composite_statement_FINAL.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement of Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Rhuhel Ahmed |publisher=Center for Constitutional Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050525100119/http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/legal/september_11th/docs/Guantanamo_composite_statement_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=2005-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote about the Bosnians:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By Bosnians we mean six Algerians who were unlawfully taken from Bosnia to Guantanamo Bay. They told us how they had won their Court case in Bosnia. As they walked out of Court, Americans were there and grabbed them and took them to [[Camp X-Ray]], January 20, 2002. They arrived five days after us. They were treated particularly badly. They were moved every two hours. They were kept naked in their cells. They were taken to interrogation for hours on end. They were short shackled for sometimes days on end. They were deprived of their sleep. They never got letters, nor books, nor reading materials. The Bosnians had the same interrogators for a while as we did and so we knew the names which were the same as ours and they were given a very hard time by those. They told us that the interrogators said if they didn't cooperate that they could ensure that something would happen to their families in Algeria and in Bosnia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the capture of the six men by the United States, the Bosnian government argued for their release from Guantanamo Bay. CSRT hearings were held in 2004. But, [[Associated Press library of Guantanamo Bay detainee dossiers]] show transcripts of four of the six men telling their tribunal officers that interrogators did not believe that there had ever been any substance to the U.S. allegations that they had planned to bomb the U.S. embassy. [[Clive Stafford Smith]], legal director of the organization [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], which represents numerous detainees, wrote in ''The Guardian'', that the CSRTs applied such a broad definition of "enemy combatant" that it could include a "little old lady in Switzerland," who donated money to a charity in Afghanistan that then, without her knowledge, funded al Qaeda.&lt;ref name="TheGuardian20070422"/&gt; (See Transcript of Motion to Dismiss before United States District Court Judge [[Joyce Hens Green]] at pp.&amp;nbsp;25–26 (December 1, 2004) ''Rasul v.

== USA drops allegation of bomb plot ==
In 2006, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' published a profile of the six Bosnians.&lt;ref name=Wapo060821&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/20/AR2006082000660_pf.html|title=At Guantanamo, Caught in a Legal Trap|publisher=|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The profile reported that during their [[Administrative Review Board]] hearings, the US officials dropped the earlier allegation that they had been plotting to bomb the US embassy in Sarajevo. The article reports the speculation that the men continued to be held because the Bush administration was unwilling to admit it had held them for four years without substantial evidence.

According to the ''Washington Post,'' Guantanamo intelligence analysts said they continued to detain the men because of intelligence including the following:&lt;ref name=Wapo060821/&gt; 
* Mustafa Idr had taught karate to Bosnian orphans.
* Another detainee, while still living in Algeria and performing compulsory military service, had served as an army cook.
* "Boudella was accused ... of joining bin Laden and Taliban fighters at Tora Bora, Afghanistan,... in December 2001." ''The Washington Post'' noted that, at the time, Boudella was already locked up thousands of miles away in Sarajevo, after having been arrested in the later-discredited embassy plot.
* Boudella wore a ring "similar to those that identified the Red Rose Group members of [[Hamas]]." Boudella's wife obtained an affidavit from the jeweler where the ring was purchased, explaining that this style of ring is extremely popular in Bosnia.

The ''Washington Post'' reports Bush administration negotiators trying to secure face-saving deals with Bosnia and Algeria. According to the article:&lt;ref name=Wapo060821/&gt;
* "U.S. officials have pressed Algeria to take back the prisoners on the condition that they be confined or kept under surveillance there. So far, the Algerian government has balked."
* "Senior Bosnian officials said they have been told by U.S. diplomats that the six Algerians will never be allowed to return to Bosnia, which had granted dual citizenship to most of the men before their seizure."
* The Bosnian Prime Minister [[Adnan Terzić]] requested the US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] to arrange the return of the men in a letter dated February 2, 2005.
* On March 17, 2005 Rice responded the men could not be freed because "they still possess important intelligence data." Rice said they still represented a threat to the USA.
* "Three months later, the State Department offered a somewhat different explanation.., [[Matthew A. Reynolds]], acting assistant secretary for legislative affairs, explained that the Algerians could not be released in part because the Bosnian government 'has not indicated that it is prepared or willing to accept responsibility for them upon transfer'."
* "Justice Minister [[Slobodan Kovač]] said there would be no legal basis to place the men under arrest or surveillance if they were returned to Bosnia because they have already been exonerated there. 'There is no case against them here in Bosnia, no criminal case,' he said."

The article notes that, although the Bush administration had declined to discuss any evidence they may have against the men, [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[J. D. Gordon]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was no mistake in originally detaining these individuals as enemy combatants. Their detention was directly related to their combat activities as determined by an appropriate Defense Department official before they were ever transferred to Guantanamo."&lt;ref name=Wapo060821/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== ''Boumediene v. Bush'' (2008) ==
In October 2008, the US Supreme Court in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' (2008) (under which ''[[Al Odah v. United States]]'' was consolidated), ruled that the detainees and other foreign nationals had the right to file habeas corpus suits in federal courts and were covered by habeas protections of the US constitution.

Following that decision, Judge [[Richard J. Leon]] of the Federal District Court in Washington DC ruled that the government had not provided sufficient evidence for detention and that all of the men except Bensayah Belkacem should be released.&lt;ref name="WilliamGlaberson"&gt;

'''Amir al-Mu'minin''' ({{lang-ar|أمير المؤمنين}}) is an [[Arabic]] title that is usually translated "'''Commander of the Faithful'''" or "'''Leader of the Faithful'''". Shias hold that the title is exclusive to [[Ali]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Imam Ali – Commander of The Faithful |url=https://www.al-islam.org/brief-commentary-hadeeth-al-kisaa-jerrmein-abu-shahba/imam-ali-commander-faithful |website=Al-Islam.org |publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Sunnis maintain the [[caliph]] at any point in time is the bearer of the title. 

The use of the title does not necessarily signify a claim to caliphate as it is usually taken to be, but described a certain form of activist leadership which may have been attached to a caliph but also could signify a level of authority beneath that. The Ottoman sultans, in particular, made scant use of it. Moreover, the term was used by men who made no claim to be caliphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pennell|first1=Richard|title=What is the significance of the title ‘Amīr al-mu'minīn?'|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|date=11 March 2016|volume=21|issue=4|pages=623–644|doi=10.1080/13629387.2016.1157482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Term==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
Amir al-Mu'minin is [[latin]]ized as {{lang|la|Miramolinus}}, hence [[Italian language|Italian]] {{lang|it|Miramolino}}, [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|Miramolin}}, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|Miramolín}} and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|Miramolim}}, in [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀμερμουμνῆς}} ''amermoumnês''.

It is also translated as "Prince of the believers" since [[Emir|"Amir" or "Emir"]] is also used as a princely title in states ruled by the royalty or monarchies.

==Shia view==
Shias view that [[Ali]], the son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and the progenitor of his only continuing lineage, was given the title during Muhammad's era.
&lt;ref&gt;Majlesi, Bahar al-Anwar, Vol. 37, P. 339, hadith 81 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shia Encyclopedia, Vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Shias believe the title is exclusive to [[Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Tasfir Al Ayashi]]|volume=1|quote=this is a title only suitable for Imam Ali|author=Muhammad Ibn Masoud Ayyashi|authorlink=Muhammad Ibn Masoud Ayyashi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|276}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shaikh al-Hur al-Aamili|authorlink1=Shaikh al-Hur al-Aamili|title=[[Wasā'il al-Shīʿa]]|volume=14|quote=this is a title only suitable for Imam Ali|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|600}} Being called the commander of the faithful does not entail only political authority, but spiritual and religious authority as well.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Sunni view==
Sunnis generally consider [[Umar]] the first person given the title, although according to several famous Sunni scholars such as Ibn al-Jawzi, Al-Dhahabi, Ibn 'Asakir, etc. the Prophet (Muhammad) called just Ali as Amir al-Muminin.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn al-Jawzi, Al-Mozooat, Vol. 1, PP. 376-377&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn 'Asakir , The history of Medina Damascus, Vol. 42, P.  386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Dhahabi, Mizan al-E’tedaal,Vol.1 P. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

But about the first view, according to the Islamic scholar [[as-Suyuti]] (1445–1505):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]] asked [[Abu Bakr|Abu Bakr ibn Sulayman ibn Abi Hathamah]] what was the reason that it used to be written, ''"From the Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,"'' in the time of [[Abu Bakr]], then later Umar used to write at first, ''"From the Khalifah of Abu Bakr."''? Then who was the first to write, ''"From the Amir al-Muminin (the Commander of the Believers)"''?

He said, ''"[[Ash-Shifa]], who was one of the women of the [[Muhajirun]], told me that Abu Bakr used to write, ''"From the Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah"'', and Umar used to write, ''"From the Khalifah of the Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah,"'' until one day Umar wrote to the governor of [[Iraq]], to send him two strong men whom he could ask about Iraq and its inhabitants. He sent to him [[Labid ibn Rabi'ah]] and [[Adi ibn Hatim]], and they came to [[Madinah]] and entered the mosque where they found [[Amr ibn al-'As]].

They said, ''"Get permission for us (to visit) the Amir al-Muminin."'' Amr said, ''"You two, [[by Allah]], have hit upon his name!"'' Then Amr went in to him and said, ''"Peace be upon you, Amir al-Mu'minin."'' He said, ''"What occurred to you about this name? You must explain what you have said."'' He told him and said, ''"You are the [[amir]] (commander) and we are the [[muminun]] (the believers)."'' Thus letters have continued to be written with that from that day.

[[An-Nawawi]] said in his Tahdhib: Adi ibn Hatim and [[Labid ibn Rabi'ah]] named him thus when they came as a deputation from 'Iraq. It has been said that [[al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah]] named him with this name. It has also been said that 'Umar said to people, 'You are the believers and I am your amir,' and so he was called Amir al-Muminin, and before that he was known as the Khalifah of the Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah, but they changed from that expression because of its length.

[[Mu'awiyah|Mu'awiyyah ibn Qurrah]] said: It used to be written 'From Abu Bakr the Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah,' and then when it was 'Umar ibn al-Khattab they wanted to say, 'The Khalifah of the Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah.' 'Umar said, 'This is lengthy.' They said, 'No. But we have appointed you as amir over us, so you are our amir.' He said, 'Yes, and you are the believers, and I am your amir.' Then it became written Amir al-Muminin.&lt;ref name=Suyuti&gt;[[History of the Caliphs]] by [[Suyuti]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Muslim usage==
The [[Kitáb-i-Íqán]], the primary theological work of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], applies the title Commander of the Faithful to [[Ali]], the son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KI/ki-4.html] "The Kitáb-i-Íqán PART ONE". BAHA'I REFERENCE LIBRARY. Retrieved 2014-09-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar (but not the same) title was afforded to the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s monarch as the Grand Duke of Lithuania by the [[Lipka Tatars]], who used to speak a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language. The title of sire was used "Vatad", as in "homeland" ("Vatan"), which meant "defender of the rights of Muslims in non-Islamic countries". The Grand Duchy was viewed as a new [[homeland]]. Vatad was viewed as variation on the name [[Vytautas]] in Lithuanian or Władysław in Polish, which was known in the diplomatic notes between the [[Golden Horde]] and the countries of Poland (Lechistan) and Lithuania (Lipka) as "Dawood". One can claim that, since [[Casimir the Great]], the Polish-Lithuanian monarch as the King of Poland was tasked with the protection of the rights of the Jews and other non-Christians.

==In Fiction==

In [[Margaret Atwood]]'s 1985 dystopian novel, [[The Handmaid's Tale]], leaders of the fictional [[Republic of Gilead]], a militaristic [[theonomy]], are referred to as "Commanders of the Faithful."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14113">[[File:Agamemnon at Mudros.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[HMS Agamemnon (1906)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] on an earlier visit to Mudros during the Dardanelles campaign in 1915]]
The '''Armistice of Mudros''' ({{lang-tr|Mondros Mütarekesi}}), concluded on 30 October 1918, ended the hostilities, at noon the next day, in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]] between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies]] of [[World War I]]. It was signed by the Ottoman Minister of Marine Affairs [[Rauf Orbay|Rauf Bey]] and the British [[Admiral]] [[Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe]], on board [[HMS Agamemnon (1906)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] in [[Moudros]] harbor on the [[Greece|Greek]] island of [[Lemnos]].&lt;ref&gt;Karsh, Efraim, ''Empires of the Sand: The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East'', (Harvard University Press, 2001), 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of several conditions to the armistice, the Ottomans surrendered their remaining [[garrisons]] outside [[Anatolia]], as well as granted the Allies the right to occupy forts controlling the Straits of the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosporus]]; and the right to occupy the same "in case of disorder" any Ottoman territory in the event of a threat to their security. The Ottoman army including the Ottoman air force was demobilized, and all ports, railways, and other strategic points were made available for use by the Allies. In the [[Caucasus]], the Ottomans had to retreat to within the pre-war borders between the Ottoman and the Russian Empires.

The armistice was followed by the [[occupation of Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and the subsequent [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (10 August 1920), which was signed in the aftermath of World War I, was never ratified by the [[Ottoman Parliament]] in Istanbul (the Ottoman Parliament was disbanded by the Allies on 11 April 1920 due to the overwhelming opposition of the Turkish MPs to the provisions discussed in Sèvres). It was later superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (24 July 1923) following the Turkish victory at the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–1923) which was conducted by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] in [[Ankara]] (established on 23 April 1920 by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] and his followers, including his colleagues in the disbanded Ottoman military, and numerous former MPs of the closed Ottoman Parliament in Istanbul.)

==Background==
{{see also|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Caucasus Campaign|Macedonian Front}}

World War I took a chaotic turn in 1918 for the Ottoman Empire. With [[Nikolai Yudenich|Yudenich]]'s [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] deserting after the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Ottomans regained ground in [[Armenia]] and even pushed into formerly Russian-controlled Caucasus with, at first, [[Vehip Pasha]]'s [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman 3rd Army]] and, later beginning in June 1918, with [[Nuri Pasha]]'s [[Islamic Army of the Caucasus|Army of Islam]] which excluded German officers and men. The [[Caucasus Campaign]] put the Ottomans at odds with their ally, Germany, which had been hoping to purchase Caucasus oil from the Bolshevik government in Moscow.{{efn|The Bolsheviks had support only in Petrograd and Moscow in 1917 and 1918. After allowing both Trotsky and Lenin to return to Russia by train from Switzerland and lead the October Revolution, Germany considered the Bolshevik government a puppet state under its power. After the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, most Russians disliked the terms of the Bolshevik signed treaty and believed that the Bolsheviks were a puppet under German interests, too.}} The Ottomans wanted to establish its eastern borders{{efn|Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], the [[Trabzon peace conference]] convened but failed to define the borders between the Ottoman Empire and the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. This led to the recognition that a state of war exists between Tiflis and Constantinople in April 1918.}} The Ottoman armies advanced far into Caucasus, gathering supporters as far away as [[Tashkent]], on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea. Additionally, with the Bolsheviks in power in Moscow, chaos spread in Persia, as the Russo-British favoring government of [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]] lost authority outside of the capital. In contrast, in Syria, the Ottomans were steadily pushed back by British forces, culminating in the [[Capture of Damascus (1918)|fall of Damascus]] in October 1918. Hopes were initially high for the Ottomans that their losses in Syria might be compensated with successes in the Caucasus. [[Enver Pasha]], one of the most influential members of the Ottoman government, maintained an optimistic stance, hid information that made the Ottoman position appear weak, and led most of the Ottoman elite to believe that the war was still winnable.&lt;ref name="fromkin"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fromkin |first=David |authorlink=David Fromkin |title =A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East |publisher=Macmillan |year=2009 |location= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OV0i1mJdNSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8050-8809-0 |pages=360&amp;ndash;373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in Southeast Europe quashed the Ottoman government's hopes. The [[Macedonian Front]], also known as the Salonika campaign, had been largely stable since 1916. In September 1918, the [[Allied Army of the Orient|Allied forces]] (under the command of [[Louis Franchet d'Espèrey]]) mounted a [[Vardar Offensive|sudden offensive]] which proved quite successful. The Bulgarian army was defeated, and Bulgaria was forced to sue for peace in the [[Armistice of Salonica]]. That undermined both the German and Ottoman cause simultaneously, as the Germans had no troops to spare to defend Austria-Hungary from the newly formed vulnerability in Southeastern Europe after the [[Western Front (World War I)#1918.E2.80.94Final offensives|losses it had suffered in France]], and the Ottomans suddenly faced having to defend [[Constantinople]] against an overland European siege without help from the Bulgarians.&lt;ref name="fromkin" /&gt;

Grand Vizier [[Talaat Pasha]] visited [[Berlin]], Germany, and [[Sofia]], Bulgaria in September 1918. He came away with the understanding that the war was no longer winnable. With Germany likely seeking a separate peace, the Ottomans would be forced to do so as well. Talaat convinced the other members of the ruling party that they must resign, as the Allies would impose far harsher terms if they thought the people who started the war were still in power. He also sought out the United States to see if he could surrender to them and gain the benefits of the [[Fourteen Points]] despite the Ottoman Empire and the United States not being at war; however, the Americans never responded, as they were waiting on British advice as to how to respond that never came. On October 13, Talaat and the rest of his ministry resigned.  [[Ahmed Izzet Pasha]] replaced Talaat as Grand Vizier. Two days after taking office, he sent the captured British General [[Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend]] to the Allies to seek terms on an armistice.&lt;ref name="fromkin" /&gt;

==Negotiations==
The British cabinet received word of the offer and were eager to negotiate a deal. The standing terms of the alliance was that the first member that was approached for an armistice should conduct the negotiations; the British government interpreted that to mean that Britain conduct the negotiations alone.  The motives for this are not entirely clear, whether it was the sincere British interpretation of the alliance terms, fears that the French would insist on over-harsh demands and foil a treaty, or a desire to cut the French out of territorial "spoils" promised to them in the [[Sykes-Picot agreement]].  Townshend also indicated that the Ottomans preferred to deal with the British; he did not know about the American contact or that Talaat had sent an emissary to the French as well but that emissary had been slower to respond back. The British cabinet empowered [[Somerset Gough-Calthorpe|Admiral Calthorpe]] to conduct the negotiations with an explicit exclusion of the French from them. They also suggested an armistice rather than a full peace treaty, in the belief that a peace treaty would require the approval of all of the Allied nations and be too slow.&lt;ref name="fromkin" /&gt;

The negotiations began on Sunday, October 27 on [[HMS Agamemnon (1906)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']], a British battleship. The British refused to admit French Vice-Admiral [[Jean-Françoise-Charles Amet|Jean Amet]], the senior French naval officer in the area, despite his desire to join; the Ottoman delegation, headed by Minister of Marine Affairs [[Rauf Orbay|Rauf Bey]], indicated that it was acceptable as they were accredited only to the British, not the French.&lt;ref name="fromkin" /&gt;

Both sides did not know that the other was actually quite eager to sign a deal and willing to give up some of their objectives to do so. The British delegation had been given a list of 24 demands, but were told to concede on any of them if pressed, except occupation of the forts on the Dardanelles and free passage through the [[Bosphorus]]; the British desired access to the Black Sea for the [[Romania during World War I|Rumanian front]]. Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] also wanted to make a deal quickly before the United States could step in; according to the diary of [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]]:
{{quote|[Lloyd George] was also very contemptuous of President Wilson and anxious to arrange the division of Turkey between France, Italy, and G.B. before speaking to America. He also thought it would attract less attention to our enormous gains during the war if we swallowed our share of Turkey now, and the German colonies later.&lt;ref name="fromkin" /&gt;}}
The Ottoman authorities, for their part, believed the war to be lost and would have accepted almost any demands placed on them. As a result, the initial draft prepared by the British was accepted largely unchanged; the Ottoman side did not know it could have pushed back on most of the clauses, and the British did not know they could have demanded even more.  Still, the terms were largely pro-British and close to an outright surrender; the Ottoman Empire ceded the rights to the Allies to occupy "in case of disorder" any Ottoman territory, a vague and broad clause.&lt;ref name="fromkin" /&gt;

The French were displeased with the precedent; French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] disliked the British making unilateral decisions in so important a matter. Lloyd George countered that the French had concluded a similar armistice on short notice in the Armistice of Salonica, which had been negotiated by French General d'Esperey and that Great Britain (and Tsarist Russia) had committed the vast majority of troops to the campaign against the Ottoman Empire. The French agreed to accept the matter as closed. The Ottoman educated public, however, was given misleadingly positive impressions of the severity of the terms of the Armistice. They thought its terms were considerably more lenient than they actually were, a source of discontent later when it seemed that the Allies had violated the offered terms during the [[Turkish War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="fromkin" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Armistice of Mudros officially brought hostilities to an end between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire. However, incursions by the Italians and Greeks into Anatolia in the name of "restoring order" soon came close to an outright partition of the country. The [[Treaty of Sèvres]] in 1920 officially partitioned the Ottoman Empire into zones of influence; however, the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–23) saw the rejection of the treaty by Turkish nationalist forces based in Ankara, who eventually took control of the Anatolian Peninsula. Ottoman territory in Syria, Palestine, and Arabia stayed as distributed by the Treaty of Sèvres while the borders of the Turkish nation-state were set by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923.

The '''Articles of War''' are a set of regulations drawn up to govern the conduct of a country's military and naval forces.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was first used in 1637 in [[Robert Monro]]'s ''His expedition with the worthy Scots regiment called Mac-keyes regiment etc.'' (in the form "Articles of warres") and can be used to refer to [[military law]] in general. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], the equivalent term ''Krigsartiklar'', is first mentioned in 1556.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=krigsartikel&amp;pz=2#U_K2633_94364 "Krigs-artikel." ''Svenska akademiens ordbok.''] Retrieved 2017-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is usually used more specifically and with the modern spelling and capitalisation to refer to the British regulations drawn up in the wake of the [[Glorious Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;William Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents, 19 (2d ed., Government Printing Office 1920), page 18&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States of America|U.S.]] regulations later based on them.

==United Kingdom==
Throughout the Articles' existence, there were separate sets for the navy and army.

===Royal Navy===
The UK's (or rather England's) first Articles of War were written for the [[Royal Navy]]. They formed the statutory provisions regulating and governing the behaviour of members of the Royal Navy.  They were prominently displayed in all naval ships, and set out a list of criminal provisions which applied to members of the Royal Navy and others to whom the Act applied, in addition to the criminal law of England and Wales and any local criminal law.

The naval Articles of War were originally issued by the [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty]] in 1653 as fighting instructions after defeat at the [[Battle of Dungeness]].  Soon after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], they were converted into an [[Act of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hmsrichmond.org/avast/customs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Articles of War, 1661, 1749 and 1866'' / (1982) {{ISBN|0-85937-275-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After another defeat at the [[Battle of Toulon (1744)|Battle of Toulon]], Parliament amended the Articles in 1749, further tightening discipline. These Articles resulted in the execution of Admiral [[John Byng]], despite a clear sentiment in the navy and in Parliament that he should be given some lesser punishment.  In response, the 1779 amendment was the start of a gradual process of easing the more draconian punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===British Army===
The first set of Articles of War for the [[British Army]] (English until 1707) were written (under [[William III of England|William III]] (r.1689–1702), taking the place of the medieval Rules and Ordinances of War, a list of regulations issued by the king at the beginning of every expedition or campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stephen-stratford.com/history_cm.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mutiny Acts]] empowered the king ''de jure'' and his government ''de facto'' to govern their army by creating a set of Articles of War for each conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq1BAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Articles+of+War%22+British+army&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7BfFohekBJ&amp;sig=G__Bj1hOUITbYKSYG-UvD-nM6QY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w5DVS9W-BqiI0wSjoozVDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false E Samuel, ''An historical account of the British army: and of the law military'', 1812, page 224]&lt;/ref&gt; To a large degree, they were superseded by [[King's Regulations]] in force at all times. The Articles of War fell out of use by the Army when they were omitted from the [[Army Act 1955]].

==United States ==
{{main|Uniform Code of Military Justice}}

On 30 June 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] established 69 Articles of War to govern the conduct of the [[Continental Army]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/contcong_06-30-75.asp) Articles of War, June 30, 1775]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Effective upon its ratification in 1789, Article I, Section 8 of the [[United States Constitution]] provided that [[United States Congress|Congress]] has the power to regulate the [[Military of the United States|land and naval forces]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 8]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 April 1806, the United States Congress enacted 101 Articles of War (which applied to both the Army and the Navy), which were not significantly revised until over a century later&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pscwrt.org/PDF/Articles%20of%20War.pdf An Act for establishing Rules and Articles for the	government of the Armies of the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;. Another code of conduct, the 1863 [[Lieber Code]], operated during the [[American Civil War]]. On 4 June 1920, Congress enacted 121 Articles of War that went into effect on 4 February 1921 with the exception of Articles 2, 23, and 45, which became effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/AW/index.html The Articles of War: Approved June 4, 1920: September 1920]&lt;/ref&gt; The military justice system then continued to operate under the Articles of War until 31 May 1951, when the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] came into effect.

The party president was Devi Dass Nahar and the general secretary was Vijay Kumar Hans (later leader of the [[Democratic Bharatiya Samaj Party]]).

In the 2002 legislative assembly elections in Punjab, BSP(A) put up 23 candidates, who together received 20,260 votes. The BSP(A) reunited with the BSP on 31 December 2003.

In 2004, after the elections of Lok Sabha, Sh.

A '''bill of attainder''' (also known as an '''act of attainder''' or '''writ of attainder''' or '''bill of pains and penalties''') is an act of a [[legislature]] declaring a person or group of persons guilty of some crime and punishing them, often without a trial. As with [[attainder]] resulting from the normal judicial process, the effect of such a bill is to nullify the targeted person's [[civil rights]], most notably the right to own property (and thus pass it on to heirs), the right to a title of nobility, and, in at least the original usage, the right to life itself. Bills of attainder passed in Parliament by Henry Vlll on 29 January 1542 resulted in the executions of a number of notable historical figures.

The use of these bills by Parliament eventually fell into disfavour due to the obvious potential for abuse and the violation of several legal principles, most importantly the right to [[due process]], the precept that a law should address a particular form of behaviour rather than a specific individual or group, and the [[separation of powers]].

==Jurisdictions==

===Australia===
Unlike the United States Constitution, there is no specific provision prohibiting the Commonwealth Government from passing bills of attainder. However, the [[High Court of Australia]] has ruled that bills of attainder are unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for any body other than a Chapter III court to wield judicial power.&lt;ref name="Wheat case"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|17|1915|link=New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915)|litigants=New South Wales v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1915/17.pdf (1915) 20 CLR 54] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Communist case"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1951|litigants=[[Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/5.pdf (1951) 83 CLR 1] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boilermakers"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1956|litigants=[[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia]] |parallelcite=(1956) 94 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 254 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the core aspects of judicial power is the ability to make binding and authoritative decisions on questions of law, that is, issues relating to life, liberty or property.&lt;ref name="Huddart"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1909|litigants=[[Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1909/36.pdf (1909)&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;CLR&amp;nbsp;330] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polyukhovich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|32|1991|litigants=[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]] (War Crimes Act case) |parallelcite=(1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 501 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wielding of judicial power by the legislative or executive branch includes the direct wielding of power and the indirect wielding of judicial power.&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1992|litigants=[[Chu Kheng Lim v Minister of Immigration]] |parallelcite=(1992) 176 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state constitutions in Australia contain few limitations on government power. Bills of attainder are considered permissible because there is no entrenched separation of powers at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;''Building Construction Employees and Builders' Labourers Federation of New South Wales v Minister of Industrial Relations'' (1986) 7 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 372, [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|46|1994|litigants=City of Collingwood v Victoria [No2] |parallelcite=[1994] 1 [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 652 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[section 77 of the Constitution of Australia]] permits state courts to be invested with Commonwealth jurisdiction, and any state law that renders a state court unable to function as Chapter III court (Commonwealth jurisdiction) is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1996|litigants=[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]] |parallelcite=(1996) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 51 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The States cannot structure their legal systems to prevent them from being subject to the Australian Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|1|2010|litigants=[[Kirk v Industrial Court of NSW]] |parallelcite=(2010) 239 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 531 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important distinction is that laws seeking to direct judicial power (e.g. must make orders)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|49|2009|litigants=International Finance Trust Company Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission (Criminal Assets Recovery case) |parallelcite=(2009) 240 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 319 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are unconstitutional, but laws that concern mandatory sentencing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NTSC|120|1997|litigants=Wynbyne v Marshall |parallelcite=(1997) 99 {{abbr|A Crim R|Australian Criminal Reports}} 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Moffatt'' [1998] 2 [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 229, [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Court of Appeal]] (Vic, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; rules of evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|9|1998|litigants=Nicholas v The Queen |parallelcite=(1998) 193 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 173 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; non-punitive imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|46|1998|litigants=Fardon v Attorney-General (QLD) |parallelcite=(2004) 223 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 575 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or tests,&lt;ref&gt;

===Canada===
In two cases of attempts to pass bills (in 1984 for [[Clifford Olson]] and in 1995 for [[Karla Homolka]]) to inflict a judicial penalty on a specific person, the speakers of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House]] and [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], respectively, have ruled that Canadian parliamentary practice does not permit bills of attainder or bills of pains and penalties.&lt;ref&gt;Canada: 32nd Parliament, 2nd Session, 14 May 1984 {{cite web|title=Debates of the House of Commons: "An Act respecting the execution of Clifford Robert Olson|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC3202_03/1321?r=0&amp;s=1|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=23 November 2015|page=3683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canada: 35th Parliament, 1st Session, 28 November 1995 {{cite web|title=Debates of the Senate: "Bill Concerning Karla Homolka|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_SOC3501_02/366?r=0&amp;s=1|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=23 November 2014|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Usage under English law====
The word "[[attainder]]", meaning "taintedness", is part of English [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;The word "attainder" does not, in fact, derive from a Latin expression meaning "tainted", but from a French expression meaning "to attain", in the sense of condemn. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/12725?redirectedFrom=attainder#eid&lt;/ref&gt; Under English law, a criminal condemned for a serious crime, whether [[treason]] or [[felony]] (but not [[misdemeanor|misdemeanour]], which referred to less serious crimes), could be declared "attainted", meaning that his civil rights were nullified: he could no longer own property or pass property to his family by will or testament. His property could consequently revert to the Crown or to the [[mesne lord]]. Any [[peerage]] titles would also revert to the Crown. The convicted person would normally be punished by [[execution (legal)|judicial execution]]—when a person committed a capital crime and was put to death for it, the property left behind [[escheat]]ed to the Crown or lord rather than being inherited by family. Attainder functioned more or less as the revocation of the feudal chain of privilege and all rights and properties thus granted.

Due to [[mandatory sentencing]], the due process of the courts provided limited flexibility to deal with the various circumstances of offenders. The property of criminals caught alive and put to death because of a guilty plea or jury conviction on a not guilty plea could be forfeited, as could the property of those who escaped justice and were outlawed; but the property of offenders who died before trial, except those killed during the commission of crimes (who fell foul of the law relating to ''[[felo de se]]''), could not be forfeited, nor could the property of offenders who refused to plead and who were tortured to death through ''[[peine forte et dure]]''.

On the other hand, when a legal conviction did take place, confiscation and "corruption of blood" sometimes appeared unduly harsh for the surviving family. In some cases (at least regarding the peerage) the Crown would eventually re-grant the convicted peer's lands and titles to his heir. It was also possible, as political fortunes turned, for a bill of attainder to be reversed. This sometimes occurred long after the convicted person was executed.

Unlike the mandatory sentences of the courts, acts of Parliament provided considerable latitude in suiting the punishment to the particular conditions of the offender's family. Parliament could also impose non-capital punishments without involving courts; such bills are called '''bills of pains and penalties'''.

Bills of attainder were sometimes criticised as a convenient way for the [[British monarchy|King]] to convict subjects of crimes and confiscate their property without the bother of a trial – and without the need for a conviction or indeed any evidence at all.

The first use of attainder was in 1321 against both [[Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester]] and his son [[Hugh Despenser the Younger|Hugh Despenser the Younger, Earl of Gloucester]]. They were both attainted for supporting [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] during his struggle with the [[Isabella of France|queen]] and barons.

In England, those executed subject to attainders include [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence]] (1478); [[Thomas Cromwell]] (1540); [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]] (1540); [[Catherine Howard]] (1542); Baron [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] (1549); [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke Thomas Howard of Norfolk]] (1572); [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl Thomas Wentworth of Strafford]] (1641); Archbishop [[William Laud]] of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] (1645); and the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke James Scott of Monmouth]]. In the case of Catherine Howard, in 1541 King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the first monarch to delegate [[Royal Assent]], to avoid having to assent personally to the execution of his wife.

After defeating [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and replacing him on the throne of England, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] had Parliament pass a bill of attainder against his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/richard-iii-the-truth-may-yet-be-discovered-8142320.html|title=Richard III: The truth may yet be discovered|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that this bill made no mention of the [[Princes in the Tower]], although it does declare him guilty of "shedding of Infants blood."&lt;ref name="Kendall, Richard IIIA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Paul Murray|ref=Kendall|title=[[Richard III (biography)|Richard the Third]]|authorlink=Paul Murray Kendall|publisher=[[W.

Although deceased by the time of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Thomas Pride]] were served with a bill of attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]]). After the committee stages, the bill passed both the Houses of Lords and Commons and was engrossed on 4 December 1660. This was followed with a resolution that passed both Houses on the same day:&lt;ref name="british-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26189 |title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8: 15 May 1660 &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="british-history2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26317 |title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8: 4 December 1660 &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="british-history3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26867 |title=Index: A-J &amp;#124; British History Online &amp;#124; ''Journal of the House of Commons:'' volume 8 |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1685, when the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth| Duke of Monmouth]] landed in West England and started [[Monmouth Rebellion|a rebellion]] in an effort to overthrow his uncle, the recently enthroned [[James II of England|James II]], Parliament passed an bill of attainder against him. After the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]], this made it possible for King James to have the captured Monmouth put summarily to death. Though  legal, this was regarded by many as an arbitrary and ruthless act.

In 1753, the Jacobite leader [[Archibald Cameron of Locheil]] was summarily put to death on the basis of a seven-year-old bill of attainder, rather than being put on trial for his recent subversive activities in Scotland. This aroused some protests in British public opinion at the time, including from people with no Jacobite sympathies.

The last use of attainder was in 1798 against [[Lord Edward FitzGerald]] for leading the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].

====The Great Act of Attainder====
In 1688, King [[James II of England]] (VII of Scotland), driven off by the ascent of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]], came to Ireland with the sole purpose of reclaiming his throne. After his arrival, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] assembled a list of names in 1689 of those reported to have been disloyal to him, eventually tallying between two and three thousand, in a bill of attainder. Those on the list were to report to Dublin for sentencing. One man, [[William Stewart, 1st Viscount Mountjoy|Lord Mountjoy]], was in the [[Bastille]] at the time and was told by the Irish Parliament that he must break out of his cell and make it back to Ireland for his punishment, or face the grisly process of being [[Drawing and quartering|drawn and quartered]].&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, ''History of England from the Accession of James the Second'' (London, 1855), 216–220&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament became known in the 1800s as the "[[Patriot Parliament]]".

Later defenders of the Patriot Parliament pointed out that the ensuing "[[Treaty of Limerick#The Williamite Settlement forfeitures|Williamite Settlement forfeitures]]" of the 1690s named an even larger number of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] suspects, most of whom had been attainted by 1699.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E800002-045/index.html TO Davis, "The Irish Parliament of James II"], 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private bills====
{{main article|Private bill}}
{{About|legislation that affects a specific person|legislation proposed by a single MP|Private member's bill|section=yes}}

In the Westminster system (and especially in the United Kingdom), a similar concept is covered by the term "private bill" (a bill which upon passage becomes a private Act). Note however that "private bill" is a general term referring to a proposal for legislation applying to a specific person; it is only a bill of attainder if it punishes them; private bills have been used in some Commonwealth countries to effect divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Millar and Sheldon Goldenberg (1998). "Explaining Child Custody Determinations in Canada", ''Canadian Journal of Law and Society'', Vol. 13, No. 1, p. 209-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditional uses of private bills include chartering corporations, changing the charters of existing corporations, granting monopolies, approving of public infrastructure and seizure of property for those, as well as enclosure of commons and similar redistributions of property. Those types of private bills operate to take away private property and rights from certain individuals, but are usually not called "bill of pains and penalties".

The last United Kingdom bill called a "Pains and Penalties Bill" was [[Pains and Penalties Bill 1820]] and was passed by the House of Lords in 1820, but not considered by the House of Commons; it sought to divorce [[Caroline of Brunswick|Queen Caroline]] from King George IV and adjust her titles and property accordingly, on grounds of her alleged adultery, as did many private bills dealing with divorces of private persons.

It has been reported that no bills of attainder have been passed since 1820 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Chafee, Jr., ''Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787 at 97'' (Univ. of Kans. Press, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Attainder as such was also a legal consequence of convictions in courts of law, but this ceased to be a part of punishment in 1870.&lt;ref name="british-civil-wars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/impeachment-attainder.htm |title=BCW Project :: British Civil Wars, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Protectorate 1638-1660 &amp;#124; Impeachment &amp; Attainder |author=David Plant|publisher=british-civil-wars.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War II====
Previously secret British [[War Cabinet#Second World War|War Cabinet]] papers released on 1 January 2006 have shown that, as early as December 1942, the War Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] had then advocated a policy of [[summary execution]] with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles. He was dissuaded by cabinet minister [[Richard Law, 1st Baron Coleraine|Richard Law]] who pointed out that the United States and Soviet Union still favoured trials.&lt;ref&gt;John Crossland [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article210371.ece "Churchill: execute Hitler without trial"], ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 1 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/trials/nurnbergtrial.html Holocaust Education and Archive Research Team], "The 1st Nuremberg Trial"&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
==== Colonial era ====
Bills of attainder were used through the 18th century in England, and were applied to British colonies as well. Some colonists were inspired to the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] because of anger at the injustice of attainder. Although at least one American state used a bill of attainder to confiscate the property of a British [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalist]] (called [[Tory|Tories]]) during the war (New York, in the 1779 case of [[Parker Wickham]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parker Wickham (1727–1785)|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jwickham/parker.htm|website=Ancestry.com|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; American dissatisfaction with British attainder laws resulted in their being prohibited in the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1789.

==== Constitutional bans ====
[[File:Constitution Pg2of4 AC-attainder.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Excerpt from Article One, Section 9 of the United States Constitution, prohibiting the passing of bills of attainder]]

The [[United States Constitution]] forbids legislative bills of attainder: in federal law under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9]], and in state law under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I, Section 10]]. The fact that they were banned even under state law reflects the importance that the framers attached to this issue.

Within the U.S. Constitution, the clauses forbidding attainder laws serve two purposes. First, they reinforced the [[separation of powers]], by forbidding the legislature to perform [[judiciary|judicial]] or executive functions—since the outcome of any such acts of legislature would of necessity take the form of a bill of attainder. Second, they embody the concept of [[due process]], which was partially reinforced by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution. The text of the Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 is "No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed".

The constitution of every state also expressly forbids bills of attainder.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} For example, [[Wisconsin Constitution|Wisconsin's constitution]] Article I, Section 12 reads:

{{quote|No bill of attainder, [[ex post facto law]], nor any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall ever be passed, and no conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate.}}

Contrast this with the Texas version: Article 1 (Titled Bill of Rights) Section 16, entitled ''Bills of Attainder; Ex Post Facto or Retroactive Laws: Impairing Obligation of Contracts'': "No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall be made". It is unclear whether a contract that calls for heirs to be deprived of their estate is allowed under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jacob |last=Reynolds |title=The Rule of Law and the Origins of the Bill of Attainder Clause |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stlr18&amp;div=13&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals |journal=St. Thomas Law Review |year=2005 |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cases before the U.S. Supreme Court ====
The U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated laws under the Attainder Clause on only five occasions.&lt;ref&gt;"Nonattainder as a Liberty Interest", ''Wisconsin Law Review'', 2010, p. 1229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]'s first decisions on the meaning of the bill of attainder clause came after the [[American Civil War]]. In ''[[Ex parte Garland]]'', 71 U.S. 333 (1866), the court struck down a federal law requiring attorneys practising in federal court to swear that they had not supported the rebellion. In ''[[Cummings v. Missouri]]'', 71 U.S. 277 (1867), the [[Missouri]] constitution required anyone seeking a professional's license from the state to swear they had not supported the rebellion. The Supreme Court overturned the law and the constitutional provision, arguing that the people already admitted to practice were subject to penalty without judicial trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hart Ely|Ely, John H.]] ''On Constitutional Ground''. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of judicial trial was the critical affront to the Constitution, the Court said.&lt;ref&gt;Nabers, Deak. ''Victory of Law: The Fourteenth Amendment, the Civil War, and American Literature, 1852–1867''. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades later, however, the Court upheld similar laws. In ''[[Hawker v. New York]]'', 170 U.S. 189 (1898), a state law barred convicted felons from practising medicine. In ''[[Dent v. West Virginia]]'', 129 U.S. 114 (1889), a state law imposed a new requirement that practising physicians had to have graduated from a licensed medical school or they would be forced to surrender their license. The Court upheld both laws because, it said, the laws were narrowly tailored to focus on an individual's qualifications to practice medicine.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, Theodore. ''The Second Amendment Controversy—Explained.'' 2d ed. Indianapolis: iUniverse, 2002, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; That was not true in ''Garland'' or ''Cummings''.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond481483"&gt;"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause". ''Virginia Law Review''. 70:475 (April 1984), p. 481-483.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court changed its "bill of attainder test" in 1946. In ''[[United States v. Lovett]]'', 328 U.S. 303 (1946), the Court confronted a federal law that named three people as subversive and excluded them from federal employment. Previously, the Court had held that lack of judicial trial and the narrow way in which the law rationally achieved its goals were the only tests of a bill of attainder. But the ''Lovett'' Court said that a bill of attainder 1) specifically identified the people to be punished; 2) imposed punishment; and 3) did so without benefit of judicial trial.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, Robert Fairchild and Koniak, Susan P. ''Cases in Civil Liberties''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1994, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Heritage Guide to the Constitution''. Washington, D.C.: Heritage Foundation, 2005, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; As all three prongs of the bill of attainder test were met in ''Lovett'', the court held that a congressional statute that bars particular individuals from government employment qualifies as punishment prohibited by the bill of attainder clause.

The [[Taft–Hartley Act]] (enacted in 1947) sought to ban [[strike action|political strikes]] by [[Communism|Communist]]-dominated [[trade union|labour unions]] by requiring all elected labour leaders to take an oath that they were not and had never been members of the [[Communist Party USA]], and that they did not advocate violent overthrow of the U.S. government. It also made it a crime for members of the Communist Party to serve on executive boards of labour unions. In ''[[American Communications Association v. Douds]]'', 339 U.S. 382 (1950), the Supreme Court had said that the requirement for the oath was not a bill of attainder because: 1) anyone could avoid punishment by disavowing the Communist Party, and 2) it focused on a future act (overthrow of the government) and not a past one.&lt;ref name="Welsh"&gt;Welsh, Jane. "The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process". ''Brooklyn Law Review''. 50:77 (Fall 1983), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting current fears, the Court commented in ''Douds'' on approving the specific focus on Communists by noting what a threat communism was.&lt;ref&gt;Wiecek, William M. ''History of the Supreme Court of the United States: The Birth of the Modern Constitution: The United States Supreme Court, 1941–1953''. New York: Macmillan, 2006, p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court had added an "escape clause" test to determining whether a law was a bill of attainder.&lt;ref name="Welsh" /&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Brown]]'', 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Court invalidated the section of the statute that criminalized a former communist serving on a union's executive board. Clearly, the Act had focused on past behaviour and had specified a specific class of people to be punished. But if this specific focus in ''Brown'' was constitutionally invalid, why was it ''not'' constitutionally invalid in ''Douds''?&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause", ''Virginia Law Review'', April 1984, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; (Many legal scholars assumed that the ''Brown'' case effectively, if not officially, overruled ''Douds''.)&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, Victor. ''Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir''. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1996, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Court did not apply the punishment prong of its test, leaving legal scholars confused as to whether the Court still intended it to apply.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, "The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process", ''Brooklyn Law Review'', Fall 1983, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court emphasised the narrowness and rationality of bills of attainder in ''[[Nixon v. Administrator of General Services]]'', 433 U.S. 425 (1977). During the [[Watergate scandal]], in 1974 Congress passed the [[Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act]], which required the [[General Services Administration]] to confiscate former President [[Richard Nixon]]'s presidential papers to prevent their destruction, screen out those which contained national security and other issues which might prevent their publication, and release the remainder of the papers to the public as fast as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Ripley, Anthony. "U.S. Judge Rules Nixon Documents Belong to Nation", ''New York Times'', 1 February 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court upheld the law in ''Nixon'', arguing that specificity alone did not invalidate the act because the President constituted a "class of one".&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;Stark, Jack. ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution''. Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2002, p. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, specificity was constitutional if it was rationally related to the class identified.&lt;ref name="Stark" /&gt; The Court modified its punishment test, concluding that only those laws which historically offended the bill of attainder clause were invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also found it significant that Nixon was compensated for the loss of his papers, which alleviated the punishment.&lt;ref name="Stark75"&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court modified the punishment prong by holding that punishment could survive scrutiny if it was rationally related to other, nonpunitive goals.&lt;ref name="Stark75" /&gt; Finally, the Court concluded that the legislation must not be intended to punish; legislation enacted for otherwise legitimate purposes could be saved so long as punishment was a side-effect rather than the main purpose of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cases considered by lower courts ====
A number of cases which raised the bill of attainder issue did not reach or have not reached the Supreme Court, but were considered by lower courts.

In 1990, in the wake of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]], Congress enacted the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990|Oil Pollution Act]] to consolidate various oil spill and oil pollution statutes into a single unified law, and to provide for a statutory regime for handling oil spill cleanup. This law was challenged as a bill of attainder by the shipping division of [[ExxonMobil]].&lt;ref&gt;''SeaRiver Maritime Fin. Holdings, Inc. v. Pena'', 952 F.Supp. 9, D.D.C. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carringan, Alison C. "The Bill of Attainder Clause: A New Weapon to Challenge the Oil Pollution Act of 1990", ''Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review'' 28:119 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] struck down the [[Elizabeth Morgan Act]] as a bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;''Doris R. Foretich, et al. v. United States'', 351 F.3d 1198 (D.C.App. 2003); Leonning, Carol D. "Appeals Court Rules Against Morgan Law", ''Washington Post'' 17 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution in late 2009 barring the community organising group [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN) from receiving federal funding, the group sued the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;Fahim, Kareem. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/nyregion/13acorn.html "Acorn Sues Over Funding Vote in House"]. ''New York Times'', 12 November 2009. Accessed 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another, broader bill, the Defund ACORN Act, was enacted by Congress later that year. In March 2010, a federal district court declared the funding ban an unconstitutional bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Michael B. "Funding Gone, Scandal-Plagued ACORN to Disband". ''Christian Science Monitor'', 23 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] reversed and remanded on the grounds that only 10 percent of ACORN's funding was federal and that did not constitute "punishment".&lt;ref&gt;"Federal Court Rules Against Acorn". Associated Press: 14 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACORN v.

==== Possible cases ====
There is argument over whether the [[Palm Sunday Compromise]] in the [[Terri Schiavo case]] was a bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;Calabresi, Steven G. "The Terri Schiavo Case: In Defense of the Special Law Enacted by Congress and President Bush", ''Northwestern University Law Review'' 100:1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGough, Michael. "Terri's Law: Is It Constitutional?" ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', 22 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Jr., Thomas C. "Terri Schiavo and the Law", ''Albany Law Review'' 67:843 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts considered a proposed Congressional bill to confiscate 90 percent of the bonus money paid to executives at federally rescued investment bank [[American International Group]] a bill of attainder, although disagreement exists on the issue. The bill was not passed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ashby. "Would an AIG-Bonus Tax Pass Constitutional Muster? (A Tribe Calls 'Yes!')" ''Wall Street Journal'', 18 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Connor. "No Bill of Attainder... Shall Be Passed". ''The Atlantic'', 16 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the City of Portland's attempt to prosecute more severely those on a "secret list" of 350 individuals deemed by police to have committed "liveability crimes" in certain neighbourhoods was challenged as unconstitutional bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/secret-list-on-trial/Content?oid=1055123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.streetroots.org/2009/03/11/two-more-cases-add-list-trial&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the House voted to defund [[Planned Parenthood]]. Democratic Representative [[Jerrold Nadler|Jerry Nadler]] called that vote a bill of attainder, saying it was unconstitutional as such because the legislation was targeting a specific group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = House votes to defund Planned Parenthood - David Nather and Kate Nocera|url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49830.html|accessdate = 23 July 2015|first = David Nather and Kate|last = Nocera|date = 18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the House reinstated the [[Holman Rule]], a procedural rule that enables lawmakers to reduce the pay of an individual federal worker down to $1.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/the-holman-rule-once-allowed-congress-to-purge-leftists-from-government-agencies-now-its-back/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Code morphing''' is an approach used in [[obfuscating software]] to protect [[software]] applications from [[reverse engineering]], analysis, modifications, and cracking. This technology protects intermediate level code such as compiled from Java and .NET languages ([[Oxygene (programming language)|Oxygene]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic]], etc.) rather than binary [[object file|object code]]. Code morphing breaks up the protected code into several processor commands or small command snippets and replaces them by others, while maintaining the same end result. Thus the protector obfuscates the code at the intermediate level.

Code morphing is a multilevel technology containing hundreds of unique code transformation patterns. In addition this technology transforms some intermediate layer commands into [[virtual machine]] commands (like [[UCSD p-System|p-code]]). Code morphing does not protect against runtime tracing, which can reveal the execution logic of any protected code.

Unlike other code protectors, there is no concept of code decryption with this method.  Protected code blocks are always in the executable state, and they are executed (interpreted) as transformed code. The original intermediate code is absent to a certain degree, but deobfuscation can still give a clear view of the original code flow.

Code morphing is also used to refer to the [[just-in-time compilation]] technology used in [[Transmeta]] processors such as the [[Transmeta Crusoe|Crusoe]] and [[Transmeta Efficeon|Efficeon]] to implement the [[x86]] instruction set architecture.  

Code morphing is often used in obfuscating the [[copy protection]] or other checks that a program makes to determine whether it is a valid, authentic installation, or an [[Copyright infringement of software|unauthorized copy]], in order to make the removal of the copy-protection code more difficult than would otherwise be the case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9798">According to Rieh (2005), "Patrick Wilson (1983) developed the '''cognitive authority''' theory from [[social epistemology]] in his book, ''Second-hand Knowledge: An Inquiry into Cognitive Authority''. The fundamental concept of Wilson’s cognitive authority is that people construct knowledge in two different ways: based on their first-hand experience or on what they have learned second-hand from others. What people learn first-hand depends on the stock of ideas they bring to the interpretation and understanding of their encounters with the world. People primarily depend on others for ideas as well as for information outside the range of direct experience. Much of what they think of the world is what they have gained second-hand. Wilson (1983) argues that all that people know of the world beyond the narrow range of their own lives is what others have told them. However, people do not count all hearsay as equally reliable; only those who are deemed to “know what they are talking about” become cognitive authorities. Wilson coined the term cognitive authority to explain the kind of authority that influences thoughts that people would consciously recognize being proper. Cognitive authority differs from administrative authority or the authority vented in a hierarchical position." (Rieh, 2005).

==Philosophical issues==
Wilson's dichotomy between first hand knowledge and second hand knowledge may be a trace left from empiricism. According to non-empiricist epistemologies such as hermeneutics and pragmatism even our first hand knowledge (our perception) is influenced by our culture and hence - mostly indirectly and unconsciously - by cognitive authorities: the way we learn to look at things when brought up in a culture and socialized into a subculture and a domain.

The concept of cognitive authority is important because it forces us to be [[skeptical]] towards claims in the literature and elsewhere. It forces us to consider the criteria we should use when evaluating information [[:wikt:source|source]]s. In other words: It forces us to consider [[epistemological]] issues.

Different "movements", "paradigms", "positions" or "schools" in a given field tend to have different cognitive authorities. 
 
"Most people, even most academics, do not have the time, training, or occasion to work through the technical literature on a controversial topic, and so, they must rely on professionals for a disinterested evaluation" (Herrnstein, 1973, pp.&amp;nbsp;52,53; quoted from Tucker, 1994). Tucker shows, however, that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted [[Cyril Burt]]'s research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that [[IQ]] was hereditary, and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. When a researcher from another field ([[Leon Kamin]]) first demonstrated that Burt's results were wrong, he was not considered a cognitive authority. When his criticism was considered unavoidable, the established researchers tried to change history and deprive Kamin of his intellectual credit. This example shows something about how cognitive authority may be ascribed in the real world.  
 
The concept of cognitive authority also raises the question of the role of experts. On the one hand, it is dangerous to blindly believe claims originating from "experts" while on the other hand, "commonsensism" is also a problematic epistemology. John Dewey (1920) discussed this dilemma and worked on improving general education in order to make the general public less vulnerable to the power of experts.

==Example: The cognitive authority of professional historians==
In about 1880, history was established as an academic discipline and as a profession based on that discipline in both Europe and the USA. The cognitive authority of history was closely related to the application of scientific methods and [[source criticism]]. A clear division was established between amateur historians and professional, scientific historians. From the dominant "paradigm" in the historical profession of that time, it was clear what to consider "cognitive authority".

However, inside history, the "paradigm" shifted to "the present period of confusion, polarization, and uncertainty, in which the idea of historical objectivity has become more problematic than ever before".&lt;ref&gt;(Novick, 1988, p. 16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

For some the development has turned around and amateurs have the same cognitive authority as professional historians: "[I]t is not the purportedly objective investigations
of the historian into a real subject matter which lead to knowledge about history, but rather the
knowledge at which the historian arrives is conditioned
by the linguistic mode in which she/he operates.
Professional historiography for White [1973] generates no
more objective knowledge of the past than does speculative philosophy of history or the historical
novel." &lt;ref&gt;(Iggers, 2001, 6772)&lt;/ref&gt;

What is considered "cognitive authority" in a given field of knowledge is thus relative and depending on the "paradigm" of the information seeker. An argument about what should be regarded "cognitive authority" is in the end an epistemological argument.

==Implications for library and information science==
The concept of cognitive authority was developed in [[library and information science]] and has attracted a lot of attention in this field. Its importance for this field is related to questions such as: What criteria should be used for selecting information sources? For advising users about selecting information? For interpreting user studies and relevance judgments? All such issues involve questions of cognitive authority and epistemology.

"Perhaps we [library and information professionals] should learn to be more critical of the very concept of authority. Authority is legitimate only within the boundaries of the community (subject or otherwise) in which it is based. Many questions pertain to areas claimed by competing disciplines, and some to areas beyond the bounds of recognized disciplinary communities. Even when we are able to locate authoritative sources with answers to questions, they tend to be less certain than they look, and greater authority is no guarantee of quality. Authority tells us only that the creators of the source have qualifications and institutional affiliations that match the expectations of a given disciplinary community, not that the source is infallible, or even that its disciplinary community is the best to pursue the information sought" (Pierce, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;31).

The '''Competition Appeal Tribunal''' ('''CAT''') of the United Kingdom was created by Section 12 and Schedule 2 to the     [[Enterprise Act 2002|Enterprisee Act]] 2002 which came into force on 1 April 2003. The '''Competition Service''' is an executive non-departmental public body which was created as a support body for the Competition Appeal Tribunal.

==Functions==
The current functions of the CAT are:
* To hear appeals on the merits in respect of decisions made under the [[Competition Act 1998|Competition Act]] 1998 by the [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT) and the regulators in the telecommunications, electricity, gas, [[water industry|water]], railways and air traffic services sectors.
* To hear actions for damages and other monetary claims under the Competition Act 1998.
* To review decisions made by the Secretary of State, OFT and the [[Competition Commission]] in respect of merger and market references or possible references under the Enterprise Act 2002.
* To hear appeals against certain decisions made by [[Ofcom]] and the Secretary of State relating to the exercise by Ofcom of its functions under Part 2 (networks, services and the radio spectrum) and sections 290 to 294 and Schedule 11 (networking arrangements for Channel 3) of the [[Communications Act 2003]].
* To hear appeals in respect of decisions made by the OFT under the EC Competition Law (Articles 84 and 85) Enforcement Regulations 2001 (as amended).

==Cases==

===Online Hotel Booking===

In March 2014, the price comparison site, Skyscanner, brought a case to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catribunal.org.uk/237-8431/1226-2-12-14-Skyscanner-Limited.html&lt;/ref&gt; challenging a January 2014 decision by the UK’s antitrust authority – then known as the [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT) – to settle a probe over pricing of hotel rooms online. The OFT's decision had been to accept commitments from a number of online travel agents (OTAs) and InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Practical Law|url = http://uk.practicallaw.com/1-556-1405|website = uk.practicallaw.com|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skyscanner appealed against the OFT's successor, the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] (CMA), because it believed its business would be affected by the settlement, even though it wasn't targeted by the investigation. Skyscanner's case was supported by a smaller online travel agent, Skoosh, which had triggered the OFT's original investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OFT launches investigation into online hotel room sales|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11330463|publisher = BBC News|access-date = 2016-02-08|first = Simon Gompertz Personal finance|last = correspondent|first2 = B. B. C.|last2 = News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a judgement handed down in September 2014, the Competition Appeal Tribunal quashed the Office of Fair Trading's decision to accept commitments in the online hotel booking sector and the matter was reverted to the CMA for reconsideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Skyscanner: CAT quashes commitments in the online booking sector|url = http://competitionbulletin.com/2014/09/28/skyscanner-cat-quashes-commitments-in-the-online-booking-sector/|website = Competition Bulletin|access-date = 2016-02-08|first = Tristan|last = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cyberspace Administration of China''' ('''CAC'''; {{zh |s = 国家互联网信息办公室 |l = State Internet Information Office }}), also known as the '''Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission''' ({{zh |s = 中央网络安全和信息化委员会办公室 }}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-12/31/c_133890303.htm |title = Cyberspace Administration of China launches official website |agency = Xinhua |date = 2014-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the central Internet regulator, [[Censorship|censor]], oversight, and control agency for the [[China|People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = China's 'great firewall' just got taller |url = https://www.opendemocracy.net/digitaliberties/jennifer-cheung/china's-'great-firewall'-just-got-taller |date=14 July 2015 |first = Jennifer |last = Cheung |website = openDemocracy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAC was founded in 2014. As of August 2018, the agency is headed by Zhuang Rongwen (庄荣文).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2018/0801/c1001-30182160.html|title =  庄荣文任中央网信办主任 徐麟不再担任|author =  |date =2018-08-01  |publisher =人民网 |language =  |accessdate =  |quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAC answers to the [[Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission]], which is headed by [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] General Secretary [[Xi Jinping]]. The deputy heads are [[Li Keqiang]], the Premier of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] of China, and [[Liu Yunshan]], the head of the [[Central Leading Group for Propaganda and Ideological Work|Propaganda and Ideology Leading Group]].

== Bureaucratic structure ==
The CAC, based on the same bureaucracy as the Communist Party's [[State Council Information Office|Office for Foreign Propaganda]], is involved in the formulation and implementation of policy on a variety of issues related to the Chinese Internet.

The CAC includes the following departments: an Internet Security Emergency Command Center, an Agency Service Center, and an Illegal and Unhealthy Information Reporting Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 中央网信办所属事业单位面向社会公开招聘-新华网 |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2015-10/19/c_128335178.htm |website = news.xinhuanet.com |accessdate = 2015-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of the CAC have been linked with a broader push by the administration of Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, characterized by Xiao Qiang, head of [[China Digital Times]], as a "ferocious assault on civil society." This has included forced confessions of television journalists, military parades, harsh media censorship and more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/CECC%20Hearing%20-%20Human%20Rights%20Abuses%20-%2018Sept15%20-%20Xiao%20Qiang.pdf |title = Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) Hearing: Urging China’s President Xi Jinping to Stop State-Sponsored Human Rights Abuses |date = September 18, 2015 |accessdate = November 30, 2015 |website = CECC |publisher = CECC |last = Qiang |first = Xiao }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAC also maintains some censorship functions, including issuing directives to media companies in China. After a campaign to arrest almost 200 lawyers and activists in China, the CAC published a directive saying that "All websites must, without exception, use as the standard official and authoritative media reports with regards to the detention of trouble-making lawyers by the relevant departments."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lu Wei, the head of the CAC, was previously the head of the Beijing Propaganda Department, and oversaw the Internet Management Office, a "massive human effort" that involved over 60,000 Internet propaganda workers and two million others employed off-payroll. It was this experience that assisted General Secretary Xi Jinping in selecting Lu was the head of the newly formed Internet regulator, the CAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.chrismcairns.com/uploads/3/0/2/2/30226899/chapter_3_-_seizing_weibos_commanding_heights_through_bureaucratic_re-centralization_-_final_7.30.15.pdf |title = Seizing Weibo’s "Commanding Heights" Through Bureaucratic Re-centralization |last = Cairns|first = Christopher |date = January 1, 2015 |journal = Dissertation |doi = |pmid = |access-date = December 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policies ==
Among the areas the CAC regulates include usernames on the Chinese Internet, the appropriateness of remarks made online, [[virtual private network]]s, the content of [[Internet portals]], and much more.&lt;ref name="phys.org"&gt;{{cite webb|title = China orders media giant Sina to 'improve censorship' |url = http://phys.org/news/2015-04-china-media-giant-sina-censorship.html |accessdate = 2015-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CAC was behind a warning given to the major web service [[Sina Weibo]], which was threatened with closure unless it "improved censorship." The CAC said that Sina had failed to properly police the comments made by users on the Internet.&lt;ref name="phys.org" /&gt;

According to a draft Cyber Security Law, made public on July 6, 2015, the CAC works with other Chinese regulators to formulate a catalog of "key network equipment" and "specialized network security products" for certification. The CAC is also involved in reviewing the procurement of network products or services for national security considerations. Data stored outside of China by Chinese companies is also required to undergo CAC approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url = http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/files/cyber-security-in-china-130661.PDF |title = Cyber security in China |author = Norton Rose Fulbright |date = July 2015 |journal = Norton Rose Fulbright |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Xinhua, the official state newsagency, the CAC was responsible for issuing a "voluntary pledge" that was intended to be adhered to by the major Internet portals in China about the comments that would or would not be allowed to be made on their website. Among the categories of comments that were banned, included were those that "harmed national security," "harmed the nation's honor or interest," "damaged the nation's religious policies," "spread rumors, disturbed public order," and "intentionally using character combinations to avoid censorship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 29家网站签署《跟帖评论自律管理承诺书》|url = http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2014-11-06/223631106669.shtml |website = news.sina.com.cn |accessdate = 2015-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAC was also responsible for chasing down Internet users and web sites that published "rumors" following an explosion in the port city of Tianjin. Such rumors included claims that blasts killed 1,000 people, or that there was looting, or leadership ructions as a result of the blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China Cracks Down on Websites Accused of Spreading 'Rumors' About the Tianjin Blast {{!}} VICE News |url = https://news.vice.com/article/china-cracks-down-on-websites-accused-of-spreading-rumors-about-the-tianjin-blast |website = VICE News |accessdate = 2015-11-30 |language = en-US }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAC has been given the responsibility for reviewing the security of devices made by foreign countries.&lt;ref name="nytMay2016"&gt;{{cite news |title=China Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author=Paul Mozur and Jane Perlez |date=May 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public reception ==

Internet users in China have generally regarded the CAC with anger, given its central role in regulating and blocking the content they have access to. In January 2015, the CAC debuted a song that ''[[The New York Times]]'' called "a throwback to revolutionary songs glorifying the state." The song included the lines: “Unified with the strength of all living things, Devoted to turning the global village into the most beautiful scene” and “An Internet power: Tell the world that the Chinese Dream is uplifting China.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = China's Internet Censorship Anthem Is Revealed, Then Deleted |url = http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/12/chinas-internet-censorship-anthem-is-revealed-then-deleted/ |website = Sinosphere Blog |accessdate = 2015-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAC has also been accused of assisting in cyber attacks against visitors to Chinese website. The anti-censorship group [[GreatFire.org]] provided data and reports showing [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s against major foreign web services, including iCloud, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Google. The attack would have required the ability to "tap into the backbone of the Chinese Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An Open Letter to Lu Wei and the Cyberspace Administration of China {{!}} GreatFire.org|url = https://en.greatfire.org/blog/2015/jan/open-letter-lu-wei-and-cyberspace-administration-china|website = en.greatfire.org|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson Research Corporation attributed some of the [[Censorship of GitHub|attacks against GitHub]] to the CAC's operations. In the attack, ads hosted on Baidu were able to leverage computers visiting from outside China, redirecting their traffic to overload the servers of GitHub. "The tampering takes places someplace between when the traffic enters China and when it hits Baidu’s servers," Gibson wrote. "This is consistent with previous malicious actions and points to the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) being directly involved..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-501-notes.pdf |title = Security Now! #501 |date = March 31, 2015 |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |author = Gibson Research Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public Monitoring ==
China has pursued a new strategy for app rules to monitor user accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = China to adopt new app rules to monitor user accounts |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36685264 |accessdate=27 July 2016 |publisher=[[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Elm Guest House''' was a former hotel in Rocks Lane, near [[Barnes Common]] in south-west [[London]] that was named in a 2012 report into [[sexual abuse]] and [[Child grooming| child grooming]] in the late 1970s and 1980s. Several prominent British men were alleged, in a list produced by convicted fraudster Chris Fay, to have visited the Guest House during this time. Labour MP [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] suggested in an October 2012 statement to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that a paedophile network which had existed at this time may have brought children to parties at the private residence. During 2014 and 2015, allegations against several leading politicians of the period, mostly now deceased, were made public in the British press. Many of these claims were examined and discredited in an October 2015 episode of the BBC current affairs programme, ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]''.

The role of the guest house became the subject of a [[Metropolitan Police Service]] investigation known as '''Operation Fairbank''' in late 2012; the purpose of this "scoping exercise" was to assess Watson's claims. As a result of allegations arising from Operation Fairbank, a full criminal investigation called '''Operation Fernbridge''' was launched in February 2013.&lt;ref name="IndFeb"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/two-arrested-over-claims-that-mps-took-part-in-childsex-ring-8482864.html |title=Two arrested over claims that MPs took part in child-sex ring |place=London |work=The Independent |first=Martin |last=Hickman |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further evidence into alleged abuse connected to the Elm Guest House was uncovered and the operation was closed in March 2015.&lt;ref name="Midland"/&gt; Another investigation, '''[[Operation Midland]]''', was set up to examine claims of possible homicide. A subsequent inquiry found that those investigated by Operation Midland had been victims of false allegations. The then-Metropolitan Police commissioner, [[Bernard Hogan-Howe, Baron Hogan-Howe|Bernard Hogan-Howe]], later made a personal apology to the innocent parties involved in November 2016.

==Elm Guest House== 
The three-storey Elm Guest House was in Rocks Lane, close to [[Barnes Common]] in south-west London. It had eight guest rooms, and its facilities included a [[sauna]], solarium and video studio.&lt;ref name="independent-police-failings"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-failings-put-dozens-of-children-at-risk-from-notorious-paedophile-ring-8518522.html |title= Police failings put dozens of children at risk from notorious paedophile ring |last=Hickman |first=Martin |place=London |work=[[The Independent on Sunday]] |date=3 March 2013 |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=observer050714&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jul/05/elm-guest-house-paedophile-network-allegations |title= Edwardian house at heart of a long-simmering sex scandal |last=Boffey |first=Daniel |place=London |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 July 2014 |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] house has since been converted into two-bedroom apartments,&lt;ref name=observer050714/&gt; and the current occupants are not connected to the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Met investigates guesthouse child abuse claims |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-21068494 |accessdate=25 July 2014 |work=BBC News |date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elm Guest House owner and manager, Carole Kasir, "transformed [the house] from a nondescript suburban hotel into a gay rendezvous which was advertised in Gay News and other specialist publications".&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Stephen; Pendlebury, Richard (5 December 2014). [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2862860/Inside-house-horrors-Revealed-chilling-boy-taken-infamous-gay-brothel-gave-senior-politician-said-abused-police-left-MP-s-report.html "Inside the house of horrors"]. ''[[Daily Mail]]''. London. 5 December 2014. Retrieved 3 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A party was raided by the police in 1982, following which 12 boys gave evidence that they had been abused by men at the house. Kasir was convicted of the charge of running a [[disorderly house]], but allegations of abuse against children, (and an alleged subsequent reported investigation in 2003), were apparently not pursued.&lt;ref name="Hanning"/&gt; Kasir died in 1990 at the age of 47; an inquest found that the cause of Kasir's death was suicide due to an overdose of [[insulin]].&lt;ref name="Hanning"/&gt; 

==Background==
===History of claims===
In 1990, according to journalist James Hanning, Chris Fay, a Labour councillor, convicted fraudster&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11893906/VIP-child-abuse-ring-accuser-served-time-in-prison-for-fraud.html |title= 'VIP child abuse ring' accuser served time in prison for fraud |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |first=Robert |last=Mendick |date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a campaigner for the National Association of Young People in Care, claimed on oath that former Home Secretary [[Leon Brittan]] had been involved in abuse and that in March 1990 he had seen a photograph of Brittan with a young boy. He said the picture had been shown to him by Carole Kasir, co-owner of the Elm Guest House, who died weeks later.&lt;ref name="chrisfay"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hanning |first=James |title=Lord Brittan: The accusations against the former Home Secretary that refused to die |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/lord-brittan-the-accusations-against-the-former-home-secretary-that-refused-to-die-10000618.html |accessdate=8 February 2015 |work=The Independent on Sunday |location=London |date=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fay also drew up a list of public figures that he said victims had told him had stayed at the Elm Guest House. The list included former government ministers, senior [[Member of parliament|MPs]], top police officers, judges, pop music stars, and people with links to the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Households]].&lt;ref name=Ind9June13&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/police-reveal-scale-of-elm-guest-house-investigation-into-alleged-paedophile-ring-8651295.html |title=Police reveal scale of Elm Guest House investigation into alleged paedophile ring |last=Milmo |first=Cahal |last2=Peachy |first2=Paul |place=London |work=[[The Independent]] |date=9 June 2013|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was uploaded to the internet.&lt;ref name="fraud"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal]] in October 2012, Labour MP [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] said in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] he had evidence that there was a "powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and Number 10".&lt;ref name=IndDec12&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/scotland-yard-investigating-allegations-senior-politicians-abused-children-in-the-1980s-and-used-connections-to-escape-justice-8411989.html |author=Hickman, Martin |title=Scotland Yard investigating allegations senior politicians abused children in the 1980s and used 'connections' to escape justice |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |place=London |date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Midland"/&gt; With the public upset that Savile was never properly investigated over his alleged crimes, the Metropolitan Police launched Operation Fairbank as a scoping exercise to examine Watson's claims.&lt;ref name="Midland"/&gt; Watson later publicly stated that two people had come forward and told him they were abused by Brittan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Millmo |first=Cahal |title=Leon Brittan sex abuse allegations: Two come forward to claim they were abused by former Home Secretary |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/leon-brittan-sex-abuse-allegations-two-come-forward-to-claim-they-were-abused-by-former-home-secretary-10001676.html |work=The Independent on Sunday |location=London |date=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next few years, additional allegations were reported in the media. Allegations were made that Liberal MP Cyril Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir Cyril Smith 'visited alleged sex abuse guest house' |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-24074818 |work=BBC News |date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DJ [[Jimmy Savile]],&lt;ref name=Piggott1/&gt; convicted rapist [[Sidney Cooke]],&lt;ref name=Piggott1&gt;{{cite news |last=Piggott |first=Mark |title=Ex-Tory Minister to be Questioned About Paedophile Party Claims |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/paedophile-orgy-conservative-savile-police-1980s-amsterdam-528374 |accessdate=18 December 2014 |work=International Business Times |date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Foreign Office barrister Colin Peters&lt;ref name=cahalan1&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cahalan |first1=Paul |last2=Hanning |first2=James |title=Paedophile ring leader, Colin Peters, linked to Barnes scandal |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/paedophile-ring-leader-colin-peters-linked-to-barnes-scandal-8518078.html |accessdate=18 November 2014 |work=The Independent on Sunday |location= London |date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among those who visited the establishment. The police's Professional Standards Directorate examined potential criminal offences by undercover officers at the time of a police raid on Elm Guest House in June 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hanning |first=James |title=Child abuse victims to sue Government |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/exclusive-child-abuse-victims-to-sue-government-9602503.html |accessdate=2 January 2015 |work=The Independent on Sunday |place=London |date=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Metropolitan Police]] referred themselves to the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]], asking them to review sixteen different allegations that they had suppressed evidence of child sexual abuse and prevented the investigation of some allegations between 1970 and 2005.&lt;ref name="bbc met ipcc"&gt;{{cite news |title=Metropolitan Police probed over child abuse 'cover-up' claims |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-31907201 |work=BBC News |date=16 March 2015 |access-date=16 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims are challenged and discredited===
In an edition of ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' broadcast on 6 October 2015, a former Elm Guest House prostitute was interviewed who claimed that he was unaware of any MPs visiting the brothel. Journalist [[John Bertram Oakes|John Oakes]] told them he had investigated Chris Fay's claims, but had never been able to find any "solid" information nor trace of photos Fay said he had seen. Fay told ''Panorama'' that 17 or 18 children from Grafton Close had told him they had been trafficked to Elm Guest House; one of them, Mark, stated that he had been an abuse victim at Grafton Close but had never been to Elm Guest House nor spoken to Fay. Another person interviewed by ''Panorama'' said they named Brittan as their abuser only after being pressured by Fay.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Panorama - The VIP Paedophile Ring: What's the Truth? (6 October 2015) - 14:49 to 20:38; [https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06h7jbl/panorama-the-vip-paedophile-ring-whats-the-truth iPlayer link]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'' later reported that Fay had been jailed for fraud in 2011.&lt;ref name="fraud"/&gt; Fay said he regretted starting a "witch-hunt".&lt;ref name="fraud"&gt;Evans, Martin (7 October 2015).

''The Daily Telegraph''. London. Retrieved 2 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, Watson was criticised for consistently refusing to comment after it was revealed that the police had been pressured into investigating rape allegations against Brittan by Watson, who wrote to the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]]. Police ultimately decided that Brittan would face no further action but Brittan was never told he would not be charged before his death in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Watson urged to break silence over Lord Brittan abuse claims|last = Cecil|first = Nicholas|date = 9 October 2015|work = London Evening Standard|access-date = |via = |page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Watson apologised to Brittan's widow and her family for the distress caused by the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tom Watson to issue written apology to Leon Brittan's widow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/20/tom-watson-written-apology-leon-brittan-widow |work=The Guardian |date=20 November 2015 |accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan police commissioner [[Bernard Hogan-Howe]] issued an apology of his own in February 2016 for mishandling the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leon Brittan's widow receives apology from Met police chief

==Criminal investigations==
===Operation Fairbank===
The police investigation known as Operation Fairbank was first set up under conditions of secrecy. ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]''&lt;ref name="Hanning"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/special-report-police-revisit-the-grim-mystery-of-elm-guest-house-8420435.html |title=Special report: Police revisit the grim mystery of Elm Guest House |place=London |work=The Independent on Sunday |first1=James |last1=Hanning |first2=Paul |last2=Cahalan |date= 16 December 2012 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that it focused on claims of [[sexual abuse]] and the [[Child grooming|grooming]] of children, involving parties for men at the former Elm Guest House. Police also investigated allegations that in the early 1980s a "paedophile ring of VIPs" abused boys from the Grafton Close Children's Home in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], south-west London.&lt;ref name=Piggott1&gt;{{cite news |last=Piggott |first=Mark |title=Ex-Tory Minister to be Questioned About Paedophile Party Claims |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/paedophile-orgy-conservative-savile-police-1980s-amsterdam-528374 |accessdate=18 December 2014 |work=International Business Times |date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Operation Fairbank caused much speculation on the internet but made little progress in exposing the alleged paedophile ring.&lt;ref name="Midland"/&gt;

===Operation Fernbridge and Operation Athabasca===
A full criminal investigation, Operation Fernbridge, was launched as a result of allegations that arose from Operation Fairbank. Operation Fernbridge investigated allegations concerning both Grafton Close children's home and Elm Guest House.&lt;ref name="yewtomid"/&gt;

Operation Fernbridge was supported by the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]], the [[Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre]] and [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond]] Social Services.&lt;ref name="IndFeb"/&gt; In June 2013, it was reported that seven police officers were working on the case and were following more than 300 leads.&lt;ref name=BBCJune10&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22841065 |title=Operation Fernbridge: Met looking into 300 lines of inquiry |place=London |work=BBC News |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate= 10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that they had more than tripled the number of officers working on the case, announcing that 22 officers were working on the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ship |first=Chris |title=Police triple number of officers working on Westminster 'child sex abuse cover-up' claims |url= http://www.itv.com/news/2014-07-10/metropolitan-police-force-triples-number-of-officers-working-on-westminster-child-sex-abuse-cover-up-claims/ |work=ITV News |date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two men, a Catholic priest from Norwich, and a man understood to be connected to the Grafton Close children's home in Richmond, were arrested on suspicion of sexual offences and questioned by child investigation officers from Operation Fernbridge in February 2013.&lt;ref name="IndFeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCFeb13&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21349730 |title=Operation Fernbridge: Norfolk priest Tony McSweeney arrested |work=BBC News |date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third arrest, of a 69-year-old man, took place in July 2013.&lt;ref name=IndJul13&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/third-arrest-in-elm-guest-house-investigation-into-alleged-paedophile-ring-8697897.html |author=Davies, Margaret |title=Third arrest in Elm Guest House investigation into alleged paedophile ring |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |place=London |date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trial against Tony McSweeney, the Catholic priest, started at [[Southwark Crown Court]] in February 2015. However, John Stingemore, the man who formerly worked for Richmond Council, was found dead at his home in January 2015 whilst still awaiting trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Children's home boss facing historical sex abuse charges found dead |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11350212/Childrens-home-boss-facing-historical-sex-abuse-charges-found-dead.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McSweeney was later convicted of his charges and sentenced to prison.&lt;ref name="yewtomid"/&gt;

Although arrests from Operation Fernbridge did result in a conviction stemming from Grafton Close children's home, it did not expose abuse related to Elm Guest House.&lt;ref name="Midland"/&gt; After McSweeny's conviction, Operation Fernbridge was closed and investigations related to Elm Guest House were taken over by Operation Athabasca.&lt;ref name="yewtomid"/&gt;

===Operation Midland===
{{main|Operation Midland}}
Vishambar Mehrotra, the father of eight-year-old [[Death of Vishal Mehrotra|Vishal Mehrotra]] who disappeared in July 1981 said in November 2014 that he believed his son may have died at the hands of a paedophile ring involving high-profile individuals, and that he feared that the Metropolitan Police covered up links between his son's death and activities at Elm Guest House. Mehrotra went missing in [[Putney]], close to the Elm Guest House in Barnes. The upper half of his torso was subsequently found seven months later, buried in woodland in West Sussex.&lt;ref name=Laville2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Laville |first1=Sandra |last2=Halliday |first2=Josh |title=Paedophile ring allegations: police are failing us, murdered boy's father says |url= https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/19/paedophile-ring-allegations-elm-house |accessdate=18 December 2014 |work=The Guardian |place=London |date=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other investigations===
[[Operation Hydrant]] is a coordination hub which gathers information from other inquiries, including those described above. In May 2015, Operation Hydrant reported that  1,400 men, of which 261 were high-profile individuals, were being investigated over allegations of historical child abuse.&lt;ref name="yewtomid"/&gt;

Some of the men accused of being involved in abuse related to the Elm Guest House faced unrelated inquiries. Allegations regarding Jimmy Savile were investigated as part of [[Operation Yewtree]]. A report into his alleged offences, ''[[Giving Victims a Voice]]'', was released in January 2013. [[Greater Manchester Police]] investigated Cyril Smith as part of Operation Jaguar.&lt;ref name="yewtomid"/&gt; In 2014, The Metropolitan Police started Operation Cayacos, an investigation into historical claims of child abuse by a paedophile ring linked to [[Peter Righton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Child abuse investigations |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28194271 |accessdate=14 November 2014 |work=BBC News |date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Watson stated that files on Righton contained "clear intelligence of a widespread paedophile ring."&lt;ref name=IndDec12/&gt; [[Wiltshire Police]] launched Operation Conifer in 2015 to examine claims against Edward Heath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41503143 |title=  Sir Edward Heath 'would have been questioned' over abuse claims |publisher=BBC News |date=5 October 2017 |accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Convention on Extradition''' is a multilateral extradition treaty drawn in 1957 up by the member states of the [[Council of Europe]] and in force between all of them. The Convention is also available for signature by non-members which as of January 2012 are [[Israel]], [[South Africa]] and [[South Korea]]. Prior to the introduction of the [[European Arrest Warrant]], the Convention governed extradition between member states of the [[European Union]].

There are 4 additional protocols to the convention that vary the conditions signed up to by individual states.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/webContent/en_GB/7752573&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Federal Cases, circuit and district courts, 1789&amp;ndash;1880''''' (in [[case citation]]s, abbreviated '''F. Cas.''') was a [[law reports|reporter]] of cases decided by the [[United States]] [[United States district court|district]] and [[United States Circuit Court|circuit court]]s between 1789 and 1880, and is part of the [[National Reporter System]].

In 1880, [[West (publisher)|West Publishing Company]] began reporting decisions from all federal courts in the ''[[Federal Reporter]]'', and the ''Federal Reporter'' soon became established as the leading unofficial reporter for the federal circuit and district courts.  But federal decisions issued prior to 1880 had been previously published in a variety of separate reporters from several private entrepreneurs.  ''Federal Cases'', then, was West Publishing's attempt to collect and republish all federal decisions from 1789 to 1880 in a single reporter which would be part of its [[National Reporter System]], just like the ''Federal Reporter''.  That is, as with other NRS reporters, the cases included were annotated by West attorney-editors with "headnotes" summarizing their holdings, and the headnotes were then indexed for easy cross-referencing to similar cases through the [[West American Digest System]].  Republishing all those old cases within the NRS framework meant that subsequent generations of lawyers and judges would be able to resort solely to West reporters to access the entire extant universe of post-1789 federal case law.

''Federal Cases'' was published in 30 numbered volumes from 1894 to 1897.  Unlike the vast majority of reporters which publish cases in chronological order, the contents of ''Federal Cases'' were arranged in alphabetical order based on the first letter of each case title.  Each of the cases was assigned a sequential number by West.  The advantage of publishing in alphabetical order was that the cases published in ''Federal Cases'' would not have cited to each other based on their volume and page in a future reporter that did not yet exist; but case citations normally began (and still begin) with the case title, which would usually remain the same. The disadvantage of alphabetical order is that it makes sense only if ''all'' the cases to be included were gathered at the beginning.  In an era before modern computerized databases, errors were inevitable, with the result that volume 30 ran through Z, then started over again at A to include a few more cases (and other miscellaneous materials) omitted the first time around.

Of course, many of the cases published in ''Federal Cases'' cited other cases published in ''Federal Cases,'' but the original text of each opinion would have cited to the volumes and pages of the various reporters in which those cases had originally been published.  Since the entire point of the project was to supersede those old reporters, all cases published in ''Federal Cases'' were edited so that all such citations were replaced with citations to the appropriate ''Federal Cases'' case numbers.

At the end of the project, a 31st volume was subsequently published which contained only a digest and various tables (that is, a navigation guide to the content already published); thus, some law library catalogs show ''Federal Cases'' as consisting of 31 volumes.

'''French nationality law''' is historically based on the principles of ''[[jus soli]]'' (Latin for "right of soil"), according to [[Ernest Renan]]'s definition, in opposition to the [[Germany|German]] definition of nationality, ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (Latin for "right of blood"), formalised by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]].

The 1993 [[Pierre Méhaignerie|Méhaignerie]] Law required children born in [[France]] of foreign parents to request French nationality at adulthood, rather than being automatically accorded citizenship. This "manifestation of will" requirement was subsequently abrogated by the [[Élisabeth Guigou|Guigou]] Law of 1998,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/les-francais-etranger_1296/vos-droits-demarches_1395/nationalite-francaise_5301/index.html French Embassy] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but children born in France of foreign parents remain foreign until obtaining [[legal majority]].

Children born in France to tourists or other short-term visitors do not acquire French citizenship by virtue of birth in France: residency must be proven. Since immigration became increasingly a political theme in the 1980s, both left-wing and right-wing governments have issued several laws restricting the possibilities of being [[naturalization|naturalized]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==History==
French nationality and citizenship were concepts that existed even before the [[French Revolution]].

===19th Century===
There are three key dates in the legal history of naturalization:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Naturalization
!Year
!Event
|-
|1804
|[[Civil Code]], which allowed the possibility of naturalization.
|-
|1851
|third generation immigrants (those with one parent born on French soil) were allowed to naturalize.
|-
|1889
|second generation immigrants (those born on French soil) were allowed to naturalize once they reached the age of majority.
|}

====Third Republic====
Military service and state education were two processes central to the creation of a common national culture.  [[Conscription in France|Military conscription]] (universal from 1872, in theory if not in practice) brought inhabitants of the state's regions together for the first time, creating bonds of friendship and encouraging the use of French rather than regional languages. Universal education (the aim of the [[Jules Ferry Laws]], 1879–1886) brought the whole of the population into contact with state-sanctioned version of French history and identity.  State teachers, the "Black hussars of the Republic,"&lt;ref&gt;from Charles Péguy's L'Argent&lt;/ref&gt; conveyed the national language to the people of the regions.

==Acquisition of citizenship==
There are various ways a person can acquire French citizenship, either at birth or later on in life.

* The [[:wikt:attribute|attribution]] of French nationality can be due to [[Paternity (law)|filiation]]. (''[[Jus sanguinis]]'')
* The attribution of French nationality can be given by birth in [[France]] (''[[Jus soli]]'') if other requirements (such as residence in France) are also met.

===French citizenship by birth in metropolitan France and its overseas territories===
Children born in France (including overseas territories) to at least one parent who is also born in France automatically acquire French citizenship at birth (''double jus soli'').

A child born in France to foreign parents may acquire French citizenship:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Maarten P. |last=Vink |first2=Gerard René |last2=de Groot |url=http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/birthright_comparativepaper.pdf |title=Birthright Citizenship: Trends and Regulation in Europe |work=EUDO Citizenship Obvservatory |date=November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* at birth, if stateless.
* at 18, if resident in France with at least 5 years' residence since age 11.
* between 16 and 18 upon request by the child and if resident in France with at least 5 years' residence since age 11.
* between 13 and 16 upon request by the child's parents and if resident in France continuously since age 8.
* if born in [[France]] of parents born before independence in a colony/territory in the past under French sovereignty.
** at birth, if born in [[France]] before January 1, 1994.
** at age 18, if born in [[France]] on or after January 1, 1994.

A child who was born abroad and who has only one French parent can [[repudiate]] their French nationality during the six months prior to their reaching the age of majority, or in the year which follows it (article 19-4 of the Civil Code).

===French citizenship by birth abroad to at least one French citizen===
The child (legitimate or natural) is French if at least one parent is French.

In the case of an adoption, the child has French nationality only under the "full adoption" regime.

Parentage to the parent from whom the French nationality is claimed, must be established while the child is still a minor (under 18).

When the child is born abroad from a French parent, it is essential for the French parent to record the birth of the child in the French civil register. In the event of litigation or to establish definitive proof of French nationality (or request a French passport) French nationality may be established by petitioning for a French nationality certificate from the Tribunal d'Instance (local court) of the person's place of residence, or if residing abroad, via the French Nationality Office in Paris&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lannuaire.service-public.fr/gouvernement/administration-centrale-ou-ministere_168982|title=Bureau de la nationalité - Annuaire {{!}} service-public.fr|website=lannuaire.service-public.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; having jurisdiction over French persons residing abroad.

===French citizenship by birth in France===
The child (legitimate or natural) is French if born in France to at least one parent also born in France or French citizen.

Simply being born in France does not confer French nationality except in the case of a child born to unknown or stateless parents, or to aliens whose nationality is not transmitted to the child.

A child born in France before January 1, 1994, to a parent born in a former French overseas territory prior to its acquisition of independence, is automatically French. The same is true for a child born after 1 January 1963, to a parent born in Algeria before July 3, 1962.

===French citizenship by adoption===

[[Plenary adoption]] is the only act of filiation which carries direct effects on nationality. Unlike the process of [[simple adoption]], a child adopted according to the procedure of plenary adoption breaks any bond with his family of origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Civil Code of France]], Article 343&lt;/ref&gt;

Filiation must be established while the child is a [[minor (law)|minor]] to take effect. Consequently, the recognition of a child older than the [[age of majority]] has no effect on his or her nationality.&lt;!-- Missing reference --&gt;

===French citizenship by naturalization===
====Eligibility resulting from residency====
A person aged 18 or above may apply for French citizenship by [[naturalization]] after five years' habitual and continuous residence in France (if married and with children, then the applicant must be living in France with his/her family).&lt;ref&gt;Le code civil des Français, Article 21-17&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, it is required that the applicant has his/her primary source of income in France during the five-year period.  Those applying who are not [[European Union]], [[European Economic Area]] or [[Swiss]] nationals are required to be in possession of a "titre de séjour" (a residence permit).
* The residence period may be completely waived for those who have served in the French military, for refugees, or in other exceptional cases.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2213|title=Naturalisation|author=|date=|website=service-public.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The residence period can be reduced to two years for a person who has completed two years of [[higher education]] and successfully obtained a qualification in France or who has rendered exceptional service to France through his/her talents and abilities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The residence period is counted backwards from the date on which the applicant lodged his/her naturalization application.

The applicant must show that he/she has been residing legally in France during the 5 or 2 year residence period. Any periods of irregular residence in France ''before'' the 5 or 2 year residence period will not be taken into account when the application is considered. If the applicant's residence period is completely waived, he/she must have resided legally in France in the 2 years immediately preceding the date on which he/she lodged his/her naturalization application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/content/download/35929/271069/file/INTK1207286C.pdf|title=Circulaire INTK1207286C du 16 octobre 2012 relative aux procédures d’accès à la nationalité française|author=|date=|website=interieur.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalization will only be successful for those who are judged to have integrated into French society (i.e. by virtue of language skills and understanding of rights and responsibilities of a French citizen, to be demonstrated during an interview at the local prefecture, as well as an ability and/or potential to integrate in the labour market), and who respect the values of French society. The applicant must also be of good character (no criminal offences with a sentence of 6 months' imprisonment or more and no tax avoidance). In assessing the applicant's character, the decision reached must be proportionate (for example, a naturalization application should not be rejected solely because the applicant occasionally declared/paid taxes late).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circulaire.legifrance.gouv.fr/pdf/2013/06/cir_37168.pdf|title=Circulaire du 21 juin 2013 relative à l’accès à la nationalité française|author=|date=|website=legifrance.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalization through residency is accorded by publication of a decree in the Journal Officiel by decision of the Home Ministry and the prefecture of the region where the applicant has submitted his/her application.  There is an obligatory delay of 12 months from the date of submission before the applicant is notified of the result of his/her naturalisation application.

====Eligibility resulting from marriage to a French citizen====

The spouse of a French national can apply for nationality, and must be able to prove that they have been married for five years and live together, (four years if the couple can prove continuous residence in France for three years since the wedding, or if when living abroad, the French spouse has been registered as a French citizen living abroad (article 79 of law 2006-911 published in the JO of 25/07/2006).) The applicant must also have a good knowledge of the French language, spoken and written, and the couple must appear in person together to sign documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2726|title=Déclaration de nationalité française par mariage|author=|date=|website=service-public.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eligibility resulting from service in the French Foreign Legion====
Foreign nationals may apply for naturalization after three years of service in the [[French Foreign Legion]], a wing of the [[French Army]] that is open to men of any nationality. Furthermore, a soldier wounded in battle during Legion service may immediately apply for naturalization under the principle of "Français par le sang versé" ("French by spilled blood").&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/3546207/The-French-Foreign-Legion-the-last-option-for-those-desperate-to-escape-the-UK.html The French Foreign Legion – the last option for those desperate to escape the UK]."

==French citizenship and identity==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
According to the French Republic, the French people are those who are in possession of French nationality. According to the [[French Constitution]], "France shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic. It shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without distinction of origin, race or religion. It shall respect all beliefs. It shall be organised on a decentralised basis." [http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp Article 1]

Since the middle of the 19th century, France has exhibited a very high rate of immigration, mainly from Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Maghreb, Africa and Asia. According to a 2004 report by [[Institut national d'études démographiques|INED]] researcher Michèle Tribalat France has approximately 14 million persons (out of nearly 63 million, or approximately 22%) (see [[demographics of France]]) of foreign ascendancy (immigrants or with at least one parent or grandparent immigrant).

The absence of official statistics on French citizens of foreign origin is deliberate. Under French law passed after the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], it is forbidden to categorize people according to their ethnic origins. In France, like in many other European countries, censuses do not collect information on supposed ancestry. Moreover, all French [[statistics]] are forbidden to have any references concerning ethnic membership. Thus, the French government's assimilationist stance towards immigration as well as towards regional identities and cultures, together with the political heritage of the French Revolution has led to the development of a French identity which is based more on the notion of citizenship than on cultural, historical or ethnic ties.

For that reason, French identity must not necessarily be associated with the "ethnic [[French people]]" but can be associated with either a nationality and citizenship, or a culture and language-based group. The latter forms the basis for [[La Francophonie]], a group of French-speaking countries, or countries with historical and cultural association to France. The concept of "French ethnicity" exists outside France's borders, in particular in [[Quebec]] where some people claim membership to a "French ethnic group", but again many view it as not so much ethnicity-based as language-based and would also include immigrants from, for example, [[Lebanon]] and [[Haiti]]. France's particular self-perception means that French identity may include a naturalized, French-speaking ethnic Portuguese, Italian, Spaniard, Poles, Romanian, Lebanese, Vietnamese, Tunisian, Algerian or Moroccan. Nonetheless, like in other European countries, some level of discrimination occurs, and there are higher unemployment rates among job-seekers with foreign-sounding names.

===Rights and obligations of French citizens===
In modern France, in general, the rights are fundamentally the same as those in other EU countries.

Despite the official discourse of universality, French nationality has not meant automatic citizenship. Some categories of French people have been excluded, throughout the years, from full citizenship:
* [[Woman's suffrage|Women]]: Until the [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation]], they were deprived of the [[right to vote]]. The [[provisional government of the French Republic|provisional government]] of General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] accorded them this right by the April 21, 1944 prescription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite French law|number or usual name=n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 2000-493|date in French=6 juin 2000|full name=tendant à favoriser l'égal accès des femmes et des hommes aux mandats électoraux et fonctions électives|language=French|URL=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000400185&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French Army|Military]]: For a long time, the military was called the ''Grande muette'' ("The Big Mute") in reference to its prohibition against interfering in political life. During a large part of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940), the Army was in the main [[republicanism|anti-republican]] (and thus [[counterrevolutionary]]), the [[Dreyfus Affair]] and the [[Seize Mai|May 16, 1877 crisis]] that led to a [[monarchist]] ''[[coup d'état]]'' by [[Patrice Mac-Mahon, duc de Magenta|MacMahon]] being examples of this anti-republican spirit. That character of the military would make them gain the right to vote only after the August 17, 1945 prescription, the contribution of De Gaulle to the interior [[French Resistance]], which reconciled the Army with the Republic. Nevertheless, the members of the military do not benefit from all public liberties, as the July 13, 1972 law on the general statute of militaries specifies.
* Young people: The July 1974 law instituted at the instigation of president [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] reduced the coming of age to 18, which thus made some [[teenagers]] full citizens.
* [[Naturalization|Naturalized foreigners]]: Since January 9, 1973, foreigners who have acquired French nationality do not have to wait five years after their naturalization to be able to vote.
* [[French colonial empires|Inhabitants of the colonies]]: The May 7, 1946 law stated that soldiers from the "Empire" (such as the ''[[tirailleurs]]'') killed during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] were not citizens.&lt;ref name="Citizenship"&gt;{{Cite web | author=B. Villalba | title=Chapitre 2 - Les incertitudes de la citoyenneté | accessdate=2006-05-03|publisher=Catholic University of [[Lille]], Law Department | url=http://droit.univ-lille2.fr/enseignants/villalba/cours_PSC/Psc_chap_citoyen.html|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern citizenship is linked to [[civic participation]] (also called [[positive freedom]]), which includes voting, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], [[petition]]s, [[activism]], etc.

==Travel freedom of French citizens==
{{Main article|Visa requirements for French citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for French citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for French citizens]]]]

Visa requirements for French citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[France]]. As of May 2018, French citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 187 countries and territories, ranking the [[French passport]] 3rd in terms of travel freedom (tied with the Finnish, Italian, South Korean, Spanish, and Swedish passports) according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Henley Passport Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Passport Index 2018|url=https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/HPI2018/PI%202018%20INFOGRAPHS%20GLOBAL%20180518.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French nationality is ranked number one as of 2018 in [[The Quality of Nationality Index]] (QNI). The ranking is considering internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development and external factors such as travel freedom. France’s comparative advantage lies in its greater settlement freedom (attributable mainly to the country’s former colonial empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennysouthan/2018/04/26/worlds-top-nationalities-revealed-france-is-number-one-us-ranks-27/#b6a6b847d46f |title= World's Top Nationalities Revealed: France Is No. 1, U.S. Ranks 27 |date= 2018-04-26 |website=  www.forbes.com |access-date= 2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Dual citizenship==
[[Dual citizenship]] was officially recognized for both men and women on 9 January 1973; since then, possession of more than one nationality does not affect French nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=CEA531215A17EEE4DA549342CD06EE79.tpdila17v_1?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070721&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006419958&amp;dateTexte=20160531&amp;categorieLien=id#LEGIARTI000006419958|title=Loi n°93-933 of 23 July 1993|author=|date=|website=legifrance.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000684539&amp;dateTexte=20160531#LEGIARTI000006283718|title=Loi n° 73-42 of 9 January 1973|author=|date=|website=legifrance.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the period of 9 April 1954 until 8 January 1973, only French men younger than the age of 50 were permitted to have dual citizenship, while a woman lost her French citizenship upon the acquisition of a foreign citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jo_pdf.do?id=JORFTEXT000000864817|title=Fac-similé JO du 10/04/1954, page 03451 - Legifrance|author=|date=|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://eudo-citizenship.eu/docs/CountryReports/France.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; France later denounced Chapter I of the [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on the Reduction of Cases of Multiple Nationality and on Military Obligations in Cases of Multiple Nationality]] of May 6, 1963. The denunciation took effect March 5, 2009.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/les-francais-etranger_1296/vos-droits-demarches_1395/nationalite-francaise_5301/index.html|title=Services aux citoyens|author=|date=|website=France Diplomatie : : Ministère de l'Europe et des Affaires étrangères}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship of the European Union==
Because France forms part of the [[European Union]], French citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[France (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/france/index_en.htm | title=France | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no French embassy, French citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (UK), [[Barbados]] (UK), [[Belize]] (UK), [[Central African Republic]] (France), [[Comoros]] (France), [[Gambia]] (UK), [[Guyana]] (UK), [[Liberia]] (Germany), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (UK), [[San Marino]] (Italy), [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (Portugal), [[Solomon Islands]] (UK), [[Timor-Leste]] (Portugal), [[Vanuatu]] (France)&lt;/ref&gt; French citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in [[Treaties of the European Union|Article 21 of the EU Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Function of the European Union  (consolidated version)|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denaturalization==
According to [[Giorgio Agamben]], France was one of the first European countries to pass denaturalization laws, in 1915, with regard to naturalized citizens of "enemy" origins. Its example was followed by most European countries.

As early as July 1940, [[Vichy France]] set up a special Commission charged with reviewing the [[naturalization]]s granted since the 1927 reform of the nationality law. Between June 1940 and August 1944, 15,000 persons, mostly Jews, were denaturalized.&lt;ref&gt;François Masure, "''Etat et identité nationale. Un rapport ambigu à propos des naturalisés'', in ''Journal des anthropologues'', hors-série 2007, pp.39-49 (see p.48) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bureaucratic designation was instrumental in their [[internment camps in France|subsequent internment]] and murder.

==Previous law: Article 21-19(5º)==
In 2001, as [[Bill Clinton]] finished his second term as President of the U.S. (the legal limit of terms under the U.S. Constitution), a theory was published by CNN that he could claim citizenship of France and run for leadership there.&lt;ref name=NYtimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/10/opinion/bill-clinton-the-french-years.html|title=Bill Clinton: The French Years|first=Patrick|last=Weil|date=22 May 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The open-letter by historian [[Patrick Weil]] held that a little known "law, passed in 1961 [article 21-19(5º)], enables people from former French territories to apply for immediate naturalisation, bypassing the normal five-year residency requirement for would-be French citizens."&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|title=Goodbye White House...bonjour Paris?|date=January 17, 2001|publisher=CNN|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/france/01/17/clinton/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Clinton was born in Arkansas which had been part of French Louisiana before it was [[Louisiana Purchase|sold to the US]], it was held that he would qualify under this law. And as a naturalised French citizen, he could run in the French presidential election.

Clinton himself later repeated this claim in 2012 as an amusing thought when speaking to an interviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Clinton Has Figured Out How He Could Be President Again|author=Grace Wyler|date=September 26, 2012|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-bill-clinton-could-be-president-again-2012-9#ixzz2UWa3XxQL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton had always dismissed the idea, and at the time of his retelling of the story in 2012, unknown to him, the possibility had already ended. This was because article 21-19(5º) of the Code civil was repealed (by article 82 of law 2006-911) on July 25, 2006 under the direction of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], who was then Minister of the Interior. Since "Weil's article made this provision of the French nationality law notorious, the French parliament abolished it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sorry, Bill Clinton.

'''Gamesmanship''' is the use of dubious (although not technically illegal) methods to win or gain a serious advantage in a game or sport. It has been described as "Pushing the rules to the limit without getting caught, using whatever dubious methods possible to achieve the desired end".&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, Stoll and Beller, 1994:92&lt;/ref&gt; It may be inferred that the term derives from the idea of playing for the game (i.e., to win at any cost) as opposed to [[sportsmanship]], which derives from the idea of playing for sport. The term was popularized by [[Stephen Potter]]'s humorous 1947 book, ''The Theory and Practice of Gamesmanship (or the Art of Winning Games without Actually Cheating)''. It had, however, been used before by [[Ian Coster]] in his autobiographic book ''Friends in Aspic'', published in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Coster: ''Friends in Aspic'' (London 1939), pp. 49 and 64.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was attributed to [[Francis Meynell]].

==Alleged origins==
Potter cites the origin of gamesmanship to be a tennis match&lt;ref name="vqr"&gt;[http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1993/autumn/lowrey-timelessness/ "The Timelessness of Stephen Potter's Gamesmanship" by Burling Lowrey. ''Virginia Quarterly Review'' Autumn 1993 pp.718-726] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907172010/http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1993/autumn/lowrey-timelessness/ |date=2009-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he and the philosopher [[C. E. M. Joad]] competed against two younger and fitter men who were outplaying them fairly comfortably. On returning a serve, Joad hit the ball straight into the back-netting twelve feet behind the back-line. While the opponents were preparing for the next [[serve (tennis)|serve]], Joad 'called across the net, in an even tone: "Kindly state clearly, please, whether the ball was in or out"'.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Potter, ''The Theory &amp; Practice of Gamesmanship'' (London 1947) p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Being young, polite university students, their opponents offered to replay the point, but Joad declined. Because they were young and polite, the slight suggestion by Joad that their etiquette and sportsmanship were in question was extremely off-putting, and distracted them for the rest of the contest. Potter and Joad went on to win the match.

==Techniques==
Common techniques of gamesmanship include:
# Breaking the flow of an opponent's play (Potter insisted 'There is only one rule; BREAK THE FLOW.')&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;
# Causing an opponent to take the game less seriously or to overthink his or her position
# Intentionally making a "mistake" which gains an advantage over an opponent

While the first method is more common at higher levels of sports, the last two are more powerful in amateur games.

===Breaking the flow===
Examples of "flow-breaking" methods include:

* In [[darts]], a player intentionally taking a long time to take their darts out of the dartboard
* Feigning injury to delay the game, or reduce advertised ability. The skilled gamesman can counter this tactic by waiting until the game has been in play for some time, before revealing that he or she suffers from a far more serious condition, such as a [[heart disease|heart defect]]
* In [[billiards]] or [[snooker]], intentionally standing in the opponent's line of sight, and then suddenly moving when the opponent is about to shoot under the guise of getting out of their sight line. "More or less at the last moment, leaping into the correct position with exaggerated agility, and stand rigidly with head bowed."&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;
* Distracting the opposing player by complaining about other people who might be (but were not) distracting the opposing player. Potter, who always insisted that the good gamesman must give the appearance of being a good [[sportsmanship|sportsman]], recommended this approach. For example, if an opponent is about to take a shot at billiards, it is bad gamesmanship to fidget and whistle but good gamesmanship to distract him by loudly requesting silence from spectators: 'Simulate annoyance, ''on the opponent's behalf'', with the onlookers'.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
* When winning a point maintain direct eye contact with opponent, but when losing one always avoid direct eye contact.
* In [[cricket]], coming out to bat with two right-handed gloves and then wasting time sorting out the problem.
*In [[baseball]], a batter disrupting a [[pitcher]]'s flow by calling a time-out just before he delivers the pitch.
* When losing an outdoor game, feigning a deep, informed and more than amateur interest in e.g. [[botany]] or [[ornithology]], in order to convey a breadth of interests and suggest to the opponent that losing is not of concern.  This can cause the opponent to relax their attention, or at any rate rob them of the satisfaction of winning. Potter termed this 'the ''natural hampette''...See ''Gardens for Gamesmen'', or ''When to be Fond of Flowers''(15s.)'.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;
* In amateur [[ice hockey]], intentionally [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing the puck]], lining up at the wrong face-off dot, or shooting the puck over the glass (in professional hockey, the team that ices the puck is not allowed a line change, while shooting the puck over the glass leads to a two-minute penalty).
* In [[tennis]] (when serving) taking a long time between serves and making the receiver wait.
* In rugby league:
** Taking too long to pack down in a scrum, thus wasting time;
** Taking too long to take to the field before a match or after half-time, thus forcing the opposition team to wait for a prolonged period before the match starts or resumes.
* In [[American football]], calling a time out the instant before a game-winning or game-tying [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]] or [[Point after touchdown|PAT]] to break the normal flow of play. This is known as [[Icing the kicker|"icing" or "freezing" the kicker]].

===Causing the opponent to overthink===
Examples of methods designed to cause the opponent to overthink or to not take the game seriously enough include:

* Giving intentionally vague advice in the hope of making the opponent focus on his play. In such "Advicemanship", 'the advice ''must be vague'', to make certain it is not helpful', although Potter also noted that 'according to some authorities the advice should be quite genuine and perfectly practical'.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 45 and 123&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asking one's opponent's advice for a (fictitious) match the following day, against an implied stronger opponent.
* Claiming that the game being played "just isn't my sport", or claiming less expertise than the player actually possesses (a mild form of [[hustling]]).
* In [[American football]], the very common practice of taking one or more timeouts to give an opposing kicker an excessive amount of time to think about a critical kick; most often a field goal or extra point but sometimes a potential on-side kick.  The intent is to cause the kicker to get overly stressed about making a mistake and hopefully create a self-fulfilling prophecy.  This is commonly referred to as "[[icing the kicker]]." A common variant of this strategy is to attempt to call the timeout right before the ball is snapped, so that there is not enough time to stop the play and the opposing kicker has to attempt the same kick twice.
* "Icing" is also used, albeit less frequently, in [[basketball]].  In late-game situations with a player shooting free throws, it is not uncommon for the opposing team to take a timeout.  This is commonly referred to as "icing the shooter".
* The converse approach, suggesting a level of expertise far higher than the player actually possesses, can also be effective.  For example, although gamesmanship frowns on simple distractions like whistling loudly while an opponent takes a shot, it is good gamesmanship to do so when taking a shot oneself, suggesting as it does a level of carefree detachment which the opponent does not possess.

===Other===
*If the players personally know and/or have experience with each other, lies and other conversation topics can be used.  In [[wrestling]] or many combat sports, it could be targeting a limb which the opponent has been carrying an injury.

===Intentional "mistakes"===
Examples of intentional "mistakes" designed to gain an advantage:

* In [[contract bridge|bridge]], intentionally misdealing and then engaging in chaotic bidding, knowing that the hand will be void anyway, in the hope that 'opponents will…be unable to form a working judgement of the opponents' bidding form'.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[poker]], intentionally raising out of turn, to induce players to give a free card.
* In [[baseball]], intentionally dropping a caught ball, to create a [[force play]] on the baserunners (hence the [[infield fly rule]]).

All of the above are considered very close to [[cheating]], and the abuser of gamesmanship techniques will find himself penalized in most serious sports and games tournaments, as well as being deemed (if caught) a "bad sport".

The rules of the [[International Defensive Pistol Association]] for its [[practical shooting]] matches specifically state that any illegal action taken with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage is penalized as a "[[International Defensive Pistol Association#Failure to Do Right|Failure to Do Right]]", adding 20&amp;nbsp;seconds to the competitor's time. This penalty is rarely given, partly because of its highly subjective nature.

== Association football ==
In [[association football]], it is considered good sportsmanship to kick the ball out of play if a player on the opposing side is injured; when the ball is to be thrown in, it is also considered to be good sportsmanship in this situation to kick it (or throw it) back to the other team who had intentionally kicked it out. Gamesmanship arises in this situation when, rather than passing the ball back to the side who kicked the ball out, the injured player's teammates keep the ball after the throw-in. Whilst not illegal or against the rules of the sport, it is heavily frowned upon.

A high-profile example occurred during the game [[Battle of Nuremberg (association football)|Portugal vs. Netherlands]] in round 16 of [[FIFA World Cup 2006]], where the game, already marred by numerous cautions and even  red cards, further deteriorated because of such an incident. Also, in a 1999 English [[FA Cup]] fifth round tie between [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], Arsenal's winning goal scored under these circumstances was so contentious the Arsenal manager [[Arsène Wenger]] offered to replay the match. Sheffield United accepted, though Arsenal went on to win the second game by the same margin, 2-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/ars-ne-wenger-offers-fa-cup-rematch |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |accessdate=10 October 2012 |title= Arsene Wenger offers FA Cup rematch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feigning injury to cause the ball to be kicked out is another example of gamesmanship intended to break the flow of play, though if detected, it may be regarded as ungentlemanly conduct, which is a breach of the laws and hence is no longer gamesmanship. In response to claims of feigned injuries during the 2006 World Cup, the Premier League has asked players, managers and referees to end the custom as of the 06/07 season, instead preferring a referee alone to determine whether a break in play is needed.

When a free kick is awarded, members of the defending team will often pick up the ball and drop it back behind them as they retreat. Whilst not throwing the ball away, which would be an infringement, the purpose is to prevent a swiftly taken free kick.

==Usage outside of games==
The term "gamesmanship" is also used for similar techniques used in non-game situations, such as [[negotiation]]s and [[election]]s.

Each form is frequently used as a means of describing dubious methods of winning and/or psychological tricks used to intimidate or confuse one's opponent. Technically speaking, these tactics are [[one-upmanship]], defined in a later book by Potter as the art of being one-up on somebody else.

The term also appears in art theory to mean playfulness, as in "literary gamesmanship".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/ugresicd/jaws.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcsweeneys.net/authorpages/eggers/eggers15.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==The gamesman versus the pure player==

Potter's double-edged ironies did not spare the gamesman himself (he slyly named one prominent protagonist 'Bzo, U., holder (1947) Yugo-Slav Gamesmanship Championship',&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; for example). Potter acknowledged repeatedly that 'the way of the gamesman is hard, his training strict, his progress slow, his disappointments many', and recognised that as a result 'the assiduous student of gamesmanship has little time for the ''minutiae'' of the game itself - little opportunity for learning how to play the shots, for instance'.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 51 and p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Yet one of his "correspondents" owlishly admits, 'there is no doubt that a knowledge of the game itself sometimes helps the gamesman'.&lt;ref name="Potter, p. 117"&gt;Potter, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence 'perhaps the most difficult type for the gamesman to play is the man who indulges in pure play. He gets down to it, he gets on with it, he plays each shot according to its merits, and his own powers, without a trace of exhibitionism, and no by-play whatever'.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The book gloomily concludes, 'we amateurs have to fight against the growing menace of young people who insist on playing their various games for the fun of the thing...indulging rather too freely, if the truth were known, in pure play'.&lt;ref name="Potter, p. 117"/&gt;

The '''Gandhi Ashram Trust''' (GAT), also called the '''Ambika-Kaliganga Charitable Trust''', is a [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] and development organization working in [[Noakhali]] since 1946 with [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]an philosophy of [[rural development]].&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{cite book

Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's visit in 1947 to Noakhali, it has applied the Gandhian philosophy of rural development, [[peace]] and social harmony to uplift living conditions of the rural poor, especially women, in that area. It has a two-pronged approach to developmental and [[Charity (practice)|charitable]] activities.

Initially set up by the original owner of the premises (Barrister Hemanta Kumar Ghose) that were subsequently gifted to GAT, the [[Ambika Kaliganga Charitable Trust]] had carried out charitable functions and started working for the 1946 [[Direct Action Day#Noakhali massacre|riot]] victims of Noakhali. Under [[Pakistan]]i rule, the Trust could not continue its activities due to the policies of the then government.

After the independence of [[Bangladesh]] in 1971, with the emergence of the Gandhi Ashram Trust in 1975, there was a shift in the vision and mission of the Trust. Development and extension services for the poor and disadvantaged were taken along with charitable functions. Currently, the main focus of Gandhi Ashram Trust is the development of better standards of living, both material and eternal.

It is working at the 5 district in Southern part of Bangladesh. Peace promotion, Human Development, Human Rights and Good Governance, Handicrafts promotion, Education, etc. are the main activities of the Organisation.

The '''Generalized Scheme of Preferences''', or '''GSP''', is a preferential tariff system which provides for a formal system of exemption from the more general rules of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), (formerly, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] or GATT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Vivian C.|title=Generalized System of Preferences: Overview and Issues for Congress|date=November 14, 2017|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33663.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it is a system of exemptions from the [[most favored nation]] principle (MFN) that obliges WTO member countries to treat the imports of all other WTO member countries no worse than they treat the imports of their "most favored" trading partner. In essence, MFN requires WTO member countries to treat imports coming from all other WTO member countries equally, that is, by imposing equal tariffs on them.

GSP exempts WTO member countries from MFN for the purpose of lowering tariffs for the least developed countries, without also lowering tariffs for rich countries. 

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
The idea of tariff preferences for developing countries was the subject of considerable discussion within the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) in the 1960s. Among other concerns, developing countries claimed that MFN was creating a disincentive for richer countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and other trade restrictions with enough speed to benefit developing countries.

In 1971, the GATT followed the lead of UNCTAD and enacted two waivers to the MFN that permitted tariff preferences to be granted to developing country goods. Both these waivers were limited in time to ten years. In 1979, the GATT established a permanent exemption to the MFN obligation by way of the [[enabling clause]]. This exemption allowed contracting parties to the GATT (the equivalent of today's WTO members) to establish systems of trade preferences for other countries, with the caveat that these systems had to be "generalized, non-discriminatory and non-reciprocal' with respect to the countries they benefited (so-called "beneficiary" countries).  Countries were not supposed to set up GSP programs that benefited just a few of their "friends.'

==Effects==

From the perspective of developing countries as a group, GSP programs have been a mixed success. On one hand, most rich countries have complied with the obligation to generalize their programs by offering benefits to a large swath of beneficiaries, generally including nearly every non-OECD member state. Certainly, every GSP program imposes some restrictions. The United States, for instance, has excluded countries from GSP coverage for reasons such as being communist ([[Vietnam]]), being placed on the U.S. State Department's list of countries that support terrorism ([[Libya]]), and failing to respect U.S. intellectual property laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cablesearch.org/cable/view.php?id=06BRASILIA1859&amp;hl=copyright |title=2006 Wikileaks leaked cable from US Ambassador Sobel in Brasilia to WHA Assistant Secretary Shannon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718214956/http://cablesearch.org/cable/view.php?id=06BRASILIA1859&amp;hl=copyright |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism has been leveled noting that most GSP programs are not completely generalized with respect to products, and this is by design. That is, they don't cover products of greatest export interest to low-income developing countries lacking natural resources. In the United States and many other rich countries, domestic producers of "simple" manufactured goods, such as textiles, leather goods, ceramics, glass and steel, have long claimed that they could not compete with large quantities of imports. Thus, such products have been categorically excluded from GSP coverage under the U.S. and many other GSP programs. Critics assert that these excluded products are precisely the kinds of manufactures that most developing countries are able to export, the argument being that  developing countries may not be able to efficiently produce things like locomotives or telecommunications satellites, but they can make shirts.

Supporters note that even in the face of its limitations, it would not be accurate to conclude that GSP has failed to benefit developing countries, though some concede GSP has benefited developing countries unevenly. Some assert that, for most of its history, GSP has benefited "richer developing" countries - in early years Mexico, [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], and [[Malaysia]],  more recently Brazil and India - while providing virtually no assistance to the world's least developed countries, such as [[Haiti]], [[Nepal]], and most countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].  The U.S., however, has closed some of these gaps through supplemental preference programs like the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]] and a newer program for Haiti, and Europe has done the same with [[Everything But Arms]].

The '''Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms''', also known as the '''Geneva Phonograms Convention''', is a 1971 international agreement relating to [[copyright]] protection for sound recordings.

==Legal context==

By the mid-1950s, the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]], the [[Buenos Aires Convention]] and [[Universal Copyright Convention]] granted strong rights to creators of printed or artistic content – and also to composers and performers of music – in most first world countries. The publisher of a book could prosecute a maker of unauthorized copies even if they operated in a different country. But there was no equivalent protection for sound recordings.&lt;ref name="Baskerville"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baskerville|first=David|title=Music business handbook and career guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZxhW5ELHzoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=SAGE|isbn=1-4129-0438-2|pages=542-546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1961 [[Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations|Rome Convention]] for the first time granted international recognition for copyright in sound recordings. Now music labels were recognized as having a copyright interest in the recording itself, separately from the composer and performer. This gave them standing to prosecute makers of unauthorized copies of their tapes or records in other countries.&lt;ref name="Baskerville" /&gt;

==Technological context==

In the mid-1960s music labels began producing pre-recorded [[compact cassette]]s, a technology developed in the late 1950s which offered relatively compact players and space-efficient storage compared to vinyl records. It was also very much cheaper and simpler to make unauthorized copies compared to vinyl records. By the late 1960s copyright infringement and counterfeiting of these recordings had become common, and the music industry lobbied for a new international treaty which would give them additional powers to combat copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="Baskerville" /&gt;

==The 1971 convention==
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}

The 1971 convention granted record producers the international right to block imports of counterfeit music recordings, and to take action against distributors and retailers who sold them.

==Specific requirement for protection==
Unlike the Berne Convention, which does not require formalities to obtain protection, the Geneva Phonograms convention does provide one formality. To secure protection under this convention, copies of the sound recording must carry [[Sound recording copyright symbol|a copyright notice, one exclusively for sound recordings]]. The notice consists of the phonogram copyright symbol, "℗" which is the upper case letter "P"  in a circle, the year of publication, and the copyright owner's name. In this way, the Geneva Phonograms Convention is similar to the notice requirement of the [[Universal Copyright Convention]].

== History ==
Ghana became the next country to have internet in the Sub Sahara. Internet services began in Ghana in 1995.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/it/history.php|title=History of Internet in Ghana|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was made possible through the collaborations between  Network Computer Systems (NCS), Pipex International, The [[Ministry of Transport and Communication of Ghana]], Ghana Telecom, and British Telecom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isoc.org/inet96/proceedings/g6/g6_4.htm|title=Development of the Internet in Ghana|website=www.isoc.org|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCS had registered ghana.com domain in 1993.

== Wireless internet ==
Ghana has over 15 internet service providers who mostly provide different forms of internet services. Most of these [[ISPs]] provide wireless internet. And these include all the telcos in Ghana.

== Internet speed ==
According to bandwithplace, Ghana's internet speed hovers around an average of 1.46 Mbps uploads across most of the internet enabled devices tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bandwidthplace.com/location/ghana/|title=Ghana Internet Speed {{!}} Average Speed Test Results {{!}} Top Cities, Devices, Trends|work=Bandwidth Place|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet accessibility ==
There are over 7.9 million internet users in Ghana who mostly access the internet from mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/ghana/|title=Ghana Internet Users|website=www.internetlivestats.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery widths="180" heights="180"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Internet service providers ==
There are a number of ISPs in Ghana, apart from the major telecommunication companies like [[MTN Ghana]], [[Vodafone Ghana]], [[Airtel Africa]], [[Millicom]] and [[Globacom]] there are other companies like Africaonline, ADTech IT,Blue Cloud Network which also provide internet services. There is also Busyinternet and Surfline which offers wireless internet services through their omternet enabled devices.Internet closure during elections

== Net neutrality ==
As it stands now, Ghana does not have any provisions on net neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mfidie.com/net-neutrality-ghana/|title=There has never been Net Neutrality in Ghana! There may never be!|date=2017-12-18|work=Mfidie.com|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has raised concerns and brought together netizens and tech firms to protest for this provision in Ghana&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citifmonline.com/2017/07/12/tech-firms-unite-for-net-neutrality-protest/|title=Tech firms unite for 'net neutrality' protest - citifmonline.com|date=2017-07-12|work=citifmonline.com|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenewghana.com/2017/12/18/there-has-never-been-net-neutrality-in-ghana-there-may-never-be/|title=There has never been Net Neutrality in Ghana! There may never be! - The New Ghana|date=2017-12-18|work=The New Ghana|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghana has however faced a net neutrality crisis in the past. This was as a result of the NCA wanting to ban sites like [[Skype]],[[WhatsApp|Whatsapp]],[[Viber]] and other internet based instant mesaaging platforms with the excuse of they causing losses to telcos in Ghana.This campaign was led by telecommunication giant MTN which complained of losses due to peoples continuous use of these platfroms which reduced the number of calls. This brought a huge debate and in the end this never happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/business/2016/May-10th/nca-to-consider-proposals-to-ban-whatsapp-skype-viber-calls.php|title=NCA receives proposals to restrict WhatsApp, Skype, Viber calls|date=2016-05-10|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NCA reacted to this that their press statement was take out of context and the said bad was not going to happen anytime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citifmonline.com/2016/05/11/nca-denies-reports-on-banning-whatsapp-skype-calls/|title=NCA denies reports on banning Whatsapp, skype calls - citifmonline.com|date=2016-05-11|work=citifmonline.com|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet censorship ==
There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet [[chat rooms]] without judicial oversight. Individuals and groups engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Ghana-2012&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204126 "Ghana"], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 25 March 2013. Retrieved 14 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the constitution and law provide for [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|press]], the government sometimes restricts those rights. The police arbitrarily arrest and detain journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154349.htm|title=Ghana|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journalists practice [[self-censorship]]. The constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government respects these prohibitions in practice.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Ghana-2012/&gt;

In 2002 the government of Ghana censored Internet media coverage of tribal violence in Northern Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ghana Internet Censorship 2008| date= 15 December 2008|publisher=NIBII|url=http://www.nibii.com/articlesghanacensorship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet shutdown during elections===
During the heat of the 2016 election year, there were rumors that the Inspector General of Ghana Police wanted to shut down access to internet. The civil society organizations came out to condemn the intended shutting down of the internet and proferred solutions like tracking of the internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2016/12/06/ghana-stands-to-lose-if-internet-is-shut-down-on-election-day//|title=Ghana stands to lose if internet is shut down on election day {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The then President [[John Mahama]] came out to state that the internet won't be shut down on the day of elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.accessnow.org/president-ghana-says-no-internet-shutdown-elections-social-media/|title=Victory!

== Cyber Fraud ==
Cyber fraud has been a major issue in Ghana like most developing countries in the world. A Kenyan IT firm report that Ghana lost over $50 million due to cyber fraud this was projected to increase to around $100 million in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citifmonline.com/2018/02/26/cyber-crime-cost-ghana-100m-2018/|title=Cyber-crime to cost Ghana $100m in 2018 - citifmonline.com|date=2018-02-26|work=citifmonline.com|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several people both Ghanaians and foreigners have also been arrested in crimes relating to cyber fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citifmonline.com/2018/03/03/22-nigerians-one-ghanaian-arrested-for-cyber-crime/|title=22 Nigerians, one Ghanaian arrested for cyber-crime - citifmonline.com|date=2018-03-03|work=citifmonline.com|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; I Notable among these crimes is the [[sim box fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/703318/10-facts-about-sim-box-fraud-in-ghana.html|title=10 Facts About SIM Box Fraud In Ghana|work=Modern Ghana|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/opinion/2014/September-4th/the-simbox-fraud-debate.php|title=The SIMbox Fraud Debate - MyJoyOnline.com|website=www.myjoyonline.com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myjoyonline.com/business/2016/April-7th/afriwave-cracks-down-on-sim-box-fraud-detects-300000-numbers-so-far.php|title=Afriwave cracks down on SIM-Box fraud, detects 300,000 numbers so far - MyJoyOnline.com|website=www.myjoyonline.com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 he National Cyber Security Week was held in Ghana to bring stakeholders together to help address issues of cyber security and cyber fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moc.gov.gh/national-cyber-security-week-2017-%E2%80%9Csecuring-ghana%E2%80%99s-digital-journey%E2%80%9D|title=National Cyber Security Week 2017 “Securing Ghana’s Digital Journey”. {{!}} Ministry of Communications|website=www.moc.gov.gh|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet laws in Ghana ==

'''Google Chrome''' (commonly known simply as '''Chrome''') is a [[freeware]] [[web browser]] developed by [[Google LLC]].&lt;ref name=TOS/&gt; It was first released on September 2, 2008 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and was later [[ported]] to [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. Google Chrome is also the main component of [[Chrome OS]], where it serves as a platform for running [[web app]]s.

Google releases the majority of Chrome's source code as the [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] [[Open-source software|open-source]] project;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Paul |title=Google unveils Chrome source code and Linux port |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/09/google-unveils-chrome-source-code-and-linux-port/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=September 2, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Chromium|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/welcome-to-chromium_02.html|work=blog.chromium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Chrome itself is proprietary software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.en.html#ChromeOS|title=Explaining Why We Don't Endorse Other Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=gnu.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07|quote="The central part of Chrome OS is the nonfree Chrome browser."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TOS" /&gt; One component that is not open-source is the built-in [[Adobe Flash Player]] (that Chrome has disabled by default since September 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anthony |last=LaForge |title=Flash and Chrome |url=https://blog.google/products/chrome/flash-and-chrome/ |website=The Keyword Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Chrome used the [[WebKit]] [[Browser engine|layout engine]] until version 27. As of version 28, all Chrome ports except the iOS port use [[Blink (web engine)|Blink]], a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the WebKit engine.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Bright |title=Google going its own way, forking WebKit rendering engine |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/google-going-its-own-way-forking-webkit-rendering-engine/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=April 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Emil |last=Protalinski |title=It’s here: Google replaces WebKit version ID with Blink in latest Chrome build |url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2013/04/08/its-here-google-replaces-webkit-with-blink-in-latest-build-of-chrome/ |website=The Next Web |date=April 8, 2013 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brucelawson-hello-blink"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hello Blink|url=http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2013/hello-blink/|work=Bruce Lawson's Blog|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|History of Google}}

Google CEO [[Eric Schmidt]] opposed the development of an independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at the time, Google was a small company," and he did not want to go through "bruising [[browser wars]]." After co-founders [[Sergey Brin]] and [[Larry Page]] hired several [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]] developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Angwin |first=Julia |date=July 9, 2009 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/07/09/sun-valley-schmidt-didnt-want-to-build-chrome-initially-he-says/ |title=Sun Valley: Schmidt Didn't Want to Build Chrome Initially, He Says |work=WSJ Digits Blog |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2004, rumors of Google building a web browser first appeared. Online journals and U.S. newspapers stated at the time that Google was hiring former Microsoft web developers among others. It also came shortly after the final 1.0 release of Mozilla Firefox, which was surging in popularity and taking market share from [[Internet Explorer]], which was suffering from major security problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3680942.stm |title=Rumours surround Google browser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release announcement was originally scheduled for September 3, 2008, and a comic by [[Scott McCloud]] was to be sent to journalists and bloggers explaining the features within the new browser.&lt;ref name="mccloud"&gt;{{cite web |last=McCloud |first=Scott |date=September 1, 2008 |url=http://smccloud.livejournal.com/15488.html |title=Surprise! |work=[[Google Blogoscoped]] |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies intended for Europe were shipped early and [[Germany|German]] blogger [[Philipp Lenssen]] of [[Google Blogoscoped]]&lt;ref name="lenssen"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lenssen |first=Philipp |date=September 1, 2008 |title=Google Chrome, Google's Browser Project |url=http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-09-01-n47.html |accessdate=September 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; made a scanned copy of the 38-page comic available on his website after receiving it on September 1, 2008.&lt;ref name="comic"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lenssen |first=Philipp |date=September 1, 2008 |title=Google on Google Chrome – comic book |url=http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/ |work=[[Google Blogoscoped]] |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google subsequently made the comic available on [[Google Books]]&lt;ref name="chrome-comic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/|title=Google Chrome comic|work=[[Google Book Search]]|date=September 1, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mentioned it on their official blog along with an explanation for the early release.&lt;ref name="releasedate" /&gt; The product was allegedly named "Chrome" because Google wanted to minimize the chrome of the browser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/bits/2015/07/12/sundar-pichai-of-google-talks-about-phone-intrusion/|title = Sundar Pichai of Google Talks About Phone Intrusion|accessdate = July 13, 2015|last = Dougerty|first = Conor|date = July 12, 2015| work = [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this meaning was added somewhat post-hoc, the [[code name]] before release apparently chosen from a connotation of speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewindowsclub.com/google-chrome-reason-revealed|title=Google Chrome - The reason behind its name revealed!|work=The Windows Club|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public release ===
[[File:File-Chromium-Linux-Alpha.png|thumb|An early version of Chromium for Linux, explaining the difference between Chrome and Chromium]]

The browser was first publicly released on September 2, 2008 for [[Windows XP]] and later, with 43 supported languages, officially a [[beta version]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doeswhat.com/2008/09/02/it-was-when-not-if-google-chrome/ |title=It was when not if... Google Chrome |date=September 2008 |access-date=June 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208060704/http://doeswhat.com/2008/09/02/it-was-when-not-if-google-chrome/ |archive-date=December 8, 2016 |dead-url=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a stable public release on December 11, 2008.

On the same day, a [[CNET]] news item&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ina |last=Fried |title=Be sure to read Chrome's fine print |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/be-sure-to-read-chromes-fine-print/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=October 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew attention to a passage in the Terms of Service statement for the initial beta release, which seemed to grant to Google a license to all content transferred via the Chrome browser. This passage was inherited from the general Google terms of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/ |title=Google Terms of Service – Policies &amp; Principles – Google |website=Google.com |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google responded to this criticism immediately by stating that the language used was borrowed from other products, and removed this passage from the Terms of Service.&lt;ref name=TOS/&gt;

Chrome quickly gained about 1% usage share.&lt;ref name="releasedate"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Sundar |last1=Pichai |first2=Linus |last2=Upson |title=A fresh take on the browser |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html |website=Official Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=September 1, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rafe |last=Needleman |title=Google Chrome update: First screenshot, and live-blog alert |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-chrome-update-first-screenshot-and-live-blog-alert/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 2, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/09/01/google-browser.html |title=Google launches Chrome web browser |date=September 2, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Canadian Press |accessdate=September 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doeswhat.com/2008/11/22/come-on-google-chrome-for-mac/ |title=Come on Google...

It then started rising again and by December 2008, Chrome again passed the 1% threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Wolfgang |last=Gruener |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/40575/113/ |title=Google Chrome crosses 1% market share again |publisher=TG Daily |location=Chicago (IL), United States |date=January 3, 2009 |accessdate=July 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310161357/http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/40575/113 |archivedate=March 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2009, CNET reported that Google planned to release versions of Chrome for [[macOS|OS X]] and [[Linux]] in the first half of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Shankland |title=Chrome gets Mac deadline, extensions foundation |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/chrome-gets-mac-deadline-extensions-foundation/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=January 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official Chrome OS X and Linux developer previews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel |title=Early Access Release Channels |website=dev.chromium.org |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; were announced on June 4, 2009, with a blog post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.chromium.org/2009/06/danger-mac-and-linux-builds-available.html |title=Danger: Mac and Linux builds available |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying they were missing many features and were intended for early feedback rather than general use.

In December 2009, Google released beta versions of Chrome for OS X and Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Larson |title=Beta Update: Linux, Mac, and Windows |url=https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2009/12/beta-update-linux-mac-and-windows.html |website=Chrome Releases |publisher=[[Google]] |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Extensions beta"&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Rakowski |title=Google Chrome for the holidays: Mac, Linux and extensions in beta |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2009/12/google-chrome-for-holidays-mac-linux.html |website=Official Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Chrome 5.0, announced on May 25, 2010, was the first stable release to support all three platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Rakowski |title=A new Chrome stable release: Welcome, Mac and Linux! |url=https://chrome.googleblog.com/2010/05/new-chrome-stable-release-welcome-mac.html |website=Chrome Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrome was one of the [[BrowserChoice.eu|twelve browsers]] offered to [[European Economic Area]] users of Microsoft Windows in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8537763.stm |title= Microsoft offers browser choices to Europeans |work=BBC News |date= March 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
Chrome was assembled from 25 different code libraries from Google and third parties such as [[Mozilla]]'s [[Netscape Portable Runtime]], [[Network Security Services]], [[NPAPI]] (dropped as of version 45),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation|title=NPAPI deprecation: developer guide - The Chromium Projects|work=chromium.org|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skia Graphics Engine]], [[SQLite]], and a number of other open-source projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://catonmat.net/blog/code-reuse-in-google-chrome-browser/ |title= Code reuse in Google Chrome Browser |last=Krumins |first=Peteris |date= September 5, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[V8 (JavaScript engine)|V8]] [[JavaScript]] [[virtual machine]] was considered a sufficiently important project to be split off (as was [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]/[[Mozilla]]'s [[Tamarin (JavaScript engine)|Tamarin]]) and handled by a separate team in Denmark coordinated by [[Lars Bak (computer programmer)|Lars Bak]] at [[Aarhus]]. According to Google, existing implementations were designed "for small programs, where the performance and interactivity of the system weren't that important", but [[web application]]s such as [[Gmail]] "are using the web browser to the fullest when it comes to [[Document Object Model|DOM]] manipulations and [[JavaScript]]", and therefore would significantly benefit from a JavaScript engine that could work faster.

Chrome initially used the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages. In 2013, they [[Fork (software development)|forked]] the WebCore component to create their own layout engine [[Blink (web engine)|Blink]]. Based on WebKit, Blink only uses WebKit's "WebCore" components, while substituting other components, such as its own multi-process architecture, in place of WebKit's native implementation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Chrome is internally tested with [[unit testing]], "automated user interface testing of scripted user actions", [[fuzz testing]], as well as WebKit's layout tests (99% of which Chrome is claimed to have passed), and against commonly accessed websites inside the Google index within 20–30 minutes.&lt;ref name="chrome-comic" /&gt;

Google created [[Gears (software)|Gears]] for Chrome, which added features for [[web developer]]s typically relating to the building of web applications, including offline support.&lt;ref name="chrome-comic" /&gt; Google phased out Gears as the same functionality became available in the [[HTML5]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/hello-html5.html |title= Hello HTML5 |publisher=Google |last=Fette |first=Ian |date= February 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2011, the Chrome product manager, Mike Jazayeri, announced that Chrome would remove [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264 video codec]] support for its HTML5 player, citing the desire to bring Google Chrome more in line with the currently available open codecs available in the Chromium project, which Chrome is based on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html |title=HTML Video Codec Support in Chrome |website=blog.chromium.org |date=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, on November 6, 2012, Google released a version of Chrome on Windows which added [[Hardware acceleration|hardware-accelerated]] H.264 video decoding.&lt;ref name="November 2012 announcements"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ami |last=Fischmann |title=Longer battery life and easier website permissions |url=https://chrome.googleblog.com/2012/11/longer-battery-life-and-easier-website.html |website=Chrome Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=November 6, 2012 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, [[Cisco]] announced that it was open-sourcing its H.264 codecs and will cover all fees required.&lt;ref name="Cisco30Oct13"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.cisco.com/collaboration/open-source-h-264-removes-barriers-webrtc|title = Open-Sourced H.264 Removes Barriers to WebRTC |accessdate = December 22, 2013|last = Trollope|first = Rowan|date = December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 2012, Google launched ''Google Chrome Beta'' for [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|Android 4.0]] devices.&lt;ref name="engadget"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/02/07/google-chrome-browser-arrives-on-android-video/ | title=Google Chrome Beta arrives on Android | work=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] | accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On many new devices with [[Android Jelly Bean|Android 4.1]] and later preinstalled, Chrome is the default browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muktware.com/3779/chrome-out-beta-default-browser-android-41|title=Chrome Out Of Beta, Default Browser Of Android 4.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Google announced a version of Chrome for [[augmented reality]] and [[virtual reality]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/chrome-is-coming-to-augmented-reality-and-google-daydream/|title=Chrome is coming to augmented reality and Google Daydream |first=Lucas|last=Matney|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Version history ===
{{Main|Google Chrome version history}}

== Features ==
Google Chrome features a minimalistic user interface, with its user-interface principles later being implemented into other browsers. For example, the merging of the [[address bar]] and search bar into the ''omnibox''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rafe |last=Needleman |title=The future of the Firefox address bar |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-future-of-the-firefox-address-bar/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrome also has a reputation for strong browser performance.&lt;ref name="CNET speed test"&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Shankland |title=Speed test: Google Chrome beats Firefox, IE, Safari |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/speed-test-google-chrome-beats-firefox-ie-safari/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=October 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5286869/lifehacker-speed-tests-safari-4-chrome-2-and-more |title= Lifehacker Speed Tests: Safari 4, Chrome 2, and More – Browsers |last=Purdy |first=Kevin |work=[[Lifehacker]] |date= June 11, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bookmarks and settings synchronization ===
Chrome allows users to synchronize their bookmarks, history, and settings across all devices with the browser installed by sending and receiving data through a chosen Google Account, which in turn updates all signed-in instances of Chrome. This can be authenticated either through Google credentials, or a sync passphrase.

=== Web standards support ===
[[File:Acid3-Chrome4Dev.PNG|thumb|The results of the [[Acid3]] test on Google Chrome 4.0]]

The first release of Google Chrome passed both the [[Acid1]] and [[Acid2]] tests. Beginning with version 4.0, Chrome has passed all aspects of the [[Acid3]] test.&lt;ref name=chrome4/&gt;

{{as of|2011|May|}}, Chrome has very good support for JavaScript/[[ECMAScript]] according to [[Ecma International]]'s ECMAScript standards conformance Test 262&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://test262.ecmascript.org/|title=ECMAScript test262|accessdate=May 6, 2011|work=ECMAScript.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514205704/http://test262.ecmascript.org/|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (version ES5.1 May 18, 2012). This test reports as the final score the number of tests a browser failed; hence lower scores are better. In this test, Chrome version 37 scored 10 failed/11578 passed. For comparison, Firefox 19 scored 193 failed/11752 passed and Internet Explorer 9 has a score of 600+ failed, while Internet Explorer 10 has a score of 7 failed.

In 2011, on the official CSS 2.1 test suite by standardization organization [[W3C]], WebKit, the Chrome rendering engine, passes 89.75% (89.38% out of 99.59% covered) CSS 2.1 tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS2.1/20110323/reports/results.html|title=CSS 2.1 Test Suite RC6 Results|accessdate=May 6, 2011|publisher=W3C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the HTML5 web standards test, Chrome 41 scores 518 out of 555 points, placing it ahead of the five most popular desktop browsers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://html5test.com/s/b204eb264a8b047b.html|title=HTML5 test desktop|accessdate=March 19, 2015|publisher=Visred}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://html5test.com/results/desktop.html|title=HTML5 test desktop browser comparison|accessdate=March 19, 2015|publisher=Visred}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrome 41 on Android scores 510 out of 555 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://html5test.com/s/3fb179264a332e3d.html|title=HTML5 test Android Chrome 41 Galaxy S5|accessdate=March 19, 2015|publisher=Visred}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://html5test.com/results/mobile.html|title=HTML5 test tablet|accessdate=March 19, 2015|publisher=Sights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://html5test.com/results/tablet.html|title=HTML5 test mobile|accessdate=March 19, 2015|publisher=Sights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrome 44 scores 526, only 29 points less than the maximum score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://html5test.com/compare/browser/chrome-44.html|title=HTML5test - How well does your browser support HTML5?|work=html5test.com|accessdate=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
{{See also|Browser security}}

Chrome periodically retrieves updates of two [[Blacklist (computing)|blacklists]] (one for [[phishing]] and one for [[malware]]), and warns users when they attempt to visit a site flagged as potentially harmful. This service is also made available for use by others via a free public [[API]] called "[[Google Safe Browsing]] API".&lt;ref name="chrome-comic"/&gt;

Chrome uses a process-allocation model to [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] [[Tab (GUI)|tabs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.marcchung.com/2008/09/05/chromes-process-model-explained.html |title=chromes-process model explained |first=Marc |last=Chung |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321110910/http://blog.marcchung.com/2008/09/05/chromes-process-model-explained.html |archivedate=March 21, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the [[principle of least privilege]], each tab process cannot interact with critical memory functions (e.g. OS memory, user files) or other tab processes{{snd}} similar to Microsoft's "Protected Mode" used by [[Internet Explorer 9]] or greater. The ''Sandbox Team'' is said to have "taken this existing process boundary and made it into a [[operating system-level virtualization|jail]]." This enforces a [[computer security model]] whereby there are two levels of [[multilevel security]] (''user'' and ''[[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]]'') and the ''sandbox'' can only respond to communication requests initiated by the ''user''.&lt;ref name="sec"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Adam|last1=Barth|first2=Collin |last2= Jackson |first3=Charles |last3= Reis |author4= The Google Chrome Team |title=The Security Architecture of the Chromium Browser |publisher=Stanford Security Laboratory|url=http://crypto.stanford.edu/websec/chromium/chromium-security-architecture.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Linux sandboxing uses the [[seccomp]] mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutschke|first=Markus|title=Re: (PATCH 2/2) x86-64: seccomp: fix 32/64 syscall hole|url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.sparc/11622|date=May 6, 2009|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edge|first=Jake|title=Google's Chromium sandbox|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/347547/|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, Chrome has been faulted for not including a master password to prevent casual access to a user's passwords. Chrome developers have indicated that a master password does not provide real security against determined hackers and have refused to implement one. Bugs filed on this issue have been marked "WontFix".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=53 |title=Issue 53 - chromium - No Master Password Option |publisher=[[Google]] |date=September 2, 2008 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kember |first=Elliott |url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/07/chrome-password-security/ |title=Chrome's Password Security Strategy Is Insane |website=Mashable.com |date=August 7, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014|02}}, the Windows version asks the user to enter the Windows account password before showing saved passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=//code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=53#c151 | title=Issue 53 - chromium - No Master Password Option (post #151) | accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, [[TorrentFreak]] reported that using Chrome when connected to the internet using a VPN can be a serious security issue due to the browser's support for [[WebRTC#Concerns|WebRTC]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://torrentfreak.com/huge-security-flaw-leaks-vpn-users-real-ip-addresses-150130/ Huge Security Flaw Leaks VPN Users’ Real IP-addresses] TorrentFreak.com (January 30, 2015). Retrieved on February 21, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2016, it was reported that starting with Chrome 56, users will be warned when they visit non-secure HTTP websites to encourage more sites to make the transition to HTTPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insightportal.io/desktop-browsers/846-chrome-will-start-flagging-insecure-http-sites|title=InsightPortal {{!}} QualityTaskForce {{!}} Chrome will start flagging insecure HTTP sites|last=Bates|first=Adam|website=www.insightportal.io|language=en-gb|access-date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Security vulnerabilities ====
{{See also|Comparison of web browsers#Security and vulnerabilities}}

No security vulnerabilities in Chrome were exploited in the three years of [[Pwn2Own]] from 2009–2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9214022/Google_s_Chrome_untouched_at_Pwn2Own_hack_match|title=Google's Chrome untouched at Pwn2Own hack match|work=[[Computerworld]]|date=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Pwn2Own 2012, Chrome was defeated by a [[France|French]] team who used [[zero day exploit]]s in the version of Flash shipped with Chrome to take complete control of a fully patched [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] Windows 7 PC using a booby-trapped website that overcame Chrome's sandboxing.&lt;ref name="ZDnet07Mar12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/pwn2own-2012-google-chrome-browser-sandbox-first-to-fall/10588 |title=Pwn2Own 2012: Google Chrome browser sandbox first to fall |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrome was compromised twice at the 2012 CanSecWest [[Pwnium]].&lt;ref name="ZDnet07Mar12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/cansecwest-pwnium-google-chrome-hacked-with-sandbox-bypass/10563 |title=CanSecWest Pwnium: Google Chrome hacked with sandbox bypass |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/teenager-hacks-google-chrome-with-three-0day-vulnerabilities/10649 |title=Teenager hacks Google Chrome with three 0day vulnerabilities |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]  |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google's official response to the exploits was delivered by Jason Kersey, who congratulated the researchers, noting "We also believe that both submissions are works of art and deserve wider sharing and recognition."&lt;ref name="ChromeReleaseNotes10Mar12"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/03/chrome-stable-update_10.html|title = Chrome Stable Update|accessdate =March 10, 2012|last = Kersey|first = Jason |date = March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fixes for these vulnerabilities were deployed within 10 hours of the submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Goodin |title=Google Chrome exploit fetches "Pinkie Pie" $60,000 hacking prize |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2012/10/google-chrome-exploit-fetches-pinkie-pie-60000-hacking-prize/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=October 10, 2012 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2012/10/pwnium-2-results-and-wrap-up_10.html|title=Pwnium 2: results and wrap-up|work=Chromium Blog|date=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of security vulnerabilities in Chrome occur in the [[Adobe Flash Player]]. For example, the 2016 Pwn2Own successful attack on Chrome relied on four security vulnerabilities. Two of the vulnerabilities were in Flash, one was in Chrome, and one was in the Windows kernel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/security/pwn2own-day-1-exploits-google-chrome-adobe-flash-apple-safari.html|title=Pwn2own Day 1 Exploits: Google Chrome, Adobe Flash, Apple Safari|access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Google announced that it was planning to phase out Flash Player in Chrome, starting in version 53. The first phase of the plan is to disable Flash for ads and "background analytics", with the ultimate goal of disabling it completely by the end of the year, except on specific sites that Google has deemed to be broken without it. Flash would then be re-enabled with the exclusion of ads and background analytics on a site-by-site basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/05/15/google-targets-html5-default-for-chrome-instead-of-flash-in-q4-2016/|title=Google targets HTML5 default for Chrome instead of Flash in Q4 2016|website=VentureBeat|access-date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013–2016, detail the capabilities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], such as the ability to compromise [[web browser]]s (including Google Chrome).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wikileaks-cia-documents-released-cyber-intelligence/|title=WikiLeaks posts trove of CIA documents detailing mass hacking|last=|first=|date=2017-03-07|work=[[CBS News]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/cia-can-hack-phone-pc-tv-says-wikileaks/|title=How the CIA Can Hack Your Phone, PC, and TV (Says WikiLeaks)|last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=2017-03-07|work=[[WIRED]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malware blocking and ad blocking ====
Google introduced download scanning protection in Chrome 17.&lt;ref name="chromereleases17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/features.html#security |title=Chrome Browser |website=Google.com |accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2018, Google introduced an [[ad blocking]] feature based on recommendations from the [[Interactive Advertising Bureau]]. Sites that employ invasive ads are given a 30-day warning, after which their ads will be blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/02/15/googles-chrome-ad-blocker-means-the-webs-largest-ad-company-is-also-now-advertisings-biggest-traffic-cop/|title=Google’s Chrome ad blocker means the Web’s largest ad company is also now advertising’s biggest traffic cop|last=Tsukayama|first=Hayley|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 15, 2018|accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' recommended users install dedicated ad-blocking tools instead, which offer increased security against malware and tracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/digital-security/to-protect-against-websites-that-spy-on-you-get-an-adblocker/|title=Want to Protect Against Websites That Spy on You?

==== Plugins ====
* Chrome supported, up to version 45, [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] with the [[Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface]] (NPAPI),&lt;ref name="chrome-faq-activex"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/webmasters-faq.html#activex |title=Google Chrome FAQ for web developers|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=April 8, 2012|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080904005822/https://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/webmasters-faq.html |archivedate = September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that plug-ins (for example [[Adobe Flash Player]]) run as unrestricted separate processes outside the browser and cannot be sandboxed as tabs are. [[ActiveX]] is not supported.&lt;ref name="chrome-faq-activex"/&gt; Since 2010, Adobe Flash has been integral to Chrome and does not need be installed separately. Flash is kept up to date as part of Chrome's own updates.&lt;ref name="Paul31Mar10"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2010/03/google-bakes-flash-into-chrome-hopes-to-improve-plugin-api.ars|title = Google bakes Flash into Chrome, hopes to improve plug-in API|accessdate =March 14, 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Java applet]] support was available in Chrome with Java 6 update 12 and above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://java.com/en/download/chrome.jsp|title=Java and Google Chrome|website=java.com|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Java under OS X was provided by a Java Update released on May 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=10812|title=Issue 10812 – chromium – No java plugin support yet|publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 12, 2009, Google introduced a replacement for NPAPI that is more portable and more secure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/ppapi/wiki/Concepts |title=Pepper.wiki |website=Code.google.com |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; called Pepper Plugin API ([[PPAPI]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/getting-started/getting-started-background-and-basics#TOC-Pepper-Plugin-API-PPAPI- |title=Pepper Plugin API (PPAPI) |website=Chromium.org |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The default bundled PPAPI Flash Player (or Pepper-based Flash Player) was available on [[Chrome OS]] first, then replaced the NPAPI Flash Player on Linux from Chrome version 20, on Windows from version 21 (which also reduced Flash crashes by 20%),&lt;ref name="the-road-to-safer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2012/08/the-road-to-safer-more-stable-and.html |title=Chromium Blog: The road to safer, more stable, and flashier Flash|website=blog.chromium.org |date=August 8, 2012 |accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually came to OS X at version 23.&lt;ref name=SecureFlashMac/&gt;
* On September 23, 2013, Google announced that it will be deprecating and then removing NPAPI support.  NPAPI support was removed from Linux in Chrome release 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2013/09/saying-goodbye-to-our-old-friend-npapi.html|title=Chromium Blog: Saying Goodbye to Our Old Friend NPAPI|work=Chromium Blog|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NPAPI plugins like Java can no longer work in Chrome (but there are workarounds for Flash by using PPAPI Flash Player on Linux including for Chromium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-dev/xEbgvWE7wMk |title=PSA: Chrome for Linux planning to drop NPAPI support as soon as April |quote=Another thing I found last night is a Debian package called PepperFlashPlayer. Apparently it works the same way as the existing FlashPlayer package (which downloads Adobe Flash from Adobe and installs it) -- it downloads Chrome from Google, extracts the PPAPI Flash plugin, and installs it for Chromium. That might be a good work-around for Chromium users in the interim. (Note: I am not endorsing this method, just making people aware of it.) But obviously it would be better if PPAPI Flash were available in a more "official" context. |accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 14, 2015, Google released Chrome v42, disabling the NPAPI by default. This makes plugins that do not have a PPAPI plugin counterpart incompatible with Chrome, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] and [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]. However, NPAPI support could be enabled through the chrome://flags{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=Jarble |fix-attempted=yes }} menu, until the release of version 45 in September 2015, that removed NPAPI support entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chromium.org/developers/npapi-deprecation |website=www.chromium.org |title=NPAPI deprecation: developer guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privacy ===

==== Incognito mode ====
[[Image:Google Chrome Incognito.png|thumb|250px|Google Chrome Incognito mode message]]
The [[privacy mode|private browsing]] feature called ''Incognito'' mode prevents the browser from permanently storing any [[web browsing history|history]] information, [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], site data, or form inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop|title=Browse in private - Computer - Google Chrome Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downloaded files and bookmarks will be stored. In addition, user activity is not hidden from visited websites or the Internet service provider.

Incognito mode is similar to the private browsing feature in other web browsers. It doesn't prevent saving in all windows: "You can switch between an incognito window and any regular windows you have open. You'll only be in incognito mode when you're using the incognito window".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95464 |title=Explore Google Chrome Features: Incognito Mode|date=September 2, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Listening capabilities ====
On June 2015 the [[Debian]] developer community discovered that Chromium 43 and Chrome 43 were programmed to download the ''Hotword Shared Module'', which could enable the [[OK Google]] voice recognition extension, although by default it was "off". This raised privacy concerns in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2015/06/google-chrome-listening-in-to-your-room-shows-the-importance-of-privacy-defense-in-depth/|title=Google Chrome Listening In To Your Room Shows The Importance Of Privacy Defense In Depth|last=Falkvinge|first=Rick|date=2015-06-18|work=Private Internet Access Blog|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-US|author-link=Rick Falkvinge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/not-ok-google-chromium-voice-extension-pulled-after-spying-concerns/|title=Not OK, Google: Chromium voice extension pulled after spying concerns|last=Bright|first=Peter|date=|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The module was removed in Chrome 45, which was released on 1 September 2015, and was only present in Chrome 43 and 44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/0366a5184a70b3eefb5fcef2c2e13721669f00d8%5E!/|title=Diff - 0366a5184a70b3eefb5fcef2c2e13721669f00d8^! - chromium/src - Git at Google|website=chromium.googlesource.com|access-date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.ca/2015/09/stable-channel-update.html|title=Chrome Releases: Stable Channel Update|work=googlechromereleases.blogspot.ca|access-date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{Anchor|User tracking}}User tracking concerns ====
Chrome sends details about its users and their activities to [[Google]] through both optional and non-optional user tracking mechanisms.&lt;ref name="The Chromium Blog" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://8ch.net/tech/chrome.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407160959/https://8ch.net/tech/chrome.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2018-04-07|title=Welcome to the Botnet|date=2018-04-07|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the tracking mechanisms can be optionally enabled and disabled through the installation interface&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/privacy.html?brand=CHKZ |title=Google Chrome Privacy Notice |publisher=[[Google]]|date=December 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2012|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through the browser's options dialog.&lt;ref name="blogoscoped"/&gt; Unofficial builds, such as [[SRWare Iron]], seek to remove these features from the browser altogether.&lt;ref name="iron"/&gt; The RLZ feature is not included in the Chromium browser either.&lt;ref name="ChromiumBlog20Jun10"/&gt;

In March 2010, Google devised a new method to collect installation statistics: the unique ID token included with Chrome is now only used for the first connection that Google Update makes to its server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/16/google_chrome_unique_identifier_change/ |title=Google Chrome Unique Identifier Change|date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The optional suggestion service included in Google Chrome has been criticized because it provides the information typed into the Omnibox to the search provider before the user even hits return. This allows the search engine to provide URL suggestions, but also provides them with web usage information tied to an [[IP address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ina |last=Fried |title=Google's Omnibox could be Pandora's box |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/googles-omnibox-could-be-pandoras-box/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=October 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The optional feature to use a web service to help resolve spelling errors has privacy implications.&lt;ref name="spellcheck-privacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&amp;answer=114836&amp;p=settings_privacy |title=Chrome's privacy settings |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Do Not Track ====
In February 2012, Google announced that Chrome would implement the [[Do Not Track]] (DNT) standard to inform websites the user's desire to be not tracked. The protocol was implemented in version 23. In line with the W3's draft standard for DNT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/drafts/tracking-dnt.html#determining|publisher=W3C|accessdate=December 17, 2015|title=Tracking DNT}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is turned off by default in Chrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://browserfame.com/478/google-chrome-support-do-not-track |title=Google and Chrome To Support Do Not Track |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226042318/http://browserfame.com/478/google-chrome-support-do-not-track |archivedate=February 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Speed ===
The [[JavaScript]] [[virtual machine]] used by Chrome, the [[V8 (JavaScript engine)|V8 JavaScript engine]], has features such as ''[[just-in-time compilation|dynamic code generation]]'', ''hidden class transitions'', and ''[[Conservative garbage collection|precise garbage collection]]''.&lt;ref name="chrome-comic"/&gt;

In 2008, several websites performed benchmark tests using the [[SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark]] tool as well as Google's own set of computationally intense benchmarks, which include [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and [[constraint solving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://code.google.com/apis/v8/run.html |title=V8 Benchmark suite |accessdate=September 3, 2008 |work=[[Google Code]] |deadurl=yes |archivedate=September 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904201317/http://code.google.com/apis/v8/run.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They unanimously reported that Chrome performed much faster than all competitors against which it had been tested, including [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (for Windows), [[Mozilla Firefox 3|Firefox 3.0]], [[Internet Explorer 7]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and [[Internet Explorer 8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Chrome – first benchmarks.

He stated that Firefox 3.0 performed poorly on [[recursion]]-intensive benchmarks, such as those of Google, because the Mozilla team had not implemented recursion-tracing yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John|last=Resig|authorlink=John Resig|url=http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-performance-rundown/|title=JavaScript Performance Rundown|date=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most major web browsers, Chrome uses [[Domain Name System|DNS]] prefetching to speed up website lookups,&lt;ref name="features"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/three_hidden_chrome_features_youll_love |title=Three hidden Chrome features you'll love |last=Gralla |first=Preston |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=September 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923064954/http://blogs.computerworld.com/three_hidden_chrome_features_youll_love |archivedate=September 23, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as do other browsers like Firefox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bitsup.blogspot.com/2008/11/dns-prefetching-for-firefox.html |title=DNS prefetching for Firefox |date=November 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safari,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#performance |title=What's new in Safari 5 |author=Apple Inc. |date=June 7, 2010 |accessdate=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Explorer (called DNS Pre-resolution),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/03/17/internet-explorer-9-network-performance-improvements.aspx |title=Internet Explorer 9 Network Performance Improvements |website=Blogs.msdn.com |date=March 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] as a UserScript (not built-in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eiras |first=João |url=http://userjs.org/scripts/browser/enhancements/page-prefetcher |title=Page prefetcher |website=userjs.org |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrome formerly used their now deprecated [[SPDY]] protocol instead of only [[HTTP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/spdy/ |title=chrome&amp;#93; Index of /trunk/src/net/spdy – Chromium SPDY client implementation|website=src.chromium.org |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-proxy-examples |title=SPDY Proxy Examples – The Chromium Projects |website=www.chromium.org |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when communicating with servers that support it, such as Google services, Facebook, Twitter. SPDY support was removed in Chrome version 51.

=== Stability ===
[[File:Chrome-crash.png|thumb|Screenshot of Chrome browser crash]]

A multi-process architecture is implemented in Chrome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html|title=Multi-process Architecture |last=Reisn|first=Charlie|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, by default, a separate process is allocated to each site instance and plugin. This procedure is termed [[process isolation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models|title=Process Models|date=September 3, 2008|work=The Chromium Projects|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it prevents tasks from interfering with each other, raising security and stability. An attacker successfully gaining access to one application gains access to no others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Google-Chrome-Puts-Security-in-a-Sandbox/|title=Google Chrome Puts Security in a Sandbox|last=Prince|first=Brian|date=December 11, 2008|work=eWeek.com|publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and failure in one instance results in a ''Sad Tab'' [[screen of death]], similar to the well-known ''[[Sad Mac]]'', but only one tab crashes instead of the whole application. This strategy exacts a fixed per-process cost up front, but results in less memory bloat over time as fragmentation is confined to each instance and no longer needs further memory allocations.&lt;ref name="chrome-comic"/&gt; This architecture was adopted in Safari&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2010-April/012235.html |title=[webkit-dev&amp;#93; Announcing WebKit2 |website=lists.webkit.org |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Firefox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2010/04/08/firefox-lorentz-beta-available-for-download-and-testing/ |title=Firefox Lorentz beta available for download and testing |date=April 8, 2010 |publisher=Mozilla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrome includes a [[process management (computing)|process management]] utility called ''Task Manager'' which lets users see what sites and plugins are using the most [[random-access memory|memory]], [[download]]ing the most [[byte]]s and overusing the [[central processing unit|CPU]] and provides the ability to terminate them.&lt;ref name="chrome-comic"/&gt; Chrome Version 23 ensures its users an improved battery life for the systems supporting Chrome's GPU accelerated video decoding.&lt;ref name="voiceofgreyhat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voiceofgreyhat.com/2012/11/Chrome23-With-Longer-Battery-Life-Do-Not-Track.html |title=Chrome 23 Closes 15 Security Vulnerabilities, Promises Longer Battery Life &amp; Added Do Not Track (DNT) |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="November 2012 announcements"/&gt;

}}
By default, the main [[user interface]] includes back, forward, refresh/cancel and menu buttons. A home button is not shown by default, but can be added through the Settings page to take the user to the new tab page or a custom home page.&lt;ref name="HomeButton"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?&amp;answer=95314|title = Set your home page|accessdate = May 22, 2012|last = [[Google]]|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tab (GUI)|Tabs]] are the main component of Chrome's user interface and have been moved to the top of the window rather than below the controls. This subtle change contrasts with many existing tabbed browsers which are based on [[window (computing)|windows]] and contain tabs. Tabs, with their state, can be transferred seamlessly between window containers by dragging. Each tab has its own set of controls, including the ''Omnibox''.&lt;ref name="chrome-comic"/&gt;

The ''Omnibox'' is a [[address bar|URL box]] that combines the functions of both the address bar and search box. If a user enters the URL of a site previously searched from, Chrome allows pressing ''Tab'' to search the site again directly from the Omnibox. When a user starts typing in the Omnibox, Chrome provides suggestions for previously visited sites (based on the URL or in-page text), popular websites (not necessarily visited before{{snd}} powered by [[Google Instant]]), and popular searches. Although Instant can be turned off, suggestions based on previously visited sites cannot be turned off. Chrome will also [[autocomplete]] the URLs of sites visited often.&lt;ref name="chrome-comic"/&gt; If a user types keywords into the Omnibox that don't match any previously visited websites and presses enter, Chrome will conduct the search using the default search engine.

One of Chrome's differentiating features is the ''New Tab Page'', which can replace the browser [[home page]] and is displayed when a new tab is created. Originally, this showed thumbnails of the nine most visited web sites, along with frequent searches, recent bookmarks, and recently closed tabs; similar to [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Firefox]] with [[Google Toolbar]], or [[Opera (web browser)|Opera's]] [[Features of the Opera web browser#Speed Dial|Speed Dial]].&lt;ref name="chrome-comic"/&gt; In Google Chrome 2.0, the New Tab Page was updated to allow users to hide thumbnails they did not want to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Darin |last=Fisher |title=A Speedier Google Chrome for all users |url=https://chrome.googleblog.com/2009/05/speedier-google-chrome-for-all-users.html |website=Chrome Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in version 3.0, the New Tab Page was revamped to display thumbnails of the eight most visited web sites. The thumbnails could be rearranged, pinned, and removed. Alternatively, a list of text links could be displayed instead of thumbnails. It also features a "Recently closed" bar that shows recently closed tabs and a "tips" section that displays hints and tricks for using the browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anthony |last=LaForge |title=Google Chrome after a year: Sporting a new stable release |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2009/09/google-chrome-after-year-sporting-new.html |website=Official Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrome includes a ''bookmarks'' submenu that lists the user's bookmarks, provides easy access to Chrome's ''Bookmark Manager,'' and allows the user to toggle a ''bookmarks bar'' on or off.

For [[web developer]]s, Chrome features an element inspector (Inspect Element), similar to the [[Firebug (software)|Firebug]] browser extension, which allows users to look into the DOM and see what makes up the webpage.&lt;ref name="features"/&gt;

Chrome has special URLs that load application-specific pages instead of websites or files on disk. Chrome also has a built-in ability to enable experimental features. Originally called &lt;code&gt;about:labs&lt;/code&gt;, the address was changed to &lt;code&gt;about:flags&lt;/code&gt; to make it less obvious to casual users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/url_constants.cc |title=Chromium url_constants.cc |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908013948/http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/url_constants.cc |archivedate=September 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AboutFlags19Oct10"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lifehacker.com/5667846/chromes-aboutlabs-renamed-to-aboutflags-adds-a-warning |title=Chrome's About:Labs Renamed to About:Flags, Adds a Warning |accessdate=October 19, 2010 |last=Pash |first=Adam |date=October 2010 |work=LifeHacker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Google introduced a new simplified logo to replace the previous 3D logo that had been used since the project's inception. Google designer Steve Rura explained the company reasoning for the change: "Since Chrome is all about making your web experience as easy and clutter-free as possible, we refreshed the Chrome icon to better represent these sentiments. A simpler icon embodies the Chrome spirit{{snd}} to make the web quicker, lighter, and easier for all."&lt;ref name=Blog21Mar11/&gt;

In September 2013, Google started making Chrome apps "For your desktop." This meant offline access, desktop shortcuts, and less dependence on Chrome—apps launch in a window separate from Chrome, and look more like native applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Erik |last=Kay |title=A new breed of Chrome Apps |url=https://chrome.googleblog.com/2013/09/a-new-breed-of-chrome-apps.html |website=Chrome Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=September 5, 2013 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Desktop shortcuts and apps ===
Chrome allows users to make local desktop [[computer shortcut|shortcuts]] that open [[web application]]s in the browser. The browser, when opened in this way, contains none of the regular interface except for the title bar, so as not to "interrupt anything the user is trying to do". This allows web applications to run alongside local software (similar to [[Mozilla Prism]] and [[Fluid (web browser)|Fluid]]).&lt;ref name="chrome-comic"/&gt;

This feature, according to Google, will be enhanced with the [[Chrome Web Store]], a one-stop web-based web applications directory which opened in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore|title=Chrome Web Store|date=May 19, 2010|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2010/05/chrome-web-store.html|title=The Chrome Web Store|last=Lay|first=Erik|date=May 19, 2010|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chrome Web Store ====
{{Main|Chrome Web Store}}

Announced on December 7, 2010, the [[Chrome Web Store]] allows users to install web applications as extensions to the browser, although most of these extensions function simply as links to popular web pages and/or games, but some of the apps like [[Springpad]] do provide extra features like offline access. The themes and extensions have also been tightly integrated into the new store, allowing users to search the entire catalog of Chrome extras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Paul |title=Chrome Web Store: a solution in search of a problem? |url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2010/12/thoughts-on-the-chrome-store-does-the-web-need-an-app-delivery-channel/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=December 9, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chrome Web Store was opened on February 11, 2011, with the release of Google Chrome 9.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Erik |last1=Kay |first2=Aaron |last2=Boodman |title=A dash of speed, 3D and apps |url=https://chrome.googleblog.com/2011/02/dash-of-speed-3d-and-apps.html |website=Chrome Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extensions ===
Google Chrome Extensions are [[browser extension]]s that modify Google Chrome.&lt;ref name="chromeblog2009"&gt;{{cite web

On September 9, 2009, Google enabled extensions by default on Chrome's developer channel, and provided several sample extensions for testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On May 27, 2014, Google issued an update to Chrome preventing Windows users from installing extensions obtained outside the Chrome Web Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/27/chrome-for-windows-will-now-only-install-extensions-from-googles-web-store/ |title=Chrome For Windows Will Now Only Install Extensions From Google's Web Store |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |date=May 27, 2014 |work=[[TechCrunch]] |accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with Google Chrome 3.0, users can install themes to alter the appearance of the browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Glen |last1=Murphy |first2=Mark |last2=Sabec |title=A splash of color to your browser: Artist Themes for Google Chrome |url=https://chrome.googleblog.com/2009/10/splash-of-color-to-your-browser-artist.html |website=Chrome Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=October 5, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many free third-party themes are provided in an online gallery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.google.com/chrome/intl/en/themes/index.html |title=Chrome Web Store |publisher=Google |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; accessible through a "Get themes" button in Chrome's options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?&amp;answer=148695|title=Basic settings: Change browser theme|work=Google Chrome Help}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Automatic web page translation ===
Starting with Google Chrome 4.1 the application added a built-in translation bar using [[Google Translate]]. Translation is currently available for 52 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hlrm=ru&amp;answer=173424|title=Change Chrome languages &amp; translate webpages |website=support.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Chrome detects a foreign language other than the user's preferred language as set during the installation time, it asks the user whether or not to translate.

=== {{Anchor|Pre-releases}}Release channels, cycles and updates ===
The first production release on December 11, 2008, marked the end of the initial Beta test period and the beginning of Production.  Shortly thereafter, on January 8, 2009, Google announced an updated release system with three channels: Stable (corresponding to the traditional Production), Beta, and Developer preview (also called the "Dev" channel). Where there were before only two channels: Beta and Developer, now there were three. Concurrently, all Developer channel users were moved to the Beta channel along with the promoted Developer release. Google explained that now the Developer channel builds would be less stable and polished than those from the initial Google Chrome's Beta period.  Beta users could opt back to the Developer channel as desired.

Each channel has its own release cycle and stability level.  The Stable channel updated roughly quarterly, with features and fixes that passed "thorough" testing in the Beta channel. Beta updated roughly monthly, with "stable and complete" features migrated from the Developer channel. The Developer channel updated once or twice per week and was where ideas and features were first publicly exposed "(and sometimes fail) and can be very unstable at times". [Quoted remarks from Google's policy announcements.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Larson |first=Mark |date=January 8, 2009|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2009/01/google-chrome-release-channels.html |title=Google Chrome Release Channels |accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larson|first=Mark|date=January 8, 2009|url=http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2009/01/dev-update-new-webkit-version-new.html|title=Dev update: New WebKit version, new features, and a new Dev channel|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fette|first=Ian|date=December 11, 2008|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2008/12/thanks-for-all-your-help.html|title=Thanks For All Your Help|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chrome Canary.png|thumb|128px|Google Chrome Canary Application Icon]]
On July 22, 2010, Google announced it would ramp up the speed at which it releases new stable versions; the release cycles were shortened from quarterly to six weeks for major Stable updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laforge|first=Anthony|date=July 22, 2010|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2010/07/release-early-release-often.html|title=Release Early, Release Often|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beta channel releases now come roughly at the same rate as Stable releases, though approximately one month in advance, while Dev channel releases appear roughly once or twice weekly, allowing time for basic release-critical testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Chromium Authors|url=https://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel|title= Chrome Release Channels|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This faster release cycle also brought a fourth channel: the "Canary" channel, updated daily from a build produced at 09:00 UTC from the most stable of the last 40 [[Revision management|revisions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Irish|first=Paul|date=November 2, 2012|url=http://www.paulirish.com/2012/chrome-canary-for-developers/|title= Chrome Canary for Developers|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name refers to the practice of [[Animal sentinel|using canaries in coal mines]], so if a change "kills" Chrome Canary, it will be blocked from migrating down to the Developer channel, at least until fixed in a subsequent Canary build.&lt;ref name="Bridge2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bridge|first1=Henry|title=Google Chrome in a Coal Mine|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2010/08/google-chrome-in-coal-mine.html|website=Chromium Blog|accessdate=March 19, 2015|date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canary is "the most bleeding-edge official version of Chrome and somewhat of a mix between Chrome dev and the Chromium snapshot builds". Canary releases run side-by-side with any other channel; it is not linked to the other Google Chrome installation and can therefore run different synchronization profiles, themes, and browser preferences. This ensures that fallback functionality remains even when some Canary update may contain release-breaking bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lee |last=Mathews|date=July 23, 2010|url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2010/07/23/google-chrome-canary-run-two-channels-at-once/|title=Google drops Chrome Canary build down the Chrome mineshaft|accessdate=July 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725003442/http://www.downloadsquad.com/2010/07/23/google-chrome-canary-run-two-channels-at-once/ |archivedate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not natively include the option to be the default browser, although on Windows and OS X it can be set through System Preferences. Canary was Windows-only at first; an [[OS X]] version was released on May 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.chromium.org/2011/05/adding-more-yellow-to-mac-color-scheme.html |title=Adding more yellow to the Mac color scheme |website=blog.chromium.org |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2012|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The Chrome beta channel for Android was launched on January 10, 2013; like Canary, it runs side-by-side with the stable channel for Android.&lt;ref name="tnw130110"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.beta |title=Chrome beta for Android on Google Play |website=Play.google.com |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrome Dev for Android was launched on April 29, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chromestory.com/2015/04/google-launches-dev-channel-for-chrome-on-android/|title=Google Launches Dev Channel for Chrome on Android|work=Chrome Story|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Chrome channels are automatically distributed according to their respective release cycles. The mechanism differs by platform. On Windows, it uses Google Update, and auto-update can be controlled via [[Group Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/05/google-update-releases-update-controls.html |title= Google Update Releases Update Controls |last=Dorwin |first=David |date= May 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, users may download a standalone installer of a version of Chrome that does not auto-update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/126299|title=Alternate (offline) Google Chrome installers for Windows - Chrome Help}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html?standalone=1 |title= Get a fast, free web browser |publisher=[[Google]] |website=Google.com |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On OS X, it uses Google Update Service, and auto-update can be controlled via the OS X "defaults" system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/support/installer/bin/answer.py?&amp;answer=147176&amp;ctx=go|title=Google Help page "Managing updates in Google Software Update"}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Linux, it lets the system's normal [[package management system]] supply the updates. This auto-updating behavior is a key difference from [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]], the non-branded [[open-source software|open-source]] browser which forms the core of Google Chrome. Because Chromium also serves as the [[Software release life cycle#Pre-alpha|pre-release]] [[Trunk (software)|development trunk]] for Chrome, its revisions are provided as source code and buildable snapshots are produced continuously with each new [[Commit (data management)|commit]], requiring users to manage their own browser updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.chromium.org/developers/testing/chromium-build-infrastructure/tour-of-the-chromium-buildbot|title=Tour of the Chromium Buildbot Waterfall - The Chromium Projects|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Release version numbers ====
Releases are identified by a four-part version number, e.g. 42.0.2311.90 (Windows Stable release April 14, 2015&lt;ref name="V42-Stable1"/&gt;). The components are major.minor.build.patch.&lt;ref name="dev-cal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chromium.org/developers/calendar|title=Chromium Development Calendar and Release Info|website=The Chromium Projects|accessdate=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chromium.org/developers/version-numbers|title=Version Numbers|website=The Chromium Projects|accessdate=May 1, 2015|date=March 14, 2014|author= Mike Frysinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Major.minor'' reflects scheduling policy
: ''Build.patch'' identifies content progression

* ''Major'' represents a product release.  These are scheduled 7–8 per year, unlike other software systems where the ''major'' version number updates only with substantial new content.
* ''Minor'' is usually 0.  References to version 'x' or 'x.0', e.g. 42.0, refer to this ''major.minor'' designation.
* ''Build'' is ever increasing. For a release cycle, e.g. 42.0, there are several builds in the Canary and Developer period. The last ''build'' number from Developer is kept throughout Beta and Stable and is locked with the ''major.minor'' for that release.
* ''Patch'' resets with each ''build'', incrementing with each ''patch''.  The first ''patch'' is 0, but usually the first publicly released ''patch'' is somewhat higher.  In Beta and Stable, only ''patch'' increments.

[[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] and Chrome release schedules are linked through [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]]
(''Major'') version Branch Point dates, published annually.&lt;ref name="dev-cal"/&gt;  The Branch Points precede the final Chrome Developer build (initial) release by 4 days (nearly always) and the Chrome Stable initial release by roughly 53 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uv_dNkPVlDFG1kaImq7dW-6PasJQU1Yzpj5IKG_2coA/present?slide=id.i109|title=Chrome Release Cycle -12/16/2010

=== iOS ===
{{anchor|iOS version}}

Chrome is available on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s mobile [[iOS]] operating system as ''Google Chrome for iOS.'' Released in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App Store]] on June 26, 2012, it supports the [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], and [[iPod touch]], and requires that the device has iOS 10.0 or greater installed.&lt;ref name="iOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/app/chrome/id535886823|title=Chrome entry - Apple's App Store}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with Apple's requirements for browsers released through their App Store, this version of Chrome uses the ''iOS WebKit''{{snd}} which is Apple's own mobile rendering engine and components, developed for their ''Safari'' browser{{snd}} therefore it is restricted from using Google's own V8 JavaScript engine.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/06/29/google-chrome-on-ios-hits-1-free-app/|title=Google Chrome on iOS Hits #1 Free App|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="9to5mac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/03/ios-8-webkit-changes-finally-allow-all-apps-to-have-the-same-performance-as-safari/|title=iOS 8 WebKit changes finally allow all apps to have the same performance as Safari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrome is the default web browser for the [[iOS]] ''Gmail'' application, but it cannot be used as the device-wide default application for opening webpages because Apple has not provided iOS users with the option to change the default from [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kovach |first=Steve |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/google-encourages-iphone-developers-to-use-chrome-2013-5 |title=Here's Even More Evidence That Google Is Trying To Take Over The iPhone|website=Business Insider |date=May 8, 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Linux distribution]]s, support for 32-bit Intel processors ended in March 2016 although Chromium is still supported .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/28980/Google_ends_32-bit_Linux_support_for_Chrome|title=Google ends 32-bit Linux support for Chrome|website=OSNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of Chrome version 26, Linux installations of the browser may be updated only on systems that support [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] v4.6 and [[GTK+|GTK]] v2.24 or later.  Thus deprecated systems include (for example) [[Debian]] 6's 2.20, and [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|RHEL]] 6's 2.18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Chrome-stops-declaring-Linux-systems-obsolete-1803451.html|title=Chrome stops declaring Linux systems obsolete - The H Open: News and Features|date=February 14, 2013|website=H-online.com|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Windows 8 mode" was introduced in 2012 and has since been discontinued.

== Reception ==
Google Chrome was met with acclaim upon release. In 2008, Matthew Moore of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' summarized the verdict of early reviewers: "Google Chrome is attractive, fast and has some impressive new features..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Moore |title=Google Chrome browser: Review of reviews |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3358306/Google-Chrome-browser-Review-of-reviews.html |accessdate=September 24, 2011 |date=September 2, 2008 |work=Daily Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Microsoft reportedly played down the threat from Chrome and predicted that most people would embrace [[Internet Explorer 8]]. [[Opera Software]] said that "Chrome will strengthen the Web as the biggest application platform in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/09/03/google-polishes-product-line-with-chrome-browser.html|title=Google polishes product line with Chrome browser|first=Michael|last=Liedtke|date=September 3, 2008|agency=Associated Press|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623142424/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/09/03/google-polishes-product-line-with-chrome-browser.html|archivedate=June 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; But by February 25, 2010, ''BusinessWeek'' had reported that "For the first time in years, energy and resources are being poured into browsers, the ubiquitous programs for accessing content on the Web. Credit for this trend{{snd}} a boon to consumers{{snd}} goes to two parties. The first is Google, whose big plans for the Chrome browser have shaken Microsoft out of its competitive torpor and forced the software giant to pay fresh attention to its own browser, Internet Explorer.

{{quote|Chrome's design bridges the gap between desktop and so-called "cloud computing." At the touch of a button, Chrome lets you make a desktop, Start menu, or QuickLaunch shortcut to any Web page or Web application, blurring the line between what's online and what's inside your PC. For example, I created a desktop shortcut for Google Maps. When you create a shortcut for a Web application, Chrome strips away all of the toolbars and tabs from the window, leaving you with something that feels much more like a desktop application than like a Web application or page.|''[[PC World]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/150579/google_chrome_web_browser.html |title=Google Chrome Web Browser |first=Nick |last=Mediati |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |website=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[IDG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Countries by most used web browser}}

Chrome overtook [[Firefox]] in November 2011, in worldwide usage. {{As of|2016|06}}, according to StatCounter, Google Chrome had 62% worldwide desktop [[usage share of web browsers|usage share]], making it the most widely used web browser, while Firefox had 16% and Internet Explorer had 12%.&lt;ref name="statcounter201606"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-browser-ww-monthly-201608-201608-bar |title=Top 9 Desktop Browsers from W01 2015 to W27 2016|website=StatCounter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For additional sources see [[Usage share of web browsers#Summary table]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] and [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]], Chrome receives a weekend "bump", which boosts its market share by as much as three percentage points on week-ends, at the expense of [[Internet Explorer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getclicky.com/marketshare/global/web-browsers/|title=Global Web Browser Marketshares|website=Clicky Analytics|accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported by StatCounter, a web analytics company, that for the single day of Sunday, March 18, 2012, Chrome was the most used web browser in the world for the first time. Chrome secured 32.7% of the global web browsing on that day, while Internet Explorer followed closely behind with 32.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gs.statcounter.com/press/chrome-is-worlds-number-one-browser-for-a-day | title=Chrome is world's number one browser for a day | website=[[StatCounter]] | date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 14–21, 2012, Google Chrome was for the first time responsible for more Internet traffic than Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which long had held its spot as the most used web browser in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/21/tech/web/chrome-explorer-browser-wars/index.html | title=Chrome overtakes Internet Explorer as No. 1 browser -- maybe | work=CNN | date=May 21, 2012 | accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to StatCounter, 31.88% of web traffic was generated by Chrome for a sustained period of one week and 31.47% by Internet Explorer. Though Chrome had topped Internet Explorer for single day's usage in the past, this was the first time it had led for one full week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mashable.com/2012/05/21/chrome-is-tops/ | title=Google Chrome Now the No. 1 Browser in the World |website=[[mashable.com]] | date=May 21, 2012 | last= Pachal |first= Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 Google I/O developers' conference, Google claimed that there were 310 million active users of Chrome, almost double the number in 2011, which was stated as 160 million active users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/06/28/chrome-tops-310-million-users-almost-100-growth-over-last-year/ |title=Chrome tops 310 million users, almost 100% growth over last year |date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, according to StatCounter, Chrome overtook Internet Explorer for the first time in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-US-monthly-201306-201306-bar|title=Stats Counter US Monthly bar graph|date=June 2013|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Chrome was used by 43% of internet users worldwide. This study was done by Statista, which also noted that in North America, 36% of people use Chrome, the lowest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fox|first=Zoe|date=August 14, 2013|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/14/google-chrome-global-share/|title=43% of Global Web Surfers Choose Google Chrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enterprise deployment ===
In December 2010, Google announced that to make it easier for businesses to use Chrome they would provide an official Chrome [[Windows Installer|MSI package]]. For business use it is helpful to have full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized via transform files (.mst){{snd}} but the MSI provided with Chrome is only a very limited [[MSI wrapper]] fitted around the normal installer, and many businesses find that this arrangement does not meet their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=68519 |title=Change MSI from a wrapper to "full" MSI |publisher=Google |date=January 4, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal downloaded Chrome installer puts the browser in the user's local app data directory and provides invisible background updates, but the MSI package will allow installation at the system level, providing system administrators control over the update process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Paul |title=Google offering MSI to simplify Chrome enterprise deployment |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/12/google-offering-msi-to-simplify-chrome-enterprise-deployment/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=December 16, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}} it was formerly possible only when Chrome was installed using [[Google Pack]].

=== Chromium ===
{{Main|Chromium (web browser)}}

In September 2008, Google released a large portion of Chrome's source code as an open-source project called Chromium. This move enabled third-party developers to study the underlying source code and to help port the browser to the [[macOS]] and [[Linux]] operating systems.

== Developing for Chrome ==
It is possible to develop applications, extensions, and themes for Chrome. They are zipped in a .crx file and contain a manifest file that specifies basic information (such as version, name, description, privileges, etc.), and other files for the user interface (icons, popups, etc.). Google has an official developer's guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devguide |title=Developer's Guide - Google Chrome |website=Developer.chrome.com |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrome has its own web store where users and developers can upload and download these applications and extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/ |title=Chrome Web Store |website=chrome.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information technology law''' (also called "cyberlaw") concerns the [[law]] of [[information technology]], including [[computing]] and the [[internet]]. It is related to [[legal informatics]], and governs the [[Digital data|digital]] dissemination of both ([[digitalized]]) information and [[software]], [[information security]] and [[electronic commerce]]. aspects and it has been described as "paper laws" for a "paperless environment". It raises specific issues of [[intellectual property]] in computing and online, [[contract]] law, [[privacy]], [[freedom of expression]], and [[jurisdiction]]. 

==History==
{{main|History of the internet|History of free and open-source software}}
The regulation of information technology, through computing and the [[internet]] evolved out of the development of the first publicly funded networks, such as [[ARPANET]] and [[NSFNET]] in the [[United States]] or [[JANET]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;A Murray, ''Information Technology Law: The Law and Society'' (3rd edn 2016) &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sect-stub|date=February 2018}}

== Areas of law ==
{{See also|Software law}}
IT law does not constitute a separate area of law rather it encompasses aspects of contract, intellectual property, privacy and data protection laws. [[Intellectual property]] is an important component of IT law, including [[copyright]], rules on [[fair use]], and special rules on [[copy protection]] for digital media, and circumvention of such schemes. The area of [[software patent]]s is [[Software patent debate|controversial]], and still evolving in Europe and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Computer Law:  Drafting and Negotiating Forms and Agreements, by [[Richard Raysman]] and Peter Brown.  Law Journal Press, 1999&amp;ndash;2008.  {{ISBN|978-1-58852-024-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related topics of [[software license]]s, [[end user license agreement]]s, [[free software license]]s and [[open-source license]]s can involve discussion of product liability, professional liability of individual developers, warranties, contract law, trade secrets and intellectual property.

In various countries, areas of the computing and communication industries are regulated &amp;ndash; often strictly &amp;ndash; by governmental bodies.

There are rules on the uses to which computers and computer networks may be put, in particular there are rules on [[Security cracking|unauthorized access]], [[data privacy]] and [[spamming]]. There are also limits on the use of [[encryption]] and of equipment which may be used to defeat copy protection schemes. The export of hardware and software between certain states within the [[United States]] is also controlled.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

There are laws governing trade on the Internet, taxation, consumer protection, and advertising.

There are laws on [[censorship]] versus freedom of expression, rules on public access to government information, and individual access to information held on them by private bodies. There are laws on what data must be retained for law enforcement, and what may not be gathered or retained, for privacy reasons.

In certain circumstances and jurisdictions, computer communications may be used in evidence, and to establish contracts.
New methods of tapping and surveillance made possible by computers have wildly differing rules on how they may be used by law enforcement bodies and as evidence in court.

Computerized voting technology, from polling machines to internet and mobile-phone voting, raise a host of legal issues.

Some states limit access to the Internet, by law as well as by technical means.

== Jurisdiction ==
Issues of [[jurisdiction]] and [[sovereignty]] have quickly come to the fore in the era of the [[Internet]].

Jurisdiction is an aspect of state [[sovereignty]] and it refers to judicial, legislative and administrative competence. Although jurisdiction is an aspect of sovereignty, it is not coextensive with it. The laws of a nation may have extraterritorial impact extending the jurisdiction beyond the sovereign and territorial limits of that nation. This is particularly problematic as the medium of the Internet does not explicitly recognize sovereignty and territorial limitations. There is no uniform, international jurisdictional law of universal application, and such questions are generally a matter of [[conflict of laws]], particularly private international law. An example would be where the contents of a web site are legal in one country and illegal in another. In the absence of a uniform jurisdictional code, legal practitioners are generally left with a conflict of law issue.

Another major problem of cyberlaw lies in whether to treat the Internet as if it were physical space (and thus subject to a given jurisdiction's laws) or to act as if the Internet is a world unto itself (and therefore free of such restraints). Those who favor the latter view often feel that government should leave the Internet community to self-regulate. [[John Perry Barlow]], for example, has addressed the governments of the world and stated, "Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=John P.|title=A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace|url=http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more balanced alternative is the Declaration of Cybersecession: "Human beings possess a mind, which they are absolutely free to inhabit with no legal constraints. Human civilization is developing its own (collective) mind. All we want is to be free to inhabit it with no legal constraints. Since you make sure we cannot harm you, you have no ethical right to intrude our lives. So stop intruding!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editthis.info/cybersecession/An_Introduction_to_Cybersecession|title=An Introduction to Cybersecession}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars argue for more of a compromise between the two notions, such as [[Lawrence Lessig]]'s argument that "The problem for law is to work out how the norms of the two communities are to apply given that the subject to whom they apply may be in both places at once" (Lessig, Code 190).

With the internationalism of the Internet, [[jurisdiction]] is a much more tricky area than before, and courts in different countries have taken various views on whether they have jurisdiction over items published on the Internet, or business agreements entered into over the Internet. This can cover areas from contract law, trading standards and tax, through rules on [[Security cracking|unauthorized access]], [[data privacy]] and [[spamming]] to more political areas such as freedom of speech, censorship, libel or sedition.

Certainly, the frontier idea that the law does not apply in "[[Cyberspace]]" is not true. In fact, conflicting laws from different jurisdictions may apply, simultaneously, to the same event. The Internet does not tend to make geographical and jurisdictional boundaries clear, but Internet users remain in physical jurisdictions and are subject to laws independent of their presence on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Trout, B. (2007). "Cyber Law: A Legal Arsenal For Online Business", New York: World Audience, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a single transaction may involve the laws of at least three jurisdictions:
# the laws of the state/nation in which the user resides,
# the laws of the state/nation that apply where the server hosting the transaction is located, and
# the laws of the state/nation which apply to the person or business with whom the transaction takes place.
So a user in one of the United States conducting a transaction with another user in Britain through a server in Canada could theoretically be subject to the laws of all three countries as they relate to the transaction at hand.&lt;ref&gt;Emerging Technologies and the Law:  Forms and Analysis, by [[Richard Raysman]], Peter Brown, Jeffrey D. Neuburger and William E. Bandon, III.  Law Journal Press, 2002-2008.  {{ISBN|1-58852-107-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practical terms, a user of the Internet is subject to the laws of the state or nation within which he or she goes online. Thus, in the U.S., [[Jake Baker]] faced criminal charges for his e-conduct, and numerous users of peer-to-peer [[file-sharing]] software were subject to civil lawsuits for [[copyright infringement]]. This system runs into conflicts, however, when these suits are international in nature. Simply put, legal conduct in one nation may be decidedly illegal in another. In fact, even different standards concerning the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in a civil case can cause jurisdictional problems. For example, an American celebrity, claiming to be insulted by an online American magazine, faces a difficult task of winning a lawsuit against that magazine for [[libel]]. But if the celebrity has ties, economic or otherwise, to England, he or she can sue for libel in the British court system, where the standard of "libelous speech" is far lower.

[[Internet governance]] is a live issue in international fora such as the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), and the role of the current US-based co-ordinating body, the [[ICANN|Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) was discussed in the UN-sponsored [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) in December 2003

==Internet law==

The [[law]] that regulates the Internet must be considered in the context of the geographic scope of the Internet and political borders that are crossed in the process of sending data around the globe. The unique global structure of the [[Internet]] raises not only jurisdictional issues, that is, the authority to make and enforce laws affecting the Internet, but also questions concerning the nature of the laws themselves.

In their essay "Law and Borders &amp;ndash; The Rise of Law in Cyberspace", [[David R. Johnson]] and [[David G. Post]] argue that it became necessary for the Internet to govern itself and instead of obeying the laws of a particular country, "Internet citizens" will obey the laws of electronic entities like service providers. Instead of identifying as a physical person, Internet citizens will be known by their usernames or email addresses (or, more recently, by their Facebook accounts). Over time, suggestions that the Internet can be self-regulated as being its own trans-national "nation" are being supplanted by a multitude of external and internal regulators and forces, both governmental and private, at many different levels. The nature of Internet law remains a legal [[paradigm shift]], very much in the process of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cli.org/X0025_LBFIN.html|title=Law and Borders - The Rise of Law in Cyberspace|publisher=Cli.org|accessdate=2013-11-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507070939/http://www.cli.org/X0025_LBFIN.html|archivedate=2008-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving aside the most obvious examples of governmental content monitoring and [[internet censorship]] in nations like [[China]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iran]], there are four primary forces or modes of regulation of the Internet derived from a socioeconomic theory referred to as [[Pathetic dot theory]] by [[Lawrence Lessig]] in his book, ''[[Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace]]'':
#'''Law''': What Lessig calls "Standard East Coast Code", from laws enacted by government in Washington D.C. This is the most self-evident of the four modes of regulation.  As the numerous United States statutes, codes, regulations, and evolving case law make clear, many actions on the Internet are already subject to conventional laws, both with regard to transactions conducted on the Internet and content posted.  Areas like gambling, child pornography, and fraud are regulated in very similar ways online as off-line.  While one of the most controversial and unclear areas of evolving laws is the determination of what forum has subject matter jurisdiction over activity (economic and other) conducted on the internet, particularly as cross border transactions affect local jurisdictions, it is certainly clear that substantial portions of internet activity are subject to traditional regulation, and that conduct that is unlawful off-line is presumptively unlawful online, and subject to traditional enforcement of similar laws and regulations.  
#'''Architecture''': What Lessig calls "West Coast Code", from the programming code of the [[Silicon Valley]]. These mechanisms concern the parameters of how information can and cannot be transmitted across the Internet.  Everything from internet filtering software (which searches for keywords or specific URLs and blocks them before they can even appear on the computer requesting them), to encryption programs, to the very basic architecture of TCP/IP protocols and user interfaces falls within this category of mainly private regulation.  It is arguable that all other modes of internet regulation either rely on, or are significantly affected by, West Coast Code.
#'''Norms''': As in all other modes of social interaction, conduct is regulated by social norms and conventions in significant ways.  While certain activities or kinds of conduct online may not be specifically prohibited by the code architecture of the Internet, or expressly prohibited by traditional governmental law, nevertheless these activities or conduct are regulated by the standards of the community in which the activity takes place, in this case internet "users".   Just as certain patterns of conduct will cause an individual to be ostracized from our real world society, so too certain actions will be censored or self-regulated by the norms of whatever community one chooses to associate with on the internet. 
#'''Markets''': Closely allied with regulation by social norms, markets also regulate certain patterns of conduct on the Internet.  While economic markets will have limited influence over non-commercial portions of the Internet, the Internet also creates a virtual marketplace for information, and such information affects everything from the comparative valuation of services to the traditional valuation of stocks.  In addition, the increase in popularity of the Internet as a means for transacting all forms of commercial activity, and as a forum for advertisement, has brought the laws of supply and demand to cyberspace. Market forces of supply and demand also affect connectivity to the Internet, the cost of bandwidth, and the availability of software to facilitate the creation, posting, and use of internet content.

These forces or regulators of the Internet do not act independently of each other. For example, governmental laws may be influenced by greater societal norms, and markets affected by the nature and quality of the code that operates a particular system.

===Net neutrality===
Another major area of interest is [[net neutrality]], which affects the regulation of the infrastructure of the Internet.  Though not obvious to most Internet users, every packet of data sent and received by every user on the Internet passes through routers and transmission infrastructure owned by a collection of private and public entities, including telecommunications companies, universities, and governments.  This is turning into one of the most critical aspects of cyber Law and has immediate jurisdictional implications, as laws in force in one jurisdiction have the potential to have dramatic effects in other jurisdictions when host servers or telecommunications companies are affected.
Very recently, Netherlands became the first country in Europe and the second in the world, after Chile to pass law relating to it. In U.S, on 12 March 2015, the FCC released the specific details of its new net neutrality rule.And on 13 April 2015, the FCC published the final rule on its new regulations

=== Free speech on the Internet ===
Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] calls for the protection of [[free expression]] in all media.

In comparison to traditional print-based media, the accessibility and relative anonymity of cyber space has torn down traditional barriers between an individual and his or her ability to publish. Any person with an internet connection has the potential to reach an audience of millions.
These complexities have taken many forms, three notable examples being the [[Jake Baker]] incident, in which the limits of obscene Internet postings were at issue, the controversial distribution of the [[DeCSS]] code, and [[Gutnick v Dow Jones]], in which libel laws were considered in the context of online publishing.  The last example was particularly significant because it epitomized the complexities inherent to applying one country's laws (nation-specific by definition) to the internet (international by nature).  In 2003, [[Jonathan Zittrain]] considered this issue in his paper, "Be Careful What You Ask For: Reconciling a Global Internet and Local Law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=395300|title=Be Careful What You Ask For: Reconciling a Global Internet and Local Law|first=Jonathan|last=Zittrain|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the case of [[Keith-Smith v Williams]] confirmed that existing [[libel]] laws applied to internet discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/story/0,,1737445,00.html|title=Warning to chatroom users after libel award for man labelled a Nazi|first=Owen|last=Gibson|date=March 23, 2006|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the [[tort]] liability of ISPs and hosts of internet forums, Section 230(c) of the [[Communications Decency Act]] may provide immunity in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Myers KS| title=Wikimmunity: Fitting the Communications Decency Act to Wikipedia  | newspaper=[[Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology]]  | volume=20 | page=163 | date=Fall 2006 | ssrn=916529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet censorship===
{{main|Internet censorship}}
In many countries, speech through cyberspace has proven to be another means of communication which has been regulated by the government.  The "Open Net Initiative",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opennetinitiative.net |title=opennetinitiative.net |publisher=opennetinitiative.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose mission statement is "to investigate and challenge state filtration and surveillance practices" to "...generate a credible picture of these practices," has released numerous reports documenting the filtration of internet-speech in various countries.  While [[China]] has thus far proven to be the most rigorous in its attempts to filter unwanted parts of the internet from its citizens,&lt;ref name="ONIChina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opennetinitiative.net/studies/china/|title=All Content related to China|publisher=OpenNet Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; many other countries &amp;ndash; including [[Singapore]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Tunisia]] &amp;ndash; have engaged in similar practices of [[Internet censorship]].  In one of the most vivid examples of information control, the Chinese government for a short time transparently forwarded requests to the [[Google]] search engine to its own, state-controlled search engines.

These examples of filtration bring to light many underlying questions concerning the freedom of speech. For example, does the government have a legitimate role in limiting access to information?  And if so, what forms of regulation are acceptable? For example, some argue that the blocking of "[[blogspot]]" and other websites in [[India]]  failed to reconcile the conflicting interests of speech and expression on the one hand and legitimate government concerns on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaronkellylaw.com/internet-law/free-speech-implications-of-blocking-blog-posts-in-india/ Free Speech Implications Of Blocking Blog Posts In India], taken from [http://www.aaronkellylaw.com/ Aaron Kelly Internet Law Firm], Retrieved December 05, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The creation of privacy in U.S. Internet law ==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=June 2017}}

===Warren and Brandeis===
At the close of the 19th century, concerns about [[privacy]] captivated the general public, and led to the 1890 publication of Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis: "The Right to Privacy".&lt;ref&gt;Warren &amp; Louis Brandeis, The Right to Privacy , 4 Harv. L. Rev. 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;  The vitality of this article can be seen today, when examining the USSC decision of ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'', 533 U.S. 27 (2001) where it is cited by the majority, those in concurrence, and even those in dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Solove, D.,Schwartz, P.. (2009). Privacy, Information, and Technology. (2nd Ed.). New York, NY: Aspen Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-7355-7910-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation of both authors to write such an article is heavily debated amongst scholars, however, two developments during this time give some insight to the reasons behind it. First, the sensationalistic press and the concurrent rise and use of "[[yellow journalism]]" to promote the sale of newspapers in the time following the Civil War brought privacy to the forefront of the public eye. The other reason that brought privacy to the forefront of public concern was the technological development of "[[instant photography]]". This article set the stage for all privacy legislation to follow during the 20 and 21st centuries.

===Reasonable Expectation of Privacy Test and emerging technology===
In 1967, the United States Supreme Court decision in ''Katz v United States'', 389 U.S. 347 (1967) established what is known as the Reasonable Expectation of Privacy Test to determine the applicability of the Fourth Amendment in a given situation. It should be noted that the test was not noted by the majority, but instead it was articulated by the concurring opinion of Justice Harlan. Under this test, 1) a person must exhibit an "actual (subjective) expectation of privacy" and 2) "the expectation [must] be one that society is prepared to recognize as 'reasonable'".

===Privacy Act of 1974===
{{further information|Privacy Act of 1974}}
Inspired by the [[Watergate scandal]], the [[United States Congress]] enacted the Privacy Act of 1974 just four months after the resignation of then President [[Richard Nixon]]. In passing this Act, Congress found that "the privacy of an individual is directly affected by the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal information by Federal agencies" and that "the increasing use of computers and sophisticated information technology, while essential to the efficient operations of the Government, has greatly magnified the harm to individual privacy that can occur from any collection, maintenance, use, or dissemination of personal information".

===Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978===
{{further information|Foreign Intelligence Act}}
Codified at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1811, this act establishes standards and procedures for use of electronic surveillance to collect "foreign intelligence" within the United States. §1804(a)(7)(B). FISA overrides the Electronic Communications Privacy Act during investigations when foreign intelligence is "a significant purpose" of said investigation. {{usc|50|1804}}(a)(7)(B) and §1823(a)(7)(B). Another interesting result of FISA, is the creation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). All FISA orders are reviewed by this special court of federal district judges. The FISC meets in secret, with all proceedings usually also held from both the public eye and those targets of the desired surveillance.&lt;br&gt;

===(1986) Electronic Communication Privacy Act===
The ECPA represents an effort by the United States Congress to modernize federal wiretap law. The ECPA amended Title III (see: [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]]) and included two new acts in response to developing computer technology and communication networks. Thus the ECPA in the domestic venue into three parts: 1) Wiretap Act, 2) Stored Communications Act, and 3) The Pen Register Act.

::*Types of Communication
::**	'''Wire Communication:'''  Any communication containing the human voice that travels at some point across a wired medium such as radio, satellite or cable.
::**	'''Oral Communication:'''
::**	'''Electronic Communication'''

===(1994) Driver's Privacy Protection Act===
The DPPA was passed in response to states selling motor vehicle records to private industry. These records contained personal information such as name, address, phone number, SSN, medical information, height, weight, gender, eye color, photograph and date of birth. In 1994, Congress passed the Driver's Privacy Protection (DPPA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 2721-2725, to cease this activity.&lt;br&gt;
For more information see: [[Driver's Privacy Protection Act]]

===(1999) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act===
-This act authorizes widespread sharing of personal information by financial institutions such as banks, insurers, and investment companies. The GLBA permits sharing of personal information between companies joined together or affiliated as well as those companies unaffiliated. To protect privacy, the act requires a variety of agencies such as the SEC, FTC, etc. to establish "appropriate standards for the financial institutions subject to their jurisdiction" to "insure security and confidentiality of customer records and information" and "protect against unauthorized access" to this information. {{usc|15|6801}}&lt;br&gt;
For more information see: [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]]

===(2002) Homeland Security Act===
-Passed by Congress in 2002, the Homeland Security Act, {{usc|6|222}}, consolidated 22 federal agencies into what is commonly known today as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The HSA, also created a Privacy Office under the DoHS. The Secretary of Homeland Security must "appoint a senior official to assume primary responsibility for privacy policy." This privacy official's responsibilities include but are not limited to: ensuring compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, evaluating "legislative and regulatory proposals involving the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by the Federal Government", while also preparing an annual report to Congress.&lt;br&gt;
For more information see: [[Homeland Security Act]]

===(2004) Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act===
-This Act mandates that intelligence be "provided in its most shareable form" that the heads of intelligence agencies and federal departments "promote a culture of information sharing." The IRTPA also sought to establish protection of privacy and civil liberties by setting up a five-member Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. This Board offers advice to both the President of the United States and the entire executive branch of the Federal Government concerning its actions to ensure that the branch's information sharing policies are adequately protecting privacy and civil liberties.&lt;br&gt;

==Legal enactments – examples==

===Great Britain===
The [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/internetcrime/compmisuse.html |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; Internet Crime - The Computer Misuse Act 1990 |publisher=Homeoffice.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050301195700/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/internetcrime/compmisuse.html |archivedate=2005-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; enacted by [[Great Britain]] on 29 June 1990, and which came into force on 29 August 1990, is an example of one of the earliest of such legal enactments. This Act was enacted with an express purpose of making "provision for securing computer material against unauthorized access or modification." Certain major provisions of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 relate to:
*"unauthorized access to computer materials",
*"unauthorized access with intent to commit or facilitate the commission of further offences", and
*"unauthorized modification of computer material."

The impact of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 has been limited and with the adoption of the Council of Europe adopts its Convention on Cyber-Crime, it has been indicated that amending legislation would be introduced in parliamentary session 2004–05 in order to rectify possible gaps in its coverage, which are many.

The CMA 1990 has many weaknesses; the most notable is its inability to cater for, or provide suitable protection against, a host of high tech attacks/crimes which have become more prevalent in the last decade.  Certain attacks such as DDOS and BOTNET attacks can not be effectively brought to justice under the CMA.  This act has been under review for a number of years.  Computer crimes such as electronic theft are usually prosecuted in the UK under the legislation that caters for traditional theft ([[Theft Act 1968]]), because the CMA is so ineffective.

===India===
{{Main|Information Technology Act 2000}}
An example of information technology law is India's [[Information Technology Act 2000|Information Technology Act, 2000]], which was substantially amended in 2008. The IT Act, 2000 came into force on 17 October 2000.  This Act applies to whole of India, and its provisions also apply to any offense or contravention, committed even outside the territorial jurisdiction of [[Republic of India]], by any person irrespective of his [[citizen|nationality]]. In order to attract provisions of this Act, such an offence or contravention should involve a computer, computer system, or computer network located in India. The IT Act 2000 provides an extraterritorial applicability to its provisions by virtue of section 1(2) read with section 75. This Act has 90 sections.

India's The Information Technology Act 2000 has tried to assimilate legal principles available in several such laws (relating to information technology) enacted earlier in several other countries, as also various guidelines pertaining to information technology law. The Act gives legal validity to electronic contracts, recognition of electronic signatures. This is a modern legislation which makes acts like hacking, data theft, spreading of virus, identity theft, defamation (sending offensive messages) pornography, child pornography, cyber terrorism, a criminal offence. The Act is supplemented by a number of rules which includes rules for, cyber cafes, electronic service delivery, data security, blocking of websites. It also has rules for observance of due diligence by internet intermediaries (ISP's, network service providers,cyber cafes, etc.). Any person affected by data theft, hacking, spreading of viruses can apply for compensation from Adjudicator appointed under Section 46 as well as file a criminal complaint. Appeal from adjudicator lies to [[Cyber Appellate Tribunal]].

====Notable cases====

=====Section 66=====
* In February 2001, in one of the first cases, the Delhi police arrested two men running a [[web-hosting]] company. The company had shut down a website over non-payment of dues. The owner of the site had claimed that he had already paid and complained to the police. The Delhi police had charged the men for hacking under Section 66 of the IT Act and breach of trust under Section 408 of the [[Indian Penal Code]]. The two men had to spend 6 days in [[Tihar jail]] waiting for bail. Bhavin Turakhia, chief executive officer of directi.com, a webhosting firm said that this interpretation of the law would be problematic for web-hosting companies.&lt;ref name=Wasnt&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyber crime that wasn't?|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2001/feb/19cyber.htm|accessdate=14 April 2015|work=[[Rediff]]|date=19 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989''' is  an [[International Labour Organization]] [[List of International Labour Organization Conventions|Convention]], also known as ILO-convention 169, or C169. It is the major binding international convention concerning [[indigenous peoples]], and a forerunner of the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].

It was established in 1989, with the preamble stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Noting the international standards contained in the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention and Recommendation, 1957, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recalling the terms of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the many [[international human rights instruments|international instruments]] on the prevention of discrimination, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Considering that the developments which have taken place in international law since 1957, as well as developments in the situation of indigenous and tribal peoples in all regions of the world, have made it appropriate to adopt new international standards on the subject with a view to removing the assimilationist orientation of the earlier standards, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recognising the aspirations of these peoples to exercise control over their own institutions, ways of life and economic development and to maintain and develop their identities, languages and religions, within the framework of the States in which they live, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Noting that in many parts of the world these peoples are unable to enjoy their fundamental human rights to the same degree as the rest of the population of the States within which they live, and that their laws, values, customs and perspectives have often been eroded, and...&lt;ref name=ILO&gt;ILO [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040113043852/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/convdisp1.htm Convention C169]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Document==

The convention is made of a Preamble, followed by forty-four articles, divided in ten parts. These are:

*Part I. General Policy
*Part II. Land
*Part III. Recruitment And Conditions Of Employment
*Part IV. Vocational Training, Handicrafts And Rural Industries
*Part V. Social Security And Health
*Part VI. Education And Means Of Communication
*Part VII. Contacts And Co-operation Across Borders
*Part VIII. Administration
*Part IX. General Provisions
*Part X. Final Provisions

== Modifications ==

This Convention revised Convention C107, the [[Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, 1957]].  Some of the nations ratifying the 1989 Convention "denounced" the 1957 Convention.

==Purpose and history==

The ILO 169 convention is the most important operative international law guaranteeing the rights of indigenous peoples. Its strength, however, is dependent on a high number of ratifications among nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Indigenous Peoples and Governance Structures: A Comparative Analysis of Land and Resource Management Rights |last=Nettheim |first=Garth |publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-85575-379-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Rights in Natural Resource Development: Public Participation in the Sustainable Development of Mining and Energy Resources |last=N.

The revision to the Convention 107 forbade governments from pursuing approaches deemed integrationist and assimilationist.&lt;ref name=JuriculturalPluralism&gt;{{cite book |title=Juricultural Pluralism Vis-a-Vis Treaty Law:State Practice and Attitudes  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqnbAdWJ-QIC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Juricultural+Pluralism+Vis-a-Vis+Treaty+Law:State+Practice+and+Attitudes&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=integration%20and%20assimilation&amp;f=false |last=Bunn-Livingstone |first=Sandra |publisher=Springer |year=2002 |isbn=90-411-1801-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It asserts the rights of indigenous peoples to choose to integrate or to maintain their cultural and political independence. Articles 8–10 recognize the cultures, traditions, and special circumstances of indigenous tribal peoples.

In November 2009, a court decision in [[Chile]], considered to be a landmark in indigenous rights concerns, made use of the ILO convention law. The court ruled unanimously in favor of granting a water flow of 9 liters per second to Chusmiza and Usmagama communities.  The legal dispute had dragged for 14 years, and centers on community water rights in one of the driest deserts on the planet. The Supreme Court decision on [[Aymara people|Aymara]] water rights upholds rulings by both the [[Pozo Almonte]] tribunal and the [[Iquique]] Court of Appeals, and marks the first judicial application of ILO Convention 169 in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiagotimes.cl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17739:chiles-supreme-court-upholds-indigenous-water-use-rights&amp;catid=19:other&amp;Itemid=142 |title=Chile’s Supreme Court Upholds Indigenous Water Use Rights |publisher=The Santiago Times |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this decision, some protests had escalated over the failure to respect the Convention 169 in Chile. [[Mapuche]] leaders filed an injunction against [[Michelle Bachelet]]&lt;!--who?  need to expand--&gt; and minister of the presidency [[José Antonio Viera Gallo]], who is also coordinator of indigenous affairs, with the argument that the government had failed to fully comply with the Convention 169 clause on the right to "prior consultation," which must be carried out "in good faith and in a form appropriate to the circumstances, with the objective of achieving agreement or consent to the proposed measures," such as logging, agribusiness or mining projects in indigenous territories. There were already several examples of the successful use of the ILO Convention in Chile, like the case of a [[Machi (shaman)|Machi]] woman who brought legal action to protect a plot of land with herbs used for medicinal purposes, which was threatened by the forest industry. Some concerns were however raised at the time over the political framework of the government being brought in line with the convention, and not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48761 |title=CHILE: Indigenous Protests on Several Fronts |publisher=IPS |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027130228/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48761 |archivedate=2009-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Curtis graduated from [[Peabody Magnet High School|Peabody High School]] in Alexandria and [[Grambling State University]] in [[Grambling, Louisiana|Grambling]] in [[Lincoln Parish, Louisiana|Lincoln Parish]], from which he gained a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree. He obtained a [[master's degree]] from [[Northwestern State University]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], Louisiana, and he did further graduate studies at [[Texas Christian University]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], the historically black [[Southern University]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], and [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]], [[Michigan]]. After high school, Curtis served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] and was a long-term member of the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]]. For more than two decades after he completed Grambling University, Curtis was a teacher and coach in Rapides Parish. He retired from the classroom to become manager and funeral director of the Winnfield Life Insurance Company of Alexandria. He was a personal bodyguard for [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], when the [[civil rights]] [[Activism|activist]] visited Alexandria.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Dixon formerly resided in [[Dallas]] and [[Duncanville, Texas|Duncanville]], [[Texas]], and [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]], Louisiana, dates not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelius.com/results.php?ReportType=1&amp;formname=name&amp;qf=Israel&amp;qmi=&amp;qn=Curtis&amp;qcs=Alexandria%2C+LA&amp;focusfirst=1|title=Israel Benjamin Curtis|publisher=intelius.com|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his wife, Barbara Jean Curtis (born 1934), Dixon had two children, Andrea Yvette Curtis (born 1958) and Benjamin Frederick Curtis (born 1963). He was a long-time choir member and [[deacon]] of the Nazarene Missionary Baptist Church in Alexandria. He was an active member of the Grambling University Alumni Association.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Political life==
In his first election to the Louisiana House in the November 16, 1991 [[general election]] Curtis, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate Robert "Bob" Jordan, 6,810 (53.6 percent) to 5,901 (46.4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11161991/11161991_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana general election returns, November 16, 1991|publisher=[[Louisiana Secretary of State]]|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first reelection in 1995, Curtis defeated another Republican, Willard Adrian "Willie" Harp (born November 1956), 5,736 (67.5 percent) to 2,001 (23.5 percent). A third candidate held the remaining 9 percent of the ballots cast. Harp had also run for the seat in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10211995/10211995_MultiParish.html|title=Louisiana primary election returns, October 21, 1995|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last election to the legislature on November 15, 2003, Curtis defeated in a [[runoff election|runoff contest]] fellow African-American Alexandria Democrat, [[Herbert Dixon (Louisiana politician)|Herbert B. Dixon]], 5,512 (53 percent) to 4,892 (47 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11152003/11152003_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana general election returns, November 15, 2003|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his sixteen years in the state House of Representatives, Curtis focused on constituent service and health care matters. He led the move to build the Rapides Primary Healthcare Center at 1217 Willow Glen River Road in Alexandria.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

From 1976 to 1992, Dixon was the District D member of the [[Rapides Parish School Board]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; His successor on the school board and in the legislature was his former intra-party rival, Herbert Dixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10202007/10202007_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana primary election returns, October 20, 2007|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10031992/10031992_40.html|title=Louisiana primary election returns, October 3, 1992|publisher=Louisiana Secretary of State|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtis died in 2012 at the age of seventy-nine and is interred at Alexandria Memorial Gardens.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=findagrave&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Curtis&amp;GSfn=Israel&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSst=20&amp;GScnty=1148&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=85698286&amp;df=all&amp;|title=Israel "Bo" Curtis|publisher=findagrave.com|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Curtis-Coleman Memorial Bridge, still under construction atop the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] at Alexandria-Pineville, was named in 2014 for Curtis and Lemon "Billy" Coleman (1935-2015), the first black to have served on the Pineville City Council. The bridge was previously named for [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[O. K. Allen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2015/08/18/trailblazer-coleman--surely-missed/31924825/|title=Trailblazer Coleman ‘will surely be missed’|author=Jeff Matthews|date=August 18, 2015|publisher=''The Alexandria Town Talk''|accessdate=August 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, expenses related to the carrying-on of a business or trade are deductible from a United States taxpayer's [[adjusted gross income]].&lt;ref name="Internal Revenue Code § 162a"&gt;Internal Revenue Code § 162(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  For many taxpayers, this means that expenses related to seeking new employment, including some relevant expenses incurred for the taxpayer's education,&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Regulations § 1.162-5&lt;/ref&gt; can be deducted, resulting in a [[tax break]], as long as certain criteria are met.

First, such costs must qualify as expenses, as contemplated by the U.S. tax code, and not as [[capital expenditures]] (generally, a [[capital expenditure]] is a cost associated with producing a benefit with a useful life of more than one year, such as a long-term investment).&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code § 263&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, if the cost qualifies as an expense, it may be deductible if it can be characterized as an "ordinary and necessary expense paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business...."&lt;ref name="Internal Revenue Code § 162a"/&gt;  For purposes of the average taxpayer looking to deduct expenses related to seeking new employment, the relevant inquiry is whether the new position sought can be deemed to be "carrying on" the prior business or trade of that taxpayer,&lt;ref&gt;''See McDonald v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue'', 323 U.S. 57, 60 (1944); ''Estate of Rockefeller v. Commissioner'', 762 F.2d 264, 268 (2d Cir. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; as costs associated with starting up a new business or trade are not immediately deductible and are subject to a special form of [[amortization]].&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code § 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether seeking new employment, and the costs associated therewith, can be deemed as "carrying on" a prior business or trade is fact- and context-specific.  However, the IRS, with approval of the courts, has insisted on a high degree of sameness between the new position sought and the previous means of employment.&lt;ref&gt;''Estate of Rockefeller'', 762 F.2d at 268&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that if substantial differences exist between the duties, tasks, and activities of the taxpayer's prior job and those of the job he now seeks,&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 268–69 (and cited cases)&lt;/ref&gt; then the expenses incurred will be deemed to be start-up costs, and not subject to immediate deduction.&lt;ref&gt;''See Id.'' at 269 (quoting ''Davis v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue'', 65 T.C. 1014, 1019 (1976))&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, if the taxpayer has undergone a significant hiatus between the prior position of employment and the one now sought, expenses will not be considered "carrying on" the business or trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 270 (and cited references)&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, whether a hiatus would be considered significant is highly fact- and context-specific.  The relevant inquiry here should be whether there is a "substantial lack of continuity."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  If the taxpayer terminated his previous employment with little indication of seeking a new position in the same profession, it is likely that time spent unemployed or employed in a different field would prevent the taxpayer from claiming that he was "carrying on" his prior business or trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ability to deduct the costs of seeking new employment is a distinct advantage for many taxpayers, but one likely to be overlooked.  To recap, a taxpayer may only deduct the costs associated with seeking new employment when that taxpayer is searching for a new employer in substantially the same profession.  Further, a significant hiatus between jobs may bar claiming this type of deduction.

'''John Sparks''' (August 30, 1843 – May 22, 1908) was an American [[politician]]. He was the [[List of Governors of Nevada|tenth Governor]] of [[Nevada]], and was [[nickname]]d '''Honest John'''. Like his predecessor, [[Reinhold Sadler]], Sparks was a cattleman and his rise to political power was evidence of the decline of the mining industry and the rise of the ranching industry in Nevada. He was a member of the [[Silver Party|Silver]] – [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sparks was born on August 30, 1843 in [[Winston County, Mississippi]]. His family was one of those known as "new lands families", who specialized in developing land on the frontier and then selling out and moving on as settlement in the area increased. His family followed the frontier through [[Arkansas]], moving on to [[Texas]] in 1857 by which point they were moderately wealthy. In Texas they began ranching [[cattle]], and John became a proficient [[cowboy]].

===Cattleman career===
In 1861, Sparks joined the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], probably to avoid being drafted into the [[Confederate Army]]. His unit was tasked with protecting settlers from the [[Comanche]], and he did not fight in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the war, Sparks drove cattle in the huge [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Longhorn]] drives of the era, at first working for John Meyers, and later in partnership with his brothers. In 1872, Sparks married Rachel Knight and they had two daughters, Maude and Rachel.

In 1873, Sparks bought a large herd of cattle in Texas then drove them to [[Wyoming]] and established a ranch in the [[Chugwater River]] valley near [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]]. He sold that ranch and its 2,100 head of cattle the next year to the Swan Brothers. After that, Sparks established a series of ranches along the [[North Platte River]], each of which he quickly sold and invested the money in the next ranch.  Sparks also invested in a bank in [[Georgetown, Texas]] (his wife's hometown), where he also built a mansion. In 1879 his wife died, and in 1880 Sparks married her half-sister Nancy Elnora "Nora" Knight, they had three sons, Benton, Charles and Leland.

By that time there was no unclaimed rangeland left east of the Rockies, and Sparks cast his eye further west. Joining with fellow Texan John Tinnin, Sparks bought the H-D Ranch in the Thousand Springs Valley north of [[Elko, Nevada]] in 1881. In 1883 Sparks-Tinnin purchased all of [[Jasper Harrell]]'s ranches for $900,000.  At that time, the Harrell ranches consisted of approximately 30,000 head of cattle ranging over a vast area of Nevada and [[Idaho]].  Very little of that land was owned outright. Sparks-Tinnin would obtain small portions of land surrounding a water source, and then deny other operations use of that water. This allowed it to control vast areas of public land that it did not own. Sparks-Tinnin would have an employee file for a [[Homestead Act|homestead]] on the land that it wished to own, and then sell that land back to the company, as an individual could only file for one homestead in a lifetime. At its peak, Sparks-Tinnin was said to control 6% of the land in Nevada.

In 1885, Sparks moved to his 1,640 acre (6.64 km²) Alamo Ranch, located in the Steamboat Springs area just south of [[Reno, Nevada]]. There he built a "hobby" herd of pure-blood [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] cattle.  Sparks became famous at western livestock auctions by paying ridiculous sums for pedigreed Hereford cattle. By purchasing stock from other breeders rather than breeding his own, Sparks' herd was soon unbeatable at livestock shows. Sparks' sale of lesser cattle from his herd helped establish the Hereford as the dominant breed in Nevada. Sparks also raised "exotic" animals such as [[bison]] and [[deer]] at the Alamo Ranch.

The Sparks-Tinnin operation continued to grow throughout the 1880s until it, like all other western cattle operations, suffered a severe setback in the harsh winter of 1889-1890. During that winter the temperature reached −42 degrees Fahrenheit (−41 degrees Celsius) in Elko, and the range was covered in deep snow from January through March. At that time most large cattle operations in Nevada kept their cattle on the open range year round, with no supplemental feed in the winter. Losses of cattle on the range were catastrophic. In the spring of 1890 it was reported that one could walk for a hundred miles along the [[Humboldt River]] on cow carcasses, and floating carcasses jammed against bridges in Elko, causing flooding. Sparks later stated that of his herd of about  45,000 head, only 15,000 survived.  He also claimed that of the survivors, 90% had the "white faces characteristic of Herefords". These were probably the descendents of Longhorn brood cows and Hereford bulls.  As range cattle operations of the day typically ran one bull per twenty brood cows it was far cheaper to improve an existing herd by replacing the bulls then by creating a whole new herd. The survival rate of these Hereford/Longhorn crosses was ascribed to the superior qualities of the Hereford, however [[hybrid vigor]] may have played a role.

Following the winter of 1889-1890, Tinnin could no longer make his mortgage payments to Jasper Harrell, and Harrell took over his shares. Sparks-Tinnin was renamed Sparks-Harrell. Between his expenditures on the Alamo Ranch, and losses in mining speculation, Sparks also ran into financial trouble, and sold his half of Sparks-Harrell back to Jasper Harrell in 1901.

===Political career===
After an unsuccessful Senate run, Sparks was elected Governor of Nevada in 1902, and re-elected in 1906. During this administration a state railroad commission was formed; the [[Nevada State Police]] was organized; an [[eight-hour work day]] bill for miners was passed; and a state engineering office was created. 

In 1904, the town of Harriman, Nevada in [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]] was renamed [[Sparks, Nevada|Sparks]] after the governor.

Sparks died while still in his second term in office on May 22, 1908. At the time of his death he was reportedly broke, and the Alamo Ranch was immediately sold to settle his debts.

===Memorium===
The [[Alamo Ranchhouse]], a portion of Sparks' Alamo Ranch, survives and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

'''Newzbin''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Usenet]] indexing website, intended to facilitate access to content on Usenet. The site caused controversy over its stance on [[copyright]]ed material. Access to the Newzbin.com website was blocked by [[BT Group|BT]] and [[Sky Broadband|Sky]] in late 2011, following legal action in the UK by [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film studios.&lt;ref name = "block" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "sky_block" /&gt;

The site announced  that it had closed down on 28 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20540853# Piracy site Newzbin2 gives up and closes 15 months after block] ''BBC News'', 29 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Newzbin indexed [[binary file]]s that have been posted on [[Usenet]], and offered the results through a [[Web search engine|search engine]], with categories that included "Movies", "Music", "Apps" and "Books".&lt;ref name = "review"&gt;[http://www.newsgroupreviews.com/newzbin-review.html Newzbin Review] Retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.imgur.com/VHEJa.png Newzbin.com site interface] Retrieved 19 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The site created [[NZB]] files, which allowed the files to be downloaded with a suitable [[Newsreader (Usenet)|newsreader]].&lt;ref name = "ars" /&gt; NZB files are similar to [[torrent file]]s, as they do not contain the file itself, but information about the location of the file to be downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifehacker.com/5601586/how-to-get-started-with-usenet-in-three-simple-steps How to Get Started with Usenet in Three Simple Steps] Lifehacker.com.

==2010 legal action from Hollywood studios==
In February and March 2010, [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation]], [[Universal Studios|Universal City Studios Productions LLLP]], [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Pictures Corporation]], [[Disney Enterprises, Inc.]] and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.]] took joint legal action against Newzbin in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in [[London]], arguing that the site was encouraging widespread [[copyright infringement]] by indexing unofficial copies of films on Usenet.&lt;ref name = "bailii" /&gt;

In March 2010, [[David Kitchin|Mr. Justice Kitchin]] ruled that Newzbin was deliberately indexing copyrighted content, observing that Newzbin had a "sophisticated and substantial infrastructure and in the region of 700,000 members, though not all premium", and that "for the year ended 31 December 2009, it had a turnover in excess of £1million, a profit in excess of £360,000 and paid dividends on ordinary shares of £415,000".&lt;ref name = "bailii"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Universal City Studios Productions LLLP, Warner Bros.

Kitchin was critical of Elsworth, stating that his evidence disputing the claim that the site's features did not encourage copyright infringement was "simply not credible".&lt;ref name = "ars"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/03/usenet-curator-newzbin-hammered-by-uk-court-for-infringement.ars|title=Usenet curator Newzbin hammered by UK court for infringement|date=2010-03-30|publisher=[[Arstechnica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "bailii" /&gt;

On 18 May 2010, the Newzbin.com site was temporarily shut down, displaying the message "Regrettably the Newzbin website has to close as a result of the legal action against us." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oates |first=John|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/19/newzbin_shuts |title=Newzbin goes titsup |publisher=The Register |date=2010-05-19 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2 June 2010, Newzbin was back online, under the name Newzbin2, but using the same code and database as its predecessor, and hosted in the [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref name="seychelles"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14339223 Newzbin: What happens next?] BBC technology news 29 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 legal action and ISP site blocking==
In June 2011, the [[Motion Picture Association]] applied for an [[injunction]] to force [[BT Group|BT]], the largest [[Internet service provider]] in the [[United Kingdom]], to cut off customers' access to Newzbin.&lt;ref name=MPAinjunction&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13927335 Film-makers seek injunction to block pirate site] BBC technology news 28 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July 2011, the High Court ruled that BT had to block access to Newzbin, using [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|Cleanfeed]].&lt;ref name = "bailii_2011"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Universal City Studios Productions LLLP, Warner Bros.

===Closedown===
On 28 November 2012, Newzbin2.es announced the closure of its indexing service, displaying to visitors the following text on its main page:

{{quotation |It is with regret that we announce the closure of Newzbin2.

 A combination of several factors has made this the only option. For a long time we have struggled with poor indexing of Usenet, poor numbers of reports caused by the majority of our editors dropping out &amp; no-one replacing them. Our servers have been unstable and crashing on a regular basis meaning the NZBs &amp; NFOs are unavailable for long periods and we don't have the money to replace them.

 Newzbin2 was always hoped to be a viable underground commercial venture. The figures just don't stack up. Newzbin1 was said to have had 700,000 registered users. In fact that was the total number of people who ever signed up in the history of Newzbin from 2000 onwards &amp; only a fraction were active, loads of people dropped out &amp; went to other sites. We reckon they had about 100,000 users and of those only a few 10's of thousands paid premium topups.That still made good money for the Newzbin1 guys. We never quite got the trust and lots of people said "Newzbin2 is an [[Motion Picture Association|MPA]] trap", that stung us bad and we never got the userbase back. We don't have much more than about 40000 active users and the number of premium users is in the small thousands. It costs much more to run than we bring in, It just doesn't stack up.

 To make things worse all our payment providers dropped out or started running scared. The MPA sued [[PayPal]] and are going at our innocent payment provider Kthxbai Ltd in the UK. Our other payment provider has understandably lost their nerve. Result? We have no more payment providers to offer &amp; no realistic means of taking money (no, [[Bitcoin]] isn't credible as it's just too hard for 90% of people).

 The tragedy is this: unlike Newzbin1 we are 100% [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] compliant. We have acted on every DMCA notice we received without stalling or playing games: if there was a DMCA complaint the report was gone. Period. That was a condition of our advertising &amp; payment partners so we complied but we never got a single complaint from the MPA. Not one.

 Will we be back? not as a search service but we might run a blog from this site at some point.}}

===December 2012 court action against former Newzbin directors===

On 20 December 2012 at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London, Mr Justice Newey ruled that the film studios involved in the legal action against Newzbin did not have a proprietary claim to money derived from infringement of copyright.

Shortly after taking power in 1949, the [[Communist Party of China]] embarked upon a series of campaigns that purportedly eradicated [[prostitution]] from [[mainland China]] by the early 1960s. Since the loosening of government controls over society in the early 1980s, prostitution in mainland China not only has become more visible, but can now be found throughout both [[Urban area|urban]] and rural areas. In spite of government efforts, prostitution has now developed to the extent that it comprises an industry, one that involves a great number of people and produces a considerable [[Output (economics)|economic output]]. Prostitution has also become associated with a number of problems, including [[organized crime]], [[government corruption]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. For example, a Communist Party official who was a top provincial campaigner against corruption was removed from his post after he was caught in a hotel room with a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chinese anti-corruption official sacked for Russian tryst - Asia-Pacific |url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/news/article_1290358.php/Chinese_anti-corruption_official_sacked_for_Russian_tryst |website=[[Monsters and Critics]] |accessdate=18 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929123845/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/news/article_1290358.php/Chinese_anti-corruption_official_sacked_for_Russian_tryst |archivedate=29 September 2007 |date=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution-related activities in mainland China are characterised by diverse types, [[Distribution (business)|venues]] and [[price]]s. Prostitutes themselves come from a broad range of social backgrounds. They are almost all female, though in recent years male prostitutes have also emerged. Venues typically include hotels, [[karaoke]] venues and [[beauty salon]]s.

Officially, prostitution is illegal in mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=25 February 2009 | accessdate=8 May 2009 | publisher=[[United States Department of State]] | url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eap/119037.htm | title=2008 Human Rights Report: China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau) }} Section 5: Discrimination, Societal Abuse, and Trafficking in Persons.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[government of China]] has vacillated, however, in its legal treatment of prostitutes themselves, treating them sometimes as [[crime|criminals]] and sometimes as behaving with [[misconduct]]. Since the reemergence of prostitution in the 1980s, government authorities have responded by first using the [[legal system]], that is, the daily operations of institutions like [[court]]s and police. Second, they have relied on police-led campaigns, clearly delineated periods of intense public activity, as a form of social discipline. Despite lobbying by international [[NGO]]s and overseas commentators, there is not much support for [[legalisation]] of the sex sector by the public, [[social organization]]s or the government of the PRC.

While the sale of sexual intercourse remains illegal throughout mainland China, as of 2013 [[erotic massage]], or more commonly known as massage with "happy endings", is legal in the city of Foshan in Guangdong province. In June of that year, the Foshan Court determined that the sale of erotic massage is not the same as prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/27/china-happy-endings-legal_n_3512037.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Carlo | last=Davis | title='Happy Endings' Just Got A Little Happier In China | date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Prostitution during the Maoist era===
Following the [[Communist Party of China]]'s victory in 1949, local government authorities were charged with the task of eliminating prostitution. One month after the Communist takeover of [[Beijing]] on 3 February 1949, the new [[Municipality of China|municipal government]] under [[Ye Jianying]] announced a policy to control the city's many [[brothel]]s. On 21 November, all 224 of Beijing's establishments were shut down; 1286 prostitutes and 434 owners, procurers, and [[pimp]]s were arrested in the space of 12 hours by an estimated 2400 [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=罗瑞卿一夜扫除北平妓女（附图） |url=http://www.booker.com.cn/gb/paper23/23/class002300006/hwz162063.htm |website=Booker |accessdate=18 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020514193047/http://www.booker.com.cn/gb/paper23/23/class002300006/hwz162063.htm |archivedate=14 May 2002 |date=2000|trans-title=Luo Ruiqing wiped out the Peking prostitute overnight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the enormity of [[social issues]] that had to be addressed, and the limited budgets and human resources of local governments, most cities adopted the slower approach of first controlling and then prohibiting brothel-prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Ma Weigang (1993). 禁娼禁毒 (''On Strictly Forbidding Prostitution and Drugs''). Beijing: Juguan jiaoyu chubanshe. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This method was used in [[Tianjin]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Wuhan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shidong |first1=Sun |title=:: 新中国取缔妓院前后 :: |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/banyt/2005-07/06/content_3181159.htm |website=Xinhua |accessdate=18 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107023246/http://news.xinhuanet.com/banyt/2005-07/06/content_3181159.htm |archivedate=7 January 2006 |date=6 July 2005|trans-title=Before and after the ban on brothels in New China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically it involved a system of governmental administration which controlled brothel activities and discouraged male patrons. The combined effect of such measures was to gradually reduce the number of brothels in each city until the point where a "Beijing-style" closure of the remaining brothels was deemed feasible and [[Re-education through labor|reeducation]] could begin. Reeducation programs were undertaken on the largest scale in [[Shanghai]], where the number of sex workers had grown to 100,000 following the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

By the early 1960s, such measures had basically wiped out visible forms of prostitution from mainland China. According to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] government, venereal diseases were almost completely eliminated from the mainland contemporaneously with the control of prostitution. To mark this victory, all 29 venereal disease research institutes were closed in 1964.

In accordance with [[Marxism|Marxist theory]], women who sold sex were viewed as being forced into prostitution in order to survive. The eradication of prostitution was thus vaunted as one of the major accomplishments of the Communist government and evidence of the primacy of [[Chinese Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Information Office of the State Council|Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China]].

''[[People's Daily]]'', 22 November 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution did not exist as a serious object of concern in China for a period of nearly three decades.

Beijing: 法律出版社 (Legal Press). p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pan Suiming]], one of China's leading experts on prostitution, argues that "invisible" prostitution — in the form of women providing sexual services to cadres in exchange for certain privileges — became a distinctive feature of [[Maoist China]], particularly towards the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]].{{sfn|Suiming|1996|pp=20–21}}

The resurgence of prostitution in mainland China has coincided with the introduction of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s [[Chinese economic reform|liberalisation of Chinese economic policy]] in 1978. According to the incomplete statistics composed on the basis of nationwide crackdowns, the rate of prostitution in China has been rising every year since 1982.{{sfn|Jeffreys|2004|p=97}} Between 1989 and 1990, 243,183 people were apprehended for prostitution-related activities.{{sfn|Xin|1999|pp=1411–1414}} Zhang Ping estimates that such police figures only account for around 25–30 percent of the total number of people who are actually involved.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Ping (1993). "当今中国社会病 Social problems in contemporary China)". ''Jindun'' '''12'''. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is an increasingly large part of the [[economy of China|Chinese economy]], employing perhaps 10&amp;nbsp;million people, with an annual level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of possibly 1&amp;nbsp;trillion [[Renminbi|RMB]].&lt;ref name=Wei&gt;Zhong Wei.

The revival of prostitution was initially associated with China's eastern, coastal cities, but since the early 1990s at least, local media have reported on prostitution scandals in the economic hinterlands, incorporating such remote and underdeveloped regions as [[Yunnan]],&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Hewitt, BBC News: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1775221.stm ''Teenage prostitution case shocks China'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guizhou]], and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffreys|first=Elaine|title=Prostitution Scandals in China: Policing, Media and Society|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OABGgpFzQ20C|isbn=9780415503426}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, the typical seller of sex was a poorly educated, young female rural migrant from populous, relatively remote provinces such as [[Sichuan]] and [[Hunan]]. Over the past decade, there has been a recognition that the majority of women who enter prostitution do so of their own accord.{{sfn|Jeffreys|2004|p=98, note 6}}&lt;ref&gt;Gil, V.E.; Wang, M.S.; Anderson, A.F.; Guo, M.L.; Wu, Z.O.

In a 1997 study, 46.8% of undergraduates in Beijing admitted to having considered receiving prostitution services.{{sfn|Suiming|1999a}} On the demand side, prostitution has been associated with the gender imbalances brought about by the [[one-child policy]].&lt;ref&gt;McCurry, J.; Allison, R.

Prostitution is often directly linked to low-level government corruption. Many local officials believe that encouraging prostitution in recreational business operations will bring economic benefits by developing the tourism and hospitality industries and generating a significant source of tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson A. and Gil V. (1999). "Prostitution and public policy in the People's Republic of China: an analysis of the rehabilitative ideal".''International Criminal Justice Review'' '''4''' (23). p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, police have been implicated in the running of high grade hotels where prostitution activities occur, or accepting bribes and demanding sexual favours to ignore the existence of prostitution activities.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, A. (February 1994). "Prostitution, triads and corruption - Shanghai's dark side". ''Asia, Inc.'' '''32'''. pp. 32–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Government corruption is also involved in a more indirect form — the widespread abuse of public funds to finance consumption of sex services. Pan Suiming contends that China has a specific type of prostitution that entails a bargain between those who use their power and authority in government to obtain sex and those who use sex to obtain privileges.{{sfn|Suiming|1996|p=21, note 6}}

Apart from incidences of violence directly associated with prostitution, an increasing number of women who sell sex have been physically assaulted, and even murdered, in the course of attempts to steal their money and property.{{sfn|Xin|1999| p=1423, note 8}} There have also been a growing number of criminal acts, especially incidences of theft and [[fraud]] directed at men who buy sex, as well as bribery of [[public servant]]s.{{sfn|Suiming|1999b|p=55, note 6}} Offenders often capitalise on the unwillingness of participants in the prostitution transaction to report such activities. Organised [[crime ring]]s are increasingly [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] women into and out of China for the sex trade, sometimes forcibly and after multiple acts of rape.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, pp. 25–9, note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, D., et al.

[[Sexually transmitted disease]]s also made a resurgence around the same time as prostitution, and have been directly linked to prostitution.

Traffickers reportedly lure, drug, detain, or kidnap some North Korean women upon their arrival. The women are then moved to cities farther away to subjected to [[forced prostitution]] in [[brothel]]s or through internet sex sites, or compelled service as hostesses in [[nightclub]]s or [[karaoke bar]]s.

When Chinese authorities arrest these North Korean trafficking victims, they repatriate them.

{{main|Prostitution in Hong Kong|Prostitution in Macau}}
[[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] are [[special administrative region]]s of China and subject to different laws: [[prostitution in Hong Kong]] is legal, as is [[prostitution in Macau]]. This has led to a higher incidence of prostitution in these regions than in mainland China. Women travel from [[mainland China]] to Hong Kong and Macau in order to engage in the trade. There are also allegations of women being trafficked for the purpose. The trafficked women are said to come from mainland China, [[Mongolia]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Europe]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-10-18-sa-a-humantrafficking-hot-spot-conference-hears|title=SA a human-trafficking hot spot, conference hears|first=Staff|last=Reporter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gvnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Macau.htm|title=Human Trafficking &amp;amp; Modern-day Slavery - Macau|publisher=gvnet.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth Wheeler Andrew (1845–1917) and Katharine Caroline Bushnell (5 February 1856 January 26, 1946), who wrote extensively on the position of women in the British Empire, wrote about the [[Tanka people|Tanka]] inhabitants of Hong Kong and their position in the prostitution industry, catering towards foreign sailors. The Tanka did not marry with the Chinese, being descendants of the natives, they were restricted to the waterways. They supplied their women as prostitutes to British sailors and assisted the British in their military actions around Hong Kong.{{sfn|Andrew|Bushnell|2006|p=11}} The Tanka in Hong Kong were considered "outcasts" categorized low class.{{sfn|Carroll|2013|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=D37ijXG-FykC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Most+of+the+Chinese+who+came+to+Hong+Kong+in+the+early+years+were+from+the+lower+classes,+such+as+laborers,+artisans,+Tanka+outcasts,+prostitutes,+wanderers,+and+smugglers.+That+these+people+violated+orders+from+authorities+in+Canton&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=q2awToSVG8Xa0QG51M3RAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Most%20of%20the%20Chinese%20who%20came%20to%20Hong%20Kong%20in%20the%20early%20years%20were%20from%20the%20lower%20classes%2C%20such%20as%20laborers%2C%20artisans%2C%20Tanka%20outcasts%2C%20prostitutes%2C%20wanderers%2C%20and%20smugglers.%20That%20these%20people%20violated%20orders%20from%20authorities%20in%20Canton&amp;f=false 36]}}

==Prostitution in Xinjiang==
The [[Manchu]] traveller Qi-yi-shi reported the presence of prostitution among [[Torghut]] and [[Khoshut]] women in the [[Karasahr]] area of [[Xinjiang]] in 1777.{{sfn|Dunnell|Millward|Elliott|Foret|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 103]}} He also wrote of the prevalence of prostitution in [[Kashgar]] and reported that some Manchu soldiers and officials in Xinjiang had long-term relationships with [[Turkistan]]i prostitutes.{{sfn|Millward|1998|p=206}} The presence of local Turki ([[Uyghurs|Uyghur]]) prostitutes at a party held by Russian officials in Kashgar in 1900 led to anti-Russian street demonstrations.{{sfn|Nightingale|Skrine|2013|pp=124–125}}

In late-19th- and early-20th-century [[Turpan]], Islamic modesty meant that Muslim prostitutes would not bare their bodies to clients in the way that Chinese prostitutes did. The only women in Xinjiang at that time not to wear headscarfs were prostitutes from the poorest social classes.{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2008|pages=192–}} In the early 20th century the Scottish missionary [[George W. Hunter (missionary)|George W. Hunter]] noted that the poverty of the Turki Muslims (Uyghurs) resulted in them selling their daughters, and that the practice led to Xinjiang containing significant numbers of Turki prostitutes.{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2008|pages=258–}} In contrast, he observed very little prostitution among the Tungan Muslims ([[Hui people]]).{{sfn|Friederich|1994|p=352}} During the same period the Finnish military officer [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Carl Mannerheim]] reported that several streets in [[Hotan]] were occupied by Uyghur prostitutes who specialised in selling their services to travelling merchants.{{sfn|Tamm|2011|pp=310 &amp; 318}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-1-A-224/V-1/page/0056.html.ja|title=Across Asia from West to East in 1906-08|author=Carl Mannerheim|volume=Vol. 1|year=1909|publisher=National Institute of Informatics - Digital Silk Road Project|page=50|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records from Turpan indicate that the customers of Turki prostitutes in Xinjiang included merchants from [[China proper]].{{sfn|Schluessel|2014|p=9}}

===Temporary marriage===
[[Temporary marriage]], in the form of the Sunni Muslim [[misyar marriage]] ("traveller's marriage") contract, is a practice that has sometimes been used as a cover for a form of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=n4Eye4ilLVkC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Mutah#v=onepage&amp;q=Mutah&amp;f=false | title=Muslim World: Modern Muslim Societies | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | date=September 1, 2010 | accessdate=April 5, 2013 | author=Pohl, Florian | pages=52–53| isbn=9780761479277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widespread in Xinjiang under Chinese rule prior to the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan Revolt of 1862–77]], and some westerners considered its use there to be a form of licensed prostitution. It allowed a man to marry a woman for a week or even a couple of days, with "the mulla who performs the ceremony arranging for the divorce at the same time".{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2008|pages=266–}} In some cases a temporary marriage was undertaken without the traditional marriage contract and could be easily terminated by the man involved. Such a marriage was forbidden by the Koran, and the Turki ([[Uyghurs|Uyghur]]) Muslims in Xinjiang called it a "[[marriage of convenience]]".{{sfn|Kamal|2000|pp=102–}}

After the restoration of Chinese rule in the late 19th century it was common for Chinese soldiers and civilians in the Yarkand area of Xinjiang, including high officials, to take temporary wives, often without a marriage ceremony. Most of the wives came from [[Khotan]]. When the Chinese returned to China proper, their wives were abandoned or sold to friends.&lt;ref name="Dunmore1894"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Adolphus Murray Earl of Dunmore|title=The Pamirs: Being a Narrative of a Year's Expedition on Horseback and on Foot Through Kashmir, Western Tibet, Chinese Tartary, and Russian Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SdxAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=When+a+Chinaman+is+called+back+to+his+own+home+in+China+proper,+or+a+Chinese+soldier+has+served+his+time+in+Turkestan+and+has+to+return+to+his+native+city+of+Pekin+and+Shanghai,+he+either+leaves+his+temporary+wife+behind+to+shift+for+herself,+or+he+sells+her+to+a+friend.+If+he+has+a+family+he+takes+the+boys+with+him#v=onepage&amp;q=When%20a%20Chinaman%20is%20called%20back%20to%20his%20own%20home%20in%20China%20proper%2C%20or%20a%20Chinese%20soldier%20has%20served%20his%20time%20in%20Turkestan%20and%20has%20to%20return%20to%20his%20native%20city%20of%20Pekin%20and%20Shanghai%2C%20he%20either%20leaves%20his%20temporary%20wife%20behind%20to%20shift%20for%20herself%2C%20or%20he%20sells%20her%20to%20a%20friend.%20If%20he%20has%20a%20family%20he%20takes%20the%20boys%20with%20him&amp;f=false|year=1894|publisher=J.

The frequent marriages of Chinese men to Muslim Turki women in Xinjiang from 1880-1949 occurred despite the fact that Islamic law forbids Muslim women from marrying non-Muslims, and that the Turki community considered such women to be prostitutes. Some foreign commentators suggested that the women involved were motivated by poverty, as such marriages prevented the women from being subject to the tax on prostitution.{{sfn|Bellér-Hann|2008|pages=83–}}

==Types and venues==

Chinese police categorise prostitution practices according to a descending hierarchy of seven tiers, though this typology does not exhaust the forms of practices that exist.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20010115002400/http://www.amrc.org.hk/Arch/3303.htm Sex Work in China]". Asia Monitor Resource Centre. Retrieved 23 April 2009. Archived from [http://www.amrc.org.hk/Arch/3303.htm the original] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010115002400/http://www.amrc.org.hk/Arch/3303.htm |date=15 January 2001 }} on 15 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; These tiers highlight the heterogeneous nature of prostitution and prostitutes. While they are all classified as prostitutes, the services they offer can be very different. Within some tiers, for example, there is still some revulsion to the acts of [[anal sex]] and [[oral sex]]. In parallel with the wide range of backgrounds for prostitutes, male buyers of sex also come from a wide range of occupational backgrounds. According to the local police, in China there are seven categories of prostitutes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution in contemporary China The case of Shanghai Jiading |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=1328797&amp;fileOId=1328798 |date=2006|author=Niklas Dougherty|publisher=Lund university|page=16|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;First tier - ''baoernai'' (包二奶):Women who act as the "second wives" of men with money and influential positions, including government officials and entrepreneurs from the mainland, as well as overseas businessmen. This practice is defined as prostitution on the grounds that women in question actively solicit men who can provide them with fixed-term accommodation and a regular allowance. Women who engage in these acts will sometimes co-habit with their "clients" and may even have ambitions to become a real wife. Illegal online "College Concubine Agencies" have appeared, charging a fee to put men in contact with female university students who wish to become mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Degrading Online Mistress Ads Pimp Out Chinese University Students|url=http://www.echinacities.com/china-media/Degrading-Online-Mistress-Ads-Pimp-Out-Chinese-University-Students|publisher=eChinacities (originally [[Xinhua News Agency]])|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Second tier - ''baopo'' (包婆 "packaged wife"): Women who accompany high class clients for a fixed duration of time, for example, during the course of a business trip, and receive a set payment for doing so.
[[File:Pimp business card.jpg|thumb|Pimps give out [[tart card|their business cards]] to potential customers. A prostitute can be sent to a hotel room upon request.]]
The first and second tiers have become the focus of heated public debate because they are explicitly linked to [[government corruption]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Many domestic commentators contend that these practices constitute a concrete expression of "[[bourgeois]] rights".{{sfn|Suiming|1996|pp=52–7, note 18}} The [[All-China Women's Federation]], as one of the major vehicles of [[feminism]] in the PRC, as well as women's groups in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]], have been actively involved in efforts to eradicate this form of "[[concubine|concubinage]]" as practices that violate the emotional and economic surety of the marriage contract.&lt;ref&gt;Act of the People's Republic of China for Security Administration Punishment.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Third tier - ''santing'' (三厅 "three halls"):
[[File:Barber shop Bao'an Shenzhen China.jpg|thumb|A hair salon where prostitutes work in [[Bao'an District]], [[Shenzhen]]. Brothels are often disguised as hair salons, or they operate out of working hair salons.]]
Women who perform sexual acts with men in [[karaoke]]/[[Nightclub|dance]] venues, [[bar (establishment)|bars]], restaurants, [[teahouse]]s and other venues and who receive financial recompense in the form of [[gratuity|tip]]s from the individual men they accompany, as well as from a share of the profits generated by informal [[service charge]]s on the use of facilities and the consumption of food and beverages. A common [[euphemism]] for such hostesses is ''sanpei xiaojie'' (三陪小姐: "ladies of the three accompaniments"). In theory, the "three accompaniments" are chatting, drinking and dancing with their clients. In practice, the "three accompaniments" more often refers to dancing with, drinking with, and being publicly groped by their clients. These women often begin by allowing their clients to fondle or intimately caress their bodies, then if the client is eager, will engage in [[sexual intercourse]].

;Fourth tier - "doorbell girls" (叮咚小姐 "dingdong ladies"): Women who solicit potential buyers of sex by [[cold calling|phoning]] rooms in a given hotel.

;Fifth tier - ''falangmei'' (发廊妹 "hairdressing salon sisters"):Women who work in places that offer commercial sexual services under the guise of [[massage]] or health and beauty treatments; for instance, in health and fitness centres, [[Beauty salon|beauty parlours]], [[barber|barber shops]], [[Public bathing|bathhouses]] and [[sauna]]s. Common activities in these premises are [[masturbation]] or [[oral sex]].

;Sixth tier - ''jienü'' (街女 "street girls"):Women who solicit male buyers of sex on the streets.

;Seventh tier - ''xiagongpeng'' (下工棚 "down the work shack"):Women who sell sex to the transient labour force of male workers from the rural countryside.

The lowest two tiers are characterised by a more straightforward exchange of sex for financial or material recompense. They are neither explicitly linked to government corruption, nor directly mediated through China's new commercial recreational business sector. Women who sell sex in the lowest two tiers usually do so in return for small sums of money, food and shelter.

==Legal responses==
The PRC rejects the argument that prostitution is an unremarkable transaction between consenting individuals and that prohibition laws constitute a violation of [[civil liberties]]. Overall, the PRC's legal response to prostitution is to penalise third party organisers of prostitution. Participants in the prostitution transaction are still usually penalised according to the Chinese system of [[administrative law|administrative sanctions]], rather than through the [[criminal code]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Prostitution law===
{{Prostitution in the People's Republic of China}}
Until the 1980s, the subject of prostitution was not viewed as a major concern for the [[National People's Congress]]. The PRC's first criminal code, the [[Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law]] of 1979 made no explicit reference to the activities of prostitutes and prostitute clients.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China''. Beijing: Foreign Languages Press (1984). Articles 140, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Legal control of prostitution was effected on the basis of [[Province of China|provincial]] rulings and localised policing initiatives until the introduction of the "Security administration punishment regulations" in 1987. The Regulations makes it an offence to "sell sex" (卖淫) and to "have illicit relations with a prostitute" (嫖宿暗娼).&lt;ref&gt;Note 15, Article 30, at 695–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution only became a distinct object of [[statute|statutory]] classification in the early 1990s. Responding to requests from the [[Ministry of Public Security (PRC)|Ministry of Public Security]] and the [[All-China Women's Federation]], the [[National People's Congress]] passed legislation that significantly expanded the range and scope of prostitution controls: the 1991 Decision on Strictly Forbidding the Selling and Buying of Sex and the 1991 Decision on the Severe Punishment of Criminals Who Abduct and Traffic in or Kidnap Women and Children.&lt;ref&gt;Quanguo renda changweihui, xingfashi bianzhu, fazhi gongzuo weiyuanhui (Criminal Law Office and the Legal Council of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress) (1991). 关于严禁卖淫嫖娼的决定和关于严惩拐卖绑架妇女儿童的犯罪分子的决定 (''An Explanation of the Decision on Strictly Forbidding the Selling and Buying of Sex and the Decision on the Severe Punishment of Criminals Who Abduct and Traffic in or Kidnap Women and Children''). Zhonggguo jiancha chubanshe.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding symbolic weight to these enhanced law enforcement controls was the 1992 Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of Women, which defines prostitution as a social practice that abrogates the inherent rights of women to personhood.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 36, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRC's revised [[Criminal Law]] of 1997 retains its abolitionist focus in that it is primarily concerned with criminalising third-party involvement in prostitution. For the first time the death penalty may be used, but only in exceptional cases of organising prostitution activities, involving additional circumstances such as repeated offences, rape, causing serious [[Bodily harm|bodily injury]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;''1997 Criminal Code of the People's Republic of China'' trans. Wei Luo, (Buffalo, New York: W.S. Hein &amp; Co., 1998), Articles 358, 359, at 186–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://english.sina.com/china/1/2005/0124/18934.html Chinese tycoon convicted of running prostitution, gambling ring sentenced to death]". [[Sina.com]], 24 January 2005. Retrieved 2 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of first-party participants continue to be regulated in practice according to [[administrative law]], with the exceptions of anyone who sells or buys prostitutional sex in the full knowledge that they are infected with an STD; and anyone who has prostitutional sex with a [[Prostitution of children|child under 14 years of age]].&lt;ref&gt;Note 19, Article 360, at 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, male [[homosexual]] prostitution has also been prosecuted under the law.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-02/08/content_304163.htm China court hears homosexual prostitution case]". ''[[China Daily]]'', 8 February 2004. Retrieved 2 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1997 criminal code codified provisions in the 1991 Decision, establishing a system of controls over social place, specifically places of leisure and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Note 19, Articles 361, 362, at 187–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal is to stop managers and workers within the predominantly male-run and male-patronised [[Hospitality industry|hospitality and service industry]] from profiting from and/or encouraging the prostitution of others. Government intervention in commercial recreation has found concrete expression in the form of the 1999 "Regulations concerning the management of public places of entertainment". The provisions proscribe a range of commercial practices that characterise the activities of female "hostesses".&lt;ref&gt;中华人民共和国国务院 guowuyuan (State Council of the PRC) (1999). 娱乐场所管理条例 (''Regulations concerning the management of public places of entertainment'').

Articles 132, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; These laws have been further reinforced via the introduction of localised licensing measures that bear directly on the interior spatial organisation of recreational venues.

===Party disciplinary measures===
As a result of strong calls to curb official corruption, during the mid to late 1990s, a whole host of regulations were also introduced to ban government employees both from running recreational venues and from protecting illegal business operations. The 1997 Communist Party Discipline Regulations, for example, contain specific provisions to the effect that party members will be stripped of their posts for using their position and/or public funds to keep a "second wife", a "hired wife", and to buy sexual services.&lt;ref&gt;"Communist Party discipline regulations". Xinhua News Agency, 1999., trans. ''Selected World Broadcasts - China'', 14 April, FE/2892 S2/1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; These measures are being policed via the practice established in 1998 of [[audit]]ing government officials, and thereby combining the forces of the CPC's disciplinary committees with those of the State Auditing Administration. Following the introduction of these measures, the [[Media of China|Chinese media]] has publicised numerous cases of government officials being convicted and disciplined for abusing their positions for prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Guangdong court judge sacked for hiring prostitutes" [[Xinhua]], 26 September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policing==
Despite the position of the law, prostitutes are often treated as quasi-criminals by the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]]. Chinese police conduct regular patrols of [[public space]]s, often with the support of mass-line organisations, using a strong presence as a deterrence against prostitution. Because lower tier prostitutes work the streets, they are more likely to be apprehended. Arrests are also more likely to be female sellers of sex than male buyers of sex. The overwhelming majority of men and women who are apprehended are released with a caution and [[fine (penalty)|fine]].{{sfn|Jeffreys|2004|p=107, note 6}}

In response, sellers and buyers of sex have adopted a wide range of tactics designed to avoid apprehension. The spatial mobility which is afforded by modern communications systems, such as mobile phones and [[pager]]s, and by modern forms of transportation, such as [[taxicab|taxis]] and [[Automobile|private cars]], has severely reduced the ability of police to determine exactly who is engaged in acts of solicitation.&lt;ref&gt;Ouyang Tao (1994) "Dangjin woguo maiyin piaochang fanzui de zhuangshi tedian ji duice" [当今我国卖淫嫖娼犯罪的壮实特点及对策: Prostitution offences in contemporary China: characteristics and countermeasures], ''Fanzui yu gaizao yanjiu'', 10: 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitutes have also begun using the internet, in particular [[instant messaging]] software such as [[Tencent QQ|QQ]], to attract customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://society.dayoo.com/gb/content/2005-10/13/content_2254667.htm 23岁"妈咪"网上介绍小姐 称学生包夜600] (23-year-old "Mummy" introduces ladies on the internet, students for 600 a night). Retrieved 25 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, PlayChina, an online prostitution referral service, was shut down by police.

In tandem with the long-term task of developing preventative policing, the much more visible form of policing have been periodic police-led campaigns. Anti-prostitution campaigns have been accompanied by nationwide "media blitzes" to publicise the PRC's laws and regulations. This is typically followed by the announcement of arrest statistics, and then by sober official statements suggesting that the struggle to eliminate prostitution will be a long one. The use of campaigns has been criticised for their reliance on an outdated "ideological" construction and an equally outmoded campaign formula of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Hershatter, G., ''Dangerous Pleasures: Prostitution and Modernity in Twentieth-Century Shanghai'' (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press) at 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary target of the PRC's prostitution controls throughout the 1990s has been China's burgeoning hospitality and entertainment industry. These culminated in the "strike hard" campaigns of late 1999 and 2000. Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution ''in toto'', there is some evidence that regulation of China's recreational venues has helped to create a legitimate female service worker with the right to refuse to engage in practices repugnant to the "valid labour contract", as well as the right to be free from [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, E., "Feminist prostitution debates: Are there any sex workers in China?" in McLaren, A. E., Chinese Women - Living and Working (London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2004) at 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese police have, however, proven unable to effectively police higher tier prostitution practices. The nature of concubinage and second wife practices makes it more suited as a target of social action campaigns rather than conventional police action. Because of social changes, for example, Chinese police are now professionally constrained not to intrude on people's personal relationships in an overt or coercive manner.{{sfn|Jeffreys|2004|p=94, note 41}} Police forces around China also differ as to how they approach the subject. In some areas, "massage parlours" on main streets are known full well to be brothels, but are generally left to function without hindrance, barring occasional raids.

==The question of legalisation==
The illegal activities and problems associated with prostitution had led some to believe that there would be benefits if prostitution was legalized.

A number of international [[NGO]]s and [[human rights]] organisations have criticised the PRC government for failing to comply with the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], accusing PRC of penalising and abusing lower tier prostitutes, many of whom are victims of human trafficking, while exonerating men who buy sex, and ignoring the ongoing problems of governmental complicity and involvement in the sex trade industry.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights in China [http://www.hrichina.org/fs/downloadables/pdf/downloadable-resources/cedaw_98.pdf?revision_id=14195 Can dialogue improve China's human rights situation?

Retrieved 2 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] reads: ''Art. 6'': ''States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women''. However, it does not advocate a system of [[Regulated prostitution|legal and regulated prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ippf.org/en/Resources/Statements/The+Right+to+be+Free+from+Torture+and+Ill+Treatment.htm |accessdate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121055338/http://www.ippf.org/en/Resources/Statements/The%2BRight%2Bto%2Bbe%2BFree%2Bfrom%2BTorture%2Band%2BIll%2BTreatment.htm |title=The Right to be Free from Torture and Ill Treatment: Charter Right 12 |publisher=International Planned Parenthood Federation |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has, though, been some calls for legalization; a minor rally for this caused was held in 2010 organized by sex worker activist Ye Haiyan, who was arrested by police for her role in organizing the protests.&lt;ref name="whatsonxiamen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news13800.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807012735/http://www.whatsonxiamen.com/news13800.html |archive-date= 7 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |title=Sex worker Ye Haiyan held in China's 1st rally to legalize prostitution - What's On Xiamen |accessdate=1 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central guidelines laid down by the CPC do not permit the public advocacy of the legalisation of prostitution. Arguments concerning legalisation are not absent, however, from mainland China. On the contrary, some commentators contend that legally recognising the sex industry, in conjunction with further economic development, will ultimately reduce the number of women in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Beichuan, Chen Guanzhi, Li Kefu and Li Xiufang "Zhonggguo mou chengshi jinü diaocha" [中国某城市妓女调查: "A survey of female prostitutes in a Chinese city"], note 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic commentators have also been highly critical of the PRC's prostitution controls, with a consistent [[Marxist]]-informed focus of complaint being the gender-biased and discriminatory nature of such controls, as well as human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Suiming (1996), note 6&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators in China and overseas contend that the PRC's policy of banning prostitution is problematic because it hinders the task of developing measures to prevent the spread of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Li Dun (1996) "Dui aizibing yu maiyin de zhengce he falü pingjia" [对艾滋病与卖淫的政策和法律评价: "An evaluation of China's policies and laws concerning AIDS and prostitution"] note 6 at 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

While prostitution controls have been relaxed at a local level,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} there is no impetus for legalisation at the central government level. Importantly, legalisation does not have much public support.{{sfn|Zhiping|2000|pp=28–33}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Settle |first1=Edmund |title=Legalise prostitution in China |url=http://casy.org/engdocs/SCMP_Oped_072904.pdf |website=South China Morning Post |accessdate=18 August 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212065702/http://casy.org/engdocs/SCMP_Oped_072904.pdf |archivedate=12 February 2006 |date=29 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the underdeveloped nature of the Chinese economy and legal system, there is an argument that legalisation would further complicate the already difficult task of establishing the legal responsibility for third-party involvement in forced prostitution and the traffic in women.&lt;ref&gt;Peratis, K. and Flores, J.R.

These include the lack of independent [[trade union]]s, and limited access of individuals to civil redress with regard to [[occupational health and safety]] issues.{{sfn|Jeffreys|2004|p=128, note 7}}

==HIV/AIDS==
{{main|HIV/AIDS in China}}
According to [[UNAIDS]], 0.5% of Chinese sex workers are infected with [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="cnn report"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/06/19/china.aids.prostitutes/|title= China tries to stop spread of HIV/AIDS among prostitutes|author= |date= 21 June 2009|work= |publisher= CNN|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study reported that 5% of low-cost sex workers were infected.&lt;ref name="elderly"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-01/11/content_9297255.htm|title= AIDS and the elderly|author= |date= 11 January 2010|website= |publisher= China Daily|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one part of [[Yunnan]] province, the infection rate is estimated to be as high as 7%. The Chinese government has initiated programs to educate sex workers in HIV/AIDS prevention.&lt;ref name="cnn report"/&gt;

Rising HIV/AIDS rates among Chinese's elderly has been partially attributed to the use of sex workers.&lt;ref name="elderly"/&gt;

==Prostitution in the media==
The spread of prostitution practices has introduced a large quantity of [[slang]] to the popular vocabulary. Prostitution is a popular subject in the media, especially on the internet. Typically news of police raids, court cases or family tragedies related to prostitution are published in a sensationalised form. A good example is news of an orgy between 400 Japanese clients and 500 Chinese prostitutes in 2003, which partially because of [[anti-Japanese sentiment]], was widely publicised and met with considerable outrage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200309/27/eng20030927_125049.shtml Japanese orgy in Zhuhai hotel sparks Chinese fury], ''People's Daily'', 27 September 2003. Retrieved 2 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Another highly publicised case was that of [[Alex Ho Wai-to]], then a [[Democratic Party of Hong Kong|Democratic Party]] candidate for the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], who was given a six-month [[re-education through labor]] sentence for hiring a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng Caixiong, [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/18/content_366425.htm HK LegCo candidate arrested for taking prostitutes], ''China Daily'', 18 August 2004. Retrieved 2 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostitution has emerged as a subject of art in recent years, particularly in [[Chinese cinema]]. [[Li Shaohong]]'s 1995 film ''[[Blush (1995 film)|Blush]]'' begins in 1949 with the rounding up of prostitutes in [[Shanghai]] for "[[Reeducation through labor|reeducation]]", and proceeds to tell the story of a [[love triangle]] between two prostitutes and one of their former clients. One of the prostitutes, Xiaoe, attempts to hang herself in reeducation. When asked to explain the reason, she says she was born in the brothel and enjoyed her lifestyle there - thereby challenging the government-sanctioned perspective of prostitution. The 1998 film ''[[Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl]]'' was a dramatic portrayal of "invisible" prostitution in the rural China during the Maoist era.

The 2001 independent film ''[[Seafood (film)|Seafood]]'', by [[Zhu Wen (writer)|Zhu Wen]], was an even more frank depiction of prostitution, this time of the complicated relationship between prostitution and law enforcement. In the film, a Beijing prostitute goes to a seaside resort to commit [[suicide]]. Her attempt is intervened by a police officer who tries to redeem her, but also inflicts upon her many instances of [[sexual assault]]. Both films, whilst being critically acclaimed abroad, performed poorly in mainland China, only partially due to government restrictions on distribution. The depiction of prostitution in fiction, by comparison, has fared slightly better. The most notable author on the subject is the young writer [[Jiu Dan]], whose portrayal of Chinese prostitutes in [[Singapore]] in her [[novel]] ''Wuya'', was extremely controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Jiu Dan, ''Wuya'' [乌鸦: Crows] (Changjiang wenyi chubanshe, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in the People's Republic of China}}
China is a source, destination, and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Chinese women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking within China. Traffickers typically recruit them from rural areas and take them to urban centers, using a combination of fraudulent job offers and coercion by imposing large travel fees, confiscating passports, confining victims, or physically and financially threatening victims to compel their engagement in commercial sex. Well-organized criminal syndicates and local gangs play key roles in the trafficking of Chinese women and girls in China, recruiting victims with fraudulent employment opportunities and subsequently forcing them into commercial sex. Illicit brokers increasingly facilitate the forced and fraudulent marriage of South Asian, Southeast Asian, and African women and girls to Chinese men for fees of up $30,000. The men—sometimes in partnership with their parents—often incur large debts to cover these fees, which they attempt to recover by subjecting the “brides” to prostitution. Some Chinese men are reportedly circumventing this brokerage system by traveling to Southeast Asian capitals and entering into legal marriages with local women and girls, then returning to China and subjecting them to forced prostitution.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=China 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282632.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=26 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese men, women, and children are subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking in at least 57 other countries.  Chinese women and girls are subjected to sexual exploitation throughout the world, including in major cities, construction sites, remote mining and logging camps, and areas with high concentrations of Chinese migrant workers.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

Women and children from neighboring Asian countries, Africa, and the Americas are subjected to sex trafficking in China. A large number of North Korean women are subjected to forced prostitution. Women and girls are kidnapped or recruited through marriage brokers and transported to China, where some are subjected to commercial sex.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks China as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 3]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18" /&gt;

{{Canadian Confederation sidebar}}
Beginning on 10 October 1864, and lasting over two weeks, the '''Quebec Conference''' was held to discuss a proposed Canadian confederation.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/quebec-conference-1864.php |title=The Quebec Conference, October 1864 |website=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage Web Site |year=1997 |author=J.K. Hiller |access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in response to the shift in political ground as Britain and the United States had come very close to engaging in war with each other.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec-conference/ |title=Québec Conference |last=Buckner |first=Phillip A. |date=7 February 2006 |website=Historica Canada |access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the overall goal of the conference was to elaborate on policies surrounding federalism, and creating a single state which were discussed previously at the [[Charlottetown Conference]] around a month earlier.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; [[Province of Canada|Canada West]] leader [[John A. Macdonald]] requested [[Governor General of Canada|Governor-General]] [[Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck|Charles Monck]] to invite all representatives from the three Maritime provinces and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] to meet with the candidates who formed the United Canada to Quebec, in October 1864. Newfoundland sent two observers, but did not participate directly in the proceedings. The Conference was held at the [[Château Frontenac]].&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

== The beginnings at Charlottetown ==
The Charlottetown Conference of September 1864, laid the foundations for the Quebec Conference and was a significant meeting that would determine what would be discussed in the Quebec Conference. During the Conference, the Canadians found support for the confederation, as discussions pointed towards a unified decision to unite the provinces under the name of Canada. The Canada West member, John A. Macdonald, who would be highly prominent in the Quebec Conference, began to find allies that would enable him to have a more dominant and influential role in the Quebec Conference a month later.{{sfn|Moore|2015|p=39}} One key alliance made in the Charlottetown Conference that would transfer over to the Quebec Conference was made between the Maritime delegates and Macdonald as they saw him as less abrasive than the other Canada West Official, [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]].{{sfn|Moore|2015|p=39}} Macdonald appealed to the Maritime populace as he seemed a more friendly and diplomatic alliance than George Brown, and in terms of Canada East politician, [[George-Étienne Cartier]], Macdonald was an anglophone, and although Cartier was prominent at the discussions at Charlottetown, the Maritime politicians were yet to get used to the influence and power of the francophone politicians.{{sfn|Moore|2015|p=40}}

On the fifth and final day of the conference, it was clear that a second part of the confederation deal was on the verge of being consummated, and that the Charlottetown Conference had been making a breakthrough on the policy of Confederacy. The Maritime politicians, however, struggled to agree and accept the details of the Canadians' proposal. On 10 September 1864, in Halifax three days later, they drew up plans to hold another conference in Quebec, in order to finalize the negotiations made during the last few days.{{sfn|Krikorian|2017|p=124}} They drew up motions for the Quebec Conference after the conclusion of Charlottetown, where they would focus on the confederation of British North America. They also agreed to invite a delegation from Newfoundland, as they were not involved in negotiations at Charlottetown{{sfn|Krikorian|2017|pp=124–125}} Therefore, the members of Charlottetown wanted to include all provinces of Canada in the negotiations at the Quebec Conference as the Charlottetown Conference had laid the foundations of discussions at the Quebec Conference. During the period between the two sessions, the members of Charlottetown prepared a list of resolutions that would be passed at the Quebec Conference, which proposed the constitution of a new union. These were going to become the "[[Quebec Resolutions|72 Resolutions]]."{{sfn|Warner|1960|p=51}}

== Conference ==
The conference involved 32 delegates from various regions of Canada. The meeting included members from Canada East- George-Étienne Cartier, [[Étienne-Paschal Taché|Etienne-Paschal Tache]] as well as [[Thomas D'Arcy McGee|Thomas D’Arcy McGee.]] Those from Canada West included George Brown and John A. Macdonald. Members in New Brunswick who also featured were [[John Hamilton Gray (New Brunswick politician)|John Hamilton Gray]] and [[Samuel Leonard Tilley]]. Nova Scotian delegates featured [[Adams George Archibald]] and [[Charles Tupper]]. Newfoundland sent two delegates whose mere purpose was to observe proceedings and Prince Edward Island sent [[George Coles (politician)|George Coles]] and [[William Henry Pope (Canadian politician)|William Henry Pope]]. The two Newfoundland delegates included [[Frederick Carter|F.B.T Carter]] and [[Ambrose Shea]], who were not government members. Overall Nova Scotia had five members, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had seven each, and the total made up all the delegates, making up all of the Maritime delegates.{{sfn|Krikorian|2017|p=125}} There were 32 delegates in total, and were given sets of calling cards, with the names and photo identification so everyone was clear with names and where certain people represented.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; The Conference lasted 14 days, but to some people, such as [[Edward Goff Penny]], editor of the Montreal Herald, and an eventual senator, complained that this was too little time to conclude proceedings.{{sfn|Colquhoun|1964|isbn=|p=57}}

The major source of conflict at the conference was between those who favoured a "legislative union", i.e. a unitary state, such as John A. Macdonald, and those who favoured stronger provincial rights. The Conference tied in very closely with the discussions of the aforementioned Charlottetown Conference, as the topics being discussed in Quebec centred around whether the country should have a strong and single central government, or a more encompassing federal system.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; Representatives from the [[Canadian Maritimes|Maritimes]] and [[Canada East]] (now [[Quebec]]) tended to argue for provincial rights, fearing they would lose their cultural identity under a centralized unitary state. John A. Macdonald thought the failure of a weak central power was evident in the [[American Civil War]], which was still being fought in the [[United States]] as the delegates met in Charlottetown and Quebec. The delegates eventually compromised, dividing powers between a "general" parliament and "local" provincial legislatures. They also decided to have an elected lower house, the [[House of Commons of Canada]], and an appointed upper house, the [[Senate of Canada]], although there was considerable debate about how many senators each province would have. The Prince Edward Island delegation called for a scheme similar to the  [[Triple-E Senate]] proposal of the 1990s.  Eventually, a proposed structure for the government was written out in the form of the seventy-two resolutions at the end of the conference.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-2600-e.html |title=The Québec Conference: October 10-27, 1864 |website=Library and Archives Canada |access-date=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from the topic of the proposed division of the central government into the upper house, that would be based on regional representation and the lower house that would represent the population, this was a key topic in both the Charlottetown Conference and the Quebec Conference. This topic was discussed at length during the conference with one examiner outlining that the meeting on 24 October 1864, that the topic was "debated all day with considerable warmth and ability but no agreement come to". He also outlined that "lower Canada complains that in the number proposed for her, 24, she would be unfairly represented (in the upper house), with it being proposed that upper Canada should have the same number."{{sfn|Waite|1972|p=84}} This discussion carried on over into the Quebec Conference in the hope that an agreement could be eventually made considering that it was not concluded at the end of the Charlottetown Conference.

In terms of what the regions as a whole desired, it was quite overtly clear. Delegates from the Maritimes feared that a legislative union which the aforementioned John A. Macdonald was promoting, as they believed it would result in the loss of their identity as other nations would have an overbearing influence. However, the smaller Maritime colonies saw the Senate as a means of strengthening their regional representation to offset their regional weakness in the so-called lower house. Cartier represented the interests of Quebec at the conference. Similar to the Maritimes, he was more invested in the conference, although he made it abundantly clear that the province needed a strong provincial government that would be able to protect their language, civil customs and local laws.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=425}} Although he was not wholeheartedly against such political reform, he believed that Quebec should still maintain its identity.

In terms of priorities at the Conference, there were many differing agendas, especially the Maritime regions that, as mentioned earlier, saw a federalized state as beneficial to their economy and commerce. An example of this was the role of [[John A. Carter (Newfoundland politician)|John A. Carter]], one of the Newfoundland diplomats invited to the conference, as he outlined the importance of the fisheries to the Newfoundland economy, and that a newly formed federalized state would open up a wide field of enterprise both with internal trade in Canada and within the continent of North America as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doughty|first=A.G.|date=March 1920|title="Notes on the Quebec Conference, 1864"|url=|journal=Canadian Historical Review|volume=1|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one concern of the Maritime colonies was due to the fact that they benefited from free trade, and the aforementioned commerce of fishing for their livelihood, Canada was more concerned about industrialization in all the provinces, creating significant improvements to the Canadian economy.{{sfn|Warner|1960|p=53}} Such a concern was raised during the Conference as the Maritime colonies wished to maintain their stable economy.  In contrast, some members from Prince Edward Island was highly sceptical of a union as advocated by John A. Macdonald, as they were concerned about the Island's autonomy if there was a confederation.{{sfn|Moore|2015|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of particularism, whereby there was paranoia surrounding an  overpowering Canada dictating Maritime policy was a salient characteristic of political thinking among numerous people in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.{{sfn|Warner|1960|p=52}} This demonstrated that even within the Maritimes, there were varying degrees of skepticism, with some parts more in favor than others highlighting the complexities of the Maritimes. One key figure, Charles Tupper who was a politician from Nova Scotia who formed close alliances with John A. Macdonald, sympathized with the confederacy and stated that the Maritimes "could never hope to occupy a position of influence or importance except in connection with their larger sister Canada".{{sfn|Moore|2015|p=40}}  This highlighted the varying degrees in which delegates from the Maritimes viewed the idea of confederacy.

== The result ==
Overall, the result was a compromise, as each province would have its own legislature and the power of government was divided up between the federal and provincial governments.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; It was decided that the central administrative area was to be placed in Ottawa, where the central government would reside.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; Delegates consolidated their previous agreement at the Charlottetown Conference, that the central government would have a lower house based on population and an upper house reflective of regional representation.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; The three separate regions of Ontario, Quebec and the three Maritime provinces would all have 24 seats in the appointment chamber. The actual overall result meant that Canada incorporated portions of both the British Unitary system and the American federal system.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; The "72 Resolutions" were drawn up by the end of the conference, which maintained none of the democratic principles as demonstrated in the United States.{{sfn|Bruchesi|1956|p=151}} The resolutions did not guarantee the protection for the rights of French Canadians, and excluded them extensively in other parts of the legislature.{{sfn|Bruchesi|1956|p=151}}

However, the Christian faith was well protected as both Catholics and Protestant minorities were granted Canada’s equality of rights and special privileges in anything involving education. Such resolutions received wide recognition and support from the colonial office. In Lower Canada, Reformers opposed the resolutions but were the only group to do so. In Nova Scotia, pressure was needed to force through legislative approval of the resolutions.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/QuebecConference-CanadianHistory.htm |title=Quebec Conference [1864] |website=Quebec History |access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the federal government was given considerable power over the provinces. This was demonstrated under the power of disallowance, which gave the federal government the ability to reject provincial laws of which they did not approve.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=425}} Other regions were considered as a result of the conference, including Newfoundland, British Columbia and the “North West Territory”, to eventually enter Canada on equal terms at a later date. Although the Quebec Conference changed the political influence in Canada considerably, the British crown would maintain its position as the head of the government and the protector and head of executive authority.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

== The 72 Resolutions ==
The Resolutions were highly comprehensive and within the first few resolutions, it was outlined that the general government would ensure that the intercolonial railway would be completed from Riviere-du-Loup, through New Brunswick and end up at Truro in Nova Scotia.{{sfn|Finlay|1991|p=319}} The delegates from Nova Scotia also admitted that the building of this railway with the full financial backing of the central government was key in swaying the Maritimes decision to back a centralized government. The arrangements proposed by Alexander Galt in terms of finance, predominantly focussing on existing debts of various debts owed by certain colonies should be divided and shared. Some of the final resolutions outline that her majesty the Queen possess considerable power over the course of proceedings as Resolution 71 underlined that the Queen was to be solicited to determine the rank and name of the federated provinces.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; The 60th Resolution outlined that the central government would tackle the debts of all the provinces and aid the payments of all those involved.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; What was eventually enacted was the policy which resulted in each province being compensated by a federal transfer resulting in 80 cents per head.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

The Quebec resolutions received increasing support from the colonial office, with the only opposing group being the Lower Canadian Reformers who had not been drafted into the coalition. In both Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, considerable pressure was needed to formulate and pass through legislative approval. Prince Edward Island did not join the newly formed unified Canada until around 1873.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt; The 72 Resolutions significantly influenced the ''British North America Act'', as will be discussed in the next section, and little was altered or changed to the resolutions when enacted in London.{{sfn|Krikorian|2017|isbn=|p=125}}

== The ''British North America Act'' of 1867 and the Quebec Conference's legacy ==
The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]'' received royal acceptance on 28 March 1867 by [[Queen Victoria]], and by 22 May, all three provinces- Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Canada. Upper and Lower Canada were to be split into Ontario (Upper Canada) and Quebec (Lower Canada). All of these provinces were to be unified by 1 July 1867, three years after the agreement was made at the Quebec Conference.{{sfn|Trotter|1971|p=135}} In the ''Act'', it was clearly stated that 'not being more than six months of passing this act, the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall form and be one dominion under the name of Canada.' It went onto outline that 'Canada shall be divided into four provinces, named Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.'{{sfn|Driedger|1976|p=2}} However, although Canada was unified under the ''British North America Act'', the act contained no general declaration or recognition of the fact that Canada was a bilingual and bicultural nation.{{sfn|Creighton|2012|p=12}} Therefore, the official language of the newly unified Canada was the language of the Crown, with no recognition of the language of French in the francophone region of Quebec. Overall, the ''British North America Act'' consolidated the 72 Resolutions as passed by the Quebec Conference, but the ''British North American Act'' introduced into the Canadian Government a new factor, the sovereignty of the British Crown.{{sfn|Laforest|2015|p=160}}&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

A '''real defense''' is a justification for a maker or drawer not to honor a [[negotiable instrument]] even if it has been transferred to a [[holder in due course]] (or "HDC") because it makes the instrument “void” according to [[Uniform Commercial Code]] §3-305 comment 1,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/3-305.html&lt;/ref&gt; thus the defense can’t be "cut off" by the transfer to an HDC.  Contrast this with personal defenses (such as failure of [[consideration]]), which cannot protect the maker against the claims by an HDC.

==Ten types of real defenses depending upon state law==
1. Fraud inducing obligor to sign instrument without a reasonable opportunity to learn of its fraudulent character or essential terms (also known as “(fraud in the factum”); this depends upon consideration of “all relevant factors”;

2. forgery of a necessary signature;

3. adjudicated insanity which renders the instrument void;

4. material alteration of the instrument, such as the amount;

5. infancy which renders the instrument voidable or void;

6. illegality which renders the instrument void;

7. duress at the time of making the instrument;

8. discharge of obligor in insolvency proceedings, or any discharge known to the HDC;

9. a suretyship defense, such as the holder knew an indorser was signing as a surety or accommodation party;

10. statute of limitation (generally 3 years after dishonor of a draft or 6 years after demand or other due date on a note).

'''Reparations''' are broadly understood as compensation given for an abuse or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |article=reparation |date=2009 |title=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |access-date=September 19, 2009 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reparation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colloquial meaning of reparations has changed substantively over the last century. In the early 1900s, reparations were interstate exchanges (see [[war reparations]]): [[punitive]] mechanisms determined by treaty and paid by the surrendering side of conflict, such as the [[World War I reparations]] paid by Germany and its allies. Now, reparations are understood as not just war damages but compensation and other measures provided to victims of severe [[human rights]] violations by the parties responsible. The right of the victim of an injury to receive reparations and the duty of the part responsible to provide them has been secured by the [[United Nations]].

In [[transitional justice]], reparations are measures taken by the state to redress gross and systematic violations of [[human rights law]] or [[humanitarian law]] through the administration of some form of compensation or restitution to the victims. Of all the mechanisms of transitional justice, reparations are unique because they directly address the situation of the victims. Reparations, if well designed, acknowledge victims' suffering, offer measures of redress, as well as some form of compensation for the violations suffered.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|de Greiff|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reparations can be symbolic as well as material. They can be in the form of public acknowledgement of or apology for past violations, indicating state and social commitment to respond to former abuses.

Proponents of reparations assert&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ-Global-Reparations-Practice-2007-English.pdf|title=Reparations in Theory and Practice|last=Magarrell|first=Lisa|date=October 22, 2007|website=International Center for Transitional Justice|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/|title=The Case for Reparations|last=Coates|first=Ta-Nehisi|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in order to be effective, reparations must be employed alongside other transitional justice measures such as prosecutions, truth-seeking, and institutional reform.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{harvnb|United Nations General Assembly|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such mechanisms ensure that compensatory measures are not empty promises, temporary stopgap measures, or attempts to buy the silence of victims.{{sfn|Magarrell|2007}}

==Types==
The legal concept of reparation has two components: the right of the victim of an injury to receive reparation, and the duty of the party responsible for the injury to provide redress.{{sfn|United Nations General Assembly|2005}} Reparations can be sought by individuals through [[judicial system]]s, or they can be policies introduced by the state to address the concerns or needs of a wider populace. While the first strategy is instrumental in creating legal [[precedent]], the second is a more efficient way to recognize the concerns of more people.

The [[United Nations]] [[Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Rights to a Remedy and Reparation for Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/RemedyAndReparation.aspx|title=OHCHR Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;describes five formal categories of reparations: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition.

# [[Restitution]] – measures which serve to "restore the victim to the original situation before the gross violations occurred". This can include: restoration of liberty, enjoyment of human rights, identity, family life and citizenship, return of one's place of residence, restoration of employment, and return of property.
# [[Damages]] Compensation – the provision of compensation "for any economically assessable damage, as appropriate and proportional to the gravity of the violation and the circumstances of each case". Such damage includes: physical or mental harm, lost opportunities, material damages and loss of earnings, moral damage, cost of legal, medical, psychological, and social services.
# Rehabilitation – medical, psychological, social services, and legal assistance
# Satisfaction – various measures which include the cessation of human rights violations and abuses, truth-seeking, searches for the disappeared, recovery and reburial of remains, judicial and administrative sanctions, public apologies, commemoration, and [[memorialization]].
# Guarantees of non-repetition – reforms ensuring the prevention of future abuses, including: [[civilian control of the military]] and security forces, strengthening an independent judiciary, protection of [[civil service]] and human rights workers, the overall promotion of human rights standards, and the establishment of mechanisms to prevent and monitor social conflict and conflict resolution.{{sfn|Magarrell|2007}}

==Who receives reparation==
Victims of violations of international human rights or humanitarian law have the rights to prompt, sufficient, and effective reparation. Victims can be individuals or a collective group of individuals who suffered similar violations. Such victims, as defined by the UN Basic Principles on the matter, are:

"Persons who individually or collectively suffered harm, including physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, economic loss, or substantial impairment of their fundamental rights, through acts or omissions that constitute gross violations of international human rights law, or serious violations of international humanitarian law… the immediate family or dependants of the direct victim and persons who have suffered harm in intervening to assist victims in distress or to prevent victimization."{{sfn|Magarrell|2007}}

==Who provides reparation==
The [[State (polity)|state]], as the authority responsible for ensuring the protection of human rights and the administration of justice within their borders, is correspondingly also responsible for providing redress for abuses and injustices suffered by their citizens. The UN Basic Principles also states that if a person or entity other than the state can be found liable for the violations and abuses endured, such party is responsible for providing reparation either directly to the victim or through compensating the state for reparations rendered.{{sfn|Magarrell|2007}}

The international legal underpinning for the right to effective remedy and duty to provide reparation can be found in multiple human rights and humanitarian treaties and conventions, including:

==Examples of reparations programs==
'''Canada''' – For more than 100 years, [[Canada]] retained a practice of removing indigenous Canadian children from their families and placing them in church-run [[Indian residential schools]] (IRS). This process was part of an effort to homogenize Canadian society, and included the prohibition of native language and cultural practices. In 1991, the Canadian government established the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] (RCAP), charged with exploring the relationship between aboriginal peoples, the government, and society.

As a result of the commission's recommendations, the government symbolically issued an apology in a "Statement of Reconciliation", admitting that the schools were designed on racist models of assimilation. Pope Benedict XVI also issued an apology on behalf of church members who were involved in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Assembly of First Nations: "AFN National Chief Says Private Audience with Pope Benedict XVI in Vatican City "Closes the Circle" and Enables Work Towards Reconciliation for Residential School Survivors" [http://www.afn.ca/article.asp?id=4511]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the government provided a $350 million fund to help those affected by the schools.&lt;ref name="ictj1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/our-work/regions-and-countries/canada|title=Canada &amp; Transitional Justice |publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice|date=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the federal government signed the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, agreeing to provide reparations to the survivors of this program. The Settlement totals approximately $2 billion, and includes financial compensation, a truth commission, and support services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/regions-and-countries/canada International Center for Transitional Justice, Canada Program page]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 [[Justin Trudeau|Prime Minister Justin Trudeau]] apologized to the [[LGBT|LGBTQ2S]] people of Canada in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] and announced reparations that would be made to citizens who were injured by specific actions of the State. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=CBC News|title=Trudeau delivers historic apology to LGBT Canadians|date=2017-11-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM0yZP-g3a4|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chile''' – In 1990, [[Chile]]'s newly elected president [[Patricio Aylwin]] created the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the human rights abuses of General [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s 1973-1990 dictatorial regime. The commission investigated disappearances, political executions, and torture, publishing the [[Rettig Report]] with its findings in 1991. Afterwards, its work was continued by the National Corporation for Reparations and Reconciliation. These programs recommended reparations for the victims, including: monthly pensions, educational benefits for the children of the disappeared, exemption from military service, and priority access to health services.

However, these initiatives have also been criticized on a variety of grounds, such as their refusal to identify the perpetrators of violence and their failure to recognize a comprehensive range of victims to whom reparations are due.

'''Morocco''' – In [[Morocco]], the period between the 1960s and 1990s is often referred to as the "years of lead," referring to the massive human rights violations that occurred in the government's campaign of political oppression, including executions, torture, and the annihilation of other civil liberties. Shortly after he ascended the throne in 1999, [[King Mohammed VI]] created the Independent Arbitration Commission (IAC) to compensate the victims of forced disappearances and arbitrary detention. The IAC decided more than 5,000 cases and awarded a total of US$100 million, but victims and their families complained of lack of transparency in the tribunal's procedures and demanded truth seeking measures in addition to financial compensation.

These pressures were instrumental in leading to the 2004 creation of the Arab world's first official truth-seeking initiative, the Equity and Reconciliation Commission. The IER issued a ground-breaking reparations policy that upheld notions of gender equity
and resulted in roughly $85 million USD in financial compensation paid to almost 10,000 individuals, as well as recommendations on other measures such as the provision of health care and restoration of civil rights. The IER's recommendations also led to
a groundbreaking collective reparations program that combined symbolic recognition of human rights violations with a development component in eleven regions that had suffered from collective punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/publication/truth-and-reconciliation-morocco|title=Truth and Reconciliation in Morocco|date=25 April 2011|publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2010, implementation of the collective reparations program was ongoing.

Other reparations programs have been proposed and/or implemented in: Argentina, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, East Timor, El Salvador, Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Iraq, Malawi, Liberia, South Africa, Kenya, the
United States, and others.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|de Greiff|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictj.org/publication/live-other-kenyans-do-study-reparative-demands-kenyan-victims-human-rights-violations|title=“To Live as Other Kenyans Do”: A Study of the Reparative Demands of Kenyan Victims of Human Rights Violations|date=25 July 2011|publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential problems==
There are some logistical problems inherent in reparations, such as clearly defining the objectives, goals, and processes by which reparations will be distributed, determining how to address a range of atrocities with streamlined programs, or balancing economic development with financing reparation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dromi|first=Shai M.|title=Uneasy Settlements: Reparation Politics and the Meanings of Money in the Israeli Withdrawal from Gaza|journal=Sociological Inquiry|year=2014|volume=84|issue=1|doi=10.1111/soin.12028|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soin.12028/abstract|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some experts suggest that the problems lie in the very definition of reparations themselves.{{sfn|Carranza|2009}}

The UN's guidelines on reparations could be contested on the fact that they equate human rights violations with violations of civil and political rights, ignoring abuses of economic, social, and cultural rights. The guidelines explicitly state that their intent is to restore victims to their status in a time of peace, but the distribution of rights and resources often wasn't equal in peacetime. Thus reparations, if their intent is to return a society to its [[status quo]], run the risk of ignoring systemic oppression and reproducing social hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|de Greiff|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, reparations programs have been critiqued for ignoring the needs of women in transitional justice processes. In 2007, women's groups mobilized to examine how reparations policies could be more responsive to victims of gender-based violence. Their efforts led to the "Nairobi Declaration on Women's and Girl's Right to a Remedy and Reparation," which states that "reparations must go above and beyond the immediate reasons and consequences of the crimes and violations; they must aim to address the political and structural inequalities that negatively shape women's and girl's lives." &lt;ref&gt;Nairobi Declaration on Women's and Girl's Right to a Remedy and Reparation (2007), International Meeting on Women's and Girl's Right to a Remedy and Reparation, Nairobi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these concerns can be addressed by empowering women to have a voice in the reparations process, challenging discriminatory practices, and educating communities about sexual violence.&lt;ref name="ictj1"/&gt;

In addition to gender-based discrimination, children are often excluded from reparations procedures. The reasons of this are varied; reparations often fall in the hands of parents and are only indirectly given to children, and reparations programs often do not take into account the fact that children and adults are affected differently by violence. Thus reparations should also have a child-specific component to target abuses that are specifically suffered by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://ictj.org/news/through-new-lens-child-sensitive-approach-transitional-justice|title=Through a New Lens: A Child Sensitive Approach to Transitional Justice |publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice |date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shipowners' Liability (Sick and Injured Seamen) Convention, 1936''' is an [[International Labour Organization]] [[International Labour Organization#International Labour Conference|Convention]].

It was established in 1936, with the preamble stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to the liability of the shipowner in case of sickness, injury or death of seamen,...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Convention was ratified by the United States Senate and made effective by proclamation of the President on 29 October 1939, 54 Stat. 1963, 1704.  In Warren v. United States, 340 U.S. 523 (1951), the Supreme Court considered the application and interpretation of Article 2 of the Convention in a seaman's case against his employer, the United States, in its capacity as owner of the merchant ship S. S. Anna Howard Shaw.

While on shore leave, the seaman visited a dance hall.  An adjoining room overlooking the ocean had French doors that opened to an unprotected ledge.  The seaman stepped out onto the ledge, lost his balance, and fell.  He sued to recover maintenance and cure.

The district court awarded maintenance and cure and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals disallowed it.  Reversing, the Supreme Court noted:

"The Convention was a product of the International Labor Organization.  Its purpose was to provide an international system of regulation of the shipowner's liability.  That international system was aimed at providing a reasonable average which could be applied in any country. . . .  The aim indeed was not to change materially American standards but to equalize operating costs by raising the standards of member nations to the American level."

==Ratifications==
As of 2013, 18 states have ratified the convention. It has subsequently been denounced by seven of those ratifying states.

'''Statutory interpretation''' is the process by which courts interpret and apply [[legislation]]. Some amount of interpretation is often necessary when a case involves a [[statute]]. Sometimes the words of a statute have a plain and straightforward meaning. But in many cases, there is some [[ambiguity]] or [[vagueness]] in the words of the statute that must be resolved by the judge. To find the meanings of statutes, judges use various tools and methods of statutory interpretation, including traditional canons of statutory interpretation, legislative history, and purpose.
In [[common law]] jurisdictions, the [[judiciary]] may apply rules of statutory interpretation both to legislation enacted by the [[legislature]] and to [[delegated legislation]] such as administrative agency [[regulation]]s.

== History ==
Statutory interpretation first became significant in common law systems, of which England is the exemplar.  In Roman and Civil law, a statute (or code) guides the magistrate, but there is no judicial precedent.  In England, Parliament historically failed to enact a comprehensive code of legislation, which is why it was left to the courts to develop the common law; and having decided a case and given [[ratio decidendi|reasons for the decision]], the decision would become binding on later courts.

Accordingly, a particular interpretation of a statute would also become binding, and it became necessary to introduce a consistent framework for statutory interpretation.  In the construction (interpretation) of statutes, the principle aim of the court must be to carry out the "Intention of Parliament", and the English courts developed three main rules (plus some minor ones) to assist them in the task. These were: the [[mischief rule]], the [[literal rule]], and the [[Golden rule (law)|golden rule]].

Statutes may be presumed to incorporate certain components, as Parliament is "presumed" to have intended their inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Notes on the English Legal System - 2016 - Trevor Lyons - LJMU&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:

* Offences defined in criminal statutes are presumed to require ''[[mens rea]]'' (a guilty intention by the accused), ''[[Sweet v Parsley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet v Parsley [1970] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 132, [1969] 2 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 470, 53 Cr App R 221, [1969] 1 All ER 347, HL, reversing [1968] 2 QB 418&lt;/ref&gt;
* A statute is presumed to make no changes in the common law.
* A statute is presumed not to remove an individual's liberty, vested rights, or property.&lt;ref&gt;As with [[EU Law]], so in the UK an individual who is specifically targeted by a statute will normally have [[locus standi]] to bring a challenge by way of [[Judicial Review]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A statute is presumed not to apply to the Crown.
* A statute is presumed not to apply retrospectively (whereas the common law is "declaratory", ''[[Conspiracy (criminal)#Conspiracy to corrupt public morals and conspiracy to outrage public decency|Shaw v DPP]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Shaw v DPP  [1962] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 220&lt;/ref&gt;
* A statute is to be interpreted so as to uphold international treaties; and any statutory provision which contravene EC treaties are effectively void, ''[[R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport|Factortame]]''.&lt;ref&gt;R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport (No 2) [1991] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 603&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is presumed that a statute will be interpreted ''[[eiusdem generis]]'', so that words are to be construed in sympathy with their immediate context.

Where legislation and [[case law]] are in conflict, there is a presumption that legislation takes precedence insofar as there is any inconsistency. In the [[United Kingdom]] this principle is known as [[parliamentary sovereignty]]; but while Parliament has exclusive jurisdiction to legislate, the courts (mindful of their historic role of having developed the entire system of common law) retain sole jurisdiction to ''interpret'' statutes.

====General meaning====

The age old process of application of the enacted law has led to formulation of certain rules of interpretation. According to CROSS, "Interpretation is the process by which the courts determine the meaning of a statutory provision for the purpose of applying it to the situation before them."&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Cross, Statutory interpretation, 3rd Edition, p.34 {{ISBN|978-0406049711}}&lt;/ref&gt; While SALMOND says that, "the process by which the courts seek to ascertain the meaning of the legislature through the medium of authoritative forms in which it is expressed".&lt;ref&gt;SALMOND: "Jurisprudence"11th Edition, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretation of a particular statute depends upon the degree of creativity applied by the judges or the court in the reading of it, employed to achieve some stated end. A statute can be interpreted by using the Golden Rule, the Mischief Rule or the Literal Rule.

==== Intention of the Legislature ====

A statute is an edict of the legislature&lt;ref&gt;Vishnu Pratap Sugar works (private) ltd. v. Chief Inspector of Stamp, U.P., AIR 1968 SC 102, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and the conventional way of interpreting a statute is to seek the 'intention' of its maker. It is the judicature's duty to act upon the true intention of the legislature or the mens or sentential legis. The courts have to objectively determine the interpretation with guidance furnished by the accepted principles.&lt;ref&gt;R v. Secretary of State for the Environment expert Spath Holme, (2001) 1 All ER 195, p. 216(HL)&lt;/ref&gt; If a statutory provision is open to more than one interpretation the court has to choose that interpretation which represents the true intention of the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Venkataswami Naidu v. Narasram Naraindas, AIR 1966 SC 361, p.363&lt;/ref&gt; the function of the courts is only to expound and not to legislate.&lt;ref&gt;GP Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 13th Edition, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Meaning ====
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
The [[judiciary]] interprets how legislation should apply in a particular case as no legislation unambiguously and specifically addresses all matters. Legislation may contain uncertainties for a variety of reasons:
* Words are imperfect symbols to communicate intent. They are ambiguous and change in meaning over time. The word 'let' used to mean 'prevent' or 'hinder'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | let | id=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now means 'allow'. {{cns|reason=isn't the desired meaning obvious from context? alike polysemes like "bank"|text=The word 'peculiar' is used to mean ''both'' specific ''and'' unusual, e.g. "kangaroos are peculiar to Australia," and "it's very peculiar to see a kangaroo outside Australia."|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | peculiar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unforeseen situations are inevitable, and new technologies and cultures make application of existing laws difficult. (e.g. does the use of a new cloning technique create an embryo within the meaning of statute enacted when embryos could only be created by fertilisation?)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pattinson|first=Shaun D.|last2=Kind|first2=Vanessa|date=2017|title=Using a moot to develop students’ understanding of human cloning and statutory interpretation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0968533217726350|journal=Medical Law International|language=en|doi=10.1177/0968533217726350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uncertainties may be added to the statute in the course of enactment, such as the need for compromise or catering to special [[interest group]]s.

Therefore, the court must try to determine how a statute should be enforced. This requires '''statutory construction'''. It is a tenet of statutory construction that the legislature is supreme (assuming constitutionality) when creating law and that the court is merely an interpreter of the law. Nevertheless, in practice, by performing the construction the court can make sweeping changes in the operation of the law.

Statutory interpretation refers to the process by which a court looks at a statute and determines what it means. A statute, which is a bill or law passed by the legislature, imposes obligations and rules on the people. Statutes, however, although they make the law, may be open to interpretation and have ambiguities. Statutory interpretation is the process of resolving those ambiguities and deciding how a particular bill or law will apply in a particular case.

Assume, for example, that a statute mandates that all motor vehicles travelling on a public roadway must be registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). If the statute does not define the term "motor vehicles", then that term will have to be interpreted if questions arise in a court of law. A person driving a motorcycle might be pulled over and the police may try to fine him if his motorcycle is not registered with the DMV. If that individual argued to the court that a motorcycle is not a "motor vehicle," then the court would have to interpret the statute to determine what the legislature meant by "motor vehicle" and whether or not the motorcycle fell within that definition and was covered by the statute.

There are numerous rules of statutory interpretation. The first and most important rule is the rule dealing with the statute's plain language. This rule essentially states that the statute means what it says. If, for example, the statute says "motor vehicles", then the court is most likely to construe that the legislation is referring to the broad range of motorised vehicles normally required to travel along roadways and not "aeroplanes" or "bicycles" even though aeroplanes are vehicles propelled by a motor and bicycles may be used on a roadway.

In Australia and in the United States, the courts have consistently stated that the text of the statute is used first, and it is read as it is written, using the ordinary meaning of the words of the statute.

Below are various quotes on this topic from US courts:
*[[U.S. Supreme Court]]: "We begin with the familiar canon of statutory construction that the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself. Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.:" ''Consumer Product Safety Commission et al. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. et al.'',447 U.S. 102 (1980).  "[I]n interpreting a statute a court should always turn to one cardinal canon before all others. . . .[C]ourts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there." ''Connecticut Nat'l Bank v. Germain'', [[Case citation|112 S. Ct. 1146, 1149]] (1992). Indeed, "when the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: 'judicial inquiry is complete.'" 503 U.S. 249, 254. 
*[[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]]: In the dissent from en banc rehearing of ''[[Silveira v. Lockyer]]'' 312 F.3rd 1052 (2002), dissent at 328 F.3d 567 (2003) at 575, Judge Kleinfeld stated "it is 'a cardinal principle of statutory construction that we must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.' ''[[Williams v. Taylor]]'', 529 U.S. 362, 404, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)."
*[[Supreme Court of Virginia]]: "Every part of an act is presumed to be of some effect and is not to be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary." ''Red Ash Coal Corp. v. Absher'', [[Case citation|153 Va. 332, 335]], 149 S.E. 541, 542 (1929). 
*[[Supreme Court of Alaska]]: "In assessing statutory language, unless words have acquired a peculiar meaning,  by virtue of statutory definition or judicial construction,  they are to be construed in accordance with their common usage."  ''Muller v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc.'', 923 P.2d 783, 787-88 (Alaska 1996); 
*[[Arkansas Supreme Court]]: "When reviewing issues of statutory interpretation, we keep in mind that the first rule in considering the meaning and effect of a statute is to construe it just as it reads, giving the words their ordinary and usually accepted meaning in common language. When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, there is no need to resort to rules of statutory construction. A statute is ambiguous only where it is open to two or more constructions, or where it is of such obscure or doubtful meaning that reasonable minds might disagree or be uncertain as to its meaning. When a statute is clear, however, it is given its plain meaning, and this court will not search for legislative intent; rather, that intent must be gathered from the plain meaning of the language used. This court is very hesitant to interpret a legislative act in a manner contrary to its express language, unless it is clear that a drafting error or omission has circumvented legislative intent." ''Farrell v. Farrell'', 365 Ark. 465, 231 S.W.3d 619. (2006)
*[[Supreme Court of New Mexico]]: "The principal command of statutory construction is that the court should determine and effectuate the intent of the legislature using the plain language of the statute as the primary indicator of legislative intent." ''State v. Ogden'', 118 N.M. 234, 242, 880 P.2d 845, 853 (1994)  "The words of a statute . . . should be given their ordinary meaning, absent clear and express legislative intention to the contrary," as long as the ordinary meaning does "not render the statute's application absurd, unreasonable, or unjust."  ''State v. Rowell'', 121 N.M. 111, 114, 908 P.2d 1379, 1382 (1995) When the meaning of a statute is unclear or ambiguous, we have recognized that it is "the high duty and responsibility of the judicial branch of government to facilitate and promote the legislature's accomplishment of its purpose."  ''State ex rel. Helman v. Gallegos'', 117 N.M. 346, 353, 871 P.2d 1352, 1359 (1994). - ''New Mexico v. Juan'', 2010-NMSC-041, August 9, 2010
* [[California Court of Appeals]], 4th District: "Our role in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. (''People v. Jefferson'' (1999) 21 Cal.4th 86, 94 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 893, 980 P.2d 441].) Because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of that intent, we look first at the words themselves, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. (''People v. Lawrence'' (2000) 24 Cal.4th 219, 230 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 570, 6 P.3d 228].) We do not, however, consider the statutory language in isolation, but rather examine the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision, construing its words in  context and harmonizing its various parts. (''People v. Acosta'' (2002) 29 Cal.4th 105, 112 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 435, 52 P.3d 624].)"  ''Alford v. Superior Court'' (People) (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1033, 1040
*[[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]: "As in all statutory construction cases, we begin with the language of the statute. The first step is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case." ''[[Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.]]'', 534 U.S. 438, 450 (2002) "[U]nless otherwise defined, statutory words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary,  common meaning." ''United States v. Piervinanzi'', 23 F.3d 670, 677 (2d Cir. 1994).
*[[Court of Appeals of Maryland]]: "[W]e begin our analysis by reviewing the pertinent rules of [statutory construction]. Of course, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. To this end, we begin our inquiry with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly understood meaning, we end our inquiry there also." ''Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. of Maryland v. Director of Finance for Mayor and City Council of Baltimore'', 343 Md. 567, 683 A.2d 512 (1996)

==== Conflict of laws within a federation ====
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
[[Federal republic|Federal]] jurisdictions may presume that either federal or local government authority prevails in the absence of a defined rule.  In [[Canada]], there are areas of law where provincial governments and the federal government have concurrent jurisdiction. In these cases the federal law is held to be paramount. However, in areas where the Canadian constitution is silent, the federal government does not necessarily have superior jurisdiction. Rather, an area of law that is not expressly mentioned in Canada's Constitution will have to be interpreted to fall under either the federal residual jurisdiction found in the preamble of s. 91—known as the Peace, Order and Good Government clause—or the provinces residual jurisdiction of "Property and Civil Rights" under s. 92(13) of the 1867 Constitution Act.  This contrasts with other federal jurisdictions, notably the [[United States]] and [[Australia]], where it is presumed that if legislation is not enacted pursuant to a specific provision of the federal [[Constitution]], the states will have authority over the relevant matter in their respective jurisdictions, unless the state's definitions of their statutes conflicts with federally established or recognized rights.

====Internal and external consistency====
It is presumed that a statute will be interpreted so as to be internally consistent. A particular section of the statute shall not be divorced from the rest of the act. The '''''ejusdem generis''''' (or ''eiusdem generis'', Latin for "of the same kind") rule applies to resolve the problem of giving meaning to groups of words where one of the words is ambiguous or inherently unclear. The rule results that where "general words follow enumerations of particular classes or persons or things, the general words shall be construed as applicable only to persons or things of the same general nature or kind as those enumerated."&lt;ref&gt;''Walling v. Peavy-Wilson Lumber Co.'', 49 F. Supp. 846, 859 (W.D. La. 1943).&lt;/ref&gt; What is of the same generic nature is particularly decided upon analogy between the entities which are specific and the indeterminate one.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law]. American International Journal of Contemporary Research no. 1/2017 (v. 7): 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in a statute forbidding the concealment on one's "pistols, revolvers, derringers, or other dangerous weapons," the term "other dangerous weapons" may be construed to comprehend only dangerous weapons that are of the same kind (ara analogues) to those enumerated; i.e., firearms, or perhaps more narrowly still, handguns. A hypothetical court may have to determine whether a sword, a [[taser]], or a Japanese [[throwing star]] would be properly included in the "other" category of the statute. Here, the term "other dangerous weapons" must be given a meaning of the "same kind (genus)" as the words of established meaning.

A statute shall not be interpreted so as to be inconsistent with other statutes. Where there is an inconsistency, the judiciary will attempt to provide a harmonious interpretation.

====Statements of the legislature====
Legislative bodies themselves may try to influence or assist the courts in interpreting their laws by placing into the legislation itself statements to that effect. These provisions have many different names, but are typically noted as:
* ''Findings'';
* ''Declarations'', sometimes suffixed with ''of Policy'' or ''of Intent''; or
* ''Sense of Congress'', or of either house in multi-chamber bodies.
These provisions of the bill simply give the legislature's goals and desired effects of the law, and are considered nonsubstantive and non-enforcable in and of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction, 6th Edition, Vol. 1A, §20.12 (West Group 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Jurisprudence 2d, Vol. 73, "Statutes" (West Group 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canons ==

Also known as canons of construction, canons give common sense guidance to courts in interpreting the meaning of statutes. Most canons emerge from the [[common law]] process through the choices of judges. Proponents of the use of canons argue that the canons constrain judges and limit the ability of the courts to [[judicial activism|legislate from the bench]]. Critics argue that a judge always has a choice between competing canons that lead to different results, so judicial discretion is only hidden through the use of canons, not reduced.

===Textual===

Textual canons are rules of thumb for understanding the words of the text. Some of the canons are still known by their traditional [[Latin]] names.

; Plain meaning: When writing statutes, the legislature intends to use ordinary English words in their ordinary senses. The United States Supreme Court discussed the [[plain meaning rule]] in ''Caminetti v. United States,'' [[Case citation|242 U.S. 470]] (1917),  reasoning "[i]t is elementary that the meaning of a statute must, in the first instance, be sought in the language in which the act is framed, and if that is plain... the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms." And if a statute's language is plain and clear, the Court further warned that "the duty of interpretation does not arise, and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion."

; Rule against surplusage: Where one reading of a statute would make one or more parts of the statute redundant and another reading would avoid the redundancy, the other reading is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.georgetown.edu/academics/academic-programs/legal-writing-scholarship/writing-center/upload/statutoryinterpretation.pdf|title=Page Not Found — Georgetown Law|author=|date=|website=www.law.georgetown.edu|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''Eiusdem generis'' ("of the same kinds, class, or nature"): When a list of two or more specific descriptors is followed by more general descriptors, the otherwise wide meaning of the general descriptors must be restricted to the same class, if any, of the specific words that precede them. For example, where "cars, motor bikes, motor powered vehicles" are mentioned, the word "vehicles" would be interpreted in a limited sense (therefore vehicles cannot be interpreted as including airplanes).

''Ejusdem generis'' in a composition of a statute assumes especially the form of:

* “x, y, z or other”
* “x, y, z or the like”
* “…, particularly x, y and z”

The terms: x, y and z are precise here, while the word “other” or that which precedes them is by definition indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law]. American International Journal of Contemporary Research no. 1/2017 (v. 7): 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''Expressio unius est exclusio alterius'' ("the express mention of one thing excludes all others"): Items not on the list are impliedly assumed not to be covered by the statute or a contract term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garner |first1=Bryan A.. Ed. In Chief. |authorlink=Bryan A. Garner |year=1999 |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition= 7th |location=St. Paul, MN |publisher=West Publishing |page=602}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, sometimes a list in a statute is illustrative, not exclusionary. This is usually indicated by a word such as "includes" or "such as."

; ''In pari materia'' ("upon the same matter or subject"): When a statute is ambiguous, its meaning may be determined in light of other statutes on the same subject matter.

; ''Noscitur a sociis'' ("a word is known by the company it keeps"): When a word is ambiguous, its meaning may be determined by reference to the rest of the statute.

; ''Reddendo singula singulis'' or "referring each to each": "When a will says "I devise and bequeath all my real and personal property to A", the principle of reddendo singula singulis would apply as if it read "I devise all my real property, and bequeath all my personal property, to A", since the word devise is appropriate only to real property and the term bequeath is appropriate only to personal property."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://definitions.uslegal.com/r/reddendo-singula-singulis/|title = US Legal definitions|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:

; ''Generalia specialibus non derogant'' ("the general does not detract from the specific"): {{main|lex specialis}} Described in ''The Vera Cruz''&lt;ref&gt;(1884) 10 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|App Cas]] 59&lt;/ref&gt; as: "Now if anything be certain it is this, that where there are general words in a later Act capable of reasonable and sensible application without extending them to subjects specially dealt with by earlier legislation, you are not to hold that earlier legislation indirectly repealed, altered, or derogated from merely by force of such general words, without any evidence of a particular intention to do so."  This means that if a later law and an earlier law are potentially—but not necessarily—in conflict, courts will adopt the reading that does not result in an implied repeal of the earlier statute.  Lawmaking bodies usually need to be explicit if they intend to repeal an earlier law.

; Adequate application of law (pertinent application of law): It is a specific technique of composing canonical texts, which enables drafters to make such texts considerably shorter. It consists in stating in a statute that the set of specific statutory provisions should also be pertinently (adequately) applied to some other scope of circumstances –  although these provisions literally do not address these circumstances. For instance, the provisions that regulate the contract of the sale of goods may be ordered to be pertinently applied to the contract of the exchange of goods. Owing to such statutory clauses, the provisions which have been primarily shaped for one legal institution regulate two different legal institutions. The first is this one which is directly regulated by such provisions and the second is this institution which is regulated by such provisions due to the statutory reference made for that purpose. The reference can be made here to one or several statutory provisions. It can, however, also refer to a larger number of such provisions or even refer to a statute as a whole. In consequence of pertinent application of law, in relation to the latter institution, particular provisions can be applied without any modification, with certain modifications (they may concern a consequent as well as an antecedent), or even be denied any appllication.&lt;ref&gt;Maciej Koszowski, 	[http://www.aijcrnet.com/journals/Vol_7_No_1_March_2017/3.pdf The Scope of Application of Analogical Reasoning in Statutory Law]. American International Journal of Contemporary Research no. 1/2017 (v. 7), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive===

Substantive canons instruct the court to favor interpretations that promote certain values or policy results.

; "Charming Betsy" Canon : National statute must be construed so as not to conflict with international law.  See [https://constitutionallawreporter.com/2015/10/06/historical-charming-betsy-and-constitutional-law-2/ ''Murray v. The Charming Betsy''], [[case citation|6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64]]  (1804):  "It has also been observed that an act of Congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible construction remains..."

; Interpretation in Light of Fundamental Values : Statute does not violate fundamental societal values. See, for example, ''[[Holy Trinity Church v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Holy Trinity Church v. United States'' [[case citation|143 U.S. 457]] (1892)&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Coco v The Queen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|15|1994|litigants=Coco v The Queen |parallelcite=(1994) 179 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 427 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, legislation that is intended to be consistent with fundamental rights can be overridden by clear and unambiguous language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|2004|litigants=Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union |parallelcite=(2004) 221 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 309 |date=2 September 2004 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Rule of Lenity]] : In construing an ambiguous criminal statute, the court should resolve the ambiguity in favor of the defendant.&lt;ref name="Rule of Lenity - Economist"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/11/child-pornography-and-law | title=A man's jail term turns on a comma | publisher=[[The Economist]] | date=4 November 2015 | accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scalia |first1=Antonin  |last2=Garne |first2=Bryan A.  |date=2012 |title=Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts|trans-title= |url= |format= |language= |location= |publisher= |isbn=9780314275554 |via= |subscription= |quote="Blurred signposts to criminality will not suffice to create it."}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|296–302}}  See ''McNally v. United States'', 483 U.S. 350 (1987); See, e.g., Muscarello v. U.S., 524 U.S. 125 (1998) (declining to apply the rule of lenity); Evans v. U.S., 504 U.S. 255 (1992) (Thomas, J., dissenting); Scarborough v. U.S., 431 U.S. 563 (1977) (Stewart, J., dissenting); See ''United States v. Santos'' (2008).

; Avoidance of abrogation of state sovereignty : See ''Gregory v. Ashcroft'';&lt;ref&gt;''Gregory v. Ashcroft'' 501 U.S. 452 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; see also ''Gonzales v. Oregon'';&lt;ref&gt;''Gonzales v. Oregon'' 546 U.S. 243 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; see also ''[[Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs'' 538 U.S. 721 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; except where such would deprive the defendant of bedrock, foundational rights that the Federal Government intended to be the minimum floor that the states were not allowed to fall beneath; ''Dombrowski v Pfister.&lt;ref&gt;''Dombrowski v Pfister'', 380 U.S. 479 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

; "Indian" Canon : National statute must be construed in favor of Native Americans.  See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-507.ZS.html ''Chickasaw Nation v. United States''], [[case citation|534 U.S. 84]]  (2001):  "statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of Indians with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit." This canon can be likened to the doctrine of [[contra proferentem]] in contract law.

===Deference===

Deference canons instruct the court to defer to the interpretation of another institution, such as an administrative agency or Congress. These canons reflect an understanding that the judiciary is not the only branch of government entrusted with constitutional responsibility.

; Deference to Administrative Interpretations (US ''Chevron'' deference) : If a statute administered by an agency is ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the courts will defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation of the statute. This rule of deference was formulated by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in [[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.|''Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council'']], [[Case citation|467 U.S. 837 (1984)]].

; Avoidance Canon (Canon of Constitutional Avoidance) : If a statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable construction, courts should choose an interpretation that avoids raising constitutional problems. In the US, this canon has grown stronger in recent history. The traditional avoidance canon required the court to choose a different interpretation only when one interpretation was actually unconstitutional. The modern avoidance canon tells the court to choose a different interpretation when another interpretation merely raises constitutional doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Einer Elhauge. ''Statutory Default Rules: How to Interpret Unclear Legislation''. [[Harvard University Press]] (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=l4A0BVUeYHsC&amp;pg=PA237 p. 237–39]. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02460-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"United States v. Jin Fuey Moy", 241 U.S. 394, 401 (1916).&lt;/ref&gt;

; Avoiding Absurdity : The legislature did not intend an absurd or manifestly unjust result.&lt;ref&gt;Einer Elhauge. ''Statutory Default Rules: How to Interpret Unclear Legislation''. [[Harvard University Press]] (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=l4A0BVUeYHsC&amp;pg=PA148 p. 148]. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02460-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Green v.

; [[Clear statement rule]] : When a statute may be interpreted to abridge long-held rights of individuals or states, or make a large policy change, courts will not interpret the statute to make the change unless the legislature clearly stated it. This rule is based on the assumption that the legislature would not make major changes in a vague or unclear way, and to ensure that voters are able to hold the appropriate legislators responsible for the modification.

===Criticism===
Critics of the use of canons argue that canons impute some sort of "omniscience" to the legislature, suggesting that it is aware of the canons when constructing the laws. In addition, it is argued that the canons give a credence to judges who want to construct the law a certain way, imparting a false sense of justification to their otherwise arbitrary process. In a classic article, [[Karl Llewellyn]] argued that every canon had a "counter-canon" that would lead to the opposite interpretation of the statute.&lt;ref&gt;Karl N. Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules of Canons About How Statutes are to be Construed, 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395 (1950) republished with permission in 5 Green Bag 297 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Courts==
The common textual canons of statutory construction employed in American jurisprudence are: '''(1)''' '''''Ejusdem generis''' -'' "of the same kinds, class, or nature,''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=Norman J.|title=2A Sutherland Statutory Construction|publisher=Thomas Reuters|page=§ 47:17|edition= 7th |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' '''(2)''' '''''Expressio unius est exclusio alterius''' - "''the express mention of one thing excludes all others," &lt;ref&gt;2A Sutherland Statutory Construction § 47:23&lt;/ref&gt; '''(3)''' '''''Noscitur a sociis''' -'' "a word is known by the company it keeps,"&lt;ref&gt;2A Sutherland Statutory Construction § 47:16&lt;/ref&gt;'''(4) ''In pari materia''''' - "upon the same matter or subject," and (5) Common, technical, legal, or trade definition.&lt;ref&gt;2A Sutherland Statutory Construction § 47:27&lt;/ref&gt;

==European perception==
The French philosopher [[Montesquieu]] (1689-1755) believed that courts should act as "the mouth of the law", but soon it was found that some interpretation is inevitable. 
Following the German scholar [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] (1779-1861) the four main interpretation methods are:
* Grammatical interpretation: using the literal meaning of the statutory text ("grammatical" is actually the wrong word, but it is commonly used for this type of interpretation. "Textual" interpretation would be better.)
* Historical interpretation: using the legislative history, to reveal the intent of the legislator. 
* Systematic interpretation: considering the context of provisions, if only by acknowledging in which chapter a provision is listed.  
* Teleological interpretation: considering the ''purpose'' of the statute is considered, as it appears from legislative history, or other observations.
It is controversial{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} whether there is a hierarchy between interpretation methods. Germans prefer a "grammatical" (literal) interpretation, because the statutory text has a democratic legitimation, and "sensible" interpretations are risky, in particular in view of German history. "Sensible" means different things to different people. The modern common law perception that courts actually ''make'' law is very different. In a German perception, courts can only ''further'' develop law ("Rechtsfortbildung").
All of the above methods may seem reasonable: 
* It may be considered undemocratic{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} to ignore the literal text, because only that text was passed through democratic processes. Indeed, there may be no single legislative "intent" other than the literal text that was enacted by the legislature, because different legislators may have different views about the meaning of an enacted statute. It may also be considered unfair to depart from the literal text because a citizen reading the literal text may not have fair notice that a court would depart from its literal meaning, nor fair notice as to what meaning the court would adopt. It may also be unwise{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} to depart from the literal text if judges are generally less likely than legislatures to enact wise policies.  
* But it may also seem unfair{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} to ignore the intent of the legislators, or the system of the statutes. So for instance in Dutch law, no general priority sequence for the above methods is recognized.
The freedom of interpretation varies by area of law. Criminal law and tax law must be interpreted very strictly, and never to the disadvantage of citizens,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} but liability law requires more elaborate interpretation, because here (usually) both parties are citizens. Here the statute may even be interpreted ''contra legem'' in exceptional cases, if otherwise a patently unreasonable result would follow.

==International treaties==
The interpretation of international treaties is governed by another treaty, the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], notably Articles 31-33. The United States is not a party to the treaty, but the Vienna Convention is assumed to be a codification of obvious rules so the Convention is likely to be applied by the United States as well.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The rule is basically that the text of the treaty is decisive unless it either leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure or leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. Recourse to "supplementary means of interpretation" is allowed only in that case, like the preparatory works, also known by the French designation of ''[[travaux préparatoires]]''.

==Philosophies==

Over time, various methods of statutory construction have fallen in and out of favor. Some of the better-known rules of construction methods are:
* The [[Golden rule (law)|Golden rule]]
* The [[Literal rule]]
* The [[Mischief rule]]
* The [[Purposive approach]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">In [[collective bargaining]], '''surface bargaining''' is a strategy in which one of the parties "merely goes through the motions," with no intention of reaching an agreement.{{sfn|Caisley|2007|page=170}}{{sfn|Carrell|Heavrin|2001|page=159}} In this regard, it is a form of [[bad faith]] bargaining.{{sfn|Caisley|2007|page=170}}

Distinguishing surface bargaining from [[good faith]] bargaining is extremely difficult.{{sfn|Emerson|2009|page=580}} The entire history of the negotiations must be assessed, including the party's intent, efforts made toward reaching an agreement, and any behavior which may be seen as inhibiting the bargaining process.{{sfn|Caisley|2007|page=171}}{{sfn|Morris|Hardin|LaVaute|O'Reilly|1992|pages=616-632}} Surface bargaining tactics may include making proposals the other party could never accept, taking inflexible or unreasonable stands on issues, and/or refusing to offer alternatives to proposals.{{sfn|Morris|Hardin|LaVaute|O'Reilly|1992|pages=616-632}}{{sfn|Holley|Jennings|Wolters|2009|page=272}} Reneging on agreements already reached during the collective bargaining process, raising new issues late in the negotiations, or failing to follow generally accepted procedures for collective bargaining may also be seen as signs of surface bargaining.{{sfn|Forsyth|Stewart|page=137}}

Based upon the "totality" of a party's actions during collective bargaining, surface bargaining may be found if there was a purposeful effort to avoid or frustrate mutual agreement.{{sfn|Morris|Hardin|LaVaute|O'Reilly|1992|pages=616-632}}  Under U.S. law, it is an [[Unfair labor practice]] and a breach of the duty to bargain in good faith.{{sfn|Morris|Hardin|LaVaute|O'Reilly|1992|pages=616-632}}
 
Surface bargaining is barred under the labor law of many countries. Federal and provincial Canadian labor law bars surface bargaining, and Canadian courts have held that the test for determining surface bargaining is to look at the totality of the negotiations.{{sfn|Willes|1990|page=70}} In New Zealand, surface bargaining is a violation of the [[Employment Relations Act 2000]] (as amended).{{sfn|Rudman|2009|page=102}} A "Code of Good Faith" promulgated by the Employment Relations Authority supplements the legal statute, however, and lays out a number of rules for good faith bargaining.{{sfn|Forsyth|Stewart|page=137}} In the United States, surface bargaining constitutes an [[unfair labor practice]] under the [[National Labor Relations Act]].{{sfn|Morris|Hardin|LaVaute|O'Reilly|1992|pages=616-632}}{{sfn|Voos|1994|page=12}} American courts have held that "hard bargaining" (taking a firmly held and well-explained position), failing to make a concession, and/or failing to reach an agreement do not constitute surface bargaining under federal labor law.{{sfn|Twomey|2010|page=168}} Additional evidence, such as away-from-the-table statements or behavior, is needed to prove surface bargaining in the U.S.{{sfn|Twomey|2010|page=168}}

A''' tax expenditure''' program is government spending through the [[tax code]]. Tax expenditures alter the [[Equity (economics)|horizontal and vertical equity]] of the basic tax system by allowing exemptions, [[Tax deduction|deductions]], or [[Tax credit|credits]] to select groups or specific activities. For example, two people who earn exactly the same income can have different [[Tax rate#Effective|effective tax rates]] if one of the tax payers qualifies for certain tax expenditure programs by owning a home, having children, and receiving employer health care and pension insurance.

== The history of tax expenditures ==
In 1967, the tax expenditure concept was created by [[Stanley S. Surrey]], former Assistant [[Secretary of the Treasury]], as a way to represent the political use of tax breaks for means that were usually accomplished through budget spending. Secretary Surrey argued that members of Congress were using tax policy as a ``vast subsidy apparatus to reward favored constituencies or subsidize narrow policy areas.&lt;ref&gt;Surrey 1973, p. 6{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974 (CBA) defines tax expenditures as "those revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws which allow a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability" (Surrey 1985). They are equally common in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Christian M.A. Valenduc, Hana Polackova Brixi, Zhicheng Li Swift: Tax Expenditures - Shedding Light on Government Spending Through the Tax System: Lessons from Developed and Transition Economies; World Bank Publications, 31 Jan 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== The process of tax expenditures ==
The Congressional [[Joint Committee on Taxation]] (hereafter JCT) annually estimates tax expenditures in terms of revenues lost to the [[U.S. Treasury]] for each special tax provision included in the U.S. tax code. In 2009, the JCT listed over 180 tax expenditure programs that cost the U.S. government over $1 trillion in revenues. Their cost varies with the level of economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Hungerford: Tax Expenditures and the Federal Budget; Congressional Research Service, RL34622, 1 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A major tax expenditure is enjoyed by tax payers who own their own home and can deduct the interest on their mortgage payments. Since tax expenditures are claimed against a progressive tax code, individual tax expenditure programs are worth more to wealthier taxpayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=29729999 |doi=10.1257/aer.98.2.79 |title=How Big Are Total Individual Income Tax Expenditures, and Who Benefits from Them? |year=2008 |last1=Burman |first1=Leonard E |last2=Geissler |first2=Christopher |last3=Toder |first3=Eric J |journal=American Economic Review |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=79–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of tax expenditure programs are targeted for private social benefits and services.&lt;ref name="FaricyFull"&gt;Faricy 2011{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The administration of tax expenditures falls on the [[IRS]], and is not accounted for.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== The politics of tax expenditures ==
Tax expenditures are considered "off-budget" spending by most economists and budget experts.&lt;ref&gt;Howard 1997{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax expenditures are  easier to pass through Congress than increases in appropriations spending. They are easily seen as free benefits, when government grants are viewed as giveaways.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard E. Burman: Is the Tax Expenditure Concept Still Relevant?; National Tax Journal, September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike direct spending, tax spending must only pass through two committees, the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance. Tax expenditure programs, once in the tax code, do not come up for annual review and can only be removed through tax legislation. Tax expenditure programs are a form of [[entitlement]] spending in that every tax payer that qualifies can claim government money. Faricy (2011) demonstrated that when tax expenditures are counted as a type of government spending, Democratic and Republican parties are indistinguishable in annual changes to federal government spending. This study also finds that Republicans are more likely to increase tax expenditures when in control of government thereby subsidizing the activities of businesses and the wealthy.&lt;ref name="FaricyFull" /&gt; Jacob Hacker (2002) shows that the federal subsidization of private health insurance has grown over the years and has made efforts for nationalized health care more difficult. Ellis and Faricy (2011) find that when tax expenditures rise, public opinion adjusts and becomes more liberal to counteract the conservative policies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==The effect of tax expenditures==
[[File:CBO - Budgetary Effects of Largest Tax Expenditures 2017 to 2026.png|thumb|right|400px|Budgetary effects of largest tax expenditures 2017 to 2026, as an average annual percent of GDP]]
Partial exemption of the poor from taxation through reliance on [[progressive tax|progressive income taxes]] rather than [[sales tax]]es for revenue or tax rebates such as the [[earned income tax credit]] loosely correlate with [[socio-economic mobility in the United States]] with areas which tax the poor heavily such as the [[Deep South]] showing lower mobility than those with generous tax expenditures for the benefit of low income families with children.&lt;ref name=HarvardJuly2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendren|first=Nathaniel|title=The Economic Impacts of Tax Expenditures Evidence from Spatial Variation Across the U.S|date=July 2013|url=http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/tax_expenditure_soi_whitepaper.pdf|publisher=[http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/ equality-of-opportunity.org]|format=Revised draft|quote=We focus on intergenerational mobility because many tax expenditures are loosely motivated by the goal of expanding opportunities for upward income mobility for low-income families.

===Size of expenditures in U.S.===
A 2016 [[Congressional Budget Office]] report estimated that U.S. tax expenditures were expected to total $1.5 trillion in 2016; for scale, U.S. federal tax receipts were expected to be $3.3 trillion that year. CBO also estimated the size of major tax expenditures on federal receipts as an annual average percent of GDP, for the 2016 to 2026 periods. These included, among others:
*Exclusions from income: Employment based health insurance (1.5% GDP) and pension contributions (1.2% GDP)
*Deductions from income: State and local taxes (0.6% GDP) and mortgage interest (0.6% GDP)
*Preferential (lower) tax rates: Capital gains and dividends (0.6% GDP)
*Tax credits: Earned income tax credit (0.3% GDP)
CBO projected that the top 10 largest tax expenditures would average 6.2% GDP each year on average over the 2016-2026 period. For scale, federal tax receipts averaged around 18% GDP from 1970 to 2016. The CBO analysis does not account for behavioral changes that might occur if the tax policies were changed, so the actual revenue impact would differ from the amounts indicated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51129 CBO Budget &amp; Economic Outlook 2016 to 2026-January 25, 2016-Pages 101 to 105]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution of benefits in U.S.===
According to the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]] (CBPP), tax expenditures dis-proportionally benefit those with high incomes. CBPP estimated that the top 1% of U.S. households by income received approximately 17% of the tax expenditure benefits in 2013, while the top 20% received 51%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-federal-tax-expenditures CBPP-Policy Basics-Federal Tax Expenditures-Updated February 23, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The top 20% pay 84% of the federal income taxes; this figure does not include payroll taxes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/top-20-of-earners-pay-84-of-income-tax-1428674384&lt;/ref&gt; For scale, 50% of the $1.5 trillion in tax expenditures in 2016 is $750 billion, while the U.S. budget deficit was approximately $600 billion. In other words, eliminating the tax expenditures for just the top 20% could theoretically balance the budget in the short-run, although economic effects from changing the incentives may reduce the impact on the deficit.

CBO reported in January 2016 that: "Tax expenditures are distributed unevenly across the income scale. When measured in dollars, much more of the tax expenditures go to higher-income households than to lower-income households. As a percentage of people’s income, tax expenditures are greater for the highest-income and lowest-income households than for
households in the middle of the income distribution."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51129 CBO Budget &amp; Economic Outlook 2016 to 2026-January 25, 2016-Pages 101 to 105]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theories of political behavior''', as an aspect of [[political science]], attempt to quantify and explain the influences that define a person's political views, [[ideology]], and levels of political participation. Broadly speaking, behavior is political whenever individuals or groups try to influence or escape the influence of others. Political behavior is the subset of human behavior that involves politics and powers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, William Roberts, Matt Golder, and Sona N. Golder. 2013. “Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.”&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists who have had an influence on this field include [[Karl Deutsch]] and [[Theodor Adorno]].

==Long-term influences on political orientation==
Interaction with the political views of parental figures is often thought of as the primary long-term influence on political orientation and willingness to take part in the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gidengil|first=Elisabeth|last2=Wass|first2=Hanna|last3=Valaste|first3=Maria|date=June 2016|title=Political Socialization and Voting: The Parent-Child Link in Turnout|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44018017|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=69|pages=373-383|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/14515/teens-stay-true-parents-political-perspectives.aspx|title=Teens Stay True to Parents' Political Perspectives|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teacher]]s and other educational authority figures are also often thought to have a significant impact on political orientation. During the 2003-2004 school year, In the United States, students spent an average of 180.4 days in primary and secondary education each year, with a school day being defined as approximately 6.7 class hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/tables/table_2004_06.asp|title=Private School Universe Survey (PSS)|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that on average a student will spend around 1,208.68 hours in class each year. [[Post-secondary education]] appears to have an impact on both voting rates and political identification; as a study of 9,784,931 college students found that they voted at a rate of 68.5% in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://idhe.tufts.edu/nslve/2016|title=2016 NSLVE National Data|last=|first=|date=2017-09-18|website=Institute for Democracy &amp; Higher Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the average of 46.1% for citizens aged 18-29 who voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html|title=Voting in America:  A Look at the 2016 Presidential Election|last=Bureau|first=US Census|work=The United States Census Bureau|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Peers also affect political orientation. Friends often, but not necessarily, have the advantage of being part of the same generation, which collectively develops a unique set of societal issues; Eric L. Dey has argued that "socialisation is the process through which individuals acquire knowledge, habits, and value orientations that will be useful in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Dey, Eric L., ''Undergraduate Political Attitudes: Peer Influence in Changing Social Contexts'', Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 68, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to relate on this common level is what fuels and enables future ideological growth.

Sociologists and political scientists debate the relationship between age and the formation of political attitudes. The [[impressionable years hypothesis]] postulates that political orientation is solidified during early adulthood. By contrast, the "increasing persistence hypothesis" posits that attitudes become less likely to change as individuals become older, while the "life-long openness hypothesis" proposes that the attitudes of individuals remain flexible regardless of age.&lt;ref name="krosnick1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krosnick|first1=Jon A.|last2=Alwin|first2=Duane F.|title=Aging and Susceptibility to Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989|volume=57|issue=3|pages=416–425|url=https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/1989-Aging-and-Att-Change-Krosnick-and-Alwin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short-term influences on political orientation==
Short-term factors also affect [[voting behavior]]; the [[mass media|media]] and the impact of individual [[election]] issues are among these factors. These factors differ from the long-term factors as they are often short-lived. However, they can be just as crucial in modifying political orientation. The ways in which these two sources are interpreted often relies on the individuals specific political ideology formed by the long-term factors.

Most [[political scientist]]s agree that the mass media have a profound impact on voting behavior. One author asserts that "few would argue with the notion that the institutions of the mass media are important to contemporary politics ... in the transition to liberal democratic politics in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Europe]] the media was a key battleground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guidetowinningelections.com/do-mass-media-influence-the-political-behavior-of-citizens/|title=Do Mass Media Influence the Political Behavior of Citizens|date=2013-11-26|work=The Guide to Winning Elections|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, there are election issues. These include campaign issues, debates and commercials. Election years and political campaigns can shift certain political behaviors based on the candidates involved, which have different degrees of effectiveness in influencing voters.

==The influence of social groups on political outcomes==
Recently, some political scientists have been interested in many studies which aimed to analyze the relation between the behavior of social groups and the political outcomes. Some of the social groups included in their studies have been age demographics, [[gender]], and [[ethnic groups]].

For example, in [[U.S. politics]], the effect of ethnic groups and gender has a great influence on the political outcomes.

[[Latin Americans]] have a profound social impact on the political outcome of their vote and are emerging as a strong up-and-coming political force. The most noticeable increase in Latin American voting was in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], although the votes did not share a socially common political view at that time. In the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 election]], the Latin American vote aided tremendously in the election of [[Florida]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Mel Martinez]], although in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], about 44% of Latin Americans voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George W. Bush]]. However, Latin Americans have the lowest voting rate in the United States, with only 47.6% voting in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html|title=Voting in America:  A Look at the 2016 Presidential Election|last=Bureau|first=US Census|work=The United States Census Bureau|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently illegal immigration has been claiming the most attention and Latin Americans, although not completely unanimous, are concerned with the education, employment and deportation of illegal immigrants in the United States. Although the majority of Latin Americans vote for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates, [[Cuban Americans]] are likely the most conservative of Latinos, with 54% of Cuban American voters casting ballots for [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]], compared to an average of 35% of all Latinos who voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/15/unlike-other-latinos-about-half-of-cuban-voters-in-florida-backed-trump/|title=About half of Cuban voters in Florida backed Trump|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was represents a net decrease in support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] among Cuban Americans, it continues a trend created by the [[Cuban exile|exile of many Cubans]] after the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/op-ed/articles/2016-11-16/2016-highlighted-the-growing-complexity-of-the-cuban-american-vote|title=The Complex Cuban Vote|last=Lopez-Gottardi|first=Cristina|date=2016-11-16|work=U.S. News|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[African Americans]] have the second highest voting rates in the United States and even surpassed white voters in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election]], although this has declined in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]]. In the 2008 Presidential Election and [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 Presidential election]], African Americans voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate, [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2008/|title=How Groups Voted in 2008 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2012/|title=How Groups Voted in 2012 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend of African Americans voting for candidates of the Democratic Party continued into the 2016 Presidential Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/groups-voted-2016/|title=How Groups Voted 2016 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the United States have, in the past 30 years, surpassed male voting rates, with the 2016 Presidential Election having a ratio between females and males of 52 to 48.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-1980/|title=How Groups Voted in 1980 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-1984/|title=How Groups Voted in 1984 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-1988/|title=How Groups Voted in 1988 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/groups-voted-2016/|title=How Groups Voted 2016 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend is often referred to as the Gender Gap and when combined with the tendency of women to vote for Democratic candidates, their effect on political outcomes is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/opinion/trump-midterms-gender-gap.html|title=Opinion {{!}} What Happens if the Gender Gap Becomes a Gender Chasm?|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
== Biology and political science ==
Interdisciplinary studies in [[biology and political science]] aim to identify correlates of political behavior with biological aspects, for example the linkage of [[biology and political orientation]], but also with other aspects like [[partisanship]] and [[voting behavior]].&lt;ref name="SomitPeterson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Somit|author2=Steven A. Peterson|title=Biology and Political Behavior: The Brain, Genes and Politics - The Cutting Edge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__M0gG5kWg8C&amp;pg=PA232|year=2011|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-0-85724-580-9|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study is typically referred to [[genopolitics]] although it is sometimes referred to as [[biopolitics]],&lt;ref name="Blank2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Blank|title=Biology and Political Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAXYIkbWxawC|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-20436-1|quote=This book demonstrates the increasing convergence of interest of some social scientists in the theories, research and findings of the life sciences in building a more interdisciplinary approach to the study of politics. It discusses the development of biopolitics as an academic perspective within political science, reviews the growing literature in biopolitics, and presents a coherent view of biopolitics as a framework for structuring inquiry across the current subfields of political science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the term has other meanings.

The study of possible genetic bases of political behavior has grown since the 1980s. The term [[genopolitics]] was coined by political scientist [[James H. Fowler|James Fowler]] in the early-2000s to describe research into identifying specific transporter/receptor genes responsible for ideological orientation beyond the sociopsychological realm of political socialisation.

==Political participation==

Political scientists also aim to understand what drives individuals to participate in the democratic process, either by voting, volunteering for campaigns, signing petitions or protesting. Participation cannot always be explained by rational behavior. The [[voting paradox]], for example, points out that it cannot be in a citizen's self-interest to vote because the effort it takes to vote will almost always outweigh the benefits of voting, particularly considering a single vote is unlikely to change an electoral outcome. Political scientists instead propose that citizens vote for psychological or social reasons. Studies show, for example, that individuals are more likely to vote if they see their friends have voted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Corbyn |first1=Zoe |title=Facebook experiment boosts US voter turnout |url=https://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401 |website=Nature |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if someone in their household has received a nudge to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nickerson |first1=David |title=Is Voting Contagious? Evidence from Two Field Experiments |journal=American Political Science Review |date=February 2008 |volume=102 |issue=1 |jstor=27644497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3580">A '''transcript''' is a [[transcription (linguistics)|written record of spoken language]]. In [[court]] proceedings, a transcript is usually a record of all decisions of the [[judge]], and the spoken [[Logical argument|arguments]] by the [[litigant]]s' [[lawyer]]s. A related term used in the United States is [[Docket (court)|docket]], not a full transcript. The transcript is expected to be an exact and unedited record of every spoken word, with each speaker indicated. Such a record was originally made by court [[stenographer]]s who used a form of [[shorthand]] abbreviation to write as quickly as people spoke. Today, most [[court reporter]]s use a [[Stenotype|specialized machine]] with a [[phonetic]] key system, typing a key or key combination for every sound a person utters.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Many courts worldwide have now begun to use [[digital recording]] systems. The recordings are archived and are sent to [[court reporter]]s or [[transcriber]]s only when a transcript is requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Legal Language|author= Peter M. Tiers-ma|year=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-80302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many US transcripts are [[Index (publishing)|indexed]] by [[Deposition Source]] so that they may be searched by legal professionals via the [[Internet]]. Transcripts may be available publicly or to a restricted group of persons; a fee may be charged.

==Types==

Transcripts may be produced digitally. Transcripts produced by a digital reporter are often less accurate than those produced by a court [[stenographer]].  Only a court stenographer has the ability to control the record and get clarification in real time. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2013/05/30/silencing-the-court-reporters/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncra.org/files/MCMS/21B6BBC7-6A00-4E52-A6AA-ACDE4FECF25E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A transcript is also any written record of a speech, debate or discussion.

Rush transcripts are transcript requests that can be processed and mailed, or picked up, within short time of the request (usually 24 hours or less), provided there are no extenuating circumstances (such as unpaid bills). These expedited transcripts normally cost much more than regular transcripts.

==Check against delivery==

Sometimes, the first page of a transcript will have the words "''Check Against Delivery''" stamped across it, which means that the transcript is not the legal representation of the speech, but rather only the audio delivery is regarded as the official record. This is better explained in the French version of the message – ''Seul le texte prononcé fait foi'', literally "Only the spoken text is faithful".

Conversely, it may be that the actual given speech differs from the way the speaker intended, or that it contains extra information that is not pertinent to the central points of the speech and that the speaker does not want to be left as a permanent record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weneedaspeech.com/essential-speechwriter/check-against-delivery/ Check Against Delivery] (essay), ''WeNeedaSpeech.com'', 5 Feb 2008. Retrieved Jul 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-654_en.htm Speech by President Barroso at the University of Cape Town] ''(Example of a transcript with the "Check Against Delivery" stamp)'', Europa.EU, 19 Jul 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3434">The '''Unemployment Act 1934''' was an Act of Parliament in the [[United Kingdom]], reaching statute on 28 June 1934. It reduced the age at which a person entered the [[National Insurance]] scheme to 14 and made the claiming age 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/so/youthchron/SocialSecurity/pre45socsecurity.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006141914/http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/so/youthchron/SocialSecurity/pre45socsecurity.htm|date=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also separated benefits earned by paying National Insurance and those purely based on need.&lt;ref name=NationalArchives&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/alevelstudies/1930-depression.htm |title=The Cabinet Papers &amp;#124; 1930s Depression and unemployment |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To do this, it established two bodies: the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee to deal with [[unemployment benefit]]s earned by payment of National Insurance when in work; and the Unemployment Assistance Board to provide [[means-tested]] payments for those not entitled to such benefits.&lt;ref name=Epidemiology&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/32/4/500 |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=2003|volume=32|pages=500–502|title=Commentary: The context and outcome of nutrition campaigning in 1934|doi=10.1093/ije/dyg164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1934 Unemployment Act also restored the previous 10% cut in unemployment benefits, brought in after the [[May Report|1931 May Committee]]. This was due to a reduction in the number of those unemployed in the UK, which was reduced partially due to the creation of the [[British Iron and Steel Federation|Iron and Steel Federation]] in 1934 and the introduction of the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]] in 1933.

== Basis for the Act ==
In order to pass the Unemployment Act, [[Henry Betterton, 1st Baron Rushcliffe|Sir Henry Betterton]] (Minister of Labour at the time), based his bill on a set of principles. Betterton divided the bill into three separate parts, each of which had a distinct set of principles.

=== Part 1: Insurance ===
# That the scheme should be financed by contributions from the workers, employers and the State.
# That benefit should be dependent upon contributions
# That the scheme should be maintained on a solvent and self-supporting basis.

=== Part 2: Eligibility ===
# That assistance should be proportionate to need.
# That a worker who has been long unemployed may require assistance other than, and in addition to, cash payments.
# That the State should accept general responsibility for all the industrial able-bodied unemployed outside insurance, within, of course, the limits of a practical definition.

=== Part 3: Transition ===
Part III of the Bill dealt with the transitory provisions—for the transition from the existing arrangements to the amended insurance scheme and the new assistance scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1933/nov/30/unemployment-bill#S5CV0283P0_19331130_HOC_269|title = UNEMPLOYMENT BILL.

'''United Nations [[List of UN Security Council Resolutions|Security Council Resolution]] 1373''', adopted unanimously on 28 September 2001, is a [[counter-terrorism]] measure passed following the [[September 11 attacks|11 September terrorist attacks]] on the United States.&lt;ref name=un&gt;{{cite news|title=Security Council unanimously adopts wide-ranging anti-terrorism resolution; calls for suppressing financing, improving international cooperation|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/sc7158.doc.htm|publisher=United Nations|date=28 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resolution was adopted under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], and is therefore binding on all UN member states.

The five-minute meeting exemplified the Security Council's working method,&lt;ref name="dewet2003"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=De Wet|editor-first1=Erika|editor-last2=Nollkaemper|editor-first2=André|editor-last3=Dijkstra|editor-first3=Petra|title=Review of the Security Council by member states|date=2003|publisher=Intersentia|location=Antwerp|isbn=9789050953078|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the meeting serves only as a public announcement of a decision that has already been reached in secret in "[[United Nations Security Council#Consultation room|informal consultations]]."&lt;ref name="elgebeily2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elgebeily|first1=Sherif|title=The Rule of Law in the United Nations Security Council Decision-Making Process: Turning the Focus Inwards|date=2017|isbn=9781315413440|page=54–-55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the United States is widely credited with initiating Resolution 1373,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} once adopted unanimously, the resolution became a common act of the Security Council, and therefore all its members at the time had ownership over it.

== Aims of the resolution ==

The resolution aimed to hinder terrorist groups in various ways. It recalled provisions from resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1189|1189]] (1998), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1269|1269]] (1999) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368|1368]] (2001) concerning terrorism. UN member states were encouraged to share their intelligence on terrorist groups in order to assist in combating international terrorism. The resolution also calls on all states to adjust their [[anti-terrorism legislation|national laws]] so that they can ratify all of the existing [[international conventions on terrorism]]. It stated that all States "should also ensure that terrorist acts are established as serious criminal offences in domestic laws and regulations and that the seriousness of such acts is duly reflected in sentences served."&lt;ref name=un/&gt;

The resolution established the Security Council's Counter Terrorism Committee [CTC] to monitor state compliance with is provisions.

It also aimed at restricting [[immigration law]], stating that "before granting [[refugee]] status, all States should take appropriate measures to ensure that the [[right of asylum|asylum seekers]] had not planned, facilitated or participated in terrorist acts.  Further, States should ensure that refugee status was not abused by the perpetrators, organizers or facilitators of terrorist acts, and that claims of political motivation were not recognized as grounds for refusing requests for the [[extradition]] of alleged terrorists."&lt;ref name=un/&gt;

However, the resolution failed to define 'Terrorism', and the [[working group]] initially only added [[Al-Qaeda]] and the [[Taliban]] regime of [[Afghanistan]] on the sanctions list. This also entailed the possibility that authoritarian regimes could label even non-violent activities as terrorist acts, thus infringing upon basic human rights.

== Resolution 1456 (2003) ==
{{Main|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1456}}
The absence of any specific reference to human rights considerations was remedied in part by Resolution 1456 (2003) which declared that "States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law, and should adopt such measures in accordance with international law, in particular, international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law."

== Resolution 1566 ==

[[UN Security Council Resolution 1566]] picked up loose ends from '''1373''' by actually spelling out what the Security Council sees as terrorism:

{{quote|criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.}}

Although this definition has operative effect for the purposes of Security Council action, it does not represent a definition of "terrorism" which binds all states in international law. That is a task which could only be achieved by way of agreeing to an international treaty under the auspices of the UN General Assembly. Negotiations towards agreeing to such are ongoing, and a Comprehensive Convention exists in draft form, however agreement to its exact terms, most particularly the definition of "terrorism", remains elusive.

Resolution 1566 also called for the creation of a working group that will expand the list of terrorist entities under sanction beyond the [[Taliban]] and [[Al-Qaeda]].

== National implementation ==

Most states complied with the resolution, with varying willingness ([[Mexico]] and [[Venezuela]] being quite reluctant, especially concerning the freezing of assets of persons or groups whom they had no evidence of involvement in terrorism), but only a few of them did so by explicitly referring to the UN resolution.

Russia implemented the resolution with great willingness - [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] translated the resolution into Russian and enacted it as domestic law by 10 January 2002 in the [[Decree]] of the President of the Russian Federation No 6 On Measures Towards the Implementation of UN Security Resolution 1373.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/17717 Указ Президента Российской Федерации от 10.01.2002 г. № 6], 10 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1st of April 2014, the Government of Sri Lanka signed an order designating 16 organisations functioning as terrorist fronts on foreign soil freezing all assets and economic resources of those, using this resolution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local/banned-no-fronting-ltte&lt;/ref&gt;

== CTC 2008 report ==

Recommendations of the Counter Terrorism Committee 2008 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey of the implementation of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), Report of the Counter-Terrorism Committee|url=https://undocs.org/S/2008/379|website=undocs.org|accessdate=10 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; included increased measures concerning [[illegal immigration]] (considered, without evidence, as a serious risk to security) as well as:

*to "Promote inter-agency coordination and the exchange of counter-terrorism information at the national, regional and international levels";
*to "Encourage States to establish dedicated and permanent counter-terrorism units, with the assistance of experts seconded from various specialized institutions, in areas such as criminal law, counter-financing of terrorism and border control";
*to "Encourage greater cooperation with [[INTERPOL]] and increased utilization of its resources and [[database]]s, such as red notices and watch lists" (Interpol created in 2002 the [[Interpol Terrorism Watch List]]).

== Criticism ==

[[Oxford University]] public law professor Stefan Talmon argued that this resolution is an example of the United Nations Security Council veering into legislating law in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks when its role is to apply and interpret international law.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Talmond, 'The Security Council  as World Legislator' (2005) 99 ''American Journal of International Law'' p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Reilly, Gabrielle Appleby and Laura Grenfell. ''Australian Public Law'' (Oxford University Press, 2011)  p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The United States of America v. Jerome O'Hara and George Perez''''' ([[S.D.N.Y.]], No. 09-mag-2484) is a federal court case for the ongoing [[Criminal trial|trial]] of Jerome O'Hara and George Perez, two [[computer programmer]]s who previously worked for [[Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC]] (BLMIS) until the arrest of the company's chairman, [[Bernard Madoff]], on December 11, 2008.&lt;ref name="McCool"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN1346294620091113 | title=U.S. arrests and charges two Madoff programmers | last=McCool | first=Grant |author2=Rachelle Younglai  | publisher=Reuters | date=November 13, 2009 | accessdate=November 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order to issue [[arrest warrant]]s for O'Hara and Perez was signed on November 12, 2009 by [[United States magistrate judge|federal magistrate judge]] Debra C. Freeman.&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/22511666/O-Hara-Jerome-and-Perez-George-Complaint | title=O'Hara, Jerome and Perez, George Complaint | accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next morning, [[FBI]] agents arrested O'Hara at his home in [[Malverne, New York]] and Perez at his home in [[East Brunswick, New Jersey]], and charged them each with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to falsify books and records, falsifying books and records of a [[Broker-dealer|broker–dealer]], and falsifying books and records of an [[investment advisor]] (IA).&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt; The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] also served them with [[Civil suit|civil charges]].&lt;ref name="McCool" /&gt;

At their [[bail hearing]], federal prosecutor [[Preet Bharara]] said: "The computer codes and random algorithms they allegedly designed served to deceive investors and regulators and concealed Madoff's crimes." The attorney for O'Hara, Gordon Mehler, said "We intend to enter a plea of not guilty", and the attorney for Perez, Larry Krantz, declined to comment. Federal magistrate judge [[Ronald L. Ellis]] set the bail at $1 million with travel restrictions.&lt;ref name="McCool" /&gt;

== Background ==
O'Hara and Perez began working for BLMIS in 1990 and 1991, respectively.&lt;ref name="McCool" /&gt;

Prosecutors claim that in April 2006, the two men tried to delete 218 computer programs from an [[IBM]] server known internally as "House 17".&lt;ref name="McCool" /&gt; According to the SEC, the programs, among other things, outputted volumes of fake trade blotters, stock records, [[Depository Trust Corporation]] (DTC) reports and other phantom books and records to substantiate nonexistent trading.&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21292.htm | title=''Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jerome O'Hara and George Perez'' (S.D.N.Y. 09 CV 9425 (LLS)). SEC Charges Madoff Computer Programmers | date=November 13, 2009 | publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission | accessdate=November 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filenames containing the programs were often prefixed with "SPCL", which stood for "special".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/13/madoff-accomplices-jerome-ohara-george-perez | date=November 13, 2009 | title=Madoff's former IT experts arrested over $65bn fraud | publisher=Guardian.co.uk | accessdate=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI and SEC said that later in August or September 2006, O'Hara and Perez withdrew hundreds of thousands of dollars from their personal BLMIS accounts before informing Madoff that they no longer wished to lie for him.&lt;ref name="McCool" /&gt;

=== The Ponzi scheme ===
According to the FBI, from at least as early as the 1980s through to December 11, 2008, Madoff, [[Frank DiPascali]], and others perpetrated a scheme to defraud clients of the BLMIS IA corporation by accepting billions of dollars of clients' funds under false pretenses, promising to invest the funds for the clients. Instead, they failed to invest the funds and created and distributed false documents that purported to show that the funds had been invested, when they hadn't. Allegedly, they also lied to the SEC and an accounting firm to cover up the fraudulent scheme.&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt;

Madoff solicited, and caused others to solicit, prospective clients to open accounts with BLMIS by, among other things, promising to invest funds in common stock, options, and other securities in a way that would achieve high [[Rate of return|rates of return]] with little risk. They managed to establish thousands of accounts with BLMIS, representing individual investors, charities, trusts, pension funds, [[hedge fund]]s, and corporations.&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt;

=== "Split Strike" strategy ===
DiPascali, under the direction of Madoff, created a purported investment strategy that was referred to as a "split strike conversion" ("Split Strike") strategy, and marketed this to clients beginning in or around the early 1990s. Clients whose funds were to be managed within the strategy were promised that:
# Their funds would be invested in a pool of around 35–50 common stocks from the [[S&amp;P 100|Standard &amp; Poor's 100 Index]] (S&amp;P 100)
# The collection of stocks would mimic the price movements of the Index
# The investments would be [[Hedge (finance)|hedged]] by buying contracts related to those stocks, thereby limiting potential losses from unexpected changes in stock prices
# Madoff would appropriately time the entry and removal of funds in this investment strategy
# Funds that were not invested in stocks would be invested in [[money market fund]]s and U.S.-issued securities such as U.S. [[Treasury bill]]s.

Thousands of BLMIS clients were told that their funds, collectively worth billions, were invested within the Split Strike strategy.&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt;

Allegedly, Madoff and others created statements for the "Split Strike clients" that listed stocks in which their funds were supposedly invested. The reports falsely made it appear that the returns were approximately 10 to 17 percent per year.

Allegedly, DiPascali and others, in order to conceal the falsehood of the strategy, prepared several, model baskets of S&amp;P 100 stocks, and tracked how these hypothetical baskets would have performed in the actual marketplace to determine what the clients would be told regarding when their funds had "entered the market". Data related to chosen baskets of securities would be entered into an [[IBM AS/400]] server known as "House 17", which was dedicated primarily to the IA business. Madoff, DiPascali, and others used computer programs that were allegedly written by O'Hara and Perez to allocate ''[[wikt:pro rata|pro rata]]'' multiples of the chosen basket, based on clients' purported account balances with BLMIS. These programs would output thousands of pages of fake documents that purported to confirm the purchase of stocks from the chosen basket. A similar process was used when funds were "removed from the market".&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt;

Because none of the purchases had actually occurred, Madoff, DiPascali, and others would allegedly price each stock at some chosen price from the range of prices which the stock was selling for on the day that the stocks were supposedly purchased. They supposedly chose a price that would make the trades, if they had actually happened, most favorable, but still making sure that the volume of trades of the stock on the day of the "trade" was sufficiently high as to not cause suspicion.

Allegedly, Madoff, DiPascali, and others oversaw the production and mailing of thousands of pages of account "statements" each month, which all falsely reflected securities transactions that had not occurred. According to the FBI, they would also routinely add lines representing additional, fictitious option trades for the purpose of making it appear that the accounts had achieved the targeted rate of return.&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt;

=== "Non-Split Strike clients" ===
At all times during the fraud, BLMIS had a number of clients who were not invested within the Split Strike strategy ("Non-Split Strike clients"). The non-Split Strike clients were told that their funds would be invested using strategies that would realize annual rates of return from at least 53 percent. From at least the early 1980s, Madoff and others allegedly took steps to make it appear as though their funds had generated these extraordinarily high returns, when, in fact, their funds had not been invested at all.&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt;

=== "House 05" and Stratus systems ===
The operations of the "Market Making" and "Proprietary Trading" businesses of BLMIS principally relied on two computer systems: a [[Stratus Technologies|Stratus]] trading platform, and an IBM AS/400 server that was internally known as "House 05". The Stratus system was responsible for, among other things, effectuating the trading activities of BLMIS, and it communicated with third parties in connection with trades, in particular, by communicating with trading contra parties. Data was regularly transferred from the Stratus system to House 05.

Allegedly, O'Hara and Perez were very familiar with the back-end workings of the House 05 system, and, among other things, they wrote programs for House 05 that would:
# Process data generated by the Stratus system
# Enable communication with third parties including the [[Depository Trust Company]]
# Obtain data from these third parties to be used in creating books and records
# Assist BLMIS employees in finding discrepancies between the House 05 and Stratus systems by generating "break sheets".

According to the FBI, O'Hara and Perez were also responsible for maintaining House 05.&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt;

=== "House 17" ===
Another IBM AS/400 server, known internally as "House 17", was the principal computer system of the IA business. Unlike House 05, House 17 did not electronically receive trading data from third parties. Allegedly, all data on the House 17 system was generated by DiPascali and others in the IA business, who entered it into the House 17 server.&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt;

The FBI examined backup tapes and used testimony of DiPascali to conclude that O'Hara and Perez developed and maintained computer programs on the House 17 server that were used expressly for the purpose of entering fictitious trading data into the server. FBI agents claim that the House 17 computer programs were used to generate, among other things, thousands of pages of fake account statements, trade confirmations, trading blotters, and other books and records related to BLMIS's purported IA business.

== Charges ==
The United States formally charged O'Hara and Perez with:&lt;ref name="complaint" /&gt;
* Count One – Conspiracy to Falsify Books and Records of a Broker–Dealer and to Falsify Books and Records of an Investment Advisor
* Count Two – Falsifying Books and Records of a Broker–Dealer
* Count Three – Falsifying Books and Records of an Investment Advisor

'''''United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.''''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/362/29/case.html#47 ''United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.''], 362 U.S. 29 (1960), reversing 164 F. Supp. 827 (D.D.C.).&lt;/ref&gt; was a 1960 decision of the [[United States Supreme Court]] limiting the so-called [[United States v. Colgate &amp; Co.|''Colgate'' doctrine]], which substantially insulates unilateral refusals to deal with price-cutters from the antitrust laws. The ''Parke, Davis &amp; Co.'' case held that, when a company goes beyond "the limited dispensation" of ''[[Colgate-Palmolive|Colgate]]'' by taking affirmative steps to induce adherence to its suggested prices, it puts together a combination among competitors to fix prices in violation of §&amp;nbsp;1 of the [[Sherman Act]]. In addition, the Court held that when a company abandons an illegal practice because it knows the US Government is investigating it and contemplating suit, it is an abuse of discretion for the trial court to hold the case that follows moot and dismiss it without granting relief sought against the illegal practice.

==Background==
[[Parke-Davis]] makes pharmaceutical products and markets them through drug wholesalers and drug retailers. The retailers buy these products from the wholesalers or make large quantity purchases directly from Parke Davis. Parke Davis placed in its wholesalers' catalogue a Net Price Selling Schedule listing suggested minimum resale prices on the Parke Davis products that wholesalers sold to retailers and stating that it was "Parke Davis' continuing policy to deal only with drug wholesalers who observed that schedule." The retailers' catalog contained a schedule of minimum retail prices applicable in States with Fair Trade laws, and stated that this schedule was suggested for use also in places such as Virginia and D.C. where there were no Fair Trade laws.&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:This is the logo of Parke Davis.gif|thumb|250px]]

There were about 260 drugstores in D.C., and about 100 in Richmond, Virginia. Many of these stores were units of the large Peoples Drug Store chain (now CVS). Five drug wholesalers handled Parke Davis products in these areas. The wholesalers observed the resale prices suggested by Parke Davis. However, during the spring and early summer of 1956, drug retailers in the two cities advertised and sold several Parke Davis vitamin products at prices substantially below the suggested minimum retail prices. As a result, the Baltimore office manager of Parke Davis in charge of the sales district that included the two cities sought advice from his head office on how to handle this situation. The Parke Davis attorney advised that the company could legally "enforce an adopted policy arrived at unilaterally" to sell only to customers who observed the suggested minimum resale prices. He further advised that this meant that "we can lawfully say 'we will sell you only so long as you observe such minimum retail prices' but cannot say 'we will sell you only if you agree to observe such minimum retail prices,' since, except as permitted by Fair Trade [laws], agreements as to resale price maintenance are invalid." &lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baltimore branch manager put into effect a program for promoting observance of the suggested minimum retail prices. In order to ensure that retailers who did not comply would be cut off from sources of supply, representatives of Parke Davis visited the five wholesalers and told them, in effect, that not only would Parke Davis refuse to sell to wholesalers who did not adhere to the policy announced in its catalogue, but also that it would refuse to sell to wholesalers who sold Parke Davis products to retailers who did not observe the suggested minimum retail prices. Each wholesaler was interviewed individually and informed that his competitors were also being apprised of this. The wholesalers each indicated a willingness to go along with the Parke Davis policy. Parke Davis representatives also called on the price-cutter retailers and told each that, if he did not observe the suggested minimum retail prices, Parke Davis would refuse to deal with him, and that, furthermore, he would be unable to purchase any Parke Davis products from the wholesalers. Each retailer was also told that his competitors were being similarly informed.&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several retailers refused to give Parke Davis any assurances of compliance and continued despite these interviews to advertise and sell Parke Davis products at prices below the suggested minimum retail prices. Parke Davis furnished their names to the wholesalers. Parke Davis refused to fill any direct orders from such retailers, and the wholesalers likewise refused to fill any of their orders. This ban extended to all Parke Davis products, even those necessary to fill prescriptions (on which price cutting had not occurred).&lt;ref&gt;362 U. S. at 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of [[Dart Drug]], one of the price-cutter retailers that Parke Davis had cut off, protested to the assistant branch manager of Parke Davis that Parke Davis was discriminating against him because a drugstore across the street, one of the Peoples Drug chain, had a sign in its window advertising Parke Davis vitamin products at cut prices. The retailer was told that, if this were so, the branch manager "would see Peoples and try to get them in line." The branch manager then visited a vice-president of Peoples and told him "that anyone that did not go along with our policy, we were not interested in doing business with them." Peoples then told Parke Davis that it would stop cutting prices on Parke Davis products. However, five retailers, including Dart Drug, continued their price cutting. Parke Davis decided that at least advertising cut prices should stop and that would lessen the price cutting. A Parke Davis representative visited Dart's president and he said that he might be willing to stop advertising, although continuing to sell at discount prices if shipments to him were resumed. Parke Davis representatives then told each of the other price-cutter retailers that Dart was ready to discontinue price-cut advertising. Each of the retailers said that, if Dart stopped advertising, he would also. Parke Davis reported this to Dart, and then all five retailers discontinued advertising of Parke Davis vitamins at less than suggested minimum retail prices, and Parke Davis and the wholesalers resumed sales of Parke Davis products to them.&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after a month one of the retailers again started newspaper advertising, and, despite the efforts of Parke Davis to prevent it, the others quickly followed suit. At this point, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, on complaint of Dart Drug, began investigating Parke Davis for price fixing.  Parke Davis then stopped trying to promote the retailers' adherence to its suggested resale prices, and neither it nor the wholesalers since declined further dealings with the price cutters.&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Government sued Parke Davis under §§&amp;nbsp;1 and 3 of the Sherman Act for combining and conspiring "with retail and wholesale druggists in Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia, to maintain the wholesale and retail prices of Parke Davis pharmaceutical products."&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.'', 164 F. Supp. 827 (D.D.C.).&lt;/ref&gt; The district court held that the Government's proofs did not establish a violation of the Sherman Act because Parke Davis's actions "were properly unilateral, and sanctioned by law under the doctrine laid down in the case of ''United States v. Colgate''."&lt;ref&gt;164 F. Supp. at 829.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling of Supreme Court==
The Government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed. [[William J. Brennan|Justice Brennan]] wrote for the majority, [[Potter Stewart|Justice Stewart]] concurred in the judgment, and [[John M. Harlan II|Justice Harlan]], joined by [[Felix Frankfurter|Justices Frankfurter]] and [[Charles Evans Whittaker|Whittaker]] dissented.

===Majority opinion===
[[File:William Brennan color.jpg|thumb|150px|Justice Brennan]]
Justice Brennan's opinion for the Court began with a review of what the Court had held in its 1919 decision in ''[[United States v. Colgate &amp; Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;250 U.S. 300 (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; since the issue before the Court was whether the conduct of Parke Davis fell under the protection of the ''Colgate'' doctrine. The Government conceded for the purposes of the ''Parke Davis'' case that, under the ''Colgate'' doctrine, a manufacturer, having announced a price-maintenance policy, may bring about adherence to it by refusing to deal with customers who do not observe that policy. The Government contended, however, that "subsequent decisions of this Court compel the holding that what Parke Davis did here by entwining the wholesalers and retailers in a program to promote general compliance with its price maintenance policy went beyond mere customer selection, and created combinations or conspiracies to enforce resale price maintenance in violation of .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. the Sherman Act."&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Dr. Miles''====
"The history of the ''Colgate'' doctrine is best understood," the Court said, "by reference to a case which preceded the ''Colgate'' decision, ''Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.''&lt;ref&gt;220 U. S. 373 (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Dr. Miles entered into contracts with wholesale and retail merchants that required them to resell a medicine at prices that Miles fixed. Park refused to sign the contracts, induced customers of Miles to resell to Park, and then Park sold the medicines at cut prices in violation of Miles's resale-price maintenance program. Miles sued Park for inducing Miles's customers to breach their contracts with him. Citing ''Coke on Littleton'', §&amp;nbsp;360 and ''[[Mitchel v Reynolds]]'', the Court held the restrictive agreements that Miles sought to enforce were invalid at common law and under the Sherman Act as well. In the ''Colgate'' case, however, there was no agreement, just a refusal to deal with price cutters. "The ''Colgate'' decision distinguished ''Dr. Miles'' on the ground that the ''Colgate'' indictment did not charge that company with selling its products to dealers under agreements which obligated the latter not to resell except at prices fixed by the seller.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Dr. Miles'', 220 U.S. at 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Schrader's Son''====
In the next case, ''United States v. Schrader's Son, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;252 U.S. 85 (1920).&lt;/ref&gt; the Government indicted a parts manufacturer for entering into price-fixing agreements with retailers, jobbers and manufacturers who used or resold his products. The ''Schrader's Son'' Court held that ''Colgate'' did not immunize the conduct, and explained that ''Colgate''

&lt;blockquote&gt;meant no more than that a manufacturer is not guilty of a combination or conspiracy if he merely "indicates his wishes concerning prices and declines further dealings with all who fail to observe them . . . "; however, there is unlawful combination where a manufacturer "enters into agreements—whether express or implied from a course of dealing or other circumstances—with all customers .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. which undertake to bind them to observe fixed resale prices."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Schrader's'', 252 U.S. at 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''Cudahy''====
The next decision was ''Frey &amp; Son. Inc. v. Cudahy Packing Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;256 U.S. 208 (1921).&lt;/ref&gt; That was a treble damage suit alleging a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act between the manufacturer and jobbers to maintain resale prices. In that case, the Court held improper a jury instruction that a Sherman Act violation (price-fixing agreement) could be found if the defendant repeatedly called to the attention of the wholesales and jobbers the minimum price provision of its sales plan and "the great majority of them not only [expressed] no dissent from such plan, but actually [cooperated] in carrying it out by themselves selling at the prices named." But the authority of ''Cudahy'' "has been seriously undermined by subsequent decisions," The ''Parke Davis'' Court said.

====''Beech-Nut''====
In ''FTC v. Beech-Nut Packing Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;257 U.S. 441 (1922).&lt;/ref&gt; the company adopted a policy of refusing to sell to price cutters. It set up a policing system. " When an offender was cut off, he would be reinstated upon the giving of assurances that he would maintain prices in the future." The Court held that the FTC could find a violation of FTC Act §&amp;nbsp;5 where a practice "had a "dangerous tendency unduly to hinder competition or create monopoly." The company sought to defend under ''Colgate'', but the Court said that "the Beech-Nut system goes for beyond the simple refusal to sell goods to persons who will not sell at stated prices, which, in the ''Colgate'' case, was held to be within the legal right of the producer." It made no difference that there were not express price-fixing contracts because the course of dealing was equivalent to that. ''Beech-Nut''

&lt;blockquote&gt;limit[ed] ''Colgate'' to a holding that, when the only act specified in the indictment amounted to saying that the trader had exercised his right to determine those with whom he would deal, and to announce the circumstances under which he would refuse to sell, no Sherman Act violation was made out. However, because Beech-Nut's methods were as effective as agreements in producing the result that "all who would deal in the company's products are constrained to sell at the suggested prices," the Court held that the securing of the customers' adherence by such methods constituted the creation of an unlawful combination to suppress price competition among the retailers.&lt;ref&gt;''Parke Davis'', 362 U.S. at 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''Bausch &amp; Lomb''====
The next case, ''United States v. Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;321 U.S. 707, 722 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt; made it clear "that ''Beech-Nut'' narrowly limited ''Colgate'' and announced principles which subject to Sherman Act liability the producer who secures his customers' adherence to his resale prices by methods which go beyond the simple refusal to sell to customers who will not resell at stated prices." In ''Bausch &amp; Lomb'', the Court found a violation of the Sherman Act where the distributor proffered a price-fixing plan and the wholesales joined in "by cooperating in prices, limitation of sales to and approval of retail licensees." The scope of the ''Colgate'' doctrine may have been uncertain before ''Beech-Nut'' and ''Bausch &amp; Lomb'' but those decisions "plainly fashioned its dimensions as meaning no more than that a simple refusal to sell to customers who will not resell at prices suggested by the seller is permissible under the Sherman Act." A combination in violation of the Sherman Act is "organized if the producer secures adherence to his suggested prices by means which go beyond his mere declination to sell to a customer who will not observe his announced policy."&lt;ref&gt;''Parke Davis'', 362 U.S. at 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

To sum this up, the Court said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Bausch &amp; Lomb'' and ''Beech-Nut'' decisions cannot be read as merely limited to particular fact complexes justifying the inference of an agreement in violation of the Sherman Act. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The Sherman Act [also] forbids combinations of traders to suppress competition. True, there results the same economic effect as is accomplished by a prohibited combination to suppress price competition if each customer, although induced to do so solely by a manufacturer's announced policy, independently decides to observe specified resale prices. So long as Colgate is not overruled, this result is tolerated, but only when it is the consequence of a mere refusal to sell in the exercise of the manufacturer's right "freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal." When the manufacturer's actions, as here, go beyond mere announcement of his policy and the simple refusal to deal, and he employs other means which effect adherence to his resale prices, this countervailing consideration is not present, and therefore he has put together a combination in violation of the Sherman Act. Thus, whether an unlawful combination or conspiracy is proved is to be judged by what the parties actually did, rather than by the words they used.&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this case, the Court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Parke Davis did not content itself with announcing its policy regarding retail prices and following this with a simple refusal to have business relations with any retailers who disregarded that policy. Instead, Parke Davis used the refusal to deal with the wholesalers in order to elicit their willingness to deny Parke Davis products to retailers, and thereby help gain the retailers' adherence to its suggested minimum retail prices. The retailers who disregarded the price policy were promptly cut off when Parke Davis supplied the wholesalers with their names. The large retailer who said he would "abide" by the price policy, the multi-unit Peoples Drug chain, was not cut off. In thus involving the wholesalers to stop the flow of Parke Davis products to the retailers, thereby inducing retailers' adherence to its suggested retail prices, Parke Davis created a combination with the retailers and the wholesalers to maintain retail prices and violated the Sherman Act.&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, Parke Davis exceeded the "limited dispensation" of ''Colgate'' in still another way. Its treatment of the advertising controversy "demonstrates how far Parke Davis went beyond the limits of the ''Colgate'' doctrine":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Parke Davis did not rest with the simple announcement to the trade of its policy in that regard followed by a refusal to sell to the retailers who would not observe it. First, it discussed the subject with Dart Drug. When Dart indicated willingness to go along, the other retailers were approached, and Dart's apparent willingness to cooperate was used as the lever to gain their acquiescence in the program. Having secured those acquiescences, Parke Davis returned to Dart Drug with the report of the accomplishment. Not until all this was done was the advertising suspended and sales to all the retailers resumed. In this manner, Parke Davis sought assurances of compliance and got them, as well as the compliance itself. It was only by actively bringing about substantial unanimity among the competitors that Parke Davis was able to gain adherence to its policy.&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Instead of inducing the retailers to adhere to the price-maintenance program as a "matter of individual free choice prompted alone" by individual self-interest, Parke Davis offered them its products "packaged in a competition-free wrapping .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. by virtue of concerted action induced by the manufacturer." Parke Davis was "thus the organizer of a price maintenance combination or conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act."&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mootness====
The district court alternatively rested its judgment of dismissal on the holding that Parke Davis had discontinued the scheme. "So far as the record indicates any reason, it is that Parke Davis stopped its efforts because the Department of Justice had instituted an investigation." The Court said that dismissal in such circumstances was an abuse of discretion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The courts have an obligation, once a violation of the antitrust laws has been established, to protect the public from a continuation of the harmful and unlawful activities. A trial court's wide discretion in fashioning remedies is not to be exercised to deny relief altogether by lightly inferring an abandonment of the unlawful activities from a cessation which seems timed to anticipate suit.&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Concurrence===
[[File:US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart - 1976 official portrait.jpg|thumb|150px|Justice Stewart]]
Justice Stewart agreed that the record amply "shows an illegal combination to maintain retail prices." He therefore could "find no occasion to question, even by innuendo, the continuing validity of the ''Colgate'' decision. (The innuendo to which he objects is in such statements as "So long as ''Colgate'' is not overruled, this result is tolerated."&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 44.&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Dissent===
[[File:John Marshall Harlan II official.jpg|thumb|150px|Justice Harlan]]
Justice Harlan protested:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Court's opinion reaches much further than at once may meet the eye, and justifies fuller discussion than otherwise might appear warranted. Scrutiny of the opinion will reveal that the Court has done no less than send to its demise the Colgate doctrine, which has been a basic part of antitrust law concepts since it was first announced in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He found the majority's limited ''Colgate'' doctrine vague and incomprehensible:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Court now says that the seller runs afoul of the Sherman Act when he goes beyond mere announcement of his policy and refusal to sell not because the bare announcement and refusal fall outside the statutory phrase, but because any additional step removes a "countervailing consideration" in favor of permitting a seller to choose his customers. But we are left wholly in the dark as to what the purported new standard is for establishing a "contract, combination .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. or conspiracy [under §&amp;nbsp;1]."&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He denied that Parke Davis went beyond ''Colgate''. Moreover, he sees the majority's treatment of the trial court's findings as disguised oevrruling of ''Colgate''—"I think that what the Court has really done here is to throw the ''Colgate'' doctrine into discard." He concludes: "It is surely the emptiest of formalisms to profess respect for ''Colgate'' and eviscerate it in application.'&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. at 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
In ''Russell Stover Candies v. FTC'',&lt;ref&gt;718 F.2d 256 (8th Cir. 1983), reversing ''In re Russell Stover Candies'', 100 F.T.C. 1 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; the FTC, "in an admitted effort to test the viability of ''Colgate'',"&lt;ref&gt;Glen 0. Robinson, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/valr80&amp;div=25&amp;start_page=577&amp;collection=top30&amp;set_as_cursor=16&amp;men_tab=srchresults ''Explaining Vertical Agreements: The Colgate Puzzle and Antitrust Method''], 80 {{smallcaps|Va. L. Rev.}} 577, 594-95 &amp; n.68 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; took the position that an unlawful combination or agreement could be found when a buyer unwillingly submitted to and complied with a supplier's pricing policy in order to avoid termination. The Eighth Circuit reversed, however, pointing to the statement in ''Parke Davis'' that "a simple refusal to sell to customers who will not resell at prices suggested by the seller is permissible under the Sherman Act" although an unlawful "combination is also organized if the producer secures adherence to his suggested prices by means which go beyond his mere declination to sell to a customer who will not observe his announced policy"; the court added that Parke Davis had been found to have gone far "beyond the limits of the ''Colgate'' doctrine" by enlisting wholesalers and retailers to adhere to and participate in the price-fixing program.&lt;ref&gt;718 F.2d at 258 (quoting 362 U.S. at 43).&lt;/ref&gt; The court said that the FTC has presented a case in which "there are no 'plus factors' to take the case beyond ''Colgate''," so it reversed the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;718 F.2d at 260.&lt;/ref&gt; "Despite the FTC's attempt to gut ''Colgate''," however, "it did not choose to argue that Section 5 [of the FTC Act] does not require agreement."&lt;ref&gt;''Robinson'', at 594 n.68.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the FTC attempted to find a violation by invoking §&amp;nbsp;1 of the Sherman Act, including specifically the requirement of a contract,
combination, or conspiracy,&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. Professor Robinson found this "a little surprising." ''Id''. There is case law that it is unnecessary under §&amp;nbsp;5 to find a conspiracy. See ''FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists'', 476 U.S. 447, 454-55 (1986); '' FTC v. Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co.'', 405 U.S. 233, 239, 244, 246 (1972); ''Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC'', 312 U.S. 457, 463 (1941) (dictum: if the defendant's "purpose and practice .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. runs counter to the public policy declared in the Sherman and Clayton Acts, the Federal Trade Commission has the power to suppress it as an unfair method of competition").&lt;/ref&gt; but it failed to establish that.

In ''Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;485 U.S. 717 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held that mere evidence of complaints by retailer competitors about price cutting did not permit inference of an agreement to fix prices. The Court held that "a vertical restraint is not illegal per se unless it includes some agreement on price or price levels."&lt;ref&gt;485 U.S. at 735-36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court explained that some economic effect must be shown to depart from a rule-of-reason analysis: "[T]here is a presumption in favor of a rule-of-reason standard; [and] departure from that standard must be justified by demonstrable economic effect, such as the facilitation of cartelizing.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;."&lt;ref&gt;485 U.S. at 726.&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the rationale of the holding of a Sherman Act violation in ''Parke Davis'' is that Parke Davis organized a horizontal cartel agreement among its direct customers to fix prices.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Parke Davis'', 362 U.S. at 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Leegin Creative Leather Products v. PSKS, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;551 U.S. 877 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court overruled ''Dr. Miles''. It held "that vertical price restraints are to be judged by the rule of reason." Of this ruling, the dissent (but not the majority of the Court) said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We here overrule one statutory case, ''Dr. Miles'', decided 100 years ago, and we overrule the cases that reaffirmed its ''per se'' rule in the intervening years. See, e.g., ''Trenton Potteries'', 273 U.S., at 399-401; ''Bausch &amp; Lomb'', 321 U.S., at 721; ''United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.'', 362 U.S. 29, 45-47 (1960); ''Simpson v. Union Oil Co. of Cal.'', 377 U.S. 13, 16-17 (1964).&lt;ref&gt;551 U.S. at _.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The particular pages of the ''Parke Davis'' opinion that the ''Leegin'' dissent cites include those in which the ''Parke Davis'' Court had found that Parke Davis had put together a horizontal combination or conspiracy among those to whom it sold its products, as in ''Interstate Circuit, Inc., v. United States''.&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. 208 (1939).&lt;/ref&gt; The majority opinion, however, says nothing about overruling ''Parke Davis''.

Furthermore, the majority opinion observed, in ''[[obiter dictum]]'', that a vertical arrangement may organize a horizontal cartel:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A horizontal cartel among competing manufacturers or competing retailers that decreases output or reduces competition in order to increase price is, and ought to be, per se unlawful. To the extent a vertical agreement setting minimum resale prices is entered upon to facilitate either type of cartel, it, too, would need to be held unlawful under the rule of reason. This type of agreement may also be useful evidence for a plaintiff attempting to prove the existence of a horizontal cartel.&lt;ref&gt;''Leegin'', 551 U.S. at 893.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[United States v. Apple Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;791 F.3d 290 (2d Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; involved a fact pattern very similar to ''Parke Davis'', but in reverse. A retailer of e-books put together or "facilitated" a combination among its suppliers (publishers) to fix and raise prices. The Second Circuit held that "the district court did not err in determining that Apple orchestrated an agreement with and among the Publisher Defendants, in characterizing this agreement as a horizontal price fixing-conspiracy, or in holding that the conspiracy unreasonably restrained trade in violation of §&amp;nbsp;1 of the Sherman Act.&lt;ref&gt;791 F.3d at 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing to "express collusion among" the publishers, the Court said that "Apple consciously played a key role in organizing that collusion."&lt;ref&gt;791 F.3d at 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Apple argued that under ''Leegin'' its conduct was vertical and had to be judged under a rule-of-reason analysis. The Second Circuit rejected that argument, saying that it was settled law that a mixed vertical and horizontal conspiracy, where distributors and manufacturers act together to fix prices or engage in other conduct illegal ''per se'', as in this case "in which a vertical player organizes a horizontal cartel," are to be judged under the rules applicable to horizontal cartels: "In that situation, the court need not consider whether the vertical agreements restrained trade because all participants agreed to the horizontal restraint, which is and ought to be, ''per se'' unlawful."&lt;ref&gt;791 F.3d at 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==
Professor Robinson argues that "some surpassingly foolish Supreme Court decisions" have misinterpreted ''Parke Davis'' as  making "coercion an effective substitute for agreement."&lt;ref&gt;''Robinson'', at 600.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in ''Parke Davis'', "the Court did not use the term 'coercion' to characterize the manufacturer's enforcement practices (describing them instead as creating a 'combination')," a few years later "the Court in ''Simpson v. Union Oil Co.'' interpreted ''Parke, Davis'' as holding that "a supplier may not use coercion on its retail outlets to achieve resale price maintenance."&lt;ref&gt;''Robinson'', at 500 n.90 (citing ''Simpson'', 377 U.S. 13, 17 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Hovenkamp contends that ''Parke Davis'' partially survives the ''Leegin'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Hovenkamp, [https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/legacy/grc/Hovenkamp.pdf ''Leegin, the Rule of Reason, and Vertical Agreement''] 12 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that ''Parke Davis'' does not find a price-fixing agreement on the basis of "announced conditions, terminations, or the use of third parties to gather information or to effect a termination." Rather, the ''Parke Davis'' Court finds an illegal combination or conspiracy on the basis of "control of third party resales and, more arguably, individualized negotiations with dealers falling short of traditional agreement, and perhaps even exhortation meetings." Although the ''Parke Davis'' case also involved "wholesalers reporting noncomplying dealers to the manufacturer as forming an 'information conspiracy' with the latter," he regards that as no longer surviving as a tenable theory under present law,&lt;ref&gt;''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Water Resources Development Act of 1986''' ('''WRDA 1986''') is part of {{USPL|99|662}}, a series of acts enacted by [[Congress of the United States]] on November 17, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/6| Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-662) on Congress.gov (Library of Congress)]&lt;/ref&gt;   

WRDA 1986 established cost sharing formulas for the construction of harbors, inland waterway transportation, and flood control projects and established rules therefor.  It also created hundreds of projects, studies, and plans in almost every state in the nation.  It also deauthorized a number of projects.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nww.usace.army.mil/dpn/publaw.htm#99-662-topics Public Laws - USACE Walla Walla District website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==WRDA 1986==
WRDA 1986 directed the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] to issue guidelines for crediting against the non-Federal share of project cost for flood control any compatible work carried out by local interests.  It authorized appropriations for the prosecution of the comprehensive plan of development for specified river basins and projects. 

It also prohibited the Government from initiating any feasibility study for a water resources project until non-Federal interests agree to contribute 50 percent of the costs during the period of the study but exempted from such prohibition any study designed for purposes of navigational improvements. It also prohibited the Government from initiating any planning or engineering authorized by this Act until non-Federal interests agree to contribute 50 percent of the costs during the period of planning and engineering. Finally, WRDA 1986 provided for determining the interest rate when a non-Federal interest elects to repay an amount under this Act over a period of time.

Ultimately, WRDA 1986 authorized 262 water projects at a total cost of $16 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-29/entire.pdf The Evolution of the Flood Control Act of 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whale conservation''' is the international [[Environmental protection|environmental]] and [[Conservation (ethic)|ethical debate]] over [[whaling|whale hunting]]. The [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[anti-whaling]] debate has focused on issues of [[Sustainability and environmental management|sustainability]] as well as ownership and national [[sovereignty]]. Also raised in conservation efforts is the question of [[cetacean intelligence]], the level of [[Animal welfare|suffering]] which the animals undergo when caught and killed, and the importance that the [[Marine mammal|mammals]] play in the [[ecosystem]] and a [[Whale#Ecology|healthy marine environment]].

The [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling, the value of lethal sampling of whales for scientific research in order to establish catch quotas has also been debated. The value of whaling to fisheries as a method of controlling whales' perceived negative impact on fish stocks is another point of debate.

==Conservation status==

[[File:Blue Whale population, Pengo.svg|thumb|[[Blue whale]] populations have declined dramatically due to unregulated commercial whaling, putting them at risk of extinction.]]
Prior to the setting up of the [[International Whaling Commission|IWC]] in 1946, unregulated whaling had depleted a number of whale populations to a significant extent, and several whales species were severely endangered. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) notes that the Atlantic population of [[gray whale]]s was made extinct around the turn of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="IUCNredGray" /&gt; Examination of remains found in England and Sweden found evidence of a separate Atlantic population of gray whales existing up until 1675.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Rice DW |title=Marine Mammals of the World.

Whaling and other threats have led to at least five of the 13 great whales being listed as [[Endangered species#Endangered mammals|endangered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/search.php?freetext=whale&amp;modifier=phrase&amp;criteria=common&amp;taxa_species=1&amp;Submit.x=102&amp;Submit.y=13&amp;redlistCategory%5B%5D=EN&amp;redlistAssessyear%5B%5D=all&amp;country%5B%5D=all&amp;aquatic%5B%5D=all&amp;regions%5B%5D=all&amp;habitats%5B%5D=all&amp;threats%5B%5D=all | title = Cetaceans listed as Endangered | publisher = [[IUCN]] Red List of Threatened Species | accessdate = 2007-03-19}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A past ban which was implemented around the 1960s has helped some of these species of whale to recover. According to IUCN's Cetacean Specialist Group (CSG), "Several populations of southern right whales, [[Humpback whale|humpback]]s in many areas, grey whales in the eastern North Pacific, and blue whales in both the eastern North Pacific and central North Atlantic have begun to show signs of recovery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3024785.stm | publisher = BBC News | title = Extinction nears for whales and dolphins | date = 2003-05-14 | accessdate = 2006-12-04 | first=Alex | last=Kirby}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Populations of many other whales species are also increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/01/conservation.endangeredspecies | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Blue whale numbers rising | first=James | last=Sturcke | date=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/21/1090089207863.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Humpback whale numbers rise | date=2004-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sciblogs.co.nz/science-life/2009/10/14/southern-right-whale-population-on-the-rebound/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1068&amp;context=usdeptcommercepub&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.50.5027|title=Estimating Bowhead Whale, Balaena mysticetus, Population Size and Rate of Increase from the 1993 Census|first1=Adrian E.|last1=Raftery|first2=Judith E.|last2=Zeh|date=30 May 1996|publisher=|journal=BAYESIAN STATISTICS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: CASE STUDIES|pages=163––240|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other whale species, however (in particular the [[minke whale]]) have never been considered endangered.

Despite this, opponents of whaling argue that a return to full-scale commercial whaling will lead to economic concerns overriding those of conservation, and there is a continuing debate as to how to describe the current state of each species.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} For instance, conservationists are pleased that the [[sei whale]] continues to be listed as endangered, but Japan says that the species has swelled in number from 9,000 in 1978 to about 28,000 in 2002, so its catch of 50 sei whales per year is safe and the classification of endangered should be reconsidered for the North Pacific population.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Some North Atlantic states have recently argued that [[fin whale]]s should not be listed as endangered anymore and criticize the list for being inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hafro.is/undir.php?ID=19&amp;nanar=1REF=3&amp;fID=3839 | title = Um stofnstærðir langreyðar og hrefnu við Ísland og flokkun IUCN | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IUCN]] has recorded studies showing that more than 40,000 individuals are present in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland, Iceland, and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/2478/0 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | title = Red List of Threatened Species - Balaenoptera physalus | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no information about fin whales in areas outside of the Northern Atlantic, where they still hold the status of being endangered.

A complete list of whale conservation statuses as listed by the IUCN is given below. Note that, in the case of the blue and gray whales, the IUCN distinguishes the statuses of various populations. These populations, while not regarded as separate species, are considered sufficiently important in terms of conservation.

==Whaling==
[[File:Hvalskyting.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Whaling harpoon being used to kill a whale]][[File:Whaling harpoon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Whaling [[harpoon]]]]{{Main|Whaling}}
Whaling is a method of hunting whales for their [[Whale meat|meat]], [[Whale oil|oil]] and [[blubber]]. The hunting of whales on an industrial scale began in the 17th century and into the 20th century, and as a result of the quantities caught the whale is an [[endangered species]]. The [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) banned commercial whaling in 1986 to increase the remaining whale population in the seas.

An alternative method of whaling would be by farming whales in captivity has never been attempted and would almost certainly be logistically impossible {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Instead, whales are killed at sea often using [[explosive harpoon]]s,&lt;ref name="Bomb lance patents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/search-bool.html&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;TERM1=102/371&amp;FIELD1=ORCL&amp;d=pall|title=Patent Database Search Results: CCL/102/371 in US Patent Collection|website=patft.uspto.gov|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which puncture the skin of a whale and then explode inside its body. [[Anti-whaling]] groups say this method of hunting is cruel, particularly if carried out by inexperienced gunners, because a whale can take several minutes or even hours to die.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Gales, Russell Leaper, Vassili Papastavrou, "Is Japan's whaling humane?" Marine Policy Volume 32, Issue 3, May 2008, Pages 408-412&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2003, Whalewatch, an umbrella group of 140 conservation and animal welfare groups from 55 countries, led by the [[World Society for the Protection of Animals]] (Now known as [[World Animal Protection]]), published a report, ''Troubled Waters'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wspa-international.org/Images/080304_173035_TroubledWatersWhaleReport_tcm25-2729.pdf#false|title=Brakes, P., Butterworth, A., Simmonds, M. and Lymbery, P (eds.) (2004) Troubled Waters: A review of the welfare implications of modern whaling activities. Foreword by Attenborough, D. WSPA: London|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose main conclusion was that whales cannot be guaranteed to be harvested humanely and that all whaling should be stopped. The report quoted official figures that said 20% of Norwegian and 60% of Japanese-captured whales failed to die as soon as they had been harpooned. WSPA further released a report in 2008 entitled ''Whaling: Defying international commitments to animal welfare?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wspa-international.org/Images/WSPA_DefyingInternational_tcm25-3478.pdf#false|title=Bass, C.L. and Brakes, P. (2008) Whaling: Defying international commitments to animal welfare? London:WSPA|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the culling of whales is compared–unfavorably–with slaughter guidelines for farm animals from the [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] (OIE).

John Opdahl of the Norwegian embassy in [[London]] responded by saying that Norwegian authorities worked with the IWC to develop the most humane methods.&lt;ref name="Bomb lance patents" /&gt; He said that the average time taken for a whale to spunk up after being shot in the blowhole, was the same as or less than that of animals killed by [[Big Five game|big game]] hunters on [[safari]]. Pro-whalers also say that the free-roaming lifestyle of whales followed by a quick death is less cruel than the long-term suffering of factory-farmed animals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In response to the UK's opposition to the resumption of commercial whaling on the grounds that no humane method of catching whales exists, or "is on the horizon", the pro-whaling [[High North Alliance]] points to apparent inconsistencies in the policies of some anti-whaling nations by drawing comparisons between commercial whaling and recreational hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highnorth.no/Library/Ethics/th-uk-po.htm |title=Humane Killing Standards |work=Correspondence between High North Alliance and UK Commissioner to the International Whaling Commission, C.I. Llewellyn |publisher=High North Alliance |year=1995 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the United Kingdom allows the commercial shooting of deer without these shoots adhering to the standards of British [[slaughterhouse]]s, but says that whalers must meet such standards as a pre-condition before they would support whaling. Moreover, [[fox hunting]], in which foxes are mauled by dogs, is legal in many anti-whaling countries including [[Ireland]], the [[United States]], [[Portugal]], [[Italy]] and [[France]] (although not in the [[United Kingdom]]) according to UK Government's Burns Inquiry (2000). Pro-whaling nations argue that they should not be expected to adhere to animal-welfare standards which anti-whaling countries do not themselves follow consistently, and draw the conclusion that the cruelty argument is a mere expression of cultural bigotry, similar to the [[Western world|Western]] attitude towards the eating of [[dog meat]] in several [[East Asia]]n countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.highnorth.no/Library/Ethics/be-uk-wh.htm | publisher = [[High North Alliance]] | title = Behind UK Whale Position Lurks Unregulated Commercial Deer Hunt | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation groups ==
{{Main|Anti-whaling}}
The whaling industry was initially supported by governments of whaling nations, then gradually regulated from 1946 with the [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]], and in 1949 with the creation of the [[International Whaling Commission]], to conserve whale stocks.

The concerns of [[over-exploitation]], a threat of [[extinction]] and popular culture widely viewing whales as interesting and intelligent, led to a campaign called "[[Anti-whaling#Save the Whales|Save the Whales]]" which began to highlight the plight of whales on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men and Whales|last=Ellis|first=Richard|publisher=The Lyons Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-55821-696-9|location=|pages=434–439|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organized and dedicated protection and conservation of whales was started in 1971 by the [[American Cetacean Society]], [[Ocean Alliance]] (formerly the Whale Conservation Institute), the Whale Center, and the Connecticut Cetacean Society, since then the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[The Humane Society of the United States|Humane Society of the United States]], [[Sierra Club]] and [[National Audubon Society]] all joined the campaign.
[[File:MV Steve Irwin Melbourne.jpg|thumb|[[MY Steve Irwin|MY ''Steve Irwin'']] a [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|Sea Shepherd]] anti-poaching vessel]]
There are many other organizations and governments that have long been actively supporting conservation efforts. In 1975 [[Greenpeace]] started its anti-whaling campaign and the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] was created in 1977 by [[Paul Watson]], a previous Greenpeace campaigner, to try a different approach using [[direct action]] tactics and unconventional methods on the open sea. [[Neptune's Navy]], the name Sea Shepherd refers to their ships, aim to intervene and prevent whaling activities and other forms of [[poaching]] to protect [[marine life]].

With the pressure from member nations the [[International Whaling Commission|IWC]] in 1982 adopted a [[International Whaling Commission#1986 moratorium|moratorium]] on commercial whaling, and by 1994 the IWC had created the [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]] in [[Antarctica]] to protect whales and their breeding grounds.

The [[Reality television|documentary-reality television]] series ''[[Whale Wars]]'' in 2008 featuring Sea Shepherd, brought the environmental hardships of the [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]] and their confrontation with the [[Whaling in Japan|Japanese whaling]] fleets to a broader audience. The direct anti-whaling activism of Sea Shepherd has saved the lives of thousands of whales, from the controversial whaling quotas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/20/japan-to-face-criticism-at-international-summit-for-flouting-whaling-ban-iwc|title=Japan to face criticism at international summit for flouting whaling ruling|last=|first=|date=20 October 2016|website=|publisher=The Guardian|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whales.org.au/news/a-seashep07.html|title=Sea Shepherd Launches Operation Migaloo|last=|first=|date=2007|website=Whales On The Net|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd have both brought significant attention to the controversy and scrutiny of commercial whaling.

==The economic argument==
The [[whale watching]] industry and [[anti-whaling]] advocates argue that whaling catches "friendly" whales that are curious about boats, as these whales are the easiest to catch. This analysis claims that once the economic benefits of hotels, restaurants and other tourist amenities are considered, hunting whales is a net economic loss. This argument is particularly contentious in [[Iceland]], as it has among the most-developed whale-watching operations in the world and the hunting of [[minke whale]]s resumed in August 2003. [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]] argue that whale watching is a growing billion-dollar industry&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/resource-centre/whale-watching-worldwide Whale Watching Worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt; that provides more revenue and more equitable distribution of profits than commercial whaling by pelagic fleets from far-away developed countries would provide. [[Peru]], [[Uruguay]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] also support proposals to permanently forbid whaling South of the Equator, as [[Indonesia]] is the only country in the Southern Hemisphere with a whaling industry. Anti-whaling groups claim that developing countries which support a pro-whaling stance are damaging their economies by driving away anti-whaling tourists.

Pro-whaling advocates argue that the economic analysis assumes unsustainable whaling by arguing that whaling deprives the whale-watching industry of whales, and counter that if whales are hunted on a sustainable basis, there is no competition between the two industries. Furthermore, they point out that most whaling takes place outside of coastal areas where whale watching takes place, and communication between any whaling fleet and whale-watching boats would ensure that whaling and whale watching occurred in different areas. Pro-whaling advocates also argue that whaling continues to provide employment in the fishery, logistic and restaurant industries and that whale blubber can be converted into valuable [[oleochemical]]s while whale carcasses can be [[rendering (food processing)|rendered]] into [[meat and bone meal]]. Poorer whaling nations argue that the need for resumption of whaling is pressing. Horace Walters, from the Eastern Caribbean Cetacean Commission stated, "We have islands which may want to start whaling again - it's expensive to import food from the developed world, and we believe there's a deliberate attempt to keep us away from our resources so we continue to develop those countries' economies by importing from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/sci_nat_spectrum_of_opinion_at_whaling_meeting/html/5.stm | publisher = BBC News | title = Spectrum of opinion at whaling meeting - A question of food | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence==
{{Main|Cetacean intelligence|Animal cognition}}
A variety of whale species possess large physical [[brain]]s and are known to have high levels of intelligence compared to other animals. [[Fin whales]], [[Humpback whales]] and [[Sperm whales]] for example have been found to have [[spindle neuron]]s, a type of brain cell known to exist only in certain other species of high intelligence: [[humans]], other [[great apes]], [[bottlenose dolphins]] and [[elephants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/2006/1798885.htm?ancient| publisher = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News, Australia]] | title = Whale Brains are Part Human | accessdate = 2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an argument that whales should not be killed because of their high intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.whales.org/wdc-in-action/are-whales-and-dolphins-great-apes-of-oceans |title=Are Whales And Dolphins The Great Apes Of The Oceans? |author=Philippa Brakes |publisher=WDCS International |date=December 2009 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-whalers claim that pigs also possess high intelligence, and are routinely butchered and eaten, and that intelligence should not be the determining factor of whether an animal is acceptable to eat or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/sep/09/foodanddrink.features4|title=Stop blubbering|first=Anthony|last=Browne|date=9 September 2001|website=the Guardian|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fishing==

[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands.jpg|200px|thumb|August 26, 2006 [[Hvalba]], [[Faroe Islands]]]]
Whalers say that whaling is an essential condition for the successful operation of commercial fisheries, and thus the plentiful availability of food from the sea that consumers have become accustomed to. This argument is made particularly forcefully in Atlantic fisheries, for example, the [[North-East Atlantic Cod|cod]]-[[capelin]] system in the [[Barents Sea]]. A [[minke whale]]'s annual diet consists of 10 kilograms of fish per kilogram of body mass,&lt;ref&gt;Sigurjonsson and Vikingsson, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; which puts a heavy predatory pressure on commercial species of fish, thus whalers say that an annual cull of whales is needed in order for adequate amounts of fish to be available for humans. Anti-whaling campaigners say that the pro-whaling argument is inconsistent: if the catch of whales is small enough not to negatively affect whale stocks, it is also too small to positively affect fish stocks. To make more fish available, they say, more whales will have to be killed, putting populations at risk. Additionally, whale feeding grounds and commercial fisheries do not always overlap.

Professor [[Daniel Pauly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fisheries.ubc.ca/members/dpauly/ | title = Dr. Daniel Pauly | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of the Fisheries Center at the [[University of British Columbia]] weighed into the debate in July 2004 when he presented a paper to the 2004 meeting of the IWC in Sorrento. Pauly's primary research is the decline of fish stocks in the Atlantic, under the auspices of the [[Sea Around Us Project]]. This report was commissioned by Humane Society International, an active anti-whaling lobby, and stated that although cetaceans and [[pinnipeds]] are estimated to eat 600 million tonnes of food per year, compared with just 150 million tonnes eaten by humans (although researchers at the Japanese Institute for Cetacean Research give figures of 90 million tonnes for humans and 249-436 million tonnes for cetaceans), much of the food eaten by cetaceans (in particular, deep sea squid and [[krill]]) is not consumed by humans. However, Japanese do eat krill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/news?q=Krill+japan&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn|title=Google News|website=Google News|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and krill is also used in large quantities by fish farms as feed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j16BZVAVoE3Tey_0icx_2Bj6V_XQ AFP: Hunted, rammed, poisoned, whales may die from heartbreak too] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080826025410/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j16BZVAVoE3Tey_0icx_2Bj6V_XQ |date=2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauly's report also claims that the locations where whales and humans catch fish only overlap to a small degree, and he also considers more indirect effects of whales' diet on the availability of fish for fisheries. He concludes that whales are not a significant reason for diminished fish stocks.

More recent studies have also concluded that there are several factors contributing to the decline in fish stocks, such as pollution and habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6108414.stm | publisher = BBC News | title = 'Only 50 Years Left' for Sea Fish | accessdate = 2006-02-11 | first=Richard | last=Black}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the dietary behaviour of whales differs among species as well as season, location and availability of prey. For example, sperm whales' prey primarily consists of mesopelagic squid. However, in Iceland, they are reported to consume mainly fish.&lt;ref&gt;Sigurjónsson, et al. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to [[krill]], minke whales are known to eat a wide range of fish species including [[capelin]], [[herring]], [[sand lance]], [[mackerel]], gadoids, cod, [[saithe]] and [[haddock]].&lt;ref&gt;Haug et al., 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Minke whales are estimated to consume 633,000 tons of Atlantic herring per year in part of Northeast Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Folkow et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In the Barents Sea, it is estimated that a [potential] net economic loss of five tons of cod and herring per fishery results from every additional minke whale in the population due the fish consumption of the single whale.&lt;ref&gt;Schweder, et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value for research==

{{See also|Whaling in Japan}}
Since the 1986 IWC ban on whaling, Japan has conducted its whaling by issuing scientific research permits. The value of "lethal sampling" of whales is a highly contentious issue. The stated aim of the Japanese JARPA research program is to establish sustainable whaling in the Antarctic Ocean.&lt;ref name=catalyst&gt;''[[Catalyst (TV program)|Catalyst]]'': [http://abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s1657789.htm Whale Science], 8 June 2006. [[ABC Television|ABC]]. Reporter/Producer: Dr Jonica Newby. (Transcript and full program available online)&lt;/ref&gt; The selling of whale meat from the lethal sampling to fish markets is purported to help fund the research, a claim disputed by opponents as being a cover for illegal whaling. The IWC requires information on population structure, abundance and prior whaling history, which anti-whalers argue can be obtained through non-lethal means.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Lethal sampling is required to obtain age information and precise dietary composition. The age of a whale can be reliably gathered by examining the ear plug in the head of the dead animal, which accumulates as annual growth rings. Japan initially argued that simple population distribution of whale species is enough to determine the level of sustainability of the hunt and argued that certain species of whale, particularly minke whales, are in sufficient number to be hunted. The anti-whaling side countered by arguing that more accurate composition of population distribution in term of age and sex distribution is needed to determine the sustainability, which ironically provided the justification for the Japanese hunt under the scientific research exemption. According to lethal-sampling opponent Nick Gales, age data is not needed to establish a catch limit for whaling within the framework of the Revised Management Procedure (RMP) computer modeling, which is the stated goal of the Japanese research.&lt;ref name=catalyst/&gt; However, deputy whaling commissioner of Japan, Joji Morishita, told [[BBC News]] that the reason for the moratorium on commercial whaling was scientific uncertainty about the number of whales, and they were asked to collect more data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7153594.stm | work=BBC News | title=Whaling: The Japanese position | date=2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dietary information is obtained with lethal sampling by cutting open the stomach of the animal. Opponents of lethal sampling state that dietary habits can be ascertained by biopsies as well as collecting feces from living whales. Proponents counter by stating that biopsies only reveal the type of food consumed (such as fish or krill) and not the exact type of fish, and that feces analysis does not provide as good of a  quantitative estimation of dietary consumption.

Although lethal sampling is a heavily debated issue, the IWC Scientific Committee acknowledges the usefulness of the data from JARPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwcoffice.org/conservation/jarpa.htm |title=Extract from the full Report of the JARPA review workshop 2007 |work=JARPA REVIEW |publisher=International Whaling Commission |date=16 March 2007 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2008 review of Japan's first 18 years of its scientific whaling program, the IWC stated that the panel was "very pleased" with the data that Japan collected, though there was some advice on how these data could be further or better analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6667907.stm|title=Under the skin of whaling science|publisher=BBC | date=2007-05-25|first=Richard|last=Black}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd raised the idea of a proposal to take the Japanese whaling issue to the [[International Court of Justice|International Court of Justice (ICJ)]], with an aim of stopping Japan from conducting scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8523328.stm|title=Australia tells Japan: Stop whaling or face court|publisher=BBC | date=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2010, the Australian Government lodged formal proceedings against Japan in the ICJ in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=ICJ-Complaint&gt;{{cite web|title=Application Instituting Proceedings|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/15951.pdf|work=Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v Japan)|publisher=International Court of Justice|accessdate=29 March 2012|author=Commonwealth of Australia|location=[[The Hague]]|format=PDF|date=May 31, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309024146/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/15951.pdf|archivedate=9 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a joint ministerial statement, the government stated that it "has not taken this decision lightly." The New Zealand government then lodged a "Declaration of Intervention" with the ICJ on February 6, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Intervention of New Zealand|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/17268.pdf|work=International Court of Justice|publisher=International Court of Justice|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=6 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611234615/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/17268.pdf|archivedate=11 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it deemed Japan as ineligible for a Special Permit that would allow whaling on the basis of scientific research.

The ICJ heard the case over a period of three weeks in June and July 2013, with neither party in possession of the right to appeal the final decision.&lt;ref name="Julia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia takes Japan to court on whaling – where to now?|url=http://theconversation.com/australia-takes-japan-to-court-on-whaling-where-to-now-13481|work=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=18 April 2013|author=Tony Press|author2=Julia Jabour |date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 2014 the ICJ made the determination that Japanese whaling in the Antarctic is not for scientific purposes.&lt;ref name="apnews.myway.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20140331/DACSJTRG1.html|title=MyWay|website=apnews.myway.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal rights==
{{main|Animal rights}}
The fundamental principle of the animal rights movement is that animals have basic interests that deserve recognition, consideration, and protection. In the view of animal rights advocates, these basic interests give the animals that have them both moral and legal rights. Thus, humans have a moral obligation to minimize or avoid causing animal suffering, just as they have an obligation to minimize or avoid causing the suffering of other humans, and should not use animals as food, clothing, research subjects, or entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/25760/animal-rights | title=Animal Rights | author = Steven M.

===2014 New York gubernatorial campaign===

Teachout faced off against incumbent [[Andrew Cuomo]] and comedian [[Randy Credico]] in the Democratic primary election on September 9, 2014. Teachout first ran for the [[Working Families Party]] nomination, but lost to Cuomo. His margin of victory was much smaller than expected, especially since the Working Families Party traditionally cross-endorses the Democratic Party candidate.&lt;ref name="capitalnewyork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2014/05/8546302/zephyr-teachout-splits-wfp-and-maybe-cuomos-base|title=Zephyr Teachout splits the W.F.P., and maybe Cuomo&amp;#039;s base|publisher=capitalnewyork.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachout then announced that she would run for the Democratic nomination.&lt;ref name="buzzfeed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jacobfischler/zephyr-teachout-challenges-andrew-cuomo|title=Exclusive: Progressive Ticket Will Challenge Andrew Cuomo And His Running Mate In New York Primary|author=Jacob Fischler|publisher=buzzfeed.com|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her running mate was [[Tim Wu]], a [[Columbia University Law School]] professor who coined the phrase "[[net neutrality]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Tim, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120206105257/http://www.freepress.net/files/timwu.pdf "Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination"], freepress.net, April 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Columbia Law School"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2008/april2008/Wu_FreePress|title=Tim Wu Elected Board Chair At Free Press|date=April 14, 2008|publisher=Columbia Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2010/12/fcc_passes_new.html|title=FCC passes New Neutrality Rule|date=December 21, 2010|publisher=Boston Globe|first=Hiawatha|last=Bray}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their platform called for a rollback of Cuomo's tax cuts for the wealthy, investment in transportation and broadband infrastructure, a statewide fracking ban, an end to high-stakes testing and fair funding for schools in both under-resourced and affluent school districts, restoring voting rights to convicted felons, and support for the NY DREAM Act and anti-corruption measures, including public financing of elections to reduce the power of corporate donors and affluent political insiders.&lt;ref name=nation/&gt;

Their campaign raised $800,000, a small amount for New York state politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.firedoglake.com/2014/09/10/cuomo-spent-nearly-40-times-more-than-teachout-to-win-primary|title=Cuomo Spent Nearly 40 Times More Than Teachout To Win Primary|publisher=News.firedoglake.com|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days before the primary, polls showed their likely voter share at 26%, in line with the predictions of political professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/steve-kornacki/zephyr-teachout-likely-wont-exceed-expectations-polls|title=Pro-Teachout poll puts Cuomo challenger at 26%|work=MSNBC|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachout and Wu lost to Cuomo and his running mate, former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Kathy Hochul]], in the primary on September 9, 2014, but did capture over 34% and 40% of the vote, respectively, with an especially strong showing in [[upstate New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/zephyr-teachout-primary-loss-air-victory-party-article-1.1934371|title=Zephyr Teachout's primary loss has air of a victory party|work=NY Daily News|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
