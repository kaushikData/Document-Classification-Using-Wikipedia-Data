The '''1971 Iraq poison grain disaster''' was a mass [[methylmercury]] poisoning incident that began in late 1971. Grain treated with a methylmercury [[fungicide]] and never intended for human consumption was imported into [[Iraq]] as seed grain from [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]]. Due to a number of factors, including foreign-language labelling and late distribution within the growing cycle, this toxic grain was consumed as food by Iraqi residents in rural areas. People suffered from [[paresthesia]] (numbness of skin), [[ataxia]] (lack of coordination of muscle movements) and vision loss, symptoms similar to those seen when [[Minamata disease]] affected [[Japan]]. The recorded death toll was 459 people, but figures at least ten times greater have been suggested.  The 1971 poisoning was the largest mercury poisoning disaster when it occurred,&lt;ref name="bakir" /&gt; with cases peaking in January and February 1972 and stopping by the end of March.

Reports after the disaster recommended tighter regulation, better labelling and handling of mercury-treated grain, and wider involvement of the [[World Health Organization]] in monitoring and preventing poisoning incidents.  Investigation confirmed the particular danger posed to fetuses and young children.

== Context ==

The properties of [[Mercury (metal)|mercury]] make it an effective [[fungicide]]. Methylmercury had been banned in Sweden in 1966,&lt;ref name="matolcsy" /&gt; the first country to do so, and the [[United Kingdom]] followed in 1971.&lt;ref name="UKHSE" /&gt; Previous mercury-poisoning incidents had occurred in Iraq in 1956 and 1960. In 1956, there had been around 200 cases, and 70 deaths; in 1960 there had been 1000 cases and 200 deaths, in both cases due to [[ethylmercury]] compounds.&lt;ref name="damluji" /&gt; Among the recommendations made after the 1960 incident had been to colour any toxic grain for easy identification.&lt;ref name="damluji" /&gt; Before the 1971 incident, around 200–300 cases of methylmercury poisoning had been reported worldwide.&lt;ref name="bakir" /&gt;  Drought had reduced harvests in 1969, affecting 500,000 people,&lt;ref name="drought" /&gt; and in 1970. [[Saddam Hussein]], as the government's no. 2 behind [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], decided to import mercury-coated seed grain for the late 1971 planting season. Hussein himself may have worked in the Department of Agriculture in the aftermath of the 1960 incident.&lt;ref name="diagnosis" /&gt;

== Causes ==
[[File:Map of Iraq, 1976.jpg|thumb|right|A map of Iraq (1976) showing the provinces referred to.]]

Some {{convert|95000|t}} of grain (73,201 tonnes of [[wheat]] grain and 22,262 tonnes of [[barley]]), coloured a pink-orange hue, were shipped to Iraq from the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]. The wheat arrived in [[Basra]] on SS ''Trade Carrier'' between 16 September and 15 October, barley between 22 October and 24 November 1971. Iraq's government chose Mexipak, a high-yield wheat seed developed in Mexico by [[Norman Borlaug]]. The seeds contained an average of 7.9 μg/g of mercury, with some samples containing up to nearly twice that. The decision to use mercury-coated grain has been reported as made by the Iraqi government, rather than the supplier, [[Cargill]].&lt;ref name="diagnosis" /&gt; The three Northern governorates of [[Ninawa Governorate|Ninawa]], [[Kirkuk Governorate|Kirkuk]] and [[Erbil Governorate|Erbil]] together received more than half the shipments. Contributing factors to the epidemic included the fact that distribution started late, and much grain arrived after the October–November planting season.

Farmers holding grain ingested it instead, since their own planting had been completed. Distribution was hurried and open, with grain being distributed free of charge or with payment in kind. Some farmers sold their own grain lest this new grain devalue what they had. This left them dependent on tainted grain for the winter. Many Iraqis were either unaware of the significant health risk posed, or chose to ignore the warnings.&lt;ref name="autism" /&gt;  Initially, farmers were to certify with a thumbprint or signature that they understood the grain was poison, but according to some sources, distributors did not ask for such an indication.&lt;ref name="diagnosis" /&gt; Warnings on the sacks were in Spanish and English, not at all understood, or included the black-and-white [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones design]], which meant nothing to Iraqis.&lt;ref name="diagnosis" /&gt; The long latent period may have granted farmers a false sense of security, when animals fed the grain appeared to be fine. The red dye washed off the grain; the mercury did not. Hence, washing may have given only the appearance of removing the poison.&lt;ref name="bakir" /&gt;

Mercury was ingested through the consumption of homemade bread, meat and other animal products obtained from livestock given treated barley, vegetation grown from soil contaminated with mercury, game birds that had fed on the grain and fish caught in rivers, canals, and lakes into which treated grain had been dumped by the farmers. Ground seed dust inhalation was a contributing factor in farmers during sowing and grinding. Consumption of ground flour through homemade bread is thought to have been the major cause,&lt;ref name="skerfving" /&gt; since no cases were reported in urban areas, where government flour supplies were commercially regulated.&lt;ref name="bakir" /&gt;

== Symptoms, outbreak and treatment ==
The effect of mercury took some time – the latent period between ingestion and the first symptoms (typically [[paresthesia]] – numbness in the extremities) was between 16 and 38 days. Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included [[ataxia]] (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from [[central nervous system]] failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40&amp;nbsp;mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of body weight&lt;ref name="skerfving" /&gt;). On average, individuals affected consumed 20&amp;nbsp;kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 million cases.&lt;ref name="bakir" /&gt;

The hospital in [[Kirkuk]] received large numbers of patients with symptoms that doctors recognised from the 1960 outbreak. The first case of alkylmercury poisoning was admitted to hospital on 21 December.&lt;ref name="skerfving"/&gt; By 26 December, the hospital had issued a specific warning to the government. By January 1972, the government had started to strongly warn the populace about eating the grain, although dispatches did not mention the large numbers already ill. The [[Iraqi Army]] soon ordered disposal of the grain and eventually declared the death penalty for anyone found selling it.&lt;ref name="diagnosis151"/&gt; Farmers dumped their supplies wherever possible, and it soon got into the water supply (particularly the [[River Tigris]]), causing further problems. The government issued a news blackout and released little information about the outbreak.&lt;ref name="bakir" /&gt;&lt;ref name="diagnosis" /&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] assisted the Iraqi government through the supply of drugs, analytical equipment and expertise. Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for [[heavy metal poisoning]] were not particularly effective. [[Dimercaprol]] was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out as a treatment for this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, [[penicillamine]] and dimercaprol sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. [[Dialysis]] was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement.&lt;ref name="skerfving" /&gt; The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity.&lt;ref name="bakir" /&gt;

== Effects ==
[[File:Methyl mercury cases, Iraq 1971.png|thumb|right|260px|Incidence of cases and fatalities, by age group&lt;ref name="bakir" /&gt;]]

6,530 patients were admitted to hospitals with poisoning, and 459 deaths reported.&lt;ref name="bakir" /&gt; Cases reached a peak of hundreds per day in January, and had largely subsided by the beginning of March. The last admittance was on 27 March; admissions represented every age and gender stratum, although those under the age of ten represented a third of admitted cases. This number is "certainly an underestimate",&lt;ref name="skerfving" /&gt; because of the availability of hospital treatment, hospital overcrowding and lack of faith in treatment. In the most severely affected areas, prevalence was 28% and mortality was 21% of the cases.&lt;ref name="skerfving" /&gt; Some Iraqi doctors believe both the number of cases and fatalities are at least ten times too low,&lt;ref name="diagnosis" /&gt; with perhaps 100,000 cases of brain damage. One suggested reason for the vast discrepancy between reported and estimated numbers of deaths is the Iraqi custom, common to large parts of the Middle East, for a person to die at home when possible. Home deaths would not have been recorded.&lt;ref name="Jernelov" /&gt;

A large number of patients with minor symptoms recovered completely; those with more serious symptoms improved. This was in contrast to expected outcomes, largely based on analysis of [[Minamata disease]] in [[Japan]]. In boys with mercury levels below clinical poisoning, a reduction in school performance was noted, although this correlation could not be confirmed.&lt;ref name="skerfving" /&gt; In infants, the mercury poisoning caused [[central nervous system]] damage. Relatively low doses caused slower development in children, and abnormal reflexes.&lt;ref name="autism" /&gt; Different treatments for mercury poisoning have since been developed, and "quiet baby syndrome", characterised by a baby who never cries, is now a recognised symptom of methylmercury-induced brain damage.&lt;ref name="Jernelov" /&gt; Ongoing recommendations of the food regulation authorities have focused on consumption by pregnant women and infant children,&lt;ref name="maryland" /&gt; noting the particular susceptibility of fetuses and infants to methylmercury poisoning. Data from Iraq have confirmed that methylmercury can pass to a child ''[[in utero]]'', and mercury levels were equal to or higher in the newborn child than in the mother.&lt;ref name="bakir" /&gt;

In 1974, a joint [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) meeting made several recommendations to prevent a similar outbreak. These included stressing the importance of labelling bags in the local language and with locally understood warning symbols. The possibility of an additive creating a strong bitter taste was studied.&lt;ref name="skerfving" /&gt; The meeting urged governments to strictly regulate methyl- and ethylmercury use in their respective countries, including limiting use to where no other reasonable alternative was available. It also recommended the involvement of the FAO and WHO in assisting national governments in regulation and enforcement, and the setting up of national poison control centres. Over 9–13 November, a Conference on Intoxication due to Alkylmercury-Treated Seed was held in [[Baghdad]]. It supported the recommendations of the FAO/WHO report and further suggested that local and national media should publicise outbreaks, including size and symptoms; it considered the distribution of this information crucial. It also laid out a general plan as to the collection of relevant information from the field and potential analysis for further investigation. It called on national governments to make use of WHO involvement whenever feasible, and absolved world governments in clear terms, saying that "No country should ever feel that any blame will attach to it for allowing an outbreak to occur".&lt;ref name="skerfving" /&gt;

Iraq now has the highest incidence of Parkinson's in the world.  Parkinson's symptoms are very similar to mercury poisoning symptoms. Mercury that enters the brain has a half-life of 27.5 years, and chelators are not able to remove it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4809">In November 2003, the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] (URJ) passed a resolution concerning [[medical cannabis]] at its general assembly in Minneapolis. The resolution became the first endorsement of medical cannabis by any religious body.&lt;ref name="Fishkoff"&gt;{{citation|title=Plenty of Jews on board California's bid to legalize marijuana|date=October 26, 2010 |author=Sue Fishkoff|publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]]|url=https://www.jta.org/2010/10/26/news-opinion/united-states/plenty-of-jews-on-board-with-californias-bid-to-legalize-marijuana}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Another source says [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] became "the first religious denomination to adopt a statement of conscience" in 2002, calling for legalization and regulation of marijuana but not legalized medical marijuana specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Clergy join push to legalize marijuana in mission of social justice – Protestant pastors and Jewish rabbis are lobbying lawmakers in Illinois and elsewhere to legalize marijuana|author=Manya Brachear Pashman|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-clergy-for-new-drug-policy-met-20150602-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two other Jewish organizations passed resolutions before then:  [[Women for Reform Judaism]] passed a resolution in support of making it legal for physicians to prescribe marijuana to critically ill patients in 1999, and the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] passed a similar resolution in 2001.&lt;ref name="Fishkoff" /&gt;}}  

== Roots ==
The measure was preceded by a 1999 resolution adopted by [[Women of Reform Judaism]], under the leadership of board member Jane Marcus.&lt;ref name=Saline2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=JTA2015&gt;

== Commentary ==

According to [[Carol Saline]], "Jews have been in the forefront of the effort to legalize medical marijuana, perhaps because of what Rabbi [[Dayle Friedman]] attributes to the 'strong mandate about [[Jewish medicine|healing in Judaism]].'"&lt;ref name=Saline2017&gt;{{Citation|work=Hadassah|publisher=[[Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America]]|title=The New (Old) Cannabis Consumer|author=[[Carol Saline]] |date=January 2017|url=http://www.hadassahmagazine.org/2017/01/18/new-old-cannabis-consumer/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a law banning [[sex selective abortion]] was introduced. The new law also introduced mandatory counseling before abortion and a 3 days waiting period. The law has been criticized as using sex-selective abortion as a pretext to restrict access to abortion, although the government denied this, and claimed that it did not intend to question women's right to access safe abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astra.org.pl/repronews/449-restrictions-in-the-law-on-abortion-in-armenia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bord Bia''' (English: Irish Food Board) is an [[State-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland|Irish state agency]] with the aim of promoting sales of Irish food and [[horticulture]] both abroad and in Ireland itself.

It acts as a link between Irish producers and their customers worldwide. For that purpose it has several overseas offices in, amongst other cities, [[Amsterdam]], [[Shanghai]] and [[New York City]].

Bord Bia is mostly known for its certification of Irish food products under the label Origin Green, through which it launched the world's first national sustainability food program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-businessreport.com/article/first-national-food-sustainability-agenda/ |title=“The first national food sustainability agenda” |publisher=The Business Report  |date=January 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bordbia.ie/aboutfood/quality/Pages/default.aspx Quality Assurance]&lt;/ref&gt; The logo connected to this scheme is used at home and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.irishbeef.nl/ Irishbeef.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bord Bia works for both small and large producers; for small producers by promoting and certifying [[farmers' market]]s, and for bigger producers by offering a great range of international marketing services.

In 2008 Bord Bia received 30 million euros for an advertising campaign in the period 2008-2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/state_aids/agriculture-2008/n019-08.pdf Advertising Activities by Bord Bia (Irish Food Board)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103203212/http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/state_aids/agriculture-2008/n019-08.pdf |date=November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the "Oireachtas Grant-in-Aid" was 28 million a year. With other incomes (earmarked grants, levies and so on) the Bord has a budget of about 43,5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bordbia.ie/aboutus/reports/Documents/Annual%20Report%202009.pdf Annual report 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723214134/http://www.bordbia.ie/aboutus/reports/Documents/Annual%20Report%202009.pdf |date=July 23, 2011 }} Last available.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the work is promoting better ways of producing, by innovation and setting "best practice" standards. According to the report ''Pathways for Growth'', published by Bord Bia, Ireland should&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrn.ie/general/2010/05/bord-bia-publishes-%E2%80%98pathways-for-growth%E2%80%99-for-ireland%E2%80%99s-food-sector/ Bord Bia publishes ‘Pathways for Growth’ for Ireland’s Food Sector] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514225241/http://www.nrn.ie/general/2010/05/bord-bia-publishes-%E2%80%98pathways-for-growth%E2%80%99-for-ireland%E2%80%99s-food-sector/ |date=May 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"adopt a strategy of developing a world-class agricultural industry by 2016 and set itself the goal of becoming the most efficient, most highly innovative food and drink country in the world."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 2011 Bord Bia published their goal of increasing food exports by 40% in 2020 compared with the 2010 level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0527/bordbia-business.html Bord Bia wants 40% increase in food exports]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Bord Bia'' was founded in 1994 as an amalgamation of the ''Coras Beostoic agus Feola'' (the Irish Meat and Livestock Board) and the food promotion activities of the ''Irish Trade Board''. In 2004 it amalgamated with ''Bord Glas'', which used to be responsible for the development of the horticulture industry. In 2009 Bord Bia took over the promotion of seafood from BIM (Bord Iascaigh Mharaigh).

'''Contraindications to breastfeeding''' are those conditions that could compromise the health of the infant if breast milk from their mother is consumed. One example of this is [[galactosemia]]. This is. If the mother has [[HIV]] or antiviral therapy, untreated active [[tuberculosis]], [[Human T-lymphotropic virus 1]] or [[Human T-lymphotropic virus 2|II]], uses [[illicit drugs]], or mothers undergoing [[chemotherapy]] or [[radiation treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/139/5/e20170647|title=The Breastfeeding-Friendly Pediatric Office Practice|first1=Joan Younger|last1=Meek|first2=Amy J.|last2=Hatcher|first3=Section On|last3=Breastfeeding|date=1 May 2017|publisher=|journal=Pediatrics|volume=139|issue=5|pages=e20170647|accessdate=6 August 2017|via=pediatrics.aappublications.org|doi=10.1542/peds.2017-0647|pmid=28557776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/disease/index.htm|title=Diseases and Conditions  - Breastfeeding - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breastfeeding contradiction is an act of breastfeeding a child while the mother has conditions such as an addiction or disease. Breast milk contains many nutrients that formulas in store shelves do not have which makes breast feeding a healthier and ideal way to feed an infant.[[Breastfeeding contraindications#cite note-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Breastfeeding contraindications can occur if a mother does not take medication or seek medical advice prior to breast. The effects of the contradiction can do damage to both the infant and even the mother. It is important to explore the factors that can do damage that way a mother can be informed and well educated on the subject manner.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drugabuse.com/library/cocaine-while-breastfeeding|title=Using Cocaine While Breastfeeding - DrugAbuse.com|website=drugabuse.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual with T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 and 2 will have excessive amounts of  [[T-cell leukemia]] and [[Human T-lymphotropic virus 1|HTLV-1]].

'''Bruno Bettelheim''' (August 28, 1903 – March 13, 1990) was a 20th century writer and clinician on [[autism]] and the education of [[Emotional and behavioral disorders|emotionally disturbed]] children. He fled Nazi occupied Austria and came to the United States at the beginning of World War II. After his death, he was exposed for plagiarism, falsified credentials, and abusive treatment of students.&lt;ref name="LosAngeles-Times-1997-Book-Review-Howard-Gardner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baltimore-Sun-Paul-McHugh-January-19-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-January-23-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Sarah-Boxer-January-26-1997"/&gt;

Bettelheim was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and following the Nazi ''[[Anschluss]]'' (annexation) of [[Austria]] in March 1938, he was arrested in May because he was a [[Jews|Jew]] and an advocate of Austrian independence. Bettelheim was imprisoned for ten and a half months in the concentration camps Dachau and Buchenwald until he was released in April 1939.&lt;ref name="NeuroTribes, Silberman, pages 202-03, Bettelheim's 10 and a 1/2 months in Dachau and Buchenwald"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bettelheim|first=Bruno|date=1943|title=Individual and Mass Behavior in Extreme Situations|url=|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=38|pages=417–452|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the camps he used mnemonic techniques to remember details of the responses of guards and inmates, which he later published in an academic journal article. He then emigrated to the United States and participated in a wartime project sponsored by [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to help refugee scholars find new jobs.  He first worked as a research assistant at the University of Chicago, became  a professor at [[Rockford College]], and then returned to the University of Chicago to accept positions as both professor and director ofthe [[Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School|Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School for Disturbed Children]].&lt;ref name="Biographical Dictionary of American Educators, 1978"/&gt;

Bettelheim remained director of the school from 1944 to 1973 and during the 1960s and 1970s had an international reputation in such fields as [[autism]], [[Child and adolescent psychiatry|child psychiatry]], and [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian analysis]].&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Sarah-Boxer-January-26-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-November-11-1990-Ron-Grossman"/&gt;  After his death in 1990, it was discovered that he had substantially misrepresented his background and credentials.&lt;ref name="Baltimore-Sun-Paul-McHugh-January-19-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Book-Review-January-13-1997"/&gt;  For example, he had never been a candidate at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and had only taken three introductory courses in psychology.&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-January-23-1997"/&gt;  His one Ph.D was in either art history or philosophy (aesthetics).&lt;ref name="Baltimore-Sun-Paul-McHugh-January-19-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chicago-Tribune-Marie-Winn-February-23-1997/&gt; Bettelheim's theories on [[autism]], for which he blamed parents and primarily mothers in ''The Empty Fortress'' (1967), raised controversy in his lifetime&lt;ref name=Lehmann-Haupt-1997/&gt; and are now considered to be discredited.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;

After his death, it was further revealed that Bettelheim often used violence against students at the school even though he wrote against corporal punishment.  Counselors at the school tended to merely perceive corporal punishment, whereas some but not all students perceived rage and out-of-control violence.&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-November-11-1990-Ron-Grossman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LosAngeles-Times-1997-Book-Review-Howard-Gardner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago-Reader-Alida-Jatich-two-letters-1990-and-1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Washington-Post-Charles-Pekow-August-26-1990/&gt;

Chicago-area psychiatrists were later criticized for knowing at least some of what was occurring and not taking effective action.&lt;ref name="Late-Talking-Children-Stephen-Camarata-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsweek-September-10-1990/&gt;  The University of Chicago was also criticized for not providing their normal oversight during Bettelheim's tenure.&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-November-11-1990-Ron-Grossman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Molly-Finn-1997"/&gt;

==Background in Austria==
Bruno Bettelheim was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], on August 28, 1903. When his father died, Bettelheim left his studies at the [[University of Vienna]] to look after his family's sawmill.  Having discharged his obligations to his family's business, Bettelheim returned as a mature student in his thirties to the University of Vienna.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He earned a degree in philosophy, producing a dissertation on [[Immanuel Kant]] and on the [[history of art]].

Bettelheim's first wife, Gina, took care of a troubled American child, Patsy, who lived in their home in Vienna for seven years. There is disagreement among sources regarding whether or not Patsy was autistic.&lt;ref name=Chicago-Tribune-Marie-Winn-February-23-1997/&gt;&lt;ref name="Molly-Finn-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weekly-Standard-1997"/&gt;

In the Austrian academic culture of Bettelheim's time, one could not study the history of art without mastering aspects of [[psychology]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Candidates for the doctoral dissertation in the History of Art in 1938 at Vienna University had to fulfill prerequisites in the formal study of the role of [[Archetypes#Jungian archetypes|Jungian archetypes]] in art, and in art as an expression of the [[Freud]]ian subconscious.

Though [[Jew]]ish by birth, Bettelheim grew up in a secular family. After the [[Nazi]] invasion and ''[[Anschluss]]'' (political annexation) of [[Austria]] on March 12, 1938, the [[Nazi]] authorities sent Bettelheim, other [[Austrian Jews]] and political opponents to the [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camp]]s where they were brutally treated, and tortured or killed. Bettelheim was arrested on May 28, 1938 and was imprisoned in both these camps for ten and half months before being released on April 14, 1939.&lt;ref name="NeuroTribes, Silberman, pages 202-03, Bettelheim's 10 and a 1/2 months in Dachau and Buchenwald"&gt;''NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity'', Steve Silberman, Foreword by Oliver Sacks, Penguin Random House, 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=w3XoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128&amp;lpg=PT128&amp;dq=%22On+May+28,+1938,+policemen+acting+on+orders+from+Berlin+arrived+at+Bettelheim's+door%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qC4YMwdm-p&amp;sig=ooaToQPrzuTq5LAv-3wP2w5wKr0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW1-vQq8XTAhVFOhQKHQXwA8oQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22On%20May%2028%2C%201938%2C%20policemen%20acting%20on%20orders%20from%20Berlin%20arrived%20at%20Bettelheim's%20door%22&amp;f=false pages 202-203].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rgGA91skoP4C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=bettelheim+released+Nazis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S9ohBY_Twz&amp;sig=mWk4HLedB4J3Xd_SFXXk99AtEQM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxyoTV_qzUAhUL64MKHUVaAtIQ6AEIUDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=bettelheim%20released%20Nazis&amp;f=false Dictionary of Genocide, Volume 1: A–L], "Bettelheim, Bruno (1903–1990)," Samuel Totten, Paul R.

As a result of an amnesty declared for [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s birthday (which occurred slightly later on April 20, 1939), Bettelheim and hundreds of other prisoners were released. Bettelheim drew on the experience of the concentration camps for some of his later work.

==Life and career in the United States==
Bettelheim arrived by ship as a refugee in New York City in late 1939 to join his wife Gina, who had already emigrated. They divorced because she had become involved with someone else during their separation. He soon moved to Chicago, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1944, and married an Austrian woman, Gertrude ('Trudi') Weinfeld, also an emigrant from Vienna.

The Rockefeller Foundation sponsored a wartime project to help resettle European scholars by circulating their resumes to American universities.  Through this process, Ralph Tyler hired Bettelheim to be his research assistant at the University of Chicago from 1939-1941 with funding from the [[Progressive Education Association]] to evaluate how high schools taught art. Once this funding ran out, Bettelheim found a job at Rockford College, Illinois, where he taught from 1942-1944.&lt;ref name="Biographical Dictionary of American Educators, 1978"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5YNz-kNZgsC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=Bettelheim+%22Progressive+Education+Association%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_3BXp8Jzlq&amp;sig=18cw_k46fLQgTtY-smixWcAQLiM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5_bqLrsbXAhXBYiYKHUBEAIAQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Bettelheim%20%22Progressive%20Education%20Association%22&amp;f=false Biographical Dictionary of American Educators, Vol. 1]

In 1943, he published the paper "Individual and Mass Behavior in Extreme Situations" about his experiences in the concentration camps, a paper which was highly regarded by Dwight Eisenhower among others.&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Sarah-Boxer-January-26-1997"/&gt;  Bettelheim claimed he had interviewed 1,500 fellow prisoners, although this was unlikely.&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Sarah-Boxer-January-26-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NeuroTribes, Steve Silberman, 2015"/&gt;

Through Ralph Tyler's recommendation, the [[University of Chicago]] appointed Bettelheim as a professor of psychology, as well as director of the [[Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School]] for emotionally disturbed children.&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-November-11-1990-Ron-Grossman"/&gt;  He held both positions from 1944 until his retirement in 1973. He wrote a number of books on psychology and, for a time, had an international reputation for his work on [[Sigmund Freud]], [[psychoanalysis]], and [[Serious emotional disturbance|emotionally disturbed]] children. He stated that the Viennese psychoanalyst [[Richard Sterba]] had analyzed him, as well as implying in several of his writings that he had written a PhD dissertation in the philosophy of education. His actual PhD was in art history, and he had only taken three introductory courses in psychology.&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-January-23-1997"&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-01-23/features/9701230196_1_orthogenic-school-bruno-bettelheim-pollak Genius Or Fraud?

"&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Orthogenic School, Bettelheim made changes and set up an environment for [[milieu therapy]], in which children could form strong attachments with adults within a structured but caring environment. He claimed considerable success in treating some of the emotionally disturbed children. He wrote books on both normal and abnormal [[child psychology]], and became a major influence in the field, widely respected during his lifetime. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After retiring in 1973, he and his wife moved to [[Portola Valley, California]], where he continued to write and taught at [[Stanford University]].

Bettelheim analyzed [[fairy tale]]s in terms of [[Freud]]ian psychology in ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'' (1976). He discussed the emotional and symbolic importance of [[fairy tale]]s for children, including traditional tales at one time{{Clarify|date=March 2012}}&lt;!-- i suspect IN HIS TIME but i don't know --&gt; considered too dark, such as those collected and published by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Bettelheim suggested that traditional fairy tales, with the darkness of abandonment, death, witches, and injuries, allowed children to grapple with their fears in remote, [[symbol]]ic terms. If they could read and interpret these fairy tales in their own way, he believed, they would get a greater sense of meaning and purpose. Bettelheim thought that by engaging with these [[social evolution|socially-evolved]] stories, children would go through emotional growth that would better prepare them for their own futures. In the United States, Bettelheim won two major awards for ''The Uses of Enchantment'': the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for Criticism&lt;ref name=nbcc&gt;[http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/ "All Past National Book Critics Circle Award Winners and Finalists"].

His writings covered a wide range of topics, beginning shortly after he arrived in the United States with an essay on concentration camps and their dynamics. He long had a reputation as an authority on these topics.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16083 Robert Gottlieb, "The Strange Case of Dr. B.", The New York ''Review of Books'', 27 Feb 2003].

At the end of his life, Bettelheim suffered from depression. He appeared to have had difficulties with depression for much of his life.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt; In 1990, widowed, in failing physical health, and suffering from the effects of a stroke which impaired his mental abilities and paralyzed part of his body, he committed suicide as a result of self-induced [[asphyxiation]] by placing a plastic bag over his head.&lt;ref name="SAJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Suicidelaterlife&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osgood|first=Nancy J.|publication-date=1992|title=Suicide in later life|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K202uE6QiDUC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;vq=bruno&amp;pg=PA4#v=snippet&amp;q=bruno|accessdate=January 29, 2010|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-21214-3|date=July 1992|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on March 13, 1990, in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-03-14/news/9001210549_1_sonia-shankman-orthogenic-school-jacquelyn-sanders-dr-Bettelheim Dr. Bruno Bettelheim, Child Psychology Expert], ''Chicago Tribune'', John W.

Currently, many of Bettelheim's theories in which he attributes [[autism spectrum]] conditions to parenting style are considered to be discredited, not least because of the controversies relating to his academic and professional qualifications.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philly.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autisticadvocacy.org"/&gt;

==Misrepresented credentials==

As early as November 1990, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' raised questions about Bettelheim's credentials. Different people seemed to believe different things about his background and credentials. Bertram Cohler and Jacquelyn Sanders at the Orthogenic School believed Bettelheim had a PhD in art history. In some of his own writings, Bettelheim implied that he had written a dissertation on the philosophy of education.  Ralph Tyler, who brought Bettelheim to the University of Chicago, assumed that Bettelheim had two PhDs, one in art history and the other in psychology.&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-November-11-1990-Ron-Grossman"&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-11-11/features/9004030282_1_bruno-bettelheim-sonia-shankman-orthogenic-school-animal-terrorSolving The Puzzle That Was Bruno Bettelheim], ''Chicago Tribune'', Ron Grossman, November 11, 1990. "  .  .  Yet the university`s official biographical sketch [University of Chicago] credits Bettelheim with only one Ph.D., and doesn`t specify a field.  .  "&lt;/ref&gt;  And also, "Tyler assumed, mistakenly, that Bettelheim had received formal certification in psychoanalysis, a matter on which Bettelheim never set Tyler straight."&lt;ref name="How Ralph W. Tyler Taught America to Teach, 2004"/&gt;

A lot of information came out following the publication of two biographies, ''Bruno Bettelheim, Une vie'' (''Bruno Bettelheim: A Life and a Legacy'') (1995) by Nina Sutton, originally in French,&lt;ref name=Tremintin-book-review-of-Sutton-in-French&gt;Trem'Site, [http://tremintin.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1354&amp;Itemid=88 Bruno Bettelheim, une vie], Nina Sutton, Stock, 1995, 758 pages.

" . . Assuming Pollak has got it right — and there is more documentation here than most of us would need — Bettelheim joins the ranks of notorious dissemblers . . . "&lt;/ref&gt;

These somewhat competing biographies, especially Pollak's more critical biography, seemed to motivate journalists to look into the matter in greater depth.  Richard Pollak's biography begins with a personal account, for his brother was a resident at Bettelheim's school. While home one summer and playing hide-and-go-seek in a hay loft, the brother fell through a chute covered with hay, hit the concrete floor on the level below and died. Years later Pollak, hoping to get some information about his brother's life, sought out Bettelheim. As Pollak recounts, "Bettelheim immediately launched into an attack. The boys' father, he said, was a simple-minded 'schlemiel.' Their mother, he insisted, had rejected Stephen at birth forcing him to develop 'pseudo-feeble-mindedness' to cope."  He went on to angrily ask, "What is it about these Jewish mothers, Mr. Pollak?" Bettelheim insisted the brother had committed suicide and made it look like an accident.&lt;ref name=Chicago-Tribune-Marie-Winn-February-23-1997/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-April-3-1997-Joan-Beck"/&gt;

As a review in the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' states, "The stance of infallibility over matters Pollak knew to be untrue prompted him to wonder about the foundation of Bettelheim's commanding reputation."&lt;ref name="Baltimore-Sun-Paul-McHugh-January-19-1997"&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-01-19/news/1997019010_1_bruno-bettelheim-richard-pollak-orthogenic-school Bruno Bettelheim: a cautionary life], ''Baltimore Sun'', Paul R. McHugh, Jan. 19, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollak would go on to work as a journalist and magazine editor for close to two decades before attempting his biography of Bettelheim.&lt;ref name="Authors-Guild-Richard-Pollak"&gt;[https://www.authorsguild.net/services/members/585 The Authors Guild], Member Profile, Richard Pollak. He has served several editorial positions with ''The Nation'' and ''Newsweek'', has written for ''Harper's'', ''The Atlantic'', ''The New York Times Book Review'', and ''The Evening Sun'' (Baltimore) newspaper. In the 1970s, Pollak was also co-founder and editor of [MORE] magazine which was a monthly journalism review.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of reviewers criticized Pollak's writing style, commenting that his book was motivated by "Vengeance, not malice"&lt;ref name=Chicago-Tribune-Marie-Winn-February-23-1997/&gt; or that his book was "curiously unnuanced,"&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Sarah-Boxer-January-26-1997"/&gt; but they still largely agreed with his conclusions.&lt;ref name="LosAngeles-Times-1997-Book-Review-Howard-Gardner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Sarah-Boxer-January-26-1997"/&gt;  For example, in a ''New York Review of Books'' article, Robert Gottlieb describes Pollak as a "relentlessly negative biographer," but Gottlieb still writes, "The accusations against Bettelheim fall into several categories. First, he lied; that is, he both exaggerated his successes at the school and falsified aspects of his background, claiming a more elaborate academic and psychoanalytic history in Vienna than he had actually had. There is conclusive evidence to support both charges."  Gottlieb goes on to say that Bettelheim arrived in the United States as a Holocaust survivor and refugee without a job nor even a profession, and writes, "I suspect he said what he thought it was necessary to say, and was then stuck with these claims later on, when he could neither confirm them (since they were false) nor, given his pride, acknowledge that he had lied."  This is Robert Gottlieb's judgment call for why Bettelheim lied.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;

A review in ''The Independent'' (UK) of Sutton's book stated that Bettelheim "despite claims to the contrary, possessed no psychology qualifications of any sort."&lt;ref name=The-Independent-December-9-1995&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/turbulent-dreams-of-a-damaged-saint-1524787.html Turbulent dreams of a damaged saint], ''The Independent'' [UK], Nicholas Tucker (review of ''Bruno Bettelheim: A Life and a Legacy'' by Nina Sutton), 8 December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  A review of Pollak's book in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated "when all is said and done, Bettelheim seems to have re-enacted the archetypal American success story of inventing a false past, concocting a new formula for snake oil and selling it to the public with flummery. Under Mr. Pollak's magnifying glass, Bettelheim is seen in a new, harsh light, and stands exposed as a brilliant charlatan."&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Book-Review-January-13-1997"/&gt;  Another review in ''The New York Times'' by a different reviewer stated that Bettelheim "began inventing degrees he never earned."&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Sarah-Boxer-January-26-1997"/&gt;  A review in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' stated "as Pollak demonstrates, Bettelheim was a snake-oil salesman of the first magnitude."&lt;ref name=Chicago-Tribune-Marie-Winn-February-23-1997/&gt;

When Bettelheim applied for a position at Rockford College in Illinois, he claimed in a résumé that he had earned summa cum laude doctorates in philosophy, art history, and psychology, and he made such claims that he had run the art department at Lower Austria's library, that he had published two books on art, that he had excavated Roman antiquities, and that he had engaged in music studies with Arnold Schoenberg.  When he applied at the University of Chicago for a professorship and as director of the Orthogenic School, he further claimed that he had training in psychology, experience raising autistic children, and personal encouragement from Sigmund Freud.  In a 1997 ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' article Peter Kramer, clinical professor of psychiatry at Brown University, summarized: "There were snatches of truth in the tall tale, but not many. Bettelheim had earned a non-honors degree in philosophy, he had made acquaintances in the psychoanalytic community, and his first wife had helped raise a troubled child. But, from 1926 to 1938, -- the bulk of the '14 years' at university -- Bettelheim had worked as a lumber dealer in the family business."&lt;ref name="Weekly-Standard-1997"&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-battle-over-bettelheim/article/9267 THE BATTLE OVER BETTELHEIM], ''Weekly Standard'', Peter D.

In his 1997 review of Pollak's book in the ''Baltimore Sun'', Paul McHugh, then director of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins, stated "Bettelheim – with boldness, energy and luck – exploited American deference to Freudo-Nietzschean mind-sets and interpretation, especially when intoned in accents Viennese."&lt;ref name="Baltimore-Sun-Paul-McHugh-January-19-1997"/&gt;

In his book ''Unstrange Minds'' (2007), Roy Richard Grinker wrote:{{Quote|"Two other books on autism, published at about the same time [as Bettelheim's ''Empty Fortress'' (1967)], got little mention in the press: Bernard Rimland's ''Autism: The Syndrome and Its Implications for a Neural Theory of Behavior'' (1964), which outlined the biological and neurological aspects of autism, and Clara Clairborne Park's ''The Siege'' (1967), a beautifully written memoir of raising an autistic child.  Though they were more accurate depictions of autism, they couldn't compete with Bettelheim. He was simply too good a writer, and with his Viennese accent—the sign of an authentic expert in psychology—too good a self promoter."&lt;ref name="Unstrange Minds, Roy Richard Grinker, 2007"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1RICHy3FpYkC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Two+other+books+on+autism,+published+at+about+the+same+time%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5u04KY3hBM&amp;sig=Xw3HnarRHFYiDzPoOX9j1T71oIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjgray32qTeAhUKlawKHWXpB_YQ6AEwAHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Two%20other%20books%20on%20autism%2C%20published%20at%20about%20the%20same%20time%22&amp;f=false Unstrange Minds: Remapping the World of Autism: A Father, a Daughter, and a Search for New Answers], Finalist for the Victor Turner Prize for Ethnographic Writing, Roy Richard Grinker, New York: Basic Books (Perseus Books Group), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jordynn Jack writes that Bettelheim's ideas gained currency and became popular in large part because society already tended to blame a mother first and foremost for her child's difficulties.&lt;ref name="Autism and Gender, Jordynn Jack, 2014"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DroPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=%22The+commonplace+of+the+absent,+anxious,+or+cold+mother+became+a+heuristic%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1C9dsLrgAg&amp;sig=tXGsReHs0M8NTl1sFDyOvfDgvdc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiNxrik16TeAhVMY6wKHbKKCa4Q6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20commonplace%20of%20the%20absent%2C%20anxious%2C%20or%20cold%20mother%20became%20a%20heuristic%22&amp;f=false Autism and Gender: From Refrigerator Mothers to Computer Geeks], Jordynn Jack, University of Illinois Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism in Bettelheim's ''Uses of Enchantment''==
For his book ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'' (1976), which applied Freudian psychology to [[fairy tale]]s, Bettelheim won the 1976 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for Criticism and the 1977 [[National Book Award]] in [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Current|category Contemporary Thought]].&lt;ref name=nbcc/&gt;&lt;ref name=nba1977/&gt;

However, within a year of his death, an article in the winter 1991 edition of ''The Journal of American Folklore'' presented a case that he had engaged in plagiarism by borrowing without acknowledgement from a number of sources, including author Alan Dundes' 1967 paper on Cinderella, although primarily from Dr. Julius E. Heuscher's book ''A Psychiatric Study of Fairy Tales'' (1963, 1974 enlarged and rev. edition).  A ''Los Angeles Times'' article stated, "Alan Dundes, a widely published expert on folklore and a 28-year veteran of Berkeley's anthropology department, details what he says is 'wholesale borrowing,' not only of 'random passages' but also of 'key ideas' in Bettelheim's 1976 book." Heuscher himself was gracious about the charges, stating "We all plagiarize. I plagiarize. Many times, I am not sure whether it came out of my own brain or if it came from somewhere else... I'm only happy that I would have influenced Bruno Bettelheim. I did not always agree with him. But that does not matter. Poor Bruno Bettelheim. I would not want to disturb his eternal sleep with this" [ellipsis as it appeared in ''Los Angeles Times'' article].&lt;ref name="Journal-of-American-Folklore-Winter-1991"&gt;Dundes, Alan: [https://www.jstor.org/pss/541135 "Bruno Bettelheim's Uses of Enchantment and Abuses of Scholarship"].

Jacquelyn Sanders, who worked with Bettelheim and was the director of the Orthogenic School in 1991, states that she had read Dundes' article but did not believe many people would agree with his conclusions. She said, "I would not call that plagiarism. I think the article is a reasonable scholarly endeavor, and calling it scholarly etiquette is appropriate. It is appropriate that this man deserved to be acknowledged and Bettelheim didn't... But I would not fail a student for doing that, and I don`t know anybody who would" [Ellipses in ''Chicago Tribune'' article].&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-February-7-1991"&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-02-07/news/9101110905_1_dundes-article-sonia-shankman-orthogenic-school-bruno-bettelheim Bettelheim Accused Of Plagiarizing Book], ''Chicago Tribune'', Sharman Stein, February 7, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heuscher wrote in 1963:  "While one must never 'explain' the fairy tales to the child, the narrator's understanding of their meaning is very important. It furthers the sensitivity for selecting those stories which are most appropriate in various phases of children's development and for stressing those themes which may be therapeutic for specific psychological difficulties."&lt;ref name="Los-Angeles-Times-February-7-1991"/&gt;

Bettelheim wrote in 1976:  "One must never 'explain' to the child the meaning of fairy tales. However, the narrator's understanding of the fairy tale's message to the child's preconscious mind is important. . . . It furthers the adult's sensitivity to selection of those stories which are most appropriate to the child's state of development and to the specific psychological difficulties he is confronted with at the moment"  [ellipsis as it appeared in ''Los Angeles Times'' article].&lt;ref name="Los-Angeles-Times-February-7-1991"/&gt;

In reviewing Richard Pollak's ''The Creation of Dr. B: A Biography of Bruno Bettelheim'' (1997), Sarah Boxer of ''The New York Times'' wrote, "Mr. Pollak gives a damning passage-for-passage comparison of the two.......Mr. Pollak's book is a startling and thorough account of a life of lies. A less vengeful biographer might have paused to analyze the psychic uses of the elaborate fairy tale Bettelheim constructed for himself." [Heuscher's 1963 book and Bettelheim's 1976 book]"&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Sarah-Boxer-January-26-1997"/&gt;

==Abusive treatment of students==

After Bettelheim's suicide in 1990, some students claimed that Bettelheim exploded in screaming anger and hit students, although he preached against corporal punishment.  A November 1990 ''Chicago Tribune'' article states:  "Of the 19 alumni of the Orthogenic School interviewed for this story, some are still bitterly angry at Bettelheim, 20 or 30 years after leaving the institution. Others say their stays did them good, and they express gratitude for having had the opportunity to be at the school. All agree that Bettelheim frequently struck his young and vulnerable patients."&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-November-11-1990-Ron-Grossman"/&gt;

Some but not all counselors at the Orthogenic School tended to see Bettelheim merely as using corporal punishment, while many but not all students saw rage and out-of-control violence on his part.&lt;ref name="Chicago-Reader-Alida-Jatich-two-letters-1990-and-1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Washington-Post-Charles-Pekow-August-26-1990&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1990/08/26/the-other-dr-bettleheim/3d938d77-08f3-430a-98f9-dac1fb7b6fd9/ The Other Dr. Bettelheim], ''The Washington Post'', Charles Pekow, Editorial, Aug. 26, 1990.

Alida Jatich, who lived at the school from 1966 to 1972 from ages twelve to eighteen, wrote in an initially anonymous April 1990 letter to the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', "Bettelheim told the children over and over how lucky they were to be at his school, and that if they didn't do as they were told, they would end up in a state mental asylum where they would be given drugs and shock treatments.  .  .  .  .  I lived in fear of Bettelheim's unpredictable temper tantrums, public beatings, hair pulling, wild accusations and threats and abuse in front of classmates and staff. One minute he could be smiling and joking, the next minute he could be exploding." Ms. Alida Jatich publicly revealed her name and the years she was at the school in another letter a year later.&lt;ref name="Chicago-Reader-Alida-Jatich-two-letters-1990-and-1991"&gt;''Chicago Reader'', Letters to the Editor, [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/brutal-bettelheim/Content?oid=875450 Brutal Bettelheim], Name Withheld, April 5, 1990.

See pages 80 and following for more of Jatich's recounts of her experiences and her thoughts regarding why more people didn't speak up.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 1990 letter to ''The Washington Post'', Charles Pekow wrote, "Bettelheim had standard lines he gave us all: we were considered hopelessly 'crazy' by the outside world and only he could save us from lives in mental institutions or jail. 'You get better here or you go to a nut house,' I heard him routinely tell school-aged children... Once, after a boy returned from a visit home, Bettelheim spent five minutes slapping him in the face, hitting him in the sides with fists and pulling his hair. Midway through, he revealed why: The lad had told his brother to 'do well in school.' He had no right to 'push' his brother around. To be sure, the blows he struck, though often painful and humiliating, did not physically damage people. But I often saw Bettleheim drag children across the floor by their hair and kick them. He even hit autistic children who couldn't speak clearly."&lt;ref name=Washington-Post-Charles-Pekow-August-26-1990/&gt;

As an example of a counselor viewing Bettelheim's behavior as more legitimate corporal punishment, David Zwerdling, who was a counselor at the school for one year in 1969-70, wrote a Sept. 1990 response to ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in which he stated, "I witnessed one occasion when an adolescent boy cursed at a female counselor. Incensed upon learning of this, Dr. Bettelheim proceeded to slap the boy two or three times across the face, while telling him sternly never to speak that way to a woman again. This was the only such incident I observed or heard of during my year at the school, and it should be noted that until fairly recently, the near-consensus against corporal punishment in schools did not obtain."  However, Zwerdling also noted, "He also was a man who, for whatever reasons, was capable of intense anger on occasion."&lt;ref name=Washington-Post-Charles-Pekow-August-26-1990/&gt;

In an October 1990 essay in ''Commentary'' magazine, alumnus Ronald Angres wrote, "For all of those years, they [my parents] too endured his insulting and intimidating theatrics.  But from his behavior they never drew the obvious conclusion about his character, nor did they ever pause to consider how he must be treating those whom he had totally in his power.  It did not seem to occur to them that in his 'total therapeutic milieu,' the professional distance they sought had been delegated to people who raised us, educated us, disciplined us, and controlled us far more completely than any ''parent''—''and'' kept our real parents in the dark.  Indeed, Bettelheim's constant verbal abuse of the parents with whom he dealt, and whom he refused to allow past the visitors' area—combined with his well-publicized assertion that it was parents who caused mental illness in their children—systematically destroyed their will to stand up for themselves or their children."&lt;ref name="Commentary-Magazine-Ron-Angres-October-1990"/&gt;

Roberta Carly Redford, who was a student at the Orthogenic School from age 16 to 23 (1967 to 1974), stated in a 1990 letter to ''The New York Times'', "Unlike most of the other kids there, I was beaten only once. Bettelheim knew how to find people's Achilles' heels. Alida Jatich, whom you quote, he beat up often, knowing that her parents had done so and that was what would cause her the most grief. He also did to me what my parents had done -- stripped me of my self-esteem, caused me constantly to doubt myself and verbally abused me. He told me I was a slut, I was a failure at life, and only by abiding by his rules would I ever be fit to live in society again."&lt;ref name=Letter-to-the-Editor-Roberta-Redford-1990/&gt;

In a July 1990 letter to the ''Chicago Reader'', a former counselor at the school writing anonymously stated, "At that time, in the late forties, I probably had more experience upon which to assess the adjustment of the children than most of the counselors at the school. By age 22, when I worked there, I had spent fully a third of my life in group living with a variety of youngsters under stress; four years in an orphan home followed by three and a half years in the wartime army. I understood that the stream of human normality was very wide, and that time healed many wounds without human intervention. It amazed me that Bettelheim, a man from another culture, could look at the same child as I and see a 'schizophrenic' while I saw another rambunctious American kid. What did a forty year old Viennese intellectual really know about the inner (or outer for that matter) life of a ten-year-old [[West Side, Chicago]] Irish kid who had no one to care for him?"&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Reader'', Letters to the Editor, [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-cult-of-bettelheim/Content?oid=3835176 The Cult of Bettelheim], "By WB A former counselor," July 5, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Pollak's 1997 biography states that two separate women reported that Bettelheim fondled their breasts and those of other female students at the school while he was ostensibly apologizing to each for beating her.&lt;ref name="LosAngeles-Times-1997-Book-Review-Howard-Gardner"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-19/books/bk-19948_1_bruno-bettelheim The Confidence Man : THE CREATION OF DR.

" . . indicts those of his time who knew the man but kept their reservations to themselves."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weekly-Standard-1997"/&gt;

The above Nov. 1990 ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article listed the following accounts of abusive treatment of students at the 'Orthogenic School':&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-November-11-1990-Ron-Grossman"/&gt;

• "[Ronald Angres] recently wrote in Commentary magazine, 'I lived for years in terror of his beatings, in terror of his footsteps in the dorms-in abject, animal terror.'"

• "would pull an adolescent girl out of a shower, then hit and berate her in front of dormitory mates. Yet Alida Jatich says he did just that."

• "another former student, Roberta Redford, recalls being summoned from a toilet stall for a similar thrashing."

• "Orthogenic School patient Charles Pekow had allergies, but was not allowed to take medication, even when overcome by asthmatic attacks. Bettelheim thought allergies were psychologically induced—a theory largely laid to rest by subsequent medical research,"

• "Richard Younker, a photojournalist in Chicago, remembers how he and a dormitory mate, both Cub Scouts, decorated their wall with a plaque illustrating how to tie knots. 'Dr. B said to the whole dorm: "Look, the two boys who are so twisted up inside show the whole world by putting knots on the wall,"' Younker says."

On the other hand, Karen Zelan, who worked at the school from 1956 to 1964 recalls Bettelheim taking personal responsibility for a badly dehydrated five-year-old girl and nursing her back to health when other staff members could not get her to take nourishment.&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-November-11-1990-Ron-Grossman"/&gt;

Jacquelyn Sanders, who started as a counselor, left to pursue her PhD, and later became director of the Orthogenic School, thinks it may have been a case of too much success coming too soon. She said, "Dr. B got worse once he started getting acclaim. He was less able to have any insight into his effect on these kids."&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-November-11-1990-Ron-Grossman"/&gt;

Richard Younker said, "I think these things happened to me the way I describe them. If you made the most innocent joke to the man, he exploded. He was out of control."&lt;ref name=New-York-Times-Richard-Bernstein-1990/&gt;

In her April 1991 letter to the ''Chicago Reader'', Alida Jatich wrote, "I suspect that the main reason why it's so hard to talk about the Bettelheim tragedy is this: in one way or another, he induced all of us to act in ways that we feel sick to think about now. This includes kids, parents, staff members, students and faculty at the University of Chicago, colleagues, and so forth."&lt;ref name="Chicago-Reader-Alida-Jatich-two-letters-1990-and-1991"/&gt;

Three alumni have written books about their experiences at the school:

• Tom Lyon's ''The Pelican and After: A Novel about Emotional Disturbance'', a roman à clef novel in which the head of the school is a "Dr. V,"  published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DyDbxBkeyQMC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=%22Tom+Lyon's+(1983)+roman+a+clef+The+Pelican+and+After:+A+Novel+about+Emotional+Disturbance%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pq9-CFYZ5b&amp;sig=ucj4Cp2SdwaD2kuHkWbEb18T-RM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2ooyCpMDTAhVrzlQKHW3UD2QQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tom%20Lyon's%20(1983)%20roman%20a%20clef%20The%20Pelican%20and%20After%3A%20A%20Novel%20about%20Emotional%20Disturbance%22&amp;f=false The Positive Side of Special Education: Minimizing Its Fads, Fancies, and Follies], Kenneth A.

==Nonresponse of psychiatric community==
A September 10, 1990 ''[[Newsweek]]'' article stated: "Patients were not the only ones who knew of Bettelheim's explosive temper.

A November 1990 article in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported that the [[University of Chicago]]'s official biographical sketch of Bettelheim listed him as having a doctorate degree (Ph.D.) but did not specify the field.&lt;ref name="Chicago-Tribune-November-11-1990-Ron-Grossman"/&gt;

In a January 1997 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' review of Richard Pollak's biography ''The Creation of Dr. B: A Biography of Bruno Bettelheim'', [[Howard Gardner]] wrote, "When I began to discuss this biography with clinicians, several of them said in effect, 'Oh, we all knew this about Bettelheim. We did not believe his claims and figures; we knew he was a bastard.' I asked myself--and then I started to ask others--'Why did no one expose this fraud, this pretending saint who was tainted with evil? Did their silence encourage Bettelheim's excesses?' Answers varied from fear about Bettelheim's legendary capacity for retribution to the solidarity needed among the guild of healers to a feeling that, on balance, Bettelheim's positive attributes predominated and an unmasking would fuel more malevolent forces."&lt;ref name="LosAngeles-Times-1997-Book-Review-Howard-Gardner"/&gt; Howard Gardner is a professor at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]], who is perhaps best known for his [[theory of multiple intelligences]].

In a June/July 1997 article in ''[[First Things]]'', Molly Finn wrote, "it is deplorable that the institution [University of Chicago] supported Bettelheim's work without ever setting up the oversight committee or board of visitors it usually appointed."&lt;ref name="Molly-Finn-1997"/&gt;

Richard Pollak, author of ''The Creation of Dr. B'' (1997), states that popular media played along from the start.  He said, "They never asked the questions, never asked to see any kind of support for the claims he was making. He'd appear on Dick Cavett and the Today Show, and they all sat there slack-jawed and threw softball questions."&lt;ref name="Chicago Reader, review of Richard Pollak's The Creation of Dr. B, 1997"&gt;[https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/in-print-the-abominable-dr-bettelheim/Content?oid=892495 In Print: the abominable Dr. Bettelheim], ''Chicago Reader'', Cara Jepsen, Jan. 16, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autism controversy==

Autism spectrum conditions are now currently regarded as perhaps having multiple forms with a variety of genetic, epigenetic, and brain development causes influenced by such environmental factors as complications during pregnancy, viral infections, and perhaps even air pollution.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/documents/evaluatingchanges_workshopsummary.pdf Workshop on U.S. Data to Evaluate Changes in the Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)], U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), February 1, 2011, Background: What Do We Know About ASD Prevalence?, M.

The two biographies by Sutton (1995) and Pollak (1997) awakened interest and focus on Bettelheim's actual methods as distinct from his public persona.&lt;ref name="Molly-Finn-1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Book-Review-January-13-1997"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/13/books/an-icon-of-psychology-falls-from-his-pedestal.html?_r=0 An Icon of Psychology Falls From His Pedestal], ''The New York Times'', Books, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt (review of ''The Creation of Dr. B'' by Richard Pollak), Jan. 13, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Sarah-Boxer-January-26-1997"&gt;

"  .  .  An evocative case history approach like his allowed for fudging of samples, methods, and final results, and Bettelheim did so quite brazenly.  .  "&lt;/ref&gt; In a favorable review of Pollak's biography, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt of ''The New York Times'' wrote, "What scanty evidence remains suggests that his patients were not even autistic in the first place."&lt;ref name="New-York-Times-Book-Review-January-13-1997"/&gt;

Bettelheim believed that autism did not have an organic basis, but resulted when mothers withheld appropriate affection from their children and failed to make a good connection with them. Bettelheim also blamed absent or weak fathers. One of his most famous books, ''The Empty Fortress'' (1967), contains a complex and detailed explanation of this dynamic in psychoanalytical and psychological terms. These views were disputed at the time by mothers of autistic children and by researchers.&lt;ref name="Lehmann-Haupt-1997"&gt;Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher, "An Icon of Psychology Falls From His Pedestal," ''The New York Times,'' 13 Jan. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; He derived his thinking from the qualitative investigation of clinical cases.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} He also related the world of autistic children to conditions in concentration camps.

In ''A Good Enough Parent'', published in 1987, he had come to the view that children had considerable resilience and that most parents could be "good enough" to help their children make a good start.&lt;ref&gt;

Prior to this, Bettelheim subscribed to and became an early prominent proponent of the "[[refrigerator mother]]" theory of autism: the theory that autistic behaviors stem from the emotional frigidity of the children's mothers. He adapted and transformed the Orthogenic School at the University of Chicago as a residential treatment [[Milieu therapy|milieu]] for such children, who he felt would benefit from a "[[parentectomy]]". This marked the apex of autism viewed as a disorder of parenting.&lt;ref name=Scientific-Review-Mental-Health-Practice-2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contemporary Directions in Psychopathology.

A 2002 book on autism spectrum stated, "At the time, few people knew that Bettelheim had faked his credentials and was using fictional data to support his research."&lt;ref name="Elijah's-Cup-2002"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SexSzvwO-k4C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=%22At+the+time,+few+people+knew+that+Bettelheim+had+faked+his+credentials+and+was+using+fictional+data%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zj2ZZN-XG5&amp;sig=NRaG8fSXL47-MI3yNVNlGhgVpEU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2pOO9murPAhUH4IMKHcw0BrEQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22At%20the%20time%2C%20few%20people%20knew%20that%20Bettelheim%20had%20faked%20his%20credentials%20and%20was%20using%20fictional%20data%22&amp;f=false Elijah's Cup: A Family's Journey into the Community and Culture of High-Functioning Autism and Asperger's Syndrome, Revised Edition], Valerie Paradiz, Free Press, 2002; UK: Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 2005, pages 72-73: "At the time, few people knew that Bettelheim had faked his credentials and was using fictional data to support his research. In 1944, with a forged resumé that suggested a stellar academic career in psychoanalysis in Austria, Bettelheim had made his way into a post as the director of the Orthgenic School for Disturbed Children at the University of Chicago."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Rutter]] has observed, "Many people made a mistake in going from a statement which is undoubtedly true—that there is no evidence that autism has been caused by poor parenting—to the statement that it has been disproven. It has not actually been disproven. It has faded away simply because, on the one hand, of a lack of convincing evidence and on the other hand, an awareness that autism was a neurodevelopmental disorder of some kind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feinstein|first=Adam|title=A History of Autism: Conversations with the Pioneers|year=2010|publisher=Blackwell's: Oxford, UK|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1997 review of two books on Bettelheim, Molly Finn wrote "I am the mother of an autistic daughter, and have considered Bettelheim a charlatan since ''The Empty Fortress'', his celebrated study of autism, came out in 1967. I have nothing personal against Bettelheim, if it is not personal to resent being compared to a devouring witch, an infanticidal king, and an SS guard in a concentration camp, or to wonder what could be the basis of Bettelheim's statement that 'the precipitating factor in infantile autism is the parent's wish that his child should not exist.'"&lt;ref name="Molly-Finn-1997"/&gt;

Although Bettelheim foreshadowed the modern interest in the causal influence of genetics in the section ''Parental Background,'' he consistently emphasised nurture over nature. For example: "When at last the once totally frozen affects begin to emerge, and a much richer human personality to evolve, then convictions about the psychogenic nature of the disturbance become stronger still."; ''On Treatability,'' p.&amp;nbsp;412.

The rates of recovery claimed for the Orthogenic School are set out in ''Follow-up Data,'' with a recovery good enough to be considered a 'cure' of 43%., ps. 414–415.

Subsequently, medical research has provided greater understanding of the biological basis of autism and other illnesses. Scientists such as [[Bernard Rimland]] challenged Bettelheim's view of autism by arguing that autism is a [[Neural development|neurodevelopmental]] issue. As late as 2009, the "refrigerator mother" theory retained some prominent supporters,&lt;ref name="SAJ"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Severson|first1=Katherine DeMaria|last2=Aune|first2=James Arnt|last3=Jodlowski|first3=Denise|editor1-first=Mark|editor1-last=Osteen|title=Autism and Representation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=188XgDxmdbEC&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=August 28, 2009|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|series=Routledge research in cultural and media studies|isbn=978-0-415-95644-4|pages=65–77|chapter=Bruno Bettelheim, Autism, and the Rhetoric of Scientific Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Refrigerator mother' tosh must go into cold storage|author=Feinstein, Adam|publisher=autismconnect|url=http://autismconnect.org/news.asp?section=00010001&amp;itemtype=adam&amp;page=9&amp;id=4540|accessdate=July 29, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200621/http://autismconnect.org/news.asp?section=00010001&amp;itemtype=adam&amp;page=9&amp;id=4540|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}

==Political controversy==

Bettelheim became one of the most prominent defenders of [[Hannah Arendt]]'s book ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]''. He wrote a positive review for ''[[The New Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"The New Republic", June 15, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; This review prompted a letter from a writer, [[Harry Golden]], who alleged that both Bettelheim and Arendt suffered from "an essentially Jewish phenomenon … self-hatred".&lt;ref&gt;''The New Republic'', July 20, 1963

==In popular culture==
In 1974, a four-part series featuring Bruno Bettelheim and directed by Daniel Carlin appeared on French television — ''Portrait de Bruno Bettelheim''.

[[Woody Allen]] included Bettelheim as himself in a cameo in the film ''[[Zelig]]'' (1983).

A [[BBC]] ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' documentary about Bettelheim was televised in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Horizon - BBC Two England - 2 February 1987 |url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/157067cd458c4728bd2d46cf79bf8de2 |website=BBC Genome |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--- [Does Kellerman state this clearly in his book, and if so where (Foreword, or Afterword, notes)? Please supply exact references, otherwise cannot be left here: libelous] --- Bettelheim and the controversy that arose after his death appeared to influence the character of Dr. Andres de Bosch in [[Jonathan Kellerman]]'s mystery ''Bad Love''. De Bosch is portrayed as a child psychiatrist who espouses great humanitarian ideals, while practicing bigotry, class prejudice and cruelty. In his life he is lionized for the man he seems to be, but after his death he is exposed as a tyrant and a fraud. ---&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">'''Cannabis in [[Bhutan]]''' is illegal, but grows prolifically in the country and has multiple traditional uses, such as feeding pigs and producing textiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bhutan|journal=UNODC: South Asia Regional Profile|date=September 2005|url=https://www.unodc.org/pdf/india/publications/south_Asia_Regional_Profile_Sept_2005/09_bhutan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularization==
Awareness of cannabis as a drug seems limited in Bhutan, with some authorities tracing its arrival to the legalization of television in 1999; prior to that point, cannabis was mostly thought of as a fodder to fatten pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/14/weekend7.weekend2 |title=Fast forward into trouble |publisher=The Guardian |date=2003-06-13 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2016895.stm |title=Bhutan's growing cannabis problem |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-05-30 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Narcotics Control Board]] noted in 2002 that Bhutan had no history of cannabis abuse, but the government had recently raised concerns about drug abuse, particularly by the young, and taken an interest in eradicating wild cannabis and counseling drug users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the International Narcotics Control Board for 2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k7IfxQ5mnEMC&amp;pg=PA57|year=2003|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-148154-9|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
Bhutan's first arrest for drug abuse occurred in 1989 in [[Gelephu]], where a man was arrested for abusing cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://thebhutanese.bt/41-dead-and-counting-bhutans-growing-drug-problem/ |title=41 dead and counting: Bhutan’s growing Drug problem – The Bhutanese |publisher=Thebhutanese.bt |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Bhutanese government seized 4kg of cannabis; in 2011 this increased to 75kg.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.incb.org/documents/Publications/AnnualReports/AR2012/AR_2012_E_Chapter_III_Asia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textiles==
Though the wild nettle is the more common source of traditional textiles, cannabis has also been used for its fibre, and is called ''kenam'' in the [[Dzongkha language]].&lt;ref name="Altmann2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karin Altmann|title=Fabric of Life - Textile Arts in Bhutan: Culture, Tradition and Transformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZNlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235|date=1 January 2016|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-042861-2|pages=235–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cannabis in Bulgaria''' is classified as a class A (high-risk) drug, together with heroin, [[cocaine]], [[amphetamines]] and [[MDMA]]. 

==Enforcement==
Until 2004, a loosely defined "personal dose" existed. Since 2006, after the last amendment of the Penal Code, the penalty for possession is 1 to 6 years in prison and a fine between 1,000 and 5,000 euros. Many offenders have been prosecuted and effectively put in jail for possession of a single joint. For possession with an aim of distribution (drug-dealing), the sentence can range from 2 to 8 years for small amounts, to 3 to 12 years for large amounts, up to 5 to 15 years when executed by an organized criminal group. In these cases, the maximum fine to be determined together with the prison time is 50,000 euros. Growing is punishable by 2 to 5 years and a fine up to 5,000 euros. The organizer of a growers' group can receive a jail sentence of 10 to 20 years and has to pay a fine of up to 100,000 euros, a participant 3 to 10 years in prison and a fine of 2,500 to 5,000 euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author = Ясен Люцканов |url = http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?issueid=2403&amp;sectionid=5&amp;id=0002301 |title = Еднократна доза закони |publisher = Segabg.com |date =  |accessdate = 2011-02-17 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11050">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' is a long unused form of punishment in '''[[Brazil]]'''. Its last recorded use was in 1876. Although virtually abolished, it is still possible during wartime, according to the Article 5, XLVII, "a", of the Federal Constitution. Brazil is the most populous country in the world that does not retain the death penalty in practice ([[Mexico]] is the most populous to have abolished it entirely). 

Brazil's president-elect [[Jair Bolsonaro]] supports the revival of capital punishment for crimes such as murder and rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 8 October 2018|title= Jair Bolsonaro: Far-right candidate wins first round of Brazil election|trans-title= |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45780176|dead-url= |format= |language= |work= |location= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |publisher=[[BBC]] |quote= "He has also spoken of torture as a legitimate practice and wants to restore the death penalty."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Tiradentes escuartejado (Tiradentes supliciado) by Pedro Américo 1893.jpg|thumb|National hero [[Tiradentes]] was [[quartered]] by [[Portuguese Empire]] forces on April 21, 1792 for his participation in the [[Inconfidência Mineira]] independence movement.]]

The last execution carried out by Brazil was of the [[Afro-Brazilian|black]] [[slave]] [[Francisco (slave)|Francisco]], in [[Pilar, Alagoas]] on April 28, 1876, and the last execution of a free man was, according to official records, of José Pereira de Sousa, in [[Luziânia|Santa Luzia]], [[Goiás]]. He was [[Hanging|hanged]] October 30, 1861. The last execution of a woman, as far as can be established, was Peregrina, one of slaves of Rosa Cassange in [[Sabará]], [[Minas Gerais|MG]], executed by hanging April 14, 1858 (some sources quote April 13, 1858), by the Province of Minas Gerais. The executioner was the slave Fortunato José. It was later discovered that Peregrina was innocent.

Until the final years of the [[Empire of Brazil|Brazilian Empire]], defendants were still condemned to death despite the fact that Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] commuted all death sentences in 1876, for both free men and slaves. However, the death sentence was only fully abolished for common crimes after the proclamation of the Republic in 1889. It was not abolished for certain military offenses in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;CARVALHO FILHO, Luís Francisco. ''Impunidade no Brasil - Colônia e Império''. in: ''Estudos Avançados - V. 18''. São Paulo, 2004; RIBEIRO, João Luiz. ''No meio das galinhas as baratas não têm razão''. ''A Lei de 10 de junho de 1835''. ''Os escravos e a pena de morte no Império do Brasil (1822 - 1889)''. Rio de Janeiro, Editora Renovar, 2005; RIBEIRO, João Luiz. ''A Violência Homicida diante do Tribunal do Júri da Corte Imperial do Rio de Janeiro'' [[UFRJ]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1937 Constitution, which ruled the country during [[Getúlio Vargas]]' [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] dictatorship, made it possible for the Justice to sentence prisoners to death for crimes beyond military offenses in wartime. According to popular belief, [[Brazilian Integralism|integralist]] writer Gerardo Mello Mourão would have been sentenced to death in 1942 under the accusation of committing [[espionage]] for the [[Axis powers]]. As he later said in an interview, he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] during that time.&lt;ref name="Conf"&gt;RUY CÂMARA. [http://www.confrariadovento.com/revista/numero14/especial.htm "Gerardo Mello Mourão, poeta absoluto"]. ''Confraria do Vento''. May–June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to have "never been sentenced to death as the pundits of history and bad faith insinuate".&lt;ref name="Conf" /&gt; As a matter of fact, there are no records of an execution taking place during the period of time in which this Constitution ruled, which lasted until 1946.

From 1969 to 1978, during the [[military dictatorship]], execution once again became available as a form of punishment for political crimes which resulted in death. As such, Teodomiro Romeiro dos Santos, a militant of the Brazilian Revolutionary Communist Party, was sentenced to death under the accusation of shooting an [[Brazilian Air Force|Air Force]] sergeant, who died, and a [[Federal Police Department|Federal Police]] officer, who was injured.&lt;ref name="Levi"&gt;Vasconcelos, Levi. [http://acervohistorico.emilianojose.com.br/imprensa/at_28082004.htm "25 anos de uma obra ainda incompleta"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706152220/http://acervohistorico.emilianojose.com.br/imprensa/at_28082004.htm# |date=2011-07-06 }}. ''A Tarde''. August 28, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Santos, now a [[retired]] [[judge]], is recognized as the only person sentenced to death during the Republican history of Brazil.&lt;ref name="Levi" /&gt; His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1971. There are no official records of executions taking place during the military rule. However, the regime was responsible for the [[extrajudicial killing]] of at least 300 of its opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Carlos Olivieri. [http://educacao.uol.com.br/atualidades/ult1685u256.jhtm "Golpe e repressão no Brasil, na Argentina e no Chile"]. UOL Educação. August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capital punishment for all non-military offences was abolished in Brazil by the 1988 Constitution. Currently, the death penalty may be applicable in Brazil only for military offences such as [[treason]], [[murder]], [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and [[terrorism]] during wartime. The sole method prescribed by law is death by firing squad.&lt;ref&gt;Article 56 of the Military Penal Code of Brazil. Available at http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/del1001.htm (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt; The Military Penal Code advises that this penalty should be sentenced only in extreme cases, and that the president may grant a [[pardon]] for the convicted officer. However, Brazil has not engaged in any major armed conflict since the end of [[World War II]]. Brazil is the only [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking country that still maintains the death penalty for some offenses.

==Law==
The [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution]] of 1988 expressly prohibits the usage of capital punishment by the penal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleII.html Article 5 of Brazilian Constitution (See Paragraph XLVII-a)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, death penalty may be applicable, according to international law, in case of a declared war, under the terms of Article 84, paragraph 19, of the Constitution. It also prohibits, in the same article that refers to the death penalty, the usage of [[Life imprisonment|life sentences]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleII.html Article 5 of Brazilian Constitution (See Paragraph XLVII-b)]&lt;/ref&gt; making Brazil one of the few countries which has abolished both life imprisonment and death penalty. According to the [[Penal code of Brazil|Brazilian Penal Code]], a citizen cannot spend more than 30 continuous years incarcerated.

Brazil is a State Party to the Protocol of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] to Abolish the Death Penalty, which was ratified on August 13, 1996.

According to international law, the "application of the death penalty in time of war pursuant to a conviction for a serious crime of a military nature committed during wartime" is admissible. Article 2, paragraph 1 of the United Nations Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty, allows members to make a reservation in these terms, at the time of ratification or accession to the Protocol.

==Opinion polls==
[[Image:Poll Death penalty Brazil.JPG|thumb|250px|Opinion polls about death penalty in Brazil since 1991:

{{legend|#0070FF|Favourable|#696969}} {{legend|#B94E48|Against|#696969}}{{legend|#9ACD32|Undefined|#696969}}

&lt;small&gt;Source: Datafolha institute.&lt;/small&gt;]]

Datafolha, a polling institute linked to the ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' newspaper, has conducted an annual survey since the early 1990s regarding the acceptance of the death penalty in Brazilian society. The majority of these surveys indicate that most Brazilians are in favor of this form of punishment.&lt;ref name="Folha"&gt;Carvalho, Mário Cesar. "Cai apoio à pena de morte e país fica dividido" ("Support of the death penalty falls and nation is divided"). ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]''. April 6, 2008. Cotidiano - page C1.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent poll (dated March 2008), however, indicates that there is no longer a clear majority on the issue. The difference between those who agree and oppose to the usage of the method is only 1%, and thus, within the [[margin of error]] of the poll.&lt;ref name="Folha" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/death_penalty_splits_views_in_brazil/ "Death Penalty Splits Views in Brazil"]. [[Angus Reid Global Monitor]]. April 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The results are similar to a 2000 poll conducted by the same institute, when approval of the death penalty had an abrupt drop, only to rise up again in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="Folha" /&gt; The newspaper indicates that murder cases widely explored by the [[mass media]] during the time of the survey, such as the [[murder of João Hélio Fernandes Vieites|death of boy João Hélio]] (which also opened a debate on the [[age of criminal responsibility|criminal responsibility age]]), may influence the outcome of the polls.&lt;ref name="Folha" /&gt;

A poll conducted by Sensus institute in January 2010 has indicated that most Brazilians are against the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Ang"&gt;[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/brazilians_remain_opposed_to_death_penalty/ "Brazilians Remain Opposed to Death Penalty". Angus Reid Global Monitor. February 5, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 55 per cent of the 2,000 respondents share this opinion, practically the same percentage from a poll conducted by the same institute in January 2001.&lt;ref name="Ang" /&gt;

By 2018, support for the use of the death penalty had grown significantly. 57% of Brazilians support the death penalty. The age group that shows the greatest support for execution of those condemned is the 25 to 34-year-old category, in which 61% say they are in favour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2018/01/1949074-support-for-death-penalty-at-record-levels-among-brazilians-datafolha-finds.shtml/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlos Monge Medrano''' (December 13, 1884 in [[Lima]] – February 15, 1970 in Lima) was a Peruvian physician specializing in high altitude medicine. [[Monge's disease]] is named after him.

Born in Lima, Peru, Carlos Monge Medrano joined the Faculty of Medicine of San Fernando in 1904, where he earned the title of Medical Surgeon. He continued his studies at the School of Tropical Medicine in London in 1912, and a year later returned to his alma mater to serve as professor.

In 1914 Carlos Monge Medrano, MD, was appointed Head of Clinic of the Faculty of Medicine of the University. He was also head of Pavilion No. 2 of the Archbishop Loayza Hospital in 1925. He was Acting Rector of the Upper House of Studies from 1945 to 1946. He also directed the School of Higher Studies of Cuatricentenaria University from 1946-1957.

Carlos Monge discovered the clinical syndrome of chronic mountain sickness or altitude sickness. He was the first to describe its symptoms and pathogenesis. In 1928 he published the results of his research and that of his collaborators in a book entitled “The Disease of the Andes”, a valuable contribution to medical science. In 1929 this condition was named “Monge's Disease” by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the Sorbonne.

In 1931 Monge suggested the creation of the National Institute of Andean Biology to the authorities of the University of San Marcos, and he became its Director in 1934.

Dr. Monge participated in many international conferences. He was a delegate from Peru to the International Medical Congress held in London in 1929; chairman of the delegation from Peru to the IX Pan American Sanitary Conference in 1934; Peru delegate to the Second Pan American Conference on Eugenics and Homicultura in 1934 and the Peruvian government delegate to the organization of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), in Mexico 1947.

In recognition of his outstanding medical work, Carlos Monge was elected president of the National Academy of Medicine from 1933 to 1936; member of the American Society for the advancement of science in 1934 and an honorary member of the Academy of Medicine of Buenos Aires, in 1934.

Carlos Monge also was vice president of International Studies Conference Stations of the Great Cultures, held in Switzerland in 1948; President of the Peruvian delegation of the II General Assembly of UNESCO in Beirut in 1948; Peru delegate at the Conference on Narcotic Drugs of the UN, New York in 1950; Rapporteur of the International Congress of Medicine in Buenos Aires in 1964, among other prestigious positions.

He was also honorary professor of the Faculty of Medical Sciences at the University of Cochabamba, Bolivia in 1947, a member of the Executive Council of the National Commission of Peru for Cooperation with UNESCO in 1962, as well as consultant on indigenous and tribal peoples of the International Labour Organization in 1962.

For his work as a professor, researcher and doctor at various hospitals, Dr. Monge was recognized and held in distinction by a number of educational and medical institutions. He was decorated with the Order of the Legion of Honor of France; Great Official of the Order of the Sun in Peru; Commander of the Order of the Condor of the Andes in Bolivia; as well as receiving a number of honorary titles.

Medical literature is full of Dr. Monge’s prolific writing. He published more than 150 scientific texts, whose main themes are medicine, parasitology, biology, Andean pathology, anthropology and history.

A '''component cause''' of a [[disease]] is an event required for the disease to develop.
Given a disease or medical condition, there is a causality chain of events from the first event to the appearance of the [[clinical disease]]
A cause of a disease event is an event that preceded the disease event in a disease causal chain. Without this [[:wikt:antecedent|antecedent]] event the disease event either would not have occurred at all or would not have occurred until some later time. However, no specific event is sufficient by itself to produce disease. Hence such an event is a component of a [[sufficient cause]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4626">'''Cryptophasia''' is a phenomenon of a language developed by [[twin]]s (identical or fraternal) that only the two children could understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Thomas | first=JG | title=The early parenting of twins | journal=Military Medicine | volume=161 | issue=4 | pages=233–235 |date=April 1996 | pmid=8935514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word has its roots from the Greek ''crypto'', meaning secret, and ''phasia'', meaning speech. Most [[Linguistics|linguists]] associate cryptophasia with [[idioglossia]], which is any language used by only one, or very few, people. Cryptophasia also differs from idioglossia on including mirrored actions like twin-walk and identical mannerisms.

While some sources&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/twin7.htm How stuff works article]&lt;/ref&gt; claim that twins and children from [[multiple birth]]s develop this ability perhaps because of more interpersonal communication between themselves than with the parents, there is inadequate scientific proof to verify these claims.

== Classification ==
It has been reported that up to 50% of young twins will have their own twin language which they use to communicate only with each other and cannot be understood by others.&lt;ref name=Bishop&gt;{{cite web|last=Bishop|title='Twin language': A risk factor for language impairment?|url=http://www.talkingkids.org/2011/05/do-twins-have-secret-language.html|publisher=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In all cases known, the language consists of [[onomatopoeic]] expressions, some [[neologism]]s, but for the greatest part of words from the adult language adapted to the constrained [[phonological]] possibilities of young children. These words being hardly recognizable, the language may turn out to be completely unintelligible to speakers of the parents' languages, but they resemble each other in that they lack [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and that word order is based on pragmatic principles such as [[salience (language)|saliency]] and the semantic scope of words. Neither the structure of the languages nor its emergence can be explained by other than situational factors."&lt;ref name=Bakker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakker|first=P|title=Autonomous Language of Twins|pmid=3434134|volume=36|issue=2|year=1987|journal=Acta Genet Med Gemellol (Roma)|pages=233–8|doi=10.1017/s0001566000004463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
A delay in the [[phonological development]] of one or both twins (or two siblings at similar age of language development) is said to be a main cause of cryptophasia. Twins can develop the ability to communicate with one another without working within the grammar of their parents' language, thus possibly leading to a short-term delay in linguistic development of one or both twins.&lt;ref name=Bishop/&gt;
The causes seem largely not to be in the greater pre- and perinatal biological problems twins may experience, but rather in postnatal factors.  These factors occur within the family environment and include both a reduced quality of verbal stimulation and interaction with adult language models which result in greater demands of care-giving made on parents of twins, and the intensive interaction between twins which may increase their chances of developing cryptophasia and [[idioglossia]] at the expense of conventional language.&lt;ref name=Zani&gt;{{cite web|last=Zani|first=Bruna|title=Communicative Skills in Childhood: The Case of Twins|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01638539109544789|publisher=Discourse Processes|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social effects ==
An article in [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] dealt with what is observed about the social effects of cryptophasia between twins and how it relates to societies. "Societies need unambiguous ways to distinguish between subject and object," Bakker says. "In the twin situation these can be dispensed with, but not in languages in which it is necessary to refer to events outside the direct situation." &lt;ref&gt;Jon Lackman  (Aug 24, 2011) [http://www.slate.com/articles/life/twins/2011/08/dugon_haus_you_dinikin_duah.html "Dugon, Haus You Dinikin, Du-Ah",]  ''Slate''&lt;/ref&gt;

Hersey was introduced to climbing by his father, who went hiking near Manchester every week. Hersey learned to climb on the [[gritstone]] of the [[Peak District National Park]] in [[Derbyshire]]. In 1983, after being unemployed for five years in England, Hersey decided to travel to the [[United States]], where he lived for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Whitehouse"/&gt;

'''Desmin-related myofibrillar myopathy''' is a subgroup of the [[myofibrillar myopathy]] diseases and is the result of a mutation in the gene that codes for [[desmin]] which prevents it from forming [[protein filament]]s, instead forming aggregates of desmin and other proteins throughout the cell.&lt;ref name="Bar"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bär H, Strelkov SV, Sjöberg G, Aebi U, Herrmann H | title = The biology of desmin filaments: how do mutations affect their structure, assembly, and organisation? | journal = J.

==Presentation==
Common symptoms of the disease are weakness and atrophy in the distal muscles of the lower limbs which progresses to the hands and arms, then to the trunk, neck and face. Respiratory impairment often follows.

== Inheritance==
There are three major types of inheritance for this disease: [[Autosomal dominant]], autosomal recessive and de novo.

* The most severe form is autosomal recessive and it also has the earliest onset.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt; It usually involves all three [[muscle tissue]]s and leads to cardiac and respiratory failure as well as intestinal obstruction.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt;
* Autosomal Dominant inheritance shows a later onset and slower progression. It usually involves only one or two of the muscle tissues.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt;
* De novo diseases occur when a new mutation arises in the person that was not inherited through either parent. This form has a wide range of symptoms and varies depending on the mutation made.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt;
==Pathophysiology==
The [[sarcomere]]s become misaligned and result in the disorganization of muscle fibers.&lt;ref name="Bar"/&gt; This mutation also results in muscle cell death by [[apoptosis]] and necrosis.&lt;ref name="Bar"/&gt; The muscle cell may also be disorganized because the aggregates may interrupt other filament structures and/or normal cellular function.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldfarb LG, Vicart P, Goebel HH, Dalakas MC | title = Desmin myopathy | journal = Brain | volume = 127 | issue = Pt 4 | pages = 723–34 |date=April 2004 | pmid = 14724127 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh033 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desminopathies are very rare diseases and {{as of|2004}} only 60 patients have been diagnosed, however this number probably does not accurately represent the population due to frequent mis or under diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt;
==Diagnosis==
Desminopathies are diagnosed by genetic analysis. Because mutations in several further genes might be pathogenic for skeletal and cardiac myopathies, gene panels or whole exome sequence analysis are mostly used. Sanger sequencing is consequently used to verify NGS-data.

==Treatment==
There is currently no cure for the disease but treatments to help the symptoms are available.&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Prognosis strongly depends on which subtype of disease it is. Some are deadly in infancy but most are late onset and mostly manageable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Selcen|first=Duygu|last2=Ohno|first2=Kinji|last3=Engel|first3=Andrew G.|date=2004-02-01|title=Myofibrillar myopathy: clinical, morphological and genetic studies in 63 patients|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/127/2/439|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=127|issue=2|pages=439–451|doi=10.1093/brain/awh052|issn=0006-8950|pmid=14711882}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1499/|title=Myofibrillar Myopathy|last=Selcen|first=Duygu|date=October 29, 2012|website=GeneReviews|publisher=National Institute of Heath, United States|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elizabeth Ponsonby''' (1900{{spaced ndash}}1940) was a prominent member of the [[Bright Young Things]], well-connected socialites who featured heavily in the contemporary tabloid press for what were perceived to be their hedonistic antics.

The daughter of [[Arthur Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede|Arthur Ponsonby]], [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], later created [[Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede]], Elizabeth descended from the Ponsonby [[Earls of Bessborough]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Ponsonby: The Politics of Life, Raymond A. Jones, 1989, Helm, pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, [[Dorothea Ponsonby|Dorothea ("Dolly")]] (1876–1963), was daughter of the composer [[Hubert Parry]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Ponsonby: The Politics of Life, Raymond A. Jones, 1989, Helm, pg 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Plunket Greene]] was her cousin.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Waugh and the forms of his time, Robert Murray Davis, 1989, Catholic University of America Press, pg 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside [[Babe Plunket-Greene]], [[Brian Howard (poet)|Brian Howard]] and [[Edward Gathorne-Hardy]], Ponsonby was considered to be one of the leaders of the group.&lt;ref name="p159"&gt;Arthur Ponsonby: The Politics of Life, Raymond A. Jones, 1989, Helm, pg 159&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was displeased by her notoriety, commenting "I think she is made for better things"&lt;ref name="p159" /&gt; and regretting that she was "famous for her extravagant pranks".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Ponsonby: The Politics of Life, Raymond A. Jones, 1989, Helm, pg 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 1929 marriage to (John) Denis Cavendish Pelly,&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, 1985, Debrett's Peerage Ltd, pg 682&lt;/ref&gt; an assistant in a Bond Street gramophone shop later employed by the Gaslight and Coke Company, son of Major William Francis Henry Pelly of the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]] and descendant of [[John Pelly|Sir John Pelly]], [[Pelly baronets|1st Baronet]],&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 2003, volume 1, pg 48, and volume 3, pg 3085&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bright Young People: The Rise and Fall of a Generation, 1918-1940, D.

Jones, 1989, Helm, pg 196&lt;/ref&gt; was dissolved in 1933, and Ponsonby later entered a relationship with garage proprietor John Ludovic ('Ludy') Ford.&lt;ref&gt;Bright Young People: The Rise and Fall of a Generation, 1918-1940, D. J. Taylor, 2007, Chatto &amp; Windus, pg 240&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, 1985, Debrett's Peerage Ltd, pg 682&lt;/ref&gt; according to her brother, [[Matthew Ponsonby, 2nd Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede|Matthew]], of alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Waugh: 1924-1966, John Howard Wilson, 1996, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, pg 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Ponsonby: The Politics of Life, Raymond A.

Ponsonby was a model for Agatha Runcible in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s novel ''[[Vile Bodies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Real People, M. C. Rintoul, 1993, Routledge, pg 746&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "escagraph" &lt;ref name=SMITH&gt;'''Smith, Dr. Larry R.'''	''[http://www.escagraph.com/ Mouthful of Words]''  Copyright© 2012.  ''[http://www.escagraph.com/mediawiki/index.php/Escagraph_Introduction Escagraph]''&lt;/ref&gt; was first used&lt;ref name=SSU&gt;'''SSU Weekly'''	[http://www.uis.edu/archives/campus_news/SSU%20Weekly%20v01%201984-85.pdf Volume 1, Number 31], ''Edible Language'', page 61, '''April 18, 1985'''.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s by [[Dr. Larry R. Smith]] to identify and describe the many forms, past and present, of ''writing on food'' and ''letters as food''.  The term is a concatenation of ''esca'' (from Latin meaning "victuals" or "things to be eaten") and ''graph'' (after the Greek meaning: "mark" or the infinitive verb "to write").

== History ==
Research has identified examples of escagraphs as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]] &lt;ref name=BREASTED&gt;'''[[James Henry Breasted]]''' 1962	''Ancient Records of Egypt'' (New York: Russell &amp; Russell, Inc.).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Roman Empire]],&lt;ref name=GUSMAN&gt;'''Gusman, Pierre''' 1900	''Pompeii: The City, Its Life and Art'' (London, William Heinemann).&lt;/ref&gt; primarily bread with words stamped into them prior to baking.   Use of escagraphs waned a bit during periods of [[early Christianity]] &lt;ref name=GALAVARIS&gt;'''Galavaris, George''' 1970	''Bread and the Liturgy: The Symbolism of Early Christian and Byzantine Bread Stamps'' (Madison, University of Wisconsin Press). {{ISBN|0-299-05310-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-299-05310-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the 19th century, though some interesting examples exist in [[Assize of Bread and Ale|bread assizes]] and [[Subtlety|sotelties]].

== Examples ==
=== Sweet ===
Most forms of escagraphs today are sweet, either molded into or drawn onto the surface of the food.  Cakes with "Happy Birthday" are extremely common.  Heart-shaped candies&lt;ref name=NECCO&gt;'''Necco Sweatheart'''
New England Confectionery Company. http://www.necco.com&lt;/ref&gt; with mottoes on them have been produced since about 1901 and are often shared at [[Valentine's Day]].  Many chocolate bars bear the name of their maker imprinted on their surface.&lt;ref name=HERSHEY&gt;'''Hershey's Chocolate Bar with Almonds'''&lt;br&gt;
''[http://www.hersheys.com/ The Hershey Company]''  http://www.hersheys.com/happiness/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawful ===
Only a few lawful examples remain, since the bread assizes of the 15th century.  However, the [http://www/usda.gov/ United States Department of Agriculture] does mark&lt;ref name=USDA&gt;
'''USDA''' United States Department of Agriculture ''[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Inspection_&amp;_Grading/index.asp Inspection &amp; Grading - What Are The Differences?]'' http://www.usda.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; certain meat products with certifications and grades in an edible ink.

=== Moveable Type ===
From alphabet cookies to cereal to pasta, letters and moveable type are very common even today.  Throughout the western world, cookies shaped as letters are made both as edible toys and ostensibly to help children learn their letters.  Many manufacturers provide alphabet pasta letters (and numbers) in both ready-to-eat and dry forms.

* [[Aerobic exercise]] is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more [[oxygen]] than it would while resting.&lt;ref name="phy_active"/&gt; The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase [[cardiovascular]] [[endurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilmore J. |author2=Knuttgen H. | year = 2003 | title = Aerobic Exercise and Endurance Improving Fitness for Health Benefits | journal = The Physician and Sportsmedicine | volume = 31 | issue = 5| page = 45 | doi=10.3810/psm.2003.05.367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of aerobic exercise include [[running]], [[cycling]], [[human swimming|swimming]], brisk [[walking]], [[skipping rope]], [[rowing (sports)|rowing]], [[hiking]], playing [[tennis]], [[continuous training]], and [[long slow distance]] training.&lt;ref name="phy_active"/&gt;
* [[Anaerobic exercise]], which includes [[Strength training|strength]] and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and tone muscles, as well as improve bone strength, [[Balance (ability)|balance]], and [[Motor coordination|coordination]].&lt;ref name="phy_active"/&gt; Examples of strength moves are [[push-ups]], [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-ups]], [[Lunge (exercise)|lunges]], and [[bicep curls]] using dumbbells.&lt;ref name="phy_active"/&gt; Anaerobic exercise also include [[weight training]], [[functional training]], [[Eccentric Training|eccentric training]], [[interval training]], [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]], and [[high-intensity interval training]] increase short-term muscle strength.&lt;ref name="phy_active"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=De Vos N. |author2=Singh N. |author3=Ross D. |author4=Stavrinos T. | year = 2005 | title = Optimal Load for Increasing Muscle Power During Explosive Resistance Training in Older Adults | journal = The Journals of Gerontology | volume = 60A | issue = 5| pages = 638–647 | doi=10.1093/gerona/60.5.638}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Flexibility (anatomy)|Flexibility]] exercises stretch and lengthen [[muscle]]s.&lt;ref name="phy_active"/&gt; Activities such as [[stretching]] help to improve [[joint]] flexibility and keep muscles limber.&lt;ref name="phy_active"/&gt; The goal is to improve the [[range of motion]] which can reduce the chance of injury.&lt;ref name="phy_active"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Connor D. |author2=Crowe M. |author3=Spinks W. | year = 2005 | title = Effects of static stretching on leg capacity during cycling | journal = Turin | volume = 46 | issue = 1| pages = 52–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical exercise can also include training that focuses on [[accuracy]], [[Sport agility|agility]], [[human power|power]], and [[speed]].&lt;ref name="crossfit "&gt;{{cite web | url = http://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/CFJ-trial.pdf| accessdate = 12 September 2010 | title= What Is Fitness? | page = 4 | date = October 2002 | publisher = The CrossFit Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the terms 'dynamic' and 'static' are used.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} 'Dynamic' exercises such as steady running, tend to produce a lowering of the [[diastole|diastolic]] blood pressure during exercise, due to the improved blood flow. Conversely, static exercise (such as weight-lifting) can cause the [[systole (medicine)|systolic]] pressure to rise significantly, albeit transiently, during the performance of the exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1 March 2010|title=Intra-Arterial Blood Pressure Response in Hypertensive Subjects during Low- and High-Intensity Resistance Exercise|journal=Clinics|volume=65|issue=3|doi=10.1590/S1807-59322010000300006| pmc=2845767 |pmid=20360917|author=de Souza Nery S, Gomides RS, da Silva GV, de Moraes Forjaz CL, Mion D Jr, Tinucci T|pages=271–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

Physical exercise is important for maintaining [[physical fitness]] and can contribute to maintaining a healthy weight, regulating digestive health, building and maintaining healthy bone density, muscle strength, and joint mobility, promoting physiological well-being, reducing surgical risks, and strengthening the immune system. Some studies indicate that exercise may increase life expectancy and the overall quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gremeaux|first1=V|last2=Gayda|first2=M|last3=Lepers|first3=R|last4=Sosner|first4=P|last5=Juneau|first5=M|last6=Nigam|first6=A|title=Exercise and longevity.|journal=Maturitas|date=December 2012|volume=73|issue=4|pages=312–7|pmid=23063021|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2012.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who participate in moderate to high levels of physical exercise have a lower mortality rate compared to individuals who by comparison are not physically active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Physical Activity and Health|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZZPc1FmL7QC&amp;pg=PA3|journal=United States Department of Health|isbn=9781428927940|author1=Department Of Health And Human Services|first1=United States|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderate levels of exercise have been correlated with preventing aging by reducing inflammatory potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woods|first=Jeffrey A.|last2=Wilund|first2=Kenneth R.|last3=Martin|first3=Stephen A.|last4=Kistler|first4=Brandon M.|date=29 October 2011|title=Exercise, Inflammation and Aging|journal=[[Aging and Disease]]|volume=3|issue=1|pages=130–140|pmc=3320801|pmid=22500274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the benefits from exercise are achieved with around 3500 [[metabolic equivalent]] (MET) minutes per week.&lt;ref name=BMJ2016/&gt; For example, climbing stairs 10 minutes, vacuuming 15 minutes, gardening 20 minutes, running 20 minutes, and walking or bicycling for transportation 25 minutes on a daily basis would ''together'' achieve about 3000 MET minutes a week.&lt;ref name=BMJ2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyu|first1=Hmwe H|last2=Bachman|first2=Victoria F|last3=Alexander|first3=Lily T|last4=Mumford|first4=John Everett|last5=Afshin|first5=Ashkan|last6=Estep|first6=Kara|last7=Veerman|first7=J Lennert|last8=Delwiche|first8=Kristen|last9=Iannarone|first9=Marissa L|last10=Moyer|first10=Madeline L|last11=Cercy|first11=Kelly|last12=Vos|first12=Theo|last13=Murray|first13=Christopher J L|last14=Forouzanfar|first14=Mohammad H|title=Physical activity and risk of breast cancer, colon cancer, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and ischemic stroke events: systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=BMJ|date=9 August 2016|pages=i3857|doi=10.1136/bmj.i3857|pmid=27510511|pmc=4979358|volume=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of physical activity causes approximately 6% of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease, 7% of type 2 diabetes, 10% of breast cancer and 10% of colon cancer worldwide.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=I-Min|last2=Shiroma|first2=Eric J|last3=Lobelo|first3=Felipe|last4=Puska|first4=Pekka|last5=Blair|first5=Steven N|last6=Katzmarzyk|first6=Peter T|date=21 July 2012|title=Impact of Physical Inactivity on the World’s Major Non-Communicable Diseases|journal=Lancet|volume=380|issue=9838|pages=219–229|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61031-9|pmc=3645500|pmid=22818936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, physical inactivity causes 9% of premature mortality worldwide.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Early motor skills and development have also shown to be related to physical activity and performance later in life. Children who have more proficient motor skills early on are more inclined to being physically active, and thus tend to perform well in sports and have better fitness levels. Early motor proficiency has a positive correlation to childhood physical activity and fitness levels, while less proficiency in motor skills results in a tendency to partake in a more sedentary lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2006-0742 |pmid=17142498 |title=The Relationship Between Motor Proficiency and Physical Activity in Children |journal=Pediatrics |volume=118 |issue=6 |pages=e1758 |year=2006 |last1=Wrotniak |first1=B.

=== Cardiovascular system ===
{{Main|Cardiovascular fitness}}
The beneficial effect of exercise on the cardiovascular system is well documented. There is a direct correlation between physical inactivity and cardiovascular mortality, and physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. Low levels of physical exercise increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases mortality.&lt;ref name="aha2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/PhysicalActivity/FitnessBasics/American-Heart-Association-Recommendations-for-Physical-Activity-in-Adults_UCM_307976_Article.jsp#.Wu3boogvxnJ|title=American Heart Association Recommendations for Physical Activity in Adults|publisher=American Heart Association|date=14 December 2017|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who participate in physical exercise experience greater loss of body fat and increased cardiovascular fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lumeng | first1 = Julie C | year = 2006 | title = Small-group physical education classes result in important health benefits | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 148 | issue = 3| pages = 418–419 | doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2006.02.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that academic stress in youth increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in later years; however, these risks can be greatly decreased with regular physical exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahaneku|first=Joseph E.|last2=Nwosu|first2=Cosmas M.|last3=Ahaneku|first3=Gladys I.|date=2000|title=Academic Stress and Cardiovascular Health|journal=Academic Medicine|doi=10.1097/00001888-200006000-00002|volume=75|issue=6|pages=567–568}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a dose-response relation between the amount of exercise performed from approximately {{nowrap|700–2000}}&amp;nbsp;[[kcal]] of energy expenditure per week and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality in middle-aged and elderly populations. The greatest potential for reduced mortality is in the sedentary who become moderately active. Studies have shown that since heart disease is the leading cause of death in women, regular exercise in aging women leads to healthier cardiovascular profiles. Most beneficial effects of physical activity on cardiovascular disease mortality can be attained through moderate-intensity activity (40–60% of maximal oxygen uptake, depending on age). Persons who modify their behavior after myocardial infarction to include regular exercise have improved rates of survival. Persons who remain sedentary have the highest risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.94.4.857 |pmid=8772712 |title=Statement on Exercise: Benefits and Recommendations for Physical Activity Programs for All Americans: A Statement for Health Professionals by the Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the Council on Clinical Cardiology, American Heart Association |journal=Circulation |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=857–62 |year=1996 |last1=Fletcher |first1=G.

S |last9=Froelicher |first9=V. F |last10=Pina |first10=I. L |last11=Pollock |first11=M. L }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Heart Association, exercise reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]].&lt;ref name=aha2017/&gt;

=== Immune system ===
Although there have been hundreds of studies on physical exercise and the [[immune system]], there is little direct evidence on its connection to illness.&lt;ref name="Gleeson2007" /&gt; [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] evidence suggests that moderate exercise has a beneficial effect on the human [[immune system]]; an effect which is modeled in a [[J curve]]. Moderate exercise has been associated with a 29% decreased incidence of [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s (URTI), but studies of marathon runners found that their prolonged high-intensity exercise was associated with an increased risk of infection occurrence.&lt;ref name="Gleeson2007" /&gt; However, another study did not find the effect. Immune cell functions are impaired following acute sessions of prolonged, high-intensity exercise, and some studies have found that athletes are at a higher risk for infections. Studies have shown that strenuous stress for long durations, such as training for a marathon, can suppress the immune system by decreasing the concentration of lymphocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=C. C.|last2=Kapasi|first2=Z. F.|date=2002|title=The effect of exercise on the immune system|journal=Rehabilitation Oncology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immune systems of athletes and nonathletes are generally similar. Athletes may have slightly elevated [[natural killer cell]] count and cytolytic action, but these are unlikely to be clinically significant.&lt;ref name=Gleeson2007&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gleeson M | title = Immune function in sport and exercise | journal = J. Appl. Physiol. | volume = 103 | issue = 2 | pages = 693–9 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17303714 | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.00008.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitamin C supplementation has been associated with lower incidence of [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s in marathon runners.&lt;ref name=Gleeson2007/&gt;

[[Biomarker]]s of [[inflammation]] such as [[C-reactive protein]], which are associated with chronic diseases, are reduced in active individuals relative to sedentary individuals, and the positive effects of exercise may be due to its anti-inflammatory effects. In individuals with heart disease, exercise interventions lower blood levels of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein, an important cardiovascular risk marker.&lt;ref name=Swardfager2012&gt;{{cite journal | author = Swardfager W | title = Exercise intervention and inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis. | journal = Am. Heart J. | volume = 163 | issue = 4 | pages = 666–76 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22520533 | doi = 10.1016/j.ahj.2011.12.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The depression in the immune system following acute bouts of exercise may be one of the mechanisms for this anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;ref name=Gleeson2007/&gt;

=== Cancer ===

A systematic review evaluated 45 studies that examined the relationship between physical activity and cancer survival rates. According to the review, "[there] was consistent evidence from 27 observational studies that physical activity is associated with reduced all-cause, breast cancer–specific, and colon cancer–specific mortality. There is currently insufficient evidence regarding the association between physical activity and mortality for survivors of other cancers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ballard-Barbash R, Friedenreich CM, Courneya KS, Siddiqi SM, McTiernan A, Alfano CM | year = 2012 | title = Physical Activity, Biomarkers, and Disease Outcomes in Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review | journal = JNCI Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 104 | issue = 11| pages = 815–840 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djs207 | pmid=22570317 | pmc=3465697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is only limited scientific evidence on the subject, people with [[cancer cachexia]] are encouraged to engage in physical exercise.&lt;ref name="pmid26401466"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grande AJ, Silva V, Maddocks M | title = Exercise for cancer cachexia in adults: Executive summary of a Cochrane Collaboration systematic review | journal = Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 208–11 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26401466 | pmc = 4575551 | doi = 10.1002/jcsm.12055 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to various factors, some individuals with cancer cachexia have a limited capacity for physical exercise.&lt;ref name="pmid29891116"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sadeghi M, Keshavarz-Fathi M, Baracos V, Arends J, Mahmoudi M, Rezaei N | title = Cancer cachexia: Diagnosis, assessment, and treatment | journal = Crit.

Inappropriate exercise can do more harm than good, with the definition of “inappropriate” varying according to the individual. For many activities, especially [[running]] and [[cycling]], there are significant injuries that occur with poorly regimented exercise schedules.

In extreme instances, over-exercising induces serious performance loss.

One result of detrimental overtraining is suppressed immune function, with an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).

Stopping excessive exercise suddenly may create a change in mood. Exercise should be controlled by each body's inherent limitations. While one set of joints and muscles may have the tolerance to withstand multiple [[marathons]], another body may be damaged by 20 minutes of light jogging. This must be determined for each individual.

Too much exercise may cause a woman to cease menstruation, a symptom known as [[amenorrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/717390_5|title = The Female Athlete Triad|website = Medscape.com|last = Furia|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skeletal muscle===

In addition to BDNF, the actions of IGF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (54) are considered essential for the angiogenic and neurogenic effects of exercise in the brain. Although the action of exercise on brain angiogenesis has been known for many years (10), it is not until recently that neurovascular adaptations in the hippocampus have been associated with cognitive function (29). Exercise enhances the proliferation of brain endothelial cells throughout the brain (113), hippocampal IGF gene expression (47), and serum levels of both IGF (178) and VEGF (63). IGF-1 and VEGF, apparently produced in the periphery, support exercise induced neurogenesis and angiogenesis, as corroborated by blocking the effects of exercise using antibodies against IGF-1 (47) or VEGF (63).| isbn = 9780470650714 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cerebral hemodynamics and AD"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarumi T, Zhang R | title = Cerebral hemodynamics of the aging brain: risk of Alzheimer disease and benefit of aerobic exercise | journal = Front Physiol | volume = 5 | pages = 6 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24478719 | pmc = 3896879 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2014.00006 | quote = Exercise-related improvements in brain function and structure may be conferred by the concurrent adaptations in vascular function and structure. Aerobic exercise increases the peripheral levels of growth factors (e.g., BDNF, IFG-1, and VEGF) which cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and stimulate neurogenesis and angiogenesis (Trejo et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Fabel et al., 2003; Lopez-Lopez et al., 2004). Consistent with this, exercise-related enlargement of hippocampus was accompanied by increases in cerebral blood volume and capillary densities (Pereira et al., 2007). Enhanced cerebral perfusion may not only facilitate the delivery of energy substrates, but also lower the risk of vascular-related brain damages, including WMH and silent infarct (Tseng et al., 2013). Furthermore, regular aerobic exercise is associated with lower levels of Aβ deposition in individuals with APOE4 positive (Head et al., 2012), which may also reduce the risk of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and microbleeds (Poels et al., 2010).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overweight children who participate in physical exercise experience greater loss of body fat and increased cardiovascular fitness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, children and adolescents should do 60 minutes or more of physical activity each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/physicalactivity/guidelines.htm|title=Youth Physical Activity Guidelines|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing physical exercise in the school system and ensuring an environment in which children can reduce barriers to maintain a healthy lifestyle is essential.

The [[European Commission]]'s Directorate General for Education and Culture (DG EAC) has dedicated programs and funds for [[Health Enhancing Physical Activity]] projects&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/sport/policy/societal-role/health-participation_en&lt;/ref&gt; within its [[Horizon 2020]] and [[Erasmus+]] program, as research showed that too many Europeans are not physically active enough.  Financing is available for increased collaboration between players active in this field across the EU and around the world, the promotion of HEPA in the EU and its partner countries and the [[European Sports Week]].  The DG EAC regularly publishes a [[Eurobarometer]] on sport and physical activity.

== Exercise trends ==
[[File:Woman running barefoot on beach.jpg|thumb|[[Running]] has become a popular form of exercise.]]
{{Main|Exercise trends}}
Worldwide there has been a large shift towards less physically demanding work.&lt;ref name=WHO2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/facts/obesity/en/ |title=WHO: Obesity and overweight |work=World Health Organization |accessdate=10 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218104805/http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/facts/obesity/en/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been accompanied by increasing use of mechanized transportation, a greater prevalence of labor saving technology in the home, and fewer active [[recreational pursuits]].&lt;ref name=WHO2009/&gt; [[Exercise trends#Solutions to address the lack of exercise|Personal lifestyle changes]] however can correct the lack of physical exercise.

Research in 2015 indicates integrating [[mindfulness]] to physical exercise interventions increases exercise adherence, self-efficacy and also has positive effects both psychologically and physiologically.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kennedy AB, Resnick PB |

===Social and cultural variation===
Exercising looks different in every country, as do the motivations behind exercising.&lt;ref name="Fitness for Foreigners"/&gt; In some countries, people exercise primarily indoors, and in others, people primarily [[Outdoor fitness|exercise outdoors]]. People may exercise for personal enjoyment, health and well-being, social interactions, competition or training, etc. These differences could potentially be attributed to geographic location, social tendencies, or otherwise.

In Colombia, citizens value and celebrate the outdoor environments of their country. In many instances, they utilize outdoor activities as social gatherings to enjoy nature and their communities. In Bogotá, Colombia, a 70-mile stretch of road known as the Ciclovía is shut down each Sunday for bicyclists, runners, rollerbladers, skateboarders and other exercisers to work out and enjoy their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Javier|title=Car-Free Streets, a Colombian Export, Inspire Debate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/nyregion/24streets.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Ciclov%C3%ADa&amp;st=cse|website=NY Times|publisher=NY Times|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to Colombia, citizens of Cambodia tend to exercise socially outside. In this country, public gyms have become quite popular. People will congregate at these outdoor gyms not only to utilize the public facilities, but also to organize aerobics and dance sessions, which are open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Nicky|title=Gyms|url=https://www.travelfish.org/sight_profile/cambodia/phnom_penh_and_surrounds/phnom_penh/phnom_penh/2235|website=Travel Fish|publisher=Travel Fish|accessdate=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden has also begun developing outdoor gyms, called ''utegym''. These gyms are free to the public and are often placed in beautiful, picturesque environments. People will swim in rivers, use boats, and run through forests to stay healthy and enjoy the natural world around them. This is especially possible in Sweden due to its geographical location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tatlow|first1=Anita|title=When in Sweden...making the most of the great outdoors!|url=http://www.stockholmonashoestring.com/when-in-sweden-making-the-most-of-the-great-outdoors/|website=Stockholm on a Shoestring|publisher=Stockholm on a Shoestring|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese exercise, particularly in the retired community, seems to be socially grounded. In the mornings, dances are held in public parks; these gatherings may include Latin dancing, ballroom dancing, tango, or even the jitterbug. Dancing in public allows people to interact with those with whom they would not normally interact, allowing for both health benefits and social benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langfitt|first1=Frank|title=Beijing's Other Games: Dancing In The Park|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93503524|website=National Public Radio|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sociocultural variations in physical exercise show how people in different geographic locations and social climates have varying motivations and methods of exercising. Physical exercise can improve health and well-being, as well as enhance community ties and appreciation of natural beauty.&lt;ref name="Fitness for Foreigners"/&gt;

== Nutrition and recovery ==
Proper [[nutrition]] is as important to health as exercise. When exercising, it becomes even more important to have a good diet to ensure that the body has the correct ratio of [[Macronutrient (nutrition)|macronutrients]] while providing ample [[micronutrient]]s, in order to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kimber N. |author2=Heigenhauser G. |author3=Spriet L. |author4=Dyck D. | year = 2003 | title = Skeletal muscle fat and carbohydrate metabolism during recovery from glycogen-depleting exercise in humans | journal = American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine | volume = 548 | issue = 3| pages = 919–927 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2002.031179|pmc=2342904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active recovery is recommended after participating in physical exercise because it removes [[lactic acid|lactate]] from the blood more quickly than inactive recovery. Removing lactate from circulation allows for an easy decline in body temperature, which can also benefit the immune system, as an individual may be vulnerable to minor illnesses if the body temperature drops too abruptly after physical exercise.&lt;ref name="pmid16195010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reilly T, Ekblom B | title = The use of recovery methods post-exercise | journal = J.

== History ==
{{See also|Aerobic exercise#History|Fitness culture}}
The benefits of exercise have been known since antiquity. Dating back to 65 BCE, it was [[Cicero|Marcus Cicero]], Roman politician and lawyer, who stated: "It is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inspirational-quotes-and-quotations.com/quotes-about-exercise.html |title=Quotes About Exercise Top 10 List }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise was also seen to be valued later in history during the [[Early Middle Ages]] as a means of survival by the [[Germanic peoples]] of Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/history.html|title=History of Fitness|website=www.unm.edu|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, exercise was regarded as a beneficial force in the 19th century. After 1860, Archibald MacLaren opened a gymnasium at the University of Oxford and instituted a training regimen for 12 military officials at the university. This regimen was later assimilated into the training of the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/physical-culture#toc249304|title=physical culture|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several mass exercise movements were started in the early twentieth century as well. The first and most significant of these in the UK was the Women's League of Health and Beauty, founded in 1930 by [[Mary Bagot Stack]], that had 166,000 members in 1937.&lt;ref name=FitnessLeague&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fitness League History |url=http://www.thefitnessleague.com/about-us/the-fitness-league-history |website=The Fitness League |accessdate=8 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729135514/http://www.thefitnessleague.com/about-us/the-fitness-league-history |archivedate=29 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between physical health and exercise (or lack of it) was further established in 1949 and reported in 1953 by a team led by [[Jerry Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|title=The man who invented exercise|newspaper=Financial Times|date=11 September 2009|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e6ff90ea-9da2-11de-9f4a-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris1953"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris JN, Heady JA, Raffle PA, Roberts CG, Parks JW | title = Coronary heart-disease and physical activity of work | journal = Lancet | volume = 265 | issue = 6795 | pages = 1053–7 | year = 1953 | pmid = 13110049 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(53)90665-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Morris noted that men of similar social class and occupation (bus conductors versus bus drivers) had markedly different rates of heart attacks, depending on the level of exercise they got: bus drivers had a sedentary occupation and a higher incidence of heart disease, while bus conductors were forced to move continually and had a lower incidence of heart disease.&lt;ref name="Morris1953"/&gt;

{{distinguish|Functional medicine}}
A '''functional disorder''' is a [[medical condition]] that impairs normal functioning of bodily processes that remains largely undetected under examination, dissection or even under a microscope. At the exterior, there is no appearance of abnormality.  This stands in contrast to a '''structural disorder''' (in which some part of the body can be seen to be abnormal) or a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic disorder]] (in which symptoms are caused by psychological or psychiatric illness). Definitions vary somewhat between fields of medicine.

Generally, the mechanism that causes a functional disorder is unknown, poorly understood, or occasionally unimportant for treatment purposes. The brain or nerves are often believed to be involved. It is common that a person with one functional disorder will have others.

==Status==
Whether a given medical condition is termed a ''functional disorder'' depends in part on the state of knowledge.  Some diseases, including [[epilepsy]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[migraine]] headaches were once considered functional disorders, but are no longer generally classified that way.&lt;ref name="isbn0-300-07401-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Natelson, Benjamin H. |title=Facing and fighting fatigue: a practical approach |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1998 |pages=33 |isbn=0-300-07401-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2431">Serbia had the second-highest mortality in Europe, at 709 per 100,000 population in 2015.

==History==
The Institute of Public Health of Serbia was first established in 1919, when it was called the Ministerial Commission for Epidemiology. In 1945, it was called the Central Institute of Hygiene and encompassed the Federal Institute of Hygiene, the Institute of Epidemiology, and the Institute of Bacteriology and Epidemiology. It changed its name to the Institute of Public Health of Serbia in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Institute of Public Health of Serbia |url=http://www.ianphi.org/membercountries/memberinformation/serbia.html |website=IANPHI |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
Expenditure on health in Serbia was 10.4% of [[GDP]] in 2014, US$1,312 per capita. 

Life expectancy at birth was estimated at 74 years for men in 2016 and 79 for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Serbia |url=https://www.who.int/countries/wsm/en/ |accessdate=24 November 2018 |publisher=WHO |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infant mortality]] dropped from 14.4 per 1000 live births in 1991 to 11.0 in 2000 and 7.0 in 2010, but for [[Romani people]] living in the urban slums it was 3 times the national average in 2006.

The leading causes of death are chronic non-communicable diseases.

'''IPC Healthcare''' ({{NASDAQ|IPCM}}), previously known as '''IPC The Hospitalist Company''', is a publicly traded corporation which operates a national physician group practice focused on the delivery of [[hospital medicine]] and related facility-based services. IPC providers manage the care of patients in coordination with primary care physicians and specialists in over 1,900 facilities in 28 states across the U.S.&lt;ref name="hospitalist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalist.com/|title=IPC: The Hospitalist Company|publisher=hospitalist.com|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The company name is derived from an earlier company called '''I'''n-'''P'''atient '''C'''onsultants Management, Inc. and the [[NASDAQ]] ticker name was changed to IPCM in 2008.&lt;ref name="nasdaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/reference/200803/market_close_033108.stm#|title=IPC The Hospitalist Company, Inc. &amp;#91;IPCM&amp;#93; - 03/31/2008|publisher=nasdaq.com|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company changed its name to IPC Healthcare in January 2015.&lt;ref name="IPC Healthcare"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalist.com/media-center/releases/press-release-20150107.htm|title=IPC Healthcare|publisher=hospitalist.com|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Dean Singer (born in Los Angeles on April 20, 1960) has been director, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of IPC since he founded the company in 1995, and in 2006, was designated as the [[Chief Medical Officer]]. In 1991, Singer acquired a private practice in pulmonary medicine that shortly thereafter merged with two other pulmonary physicians to become part of Consultants For Lung Disease, Inc.&lt;ref name="hospitalist2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospitalist.com/about/management-team/|title=IPC: The Hospitalist Company &amp;raquo; About Us &amp;raquo; Management Team|publisher=hospitalist.com|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company disclosed that on June 7, 2010, it received a civil investigative demand (CID) issued by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ), [[U.S. Attorney's Office]] for the [[Northern District of Illinois]]. The CID requested information concerning claims that IPC had submitted to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]].&lt;ref name="faqs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/111027/IPC-The-Hospitalist-Company-Inc_10-Q/R12.htm#ixzz1zckbgJj8|title=IPC The Hospitalist Company, Inc. - FORM 10-Q - XML - IDEA: XBRL DOCUMENT - October 27, 2011|author=advameg.com|publisher=faqs.org|accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[US Justice Department]] joined a "[[whistleblower]]" lawsuit against IPC, alleging that IPC physicians sought payment for higher and more expensive levels of medical service than were actually performed – a practice commonly referred to as "upcoding".  Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that IPC encouraged its physicians to bill at the highest levels regardless of the level of service provided, trained physicians to use higher level codes and encouraged physicians with lower billing levels to "catch up" to their peers.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/December/13-civ-1294.html|title=USDOJ: Government Intervenes in False Claims Lawsuit Against Ipc the Hospitalist Co.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31730">'''[[Integrated urban water management]] (IUWM) in [[Buenos Aires]]''' is not unlike many large urban areas in Latin America where in past decades, more focus was placed on just a few sectors or perhaps only one sector. The water management philosophy in Buenos Aires has evolved to one that is integrating efforts in reducing water pollution, improving [[stormwater]] management, adding [[drainage]] infrastructure, and improving water supply and sanitation (WSS). Primary challenges in urban water management continue to be flood control and stormwater management as Buenos Aires is situated in the low-lying [[pampas]] region where heavy rain is expected all year long. Adding to the challenges, [[urbanization]] has outpaced planning and development in the various water sectors. Efforts have been made to control the major tributaries of [[Río de la Plata]] such as channelizing and building culverts into urban rivers, however, this has increased flooding as the natural meander and saturating ability of the rivers have been lost. Rapid urbanization and very large quantities of industrial discharge have also caused severe contamination of the water basins that Buenos Aires is built upon. The [[Matanza River|Matanza-Riachuelo river (MR)]], a tributary of the Río de la Plata (La Plata River), is a prime example and has become the most contaminated basin in [[Argentina]].

In response to water pollution and flooding challenges, the Government of Argentina (GoA) is working with the [[World Bank]] to address industrial water pollution by providing technical assistance and mentoring to the 50 worst industrial polluters which represent 95% of the total [[effluent]].&lt;ref name="Matanza"/&gt; Oversight and monitoring is provided by the Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin Authority (ACUMAR). The Urban Flood Prevention and Drainage Program (APL) is the government's commitment to flood prevention and risk management and falls within the framework of the Buenos Aires Hydraulic Master Plan. The "Master Plan" focuses on implementing non-structural measures throughout the entire city.

Recent history in Buenos Aires urban water management is notable for its move to [[privatization]] of the water and sanitation systems. Signed in 1992, the Buenos Aires water concession was a unique example of water privatization on a large urban scale for its rapid implementation. The concession handed control of water and [[sanitation]] systems to the French company [[Suez (company)|Suez S.A.]]. Generating controversy for its size, the privatization was successful in that improvements were made to water and service coverage while efficiencies were gained within the water company itself. Additionally, a near 27% reduction in water tariffs quickly followed after the signing of the concession.&lt;ref name="WaterConcession"/&gt; After a renegotiation of terms in 1997 that generated wide criticism, the concession was canceled in 2006. Water and sewer provisions in the Buenos Aires Metro Area (BAMA) have since been handled by a conglomerate of companies called Water of Greater Buenos Aires (''Aguas del Gran Buenos Aires'').

==Economic and social conditions==
Argentina enjoyed four years of rapid recovery from the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|economic and social crisis of 2001-02]], which was one of the most severe losses of income and downturns in living standards on record. Effective [[macroeconomic]] management, focused on the generation of primary fiscal surpluses, has helped to sustain this strong performance. Consequently, average [[real GDP]] increased by nearly 9% per year between 2003 and 2006, surpassing the maximum GDP reached in 1998. Poverty and [[unemployment]] have fallen substantially from their peaks during the economic crisis. Poverty has declined to about 31% from a high of over 57% in 2002, while unemployment fell to near 11% from 21% in 2003.&lt;ref name="WBPID2"&gt;{{cite web

The period in Argentina between 1990 and 1993 was a time of transition away from social policies, government support devices, and welfare systems to an IMF-backed structural adjustment in economic and market policies. During this time, crime became a serious problem with the creation of an informal criminal economy that sought to take advantage of a lack of economic authority. Crime rates rose 286% between 1992 and 1995 and in 1995 the former President, [[Carlos Menem]] was re-elected with international praise for achieving low inflation, privatizing state-run companies and the currency peg to the dollar. Crime has continued to grow as a considerable social concern in the aftermath of the 2001 recession and a reversal of the currency peg where [[hyperinflation]] ensued. Consequently, the arms and drug trade has flourished and slums in Buneos Aires grew by 114% during the 1990s to around 113,000 people. These slums lack basic public services and law enforcement, and have become safe havens for criminal activities.&lt;ref name="BNET"&gt;{{cite web

The Matanza-Riachuelo river (MR) basin is home to Argentina’s largest concentrations of urban poor. Of the approximately 3.5 million inhabitants in the basin, 1.2 million live below the poverty line. An estimated 10 percent of the total population in the MR Basin lives in informal settlements, often in flood-prone areas and/or near open garbage dumps. The poorest populations living alongside the river are in constant contact with numerous contaminants ranging from untreated organic waste to toxic industrial chemicals.&lt;ref name="WBPID"/&gt;

==Geography and climate==
Buenos Aires lies in the [[Pampa|pampa region]] of Argentina and is bordered on the eastern and north-east sides by the [[Río de la Plata]], on the south and southeast side by the [[Matanza River|Riachuelo]] and to the northwest, west and Southwest by the Avenida General Paz, which is a long highway that separates the [[Buenos Aires Province]] from the city.

The region was formerly transected by small tributaries and some lagoons, some of which were refilled and others piped. Among the most important small tributary basins are the Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, Cildañez and White. In 1908 many of these tributaries were channelized as floods damaged the city's infrastructure. Beginning in 1919, most creeks were enclosed. Notably, the Maldonado was re-engineered in 1954 to flow underground in tubes and currently runs underneath Juan B. Justo Avenue.

The city has a [[humid subtropical climate]] and the average annual temperature is {{convert|17.6|°C|°F}}. The city gets {{convert|1147|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year. Rain can be expected at any time of year with March being the wettest month (5.3&amp;nbsp;inches) and June the driest month (2.5&amp;nbsp;inches).&lt;ref name="WMO"&gt;{{cite web

==The Buenos Aires water concession of 1992==

{{See also|Water privatization in Argentina}}

The signing of the Buenos Aires water and sanitation concession in 1992 attracted worldwide attention and was the source of considerable controversy for its scale of private participation in the Argentine water and sanitation sector. In addition to being one of the world's largest water concessions, the Buenos Aires concession has remained interesting for a number of other reasons. First, the rapid implementation of the Buenos Aires concession contrasted with the slow movement towards private participation in other large urban water systems, such as [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] or [[Lima]]. Second, the reform was widely acclaimed for generating major improvements in the water and sanitation sectors, including wider coverage, better service, more efficient operation of the company, and a reduction in waste. What makes these improvements especially striking is the immediate 26.9 percent reduction in [[water tariff]]s that followed the signing. Finally, the Buenos Aires case is of interest because the contract was renegotiated in 1997, provoking criticisms of the original bid and the regulation. More recently, the concession was revoked in 2006 and remained under arbitration in 2008.&lt;ref name="WaterConcession"&gt;{{cite web

===Water supply===
Over most of its history, Buenos Aires has remained a city with a quality water supply delivered by the immense [[Río de la Plata]] and surrounding high plains that have abundant high quality groundwater below them. In the outskirts of the city, the inhabitants have good access to wells and piped water.&lt;ref name="Graciela"&gt;{{cite journal

'''Surface Water''':
The La Plata sub-basin's catchment area is 130,200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and constitutes (4.2%) of the world’s fifth largest river basin – the La Plata, extending over 3.1 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, five countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), almost 50 major cities, and supporting over 100 million inhabitants. The mouth of the La Plata River is 230&amp;nbsp;km wide and separates Argentina from Uruguay.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate= 2-15-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main watercourses that form the base structure for the region’s drainage network are the Luján, Reconquista, and Matanza-Riachuelo Rivers. The Luján River, 128&amp;nbsp;km, has the largest catchment area of nearly 3,300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and runs from southeast-northeast before discharging into the La Plata River. The Reconquista River is 82&amp;nbsp;km long, drains a catchment of 1,738&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (the lower 40% includes urban and semi-urban populations), and discharges into the Luján River. The Matanza-Riachuelo River (known as Riachuelo from its lower catchment) is 510&amp;nbsp;km long and eventually discharges into the La Plata River.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

'''Groundwater''':
Over many decades a significant proportion of the water-supply of the Buenos Aires Metro Area (BAMA) was obtained from three major groundwater reservoirs found at different depths, quantities and qualities. The Pampeano, Puelches, and the Parana account for these three reservoirs of groundwater and reached their pinnacle of use in the late 1980s. At that time BAMA underwent a switch from groundwater to imported surface water which has led to groundwater levels to rise to the point of frequent flooding because of the close proximity of the water level to the surface.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite web

===Drinking water===
Aguas y Saneamientos Argentinos (AySA) is the primary water service provider in the metropolitan area serving the city of Buenos Aires and 17 municipalities, while Aguas Bonaerenses serves the remaining municipalities. Almost 95% of the water supply comes from the La Plata River (4,442,065 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day), while the rest is extracted from the ground (231,416 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day) and is treated at one of three plants. AySA is building two additional water treatment plants that will increase daily capacity by 947,040 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

===Stormwater and drainage===
Due to rapid urbanization, topographic elements, and the occurrence of severe storm events in Buenos Aires, flooding has become one of the most serious problems affecting the normal life of Buenos Aires citizens. Extensive and frequent damage to urban, commercial, and industrial infrastructure is also prevalent. The continuous increase in the degree of impermeable surfaces (only 10% of the city is open and green space) in the city has altered normal functioning of the stormwater drainage network. Today, the system cannot adequately convey the stormwater runoff generated after a storm.&lt;ref name="Aradas"&gt;{{cite web 
|url= http://www.ciwem.org/groups/wapug/aradas.pdf

Each of the three most important catchments (Maldonado, Medrano and Vega) are drained by a large drainage pipe that follows in the direction of the former watercourses. Typical dimensions range from 15&amp;nbsp;m to 20&amp;nbsp;m wide and 3&amp;nbsp;m to 4&amp;nbsp;m high with an internal supporting structure of columns and beams that results in interference of stormwater flow and can cause back up and increased flooding. The city counts approximately 1400&amp;nbsp;km (870&amp;nbsp;mi.) of stormwater conveyance covering an area of 30,000&amp;nbsp;ha (74,000 acres) with 7,000 sub-catchments structures, 12,000 street-level storm drains, and 6,000 sewer drains.&lt;ref name="Aradas"/&gt;

===Wastewater treatment===
AySA has four wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) that currently treat only 5.3% of wastewater before discharging it into the La Plata River. To improve this situation, AySA is in the midst of constructing another wastewater treatment plant Del Bicentenario, which will increase the City’s treatment capacity by 120,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per hour (current output is 2,249,494&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day).&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==Water challenges==

===Pollution===
The Matanza-Riachuelo river (MR), a tributary of the Río de la Plata (La Plata River), is the most contaminated river basin in Argentina and considered one of the most polluted water bodies in the world. Pollution levels in Buenos Aires’ rivers are so high that they have been considered “open sewers”, making pollution the greatest environmental risk for the metropolitan area.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; Pollution levels have increased steadily as [[urbanization]] and industrial growth have continuously increased in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires. It is estimated that more than 4,000 industrial facilities are located in the lower and middle sections of the basin. Almost all of these industries discharge untreated [[effluents]] into the drainage system or directly into the MR River. In addition to high levels of [[Organic compound|organic pollution]], these discharges contribute toxic contaminants such as heavy metals from petrochemical industries, tanneries, and meat processing facilities. More specifically, the Riacheuleo has levels of Lead, Zinc and Chrome 50 times higher than the legal limit in Argentina; 25% is from industrial sewage and waste, while the remaining 75% originates from domestic sources.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt; The sudden onset of environmental and social degradation of the MR basin has resulted from limited investment in public infrastructure, poor environmental management, lack of adequate urban and industrial planning, and limited public infrastructure investment.&lt;ref name="WBPID"/&gt;

===Flooding and drainage===
Flooding is the most prominent natural hazard in Argentina, and along with the [[littoral]] provinces, Buenos Aires is a very high risk area. Across the country, an according to 1998 statistics from Swiss-Re, Argentina ranks 18th in the world in potential flood losses, in excess of US$3 billion in 1998.  Argentina is also one of 14 countries whose potential losses from floods are greater than 1 percent of GDP.&lt;ref name="WBPID"/&gt; Specifically in Buenos Aires, flooding occurs on average about twice per year. These floods are due to two causes: the condition of the drainage network, and strong winds from the southeast, (''sudestadas''), which produce a rise of the Rio de la Plata high above its average. Its waters then spill over the land, flooding the coastal areas inhabited by the poor. From the topographical standpoint, the City of Buenos Aires and its suburbs are located in a periphery of rolling grasslands, characterized by its limited slope toward the Rio de la Plata. The area was originally carved by small watercourses that either drain into the Rio de la Plata or in the two most important bodies of water in the area: the Reconquista and Matanza-Riachuelo. All of the watercourses have the special characteristics of a plain region: short water courses with little permanent flow, irregular routes, and broad flood valleys. The layout of the watercourses defines flood-prone areas, where flooding of the following tributary areas often occurs. The Maldonado (covering 5,050 hectares in Buenos Aires), Medrano, (covering 2,050 ha in Buenos Aires and 4,600 in total); White-Vega (covering 1,777 ha); and Cildáñez are important basins covering Buneos Aires.&lt;ref name="Hilda"&gt;{{cite web

===Institutional weakness===
The 1992 Buenos Aires water concession was meant to attract private companies who could bring the needed infrastructure and service upgrades; however, growth of service networks has been lower than planned, particularly in low-income sectors of metropolitan Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="ECLAC"/&gt; Governance issues, institutional weaknesses and lack of control mechanisms are responsible for the failure of the Buenos Aires water concession.&lt;ref name="ECLAC"&gt;{{cite web

==Response to challenges==

[[File:River Plate.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of [[Río de la Plata]]]]

===Pollution===
The Government of Argentina (GoA) with World Bank assistance has aimed to reduce industrial wastewater discharge (organic as well as toxic effluents) that directly enter the MR River. Over the next 15–20 years these efforts will contribute to the environmental recovery of the river. They will focus on the 50 main industrial polluters that contribute ~95% of the total industrial organic load (approximately 70 percent of the total organic load) discharged to the MR River and a further 170 industries with the highest toxic load currently discharged into the MR River. A combination of technical assistance to improve monitoring, control, and enforcement by the MR Basin Authority will be instituted. The idea is to help in collecting baseline data and carry out diagnostic exercises. Support will be provided for private sector investments in pollution control and cleaner production processes, targeting small-to-medium enterprises ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]) that typically pollute more per unit of output and have weaker financial and technical capacity to comply with environmental regulations.&lt;ref name="Matanza"&gt;{{cite web

===Flooding and drainage===
The Urban Flood Prevention and Drainage Program (APL) is the result of a government commitment to flood prevention and risk management. The program places emphasis on risk prevention, and developing a strategy that guides targeted Provinces from protection to a full risk management scheme.  This program targets urban areas from the most exposed provinces at a cost of US$200 million. The first phase of this project was directed towards the City of Buenos Aires where a portion of the funding was a $130 million direct loan from the World Bank. Overall government strategy beginning in 1992 has aimed at evolving from a disaster response to a risk prevention approach, introducing a water basin approach and strengthening of the institutions. The program is being implemented within the framework of the Buenos Aires Hydraulic Master Plan, which involves the entire city in implementing non-structural measures and then the Maldonado Basin for the first stage of the structural measures. Planned investments will benefit about 500,000 people over an area that suffers losses estimated at US$50 million annually.&lt;ref name="WBPID"&gt;{{cite web

===Legal initiatives===
Law 26128 was approved in 2006 by the National Congress of Argentina and created MR River Basin Authority (ACUMAR). Law 26128 also designated the Secretary of Environment to be the acting authority. Law 26128 was a result of the GoA giving a high priority to the environmental and social recovery of the MR basin. Additionally, this recently passed legislation is a response to the lack of a strong institutional framework.&lt;ref name="Matanza"/&gt;

In 2004, a group of residents living in the CMR area filed a claim against the national government, the Province of Buenos Aires, the government of Buenos Aires, and 44 businesses for damages suffered as a result of pollution from the Matanza-Riachuelo River. The lawsuit resulted in a landmark decision from the Supreme Court in 2008, which ruled on the side of the residents and determined that the defendants were liable for restoration 
and future prevention of environmental damage in the river basin. The Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN) participated in the case as a third party, along with various other civil society organizations. Throughout the entire process, FARN played a vital role in analyzing the defendants’ submissions, 
submitting briefs and "amparos" (claims of constitutional violations), and coordinated the efforts of the different organizations. Since the ruling, in which the Supreme Court named FARN as a "permanent independent monitoring body for Riachuelo cleanup," the organization has maintained its leadership role.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

===Tariffs and reinvestment===
AySA’s tariff system is based on a fixed rate plus metered consumption system. The rate structure classifies users according to category (residential or nonresidential), the zone where the building is located, and the services provided; sewer services cost twice the amount of the fixed fee for drinking water service; finally, low-income customers are eligible for a subsidy. As of 2007, only 12.8% of the connections were 
billed under a metering system, thereby encouraging relatively high consumption.&lt;ref name="AABA"/&gt; In 2010, AySA collected US$103,478,000 from users and re-invested US$195,144,000. AySA’s users are 88% residential (the majority of which are concentrated in the lowest socio-economic strata), 10.8% nonresidential, and 1.2% 
unowned land.&lt;ref name="AABA"&gt;{{cite web

==Multi-lateral assistance==
In the mid-1990s, the government completed a comprehensive MR Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and received a US$250 million [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) loan to help finance implementation of the EMP objectives. However, 12 years after the beginning of the project, the IDB had only disbursed US$10 million, and is only now committing another US$90 million for urgent clean-up activities (the remaining balance having been long reallocated). The Government of Argentina (GoA) concluded that the lack of an adequate institutional and legal framework to coordinate the involvement of different government jurisdictions has been a major obstacle to implementing the EMP.&lt;ref name="Matanza"/&gt;

The [[World Bank]] is engaged with the GoA in a multi-phase US$840 million project with the following objectives (i) improve sewerage services in the MR River Basin and other parts of the Province and City of Buenos Aires by expanding transport and treatment capacity; (ii) support a reduction of industrial discharges to the MR River, through the provision of industrial conversion grants to small and medium enterprises; (iii) promote improved decision-making for environmentally sustainable land use and drainage planning, and to pilot urban drainage and land use investments, in the M-R River Basin; and (iv) strengthen ACUMAR’s institutional framework for ongoing and sustainable clean-up of the MR River Basin.&lt;ref name="MR Basin"&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Jose Ingenieros - ca 1915.jpg|thumb|José Ingenieros]]
'''José Ingenieros''' (born '''Giuseppe Ingegnieri''', April 24, 1877{{spaced ndash}}October 31, 1925) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]]  physician, pharmacist, [[Positivism|positivist]]  philosopher and essayist. 

He was born in [[Palermo]] ([[Italy]]), and graduated from the [[University of Buenos Aires]] School of Medicine in 1900. Ingenieros was philosophically influenced by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Auguste Comte]], and wrote a very important philosophical and social work, "El hombre mediocre" (''The Mediocre Man''), in 1913. Ingenieros founded the [[Buenos Aires]] Institute of [[Criminology]] in 1907 and the Argentine Psychological Society in 1908; he was elected President of the Argentine Medical Association in 1909.

Ingenieros married Eva Rutenberg, in [[Lausanne]], in 1914. Appointed Assistant Dean of the School of Philosophy and Letters of his alma mater, he played a prominent role in the landmark [[University reform in Argentina]], in 1918. He resigned his academic posts in 1919 to join ''Claridad'', a [[communist]] organization, and in 1922, formed ''Unión Latinoamerica'', a [[political action committee]] focused on [[anti-imperialism]]. He was an active Freemason since 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logiamazzini.org.ar/masones_ilustres_argentinos.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922004533/http://www.logiamazzini.org.ar/masones_ilustres_argentinos.htm |archivedate=2013-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded a monthly, ''Renovación'', in 1925, but died in [[Buenos Aires]] later that year.

The '''Kerr-McGee Corporation''', founded in 1929, was an American energy company involved in [[oil exploration]], production of [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[perchlorate]] and [[uranium mining]] and milling in various countries. On June 23, 2006, [[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation]] acquired Kerr-McGee in an all-cash transaction totaling $16.5 billion plus $2.6 billion in debt and all operations moved from their base in [[Oklahoma]], United States.

==History==
The company later known as Kerr-McGee was founded in 1929 as Anderson &amp; Kerr Drilling Company by [[Oklahoma]] businessman-politician [[Robert S. Kerr]] (1896-1963) and oil driller James L. Anderson. When [[Dean A. McGee]] (1904-1989), a former chief geologist for [[Phillips Petroleum]], joined the firm in 1946, it changed its name to Kerr-McGee Oil Industries, Incorporated. The company initially focused mostly on off-shore oil exploration and production, being one of the first companies to use [[drillship]]s in the Gulf of Mexico,&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerr-McGee Natural Gas STAR Case Study Series|url=http://www.epa.gov/gasstar/pdf/kerrmcgee.pdf |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later one of the first companies to use a Spar type platform in the area.

{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
With the acquisition of the [[Oryx Energy Company]] of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in 1999, Kerr-McGee gained more onshore assets, as well as significant assets in several foreign areas, most notably [[Algeria]] and western [[Kazakhstan]]. Later acquisitions of [[HS Resources]] and [[Westport Resources Corp.]] established the base of operations in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] and added large resource areas throughout the [[Rocky Mountains]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Until 2005, Kerr-McGee had two major divisions: chemical and oil-related. On November 21, 2005, the chemical division of the company, based in Oklahoma City, was sold off by [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] as [[Tronox]], thereby making Oklahoma City home to the administrative side of Kerr-McGee, while all exploration and production management was located in Denver and Houston.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

On June 23, 2006, [[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation]], based in [[The Woodlands, Texas]], purchased Kerr-McGee in an all-cash transaction totaling $16.5 billion plus the assumption of $2.6 billion in debt. Kerr-McGee shareholders approved the offer on August 10, 2006 and Kerr-McGee ceased to exist as an independent entity. All operations with the exception of [[Tronox]] which was spun off as a separate company in 2005 moved out of [[Oklahoma]]. Within a few years, the top positions at Anadarko had been filled by Kerr-McGee employees and many long-time Anadarko employees had left or been removed from the company, effecting a de facto name change for Kerr-McGee.

===Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Navajo Tribe===
{{main|Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Navajo Tribe}}
''Kerr-McGee v. Navajo Tribe'', [[Case citation|471 U.S. 195]] (1985), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that an Indian tribe is not required to obtain the approval of the Secretary of the Interior in order to impose taxes on non-tribal persons or entities doing business on a reservation.

In 1978, the [[Navajo Nation Council|Navajo Tribal Council]] passed two taxing ordinances.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;Wilkinson, Charles F. (1996), ''[http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview4/archives/1996/2/1996-02%20Wilkinson.pdf Home Dance, the Hopi, and Black Mesa Coal: Conquest and Endurance in the American Southwest]'', 1996 BYU L. R. 449, Brigham Young Univ.&lt;/ref&gt; The first was a tax of 3% on leaseholds (such as [[mineral rights]]) and the second was a 5% tax on business activity.

Kerr-McGee held substantial mineral rights on the [[Navajo Nation]] and filed a [[lawsuit]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Arizona|federal district court]] seeking an [[injunction]] to prohibit the tribe from collecting the tax. Kerr-McGee argued that any tax of non-Indians by a tribe required approval by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] and the district court agreed, granting the injunction. The tribe appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. The Ninth Circuit overruled the district court, finding no federal statute or regulation required such approval. Kerr-McGee then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted [[certiorari]] and agreed to hear the case.&lt;ref name=SCOTUS&gt;''Kerr-McGee v. Navajo Tribe'', {{ussc|source=f|471|195|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=9COA&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kerr-McGee v. Navajo Tribe |vol=731 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=597 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=1984 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/731/597/30389/ |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court decided unanimously that the Navajo Nation had the right to tax Kerr-McGee because tribal authority to tax had already been recognized, and because no federal law prohibited exercising [[tribal sovereignty]] in enacting a tax.

==Locations==

===United States===
Main oil and gas operations in the US were the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountains, onshore Louisiana, and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Main offices were located in downtown Denver and the Greenspoint area of Houston.

Corporate headquarters were located in [[Downtown Oklahoma City]]. In the 1970s the company had a forest products division, and mineral mining in New Mexico, Arizona, and Idaho, and coal mining in Wyoming and Illinois. Most of the U.S operations were on land owned by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] (i.e. [[Bureau of Land Management]], National Forest) and the Navajo Indian tribe.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Mainland China===
Kerr-McGee had exploration, development, and production projects in Bohai Bay, China, near [[Beijing]]. Additional exploration was planned for the South China Sea. These operations were run primarily from an office in [[Beijing]].

===Other locations===
Kerr-McGee and its subsidiaries formerly operated in western [[Kazakhstan]], western Australia, [[Brazil]], [[Trinidad]], [[Benin]], the United Kingdom and several other more minor locations around the world at various times.

==Controversies==

===Exploration in disputed regions of Western Sahara===
Kerr-McGee received international criticism for undertaking exploration for hydrocarbon resources offshore the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] controlled area of the disputed territory of [[Western Sahara]] in 2001. In 2003, one of Norway's main private investment funds, [[Skagen Vekst]], sold their €3.6 million stake in the oil company, referring to ethic problems surrounding Kerr-McGee's engagement in Western Sahara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Divestments from Kerr-McGee over Western Sahara engagement | url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/15084 | publisher=[[Afrol News]] | date=2004-12-21 | accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2005, despite the number of growing protests, the company renewed the contract signed with Moroccan authorities until October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Kerr-McGee renueva su búsqueda de hidrocarburos en Sáhara Occidental | url=http://www.afrol.com/es/articulos/16284 | publisher=Afrol News | date=2005-05-06 | accessdate=2015-01-23|language=es|archivedate=2008-10-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007192429/http://www.afrol.com/es/articulos/16284}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, the [[Norway|Norwegian]] government sold the $52.7 million it had invested in the company through the [[Government Petroleum Fund]] (one of the biggest investment funds of the world), characterizing Kerr-McGee's contract in Western Sahara as having "''particularly serious violations of fundamental ethical norms''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Recommendation on Exclusion from the Government Petroleum Fund’s Investment Universe of the Company Kerr-McGee Corporation | url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/fin/tema/statens_pensjonsfond/ansvarlige-investeringer/tilradninger-og-brev-fra-etikkradet/Recommendation-on-Exclusion-from-the-Government-Petroleum-Funds-Investment-Universe-of-the-Company-Kerr-McGee-Corporation.html?id=419582 | publisher= Ministry of Finance of Norway | date=2005-04-12 | accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, another two Norwegian private investment funds ([[Storebrand]] and [[KLP]]) sold their participations on Kerr-McGee, €1 million and €1.45 million respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Inversoras venden acciones Kerr-McGee por conflicto Sahara

===Under-payment of royalties to the U.S. government===
On June 14, 2004, Bobby Maxwell, a senior government auditor for the U.S. Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service ("MMS"), filed suit in federal court on behalf of the U.S. Government against Kerr-McGee, under the whistle-blowing provisions of the [[False Claims Act]] ("FCA").&lt;ref&gt;31 U.S.C. § 3729. (See also [https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/319/index.html The Royalty Treatment. NOW | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;, May 11, 2007, retrieved April 22, 2015].)&lt;/ref&gt; In the suit, Mr. Maxwell alleged that, based on the information uncovered during his audit, "Kerr-McGee knowingly made false and/or fraudulent statements on the monthly royalty reports submitted to the MMS and 'understated and underpaid' its federal royalties." &lt;ref&gt;''Maxwell v. Kerr-McGee Oil &amp; Gas Corp.'', 486 F.Supp.2d 1217, 1221 (D.Colo.2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, after a full trial on the issues, Kerr-McGee was found by a jury to have failed to report earnings, and thus, under-paying royalties due to the U.S. government. The jury award damages in the amount of US$7.6 million. Despite the jury's verdict, however, before entering judgment, the court reconsidered an earlier Motion for Summary Judgement filed by Kerr-McGee and reversed its prior holding, this time determining that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Maxwell'', 486 F.Supp.2d at 1222&lt;/ref&gt; The case was appealed by Mr. Maxwell, and on September 10, 2008, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of the lower court, remanding it back for further proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. ex rel. Maxwell v. Kerr-McGee Oil &amp; Gas Corp.'', 540 F.3d 1180 (10th Cir.2008)&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Marcia S. Krieger of Colorado ordered Kerr-McGee to pay treble damages, or almost $23 million. As a whistle-blower under the FCA, Mr. Maxwell would be entitled to twenty-five percent of the amount recovered for the government, or approximately $5.7 million. Per Mr. Maxwell, however, most of the money awarded would go to pay the legal fees associated with his almost-10-year fight to force Kerr-McGee to change its deceptive practices and pay what it owed to the public.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/business/energy-environment/21whistle.html?_r=0, September 20, 2010, retrieved April 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karen Silkwood===
It is alleged that [[Karen Silkwood]] was negligently or purposefully contaminated with [[plutonium]] while working at Kerr-McGee's [[Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site]] and investigating safety violations at the plant. Her activism and November 1974 death were the subject of the 1983 film ''[[Silkwood]]''. In a civil suit against Kerr-McGee by the Estate of Karen Silkwood, Judge [[Frank Theis]] told the jury, "If you find that the damage to the person or property of Karen Silkwood resulted from the operation of this plant, Kerr-McGee is liable."&lt;ref name="Rashke"&gt;Rashke, Richard L. ''The Killing of Karen Silkwood: The Story Behind the Kerr-McGee Plutonium Case.'' 2d ed. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8014-8667-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury rendered its verdict of $505,000 in damages and $10,000,000 in punitive damages. On appeal, the judgment was reduced to $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Silkwood Award Is Reversed." ''Associated Press.'' December 12, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] restored the original verdict (''[[Karen Silkwood#Estate of Karen Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee|Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.]],'' [[case citation|464 U.S. 283]] (1984)).&lt;ref&gt;"High Court Clears Award in Karen Silkwood Case." ''New York Times.'' January 12, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was headed for retrial when Kerr-McGee settled out of court in 1986 for $1.38 million, admitting no liability.&lt;ref name="Rashke" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Business Digest." ''New York Times.'' August 23, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerry Spence]], the noted trial lawyer from [[Jackson Hole|Jackson Hole, Wyoming]], represented the Karen Silkwood estate in this litigation.

==Environmental record==
Kerr-McGee is at least partially responsible for large scale [[perchlorate]] water contamination first discovered in the Lower Colorado River in 1997; It stemmed from land used by a facility in [[Henderson, Nevada]] which was owned and operated by Kerr-McGee Chemical LLC (as of 2011 Tronox LLC), where perchlorate was produced from 1945 until 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndep.nv.gov/bca/perchlorate05.htm|publisher=Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources|title=Southern Nevada Perchlorate Clean Up Project|date=16 August 2011|accessdate=13 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523162748/http://ndep.nv.gov/bca/perchlorate05.htm|archive-date=23 May 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, Kerr-McGee Corp spent $18 million on [[pollution]] controls in the first comprehensive [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]] under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] that reduced harmful emission and conserved [[natural gas]] at production facilities across [[Utah]] and [[Colorado]]. The settlement addressed violations discovered at several of Kerr-McGee's [[natural gas]] [[Gas compressor|compressor]] stations located on the [[Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation]] near [[Vernal, Utah]], and in the Denver [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]] Basin near [[Weld County, Colorado]]. In addition to implementing [[pollution]] controls, the agreement required Kerr-McGee to pay a $200,000 [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]], and spend $250,000 on [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] projects to benefit the areas in which violations occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/2467feca60368729852573590040443d/0ff61e4e98efe594852572de0069cfcc!OpenDocument Kerr-McGee Reaches Major Settlement on Natural Gas Production in Colorado and Utah | Newsroom | United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) settled with Kerr McGee Chemical in Henderson, Nevada that required the company to pay $55,392 penalty to resolve air permitting violations at its facility that began in 1993. The EPA cited Kerr-McGee for failing to install [[carbon monoxide]] emissions controls required under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] when it installed a new [[open hearth furnace]] in 1993. The company spent $4.8 million to install proper [[pollution control]]s at the facility reducing total carbon monoxide emission by 115 [[ton]]s per year, an 80% reduction from previous levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/2dd7f669225439b78525735900400c31/9e805fced84fff32852570d8005e1779!OpenDocument U.S. EPA settles air pollution case with Kerr-McGee in Henderson, Nev. | Newsroom | United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Kerr-McGee bought the [[Navajo Uranium Mining Company]], including an interest in a number of mines. It also bought an ore buying station at [[Shiprock, New Mexico]]. In 1953 it built a processing plant (called the [[Shiprock Mill]]) near the buying station. In 1963 the mines and mill were sold to the [[Vanadium Corporation of America]].&lt;ref name="odell"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NU001.html | accessdate = 2009-10-02 | title = NUCLEAR POWER | work = Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture | author = O'Dell, Larry | publisher = Oklahoma Historical Society  / Oklahoma State University | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100727213314/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NU001.html | archive-date = 2010-07-27 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eia1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/umtra/shiprock_title1.html | title=Shiprock Mill Site | publisher=Energy Information Administration | date=2005-10-09 | accessdate=2009-10-02 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016230005/http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/umtra/shiprock_title1.html | archivedate=2009-10-16 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later a partnership with other companies was formed called the Kermac Nuclear Fuels Corporation. In 1957-58 this partnership built a uranium mill near [[Grants, New Mexico]] and [[Ambrosia Lake]]. In 1983 the mill was taken over by a new Kerr-McGee subsidiary called the [[Quivira Mining Corporation]]. Quivira was sold to Rio Algom in 1989.&lt;ref name="mclemore"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/mclemore/documents/07-111_18.pdf | title=Uranium Mining Resources in New Mexico | publisher=SME Annual Meeting | date=February 2007 | accessdate=2009-10-03 | author=V.

From about 1962-1966 Kerr-McGee processed uranium at its oil refinery site in [[Cushing, Oklahoma]]. It received licenses in 1962 for processing uranium and thorium, and in 1963 for [[enriched uranium]]. In 1966 it stopped production. An attempt was made to move all regulated nuclear material to the company's new Cimarron facility at Crescent, OK. Cleanups were attempted in 1966, 1972, 1979–82, and the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/hac/pha/kerr/ker_p1.html | title=PUBLIC HEALTH ASSESSMENT KERR-MCGEE REFINERY SITE | publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control]] | accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In about 1965 Kerr-McGee started producing uranium fuel at its [[Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site]]. This was located near the [[Cimarron River (Arkansas River)|Cimarron River]] and [[Crescent, Oklahoma]]. From 1973-1975 it would also produce [[MOX|mixed Plutonium-Uranium Oxide (MOX)]] 'driver fuel pins' for use in the [[Fast Flux Test Facility]] at the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State. The plant shut down in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

In 1967 Kerr-McGee bought the [[American Potash and Chemical Company]], which owned the [[Rare Earths Facility]] in [[West Chicago, Illinois]]. This facility produced [[thorium]], [[radium]], and [[uranium]] by [[Leaching (metallurgy)|acid leaching]] of [[monazite]] sands and other ores. It stopped work in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epa.gov/R5Super/npl/illinois/ILD980824031.htm | title=NPL Fact Sheet, KERR-MCGEE (SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT) | date=July 2009 | accessdate=2009-10-02 | author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | authorlink=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GAvsNRC1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://openjurist.org/75/f3d/536/general-atomics-v-united-states-nuclear-regulatory-commission | title=75 F3d 536 General Atomics v.

In 1968 the company started construction on what would become the [[Sequoyah Fuels Corporation]] plant in [[Gore, Oklahoma]]. In 1970 the plant started turning [[yellowcake uranium]] into [[uranium hexafluoride]]. In 1987 it began producing [[depleted uranium|depleted]] [[uranium tetrafluoride]] using depleted uranium hexafluoride as input. In 1988 SFC was sold to [[General Atomics]]. In late November 1993 production ceased after a stuck valve in the processing plant stuck open and caused an uncontrolled reaction. The uncontrolled reaction resulted in a large visible cloud leaving the plant. Production ceased immediately and the plant operations were suspended to never resume.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

===Nuclear corporations, subsidiaries, and spinoffs===

In 1956 Kerr-McGee formed the [[Kermac Nuclear Fuels Corporation]] in partnership with Anderson Development Corp, and [[Pacific Uranium Mines]] Co. It was active in New Mexico.&lt;ref name="odell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eia1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mclemore"/&gt;

Some time in the 1970s, the Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corporation was formed. In 1983 it split into the [[Quivira Mining Corporation]] and [[Sequoyah Fuels Corporation]]. Quivira got the [[Ambrosia Lake]], NM mine,&lt;ref name="mclemore"/&gt; while Sequoyah Fuels took over the Sequoyah plant in [[Gore, OK]], as well as the [[Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site|Cimarron]] plant in [[Crescent, OK]]. Sequoyah was sold to [[General Atomics]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/75/f3d/536/general-atomics-v-united-states-nuclear-regulatory-commission General Atomics vs NRC, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; and Quivira was sold to Rio Algom in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=10151409 | title=Design and use of plasma arc cutting equipment | publisher=Sequoyah Fuels Corporation / OSTI.gov | accessdate=2009-10-02 | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doe0007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(technically, GA owned Sequoyah Holding Corporation, which owned Sequoyah Fuels International, which owned Sequoyah Fuels). See [http://openjurist.org/75/f3d/536/general-atomics-v-united-states-nuclear-regulatory-commission General Atomics vs NRC, 1995], footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cimarron Corporation was a subdivision that took control of the Cimarron plant in 1988.&lt;ref name="nrc1"/&gt; When [[Tronox]] was spun off in 2006, it would get ownership of Cimarron Corporation and responsibility for the plant as well.&lt;ref name="nrc1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/decommissioning/complex/kerr-mcgee-cimarron-corporation-former-fuel-fabrication-facility.html | title=Kerr-McGee - Cimarron | publisher=[[US NRC]] | date=April 2009 | accessdate=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerr-McGee bought the [[American Potash and Chemical Company]] in 1967, including its [[Rare Earths Facility]] that processed uranium and thorium. [[AMPOT]] became [[Kerr-McGee Chemical Company]] around 1970 or 1974. In 2005 this became [[Tronox]]. Tronox became independent in 2006, a few months before Kerr-McGee was sold to [[Anadarko Petroleum]]. Tronox later went bankrupt, blaming in part the environmental liabilities inherited from KMC. In 2009 purchasers of Tronox filed a class action lawsuit against Anadarko for having allegedly misled investors.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

'''Lake Karapiro''' is an artificial [[reservoir]] lake on the [[Waikato River]], {{convert|30|km}} south-east of the city of [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] in New Zealand's [[North Island]]. The lake was formed in 1947 by damming the Waikato River to store water for the 96-megawatt [[Karapiro Power Station|Karapiro hydroelectric power station]].&lt;ref name="lowe"&gt;{{cite book| editor = Viner, A.B.| author=Lowe, D.J., Green, J.D.| title=Inland waters of New Zealand| pages=471–474| publisher=DSIR Science Information Publishing Centre| location=Wellington| year=1987| isbn=0-477-06799-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
'Kara' means stone (dark basalt), 'piro' means evil-smelling. According to legend, Karapiro was the stronghold of the chief O-Te-Ihingarangi, and was where the Ngati Haua and their [[Tauranga]] allies made a defensive pact during the [[New Zealand land wars|land wars]] of 1864.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mightyriverpower.co.nz/Generation/AboutUs/HydroStations/Karapiro/Default.aspx| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051858/http://www.mightyriverpower.co.nz/Generation/PowerStations/HydroStations/Karapiro/Default.aspx?id=1425| title=Karapiro - History| deadurl=yes| archivedate=10 June 2011| publisher=Mighty River Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rowing venue ==
The lake, regarded as one of New Zealand's best [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] venues, hosted the [[World Rowing Championships]] in [[1978 World Rowing Championships|1978]] and [[2010 World Rowing Championships|2010]], as well as the rowing events for the [[1950 British Empire Games]]. Lake Karapiro alternates with the South Island's [[Lake Ruataniwha]] in hosting the New Zealand national rowing championships and the New Zealand secondary school rowing championships ([[Maadi Cup]]). Rowers who train on the lake mostly live in nearby [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]].

An [[International Rowing Federation]] inspection panel visited Lake Karapiro in March 2006 and said in its report that it was one of the fairest courses in the world they had seen and that the lake was one of the most picturesque in the world.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10385584"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10385584 |title=NZ to host 2010 world rowing champs |date=8 June 2006 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydroelectric power==
The 96-megawatt [[Karapiro Power Station]] is located adjacent to the dam at the head of the lake, and is the eighth and last hydroelectric power station located on the Waikato River. Water for the power station up to {{convert|362|m3/s}} at full power, is taken from the lake and passed through three Kaplan turbines in the powerhouse, before being deposited into the lower Waikato River. Each turbine turns a 32&amp;nbsp;MW generator, and the electricity from the generators is fed into [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]]'s [[National Grid (New Zealand)|national transmission grid]]. The station is a [[base load power plant|base load generator]] due to its need to maintain water flows into the Waikato River system beyond the lake.

The ten-megawatt [[Horahora Power Station]] at Horahora, 13&amp;nbsp;km upstream of Karapiro Dam, part of an earlier hydroelectric power scheme, was flooded with the formation of Lake Karapiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=John E. |title= People, politics and power stations : electric power generation in New Zealand, 1880–1990|year=1991|isbn=0-908912-16-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4230">The following is a non-comprehensive list of [[Iran]]ian doctors that lived from medieval times up until the beginning of the modern age.

By "Iranian", all the peoples of historic [[Persia]] are meant, i.e., what is today [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], and all the countries of [[Central Asia]] ("common modern definition") that were historically part of the [[Persian empire]], whether or not such people were ethnic Persians or Iranians. In some cases, their exact ancestry is unclear. They may have emigrated or immigrated, and thus may appear in other "Lists of", but nevertheless their names and work are somehow linked to the words "Iranian" and/or "Persian".

'''Non-Starchy Vegetables''' are [[vegetables]] that contain a lower amount of [[carbohydrates]] and [[calories]] compared to their [[starch]]y counterparts. Thus, for the same calories, one can eat a larger quantity of non-starchy vegetables compared to smaller servings of starchy vegetables.

'''Local involvement networks''' ('''LINks''')  were launched by England's [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] in April 2008 following the [[Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007]].  They replaced the [[Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health]] (CPPIH)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/managingyourorganisation/patientandpublicinvolvement/dh_4031635# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105135511/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/PatientAndPublicinvolvement/DH_4031635# |archive-date=2009-11-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and patient and public involvement forums&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407182824/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/PatientAndPublicinvolvement/DH_4074577|title=Patient and public involvement forums|first=Department of|last=Health|website=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existed in every [[local authority area]] with a responsibility for NHS health care and [[social services]].

There were 151 LINks and the Government committed £84 million in funding to them until March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/PatientAndPublicinvolvement/dh_076366# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114181912/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/PatientAndPublicinvolvement/DH_076366# |archive-date=2009-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were abolished in April 2013.

==About LINks==
LINks were supposed to ask people what they like and dislike about NHS care services and [[Social care|adult social care services]] and seek ideas from the public to help improve services. They explored specific issues of concern to the community by collecting feedback from local people. LINks could tell those who commission, provide and manage local services what the community thinks and work with commissioners and providers to improve, amend, reconfigure and supplement services. They also had the power to carry out visits to services to see them at work. They sometimes facilitated  consultation on new or revised commissioning and provision of services.

LINks had the power to ask health and care commissioners for information about their services and expect a response within 20 days. They issued reports and made recommendations about services and expect responses from commissioners. The power to enter certain services and view the care provided is called Enter &amp; View.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_087285# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503195119/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_087285# |archive-date=2011-05-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; LINk members had to undergo training in order to carry out this power. LINks could also refer health &amp; social care matters to the local council’s [[Overview and Scrutiny Committee]] if local service providers did not provide a satisfactory response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stockportlink.co.uk/about.php|title=Healthwatch Stockport :: Home|website=Stockportlink.co.uk|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.linksouthwark.org/whatislink.php# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008102817/http://www.linksouthwark.org/whatislink.php# |archive-date=2011-10-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no set structure for a LINk.  Funding came from local councils, who were given money by the [[Department of Health]] to finance them. Each LINk is hosted by a "host organisation" of paid staff who to set up and support the LINk. The host is accountable to the LINk. LINks are independent of the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407163202/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Managingyourorganisation/PatientAndPublicinvolvement/DH_076366#_1|title=Local involvement networks (LINks)|first=Department of|last=Health|website=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsLegislation/DH_076445# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503162302/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsLegislation/DH_076445# |archive-date=2011-05-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a host organisation is Voluntary Norfolk, the lead partner of a consortium  selected as the host for Norfolk LINk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.norfolk.nhs.uk/local-involvement-networks-links# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927102644/http://www.norfolk.nhs.uk/local-involvement-networks-links# |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone who wants to have their say on how health and [[social care]] services are delivered in their area can become a member of a LINk. The principle is that "everyone's views matter", including  individuals, such as carers, service users, community leaders, patient representatives, health and social care professionals (as long as any [[conflict of interest]] are appropriately handled or managed), organisations.

Certain bodies could not be part of a LINk, these include National Health Service trusts, [[NHS foundation trust]]s, [[NHS primary care trust]]s and [[strategic health authority|strategic health authorities]].

LINks were intended to give people a range of ways to get involved, whether this just taking a few minutes to answer a survey or taking more time to train as a representative who visits services to see how they are run.

Norfolk LINk's work influencing how [[myalgic encephalomyelitis]]/[[chronic fatigue syndrome]](ME/CFS) services are planned and delivered in [[Norfolk]] is an example of how LINks practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/links/realstories/Pages/norfolk-link.aspx|title=Healthwatch :: Home|website=Nhs.uk|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heathwatch==
In July 2010 the Government released a White Paper called Liberating the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/liberating-the-nhs-white-paper|title=Liberating the NHS white paper|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Paper proposed the abolition of LINks and the introduction of Local Healthwatch, this was included in the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].  The intention is to strengthen public influence and involvement in health and social care, as well as to remove the ambiguity of the current 'hosting' arrangements. 

Originally scheduled for April 2012, but  delayed until April 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthandcare.dh.gov.uk/local-healthwatch/|title=New start date and funding for local Healthwatch|first=Department of|last=Health|website=Healthandcare.dh.gov.uk|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was envisaged that local Healthwatch would build upon the existing functions of LINks to include the provision of information and advice to help people make choices about health and care services as well as the possibility of providing an advocacy service for people making a complaint using the NHS complaints process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coventrylink.org.uk/links-become-healthwatch# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025051347/http://www.coventrylink.org.uk/links-become-healthwatch# |archive-date=2011-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HealthWatch England]] was also set up as an independent arm of the [[Care Quality Commission]], with a specific remit to represent at a national level people using health and social care services.  Healthwatch England will use evidence from Local Healthwatch and from carrying out its own work to identify concerns and poorly performing services. It will then be able to recommend to Care Quality Commission that they investigate those services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vsra.org.uk/resources/HealthWatch.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323001800/http://www.vsra.org.uk/resources/HealthWatch.pdf# |archive-date=2012-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mosquito-malaria theory''' (or sometimes '''mosquito theory''') was a [[scientific theory]] developed in the latter half of the 19th century that solved the question of how [[malaria]] was transmitted. The theory basically proposed that malaria was transmitted by mosquitoes, in opposition to the centuries-old medical dogma that malaria was due to bad air, or [[Miasma theory|miasma]]. The first scientific idea was postulated in 1851 by Charles E. Johnson, who argued that miasma had no direct relationship with malaria. Although Johnson's hypothesis was forgotten, the arrival and validation of the [[germ theory of disease]]s in the late 19th century began to shed new lights.&lt;ref name=hempelmann&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hempelmann|first=E|author2=Krafts, K|title=Bad air, amulets and mosquitoes: 2,000 years of changing perspectives on malaria|journal=Malaria Journal|year=2013|volume=12|issue=1|pages=232|pmid=23835014|pmc=3723432|doi=10.1186/1475-2875-12-232}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]] discovered that malaria was caused by a [[protozoan]] [[parasite]] in 1880, the miasma theory began to subside.&lt;ref name=nye&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nye|first=ER|title=Alphonse Laveran (1845-1922): discoverer of the malarial parasite and Nobel laureate, 1907.|journal=Journal of Medical Biography|year=2002|volume=10|issue=2|pages=81–7|pmid=11956550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garrec|first=MF|title=Alphonse Laveran, a life dedicated to the discovery of malaria|journal=Soins; la revue de reference infirmiere|year=2003|issue=677|pages=31|pmid=12929603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lalchhandama&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lalchhandama|first=K|title=The making of modern malariology: from miasma to mosquito-malaria theory|journal=Science Vision|year=2014|volume=14|issue=1|pages=3–17|url=http://www.sciencevision.org/current_issue/dl/Lalchhandama.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427025145/http://www.sciencevision.org/current_issue/dl/Lalchhandama.pdf|archivedate=2014-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important discovery was made by [[Patrick Manson]] in 1877 that mosquito could transmit [[Wuchereria bancrofti|human filarial parasite]].&lt;ref name=eldridge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eldridge|first=BF|title=Patrick Manson and the discovery age of vector biology|journal=Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association|year=1992|volume=8|issue=3|pages=215–20|pmid=1402856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inferring from such novel discovery [[Albert Freeman Africanus King]] proposed the hypothesis that mosquitoes were the source of malaria.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=G C|title=Perceptions of malaria transmission before Ross' discovery in 1897|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|year=2000|volume=76|issue=901|pages=738–740|doi=10.1136/pmj.76.901.738|pmid=11060174|pmc=1741788}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1890s Manson himself began to formulate the complete hypothesis, which he eventually called the mosquito-malaria theory. According to Manson malaria was transmitted from human to human by a mosquito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The mosquito-malaria theory|journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine|year=2002|volume=75|issue=2|page=102|pmid=12230307|pmc=2588730}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=manson1900&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manson|first=P|title=Experimental proof of the mosquito-malaria theory. 1900|journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine|year=2002 |origyear=1900|volume=75|issue=2|pages=107–12|pmid=12230309|pmc=2588736}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was scientifically proved by Manson's confidant [[Ronald Ross]] in the late 1890s. Ross discovered that malaria was transmitted by the biting of specific species of mosquito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nye|first=ER|title=Ronald Ross: discoverer of the role of the mosquito in the transmission of malaria.|journal=The New Zealand Medical Journal|year=1991|volume=104|issue=919|pages=386–7|pmid=1681486}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this Ross won the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronald Ross - Facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1902/ross-facts.html|publisher=Nobel Media AB|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further experimental proof was provided by Manson who induced malaria in healthy human subjects from malaria-carrying mosquitoes.&lt;ref name=manson1900/&gt; Thus the theory became the foundation of malariology and the strategy of control of malaria.&lt;ref name=bynum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bynum|first=W.

==Early concepts==

Malaria was prevalent in the [[Roman Empire]], and the Roman scholars associated the disease with the marshy or swampy lands where the disease was particularly rampant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassl|first=Andreas R.|title=Die Malaria im Römischen Kaiserreich: eine bemerkenswerte Textstelle in den Digesten|journal=Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift|year=2008|volume=120|issue=S4|pages=11–14|doi=10.1007/s00508-008-1033-2|pmid=19066765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sallares|first=R|author2=Bouwman, A |author3=Anderung, C |title=The spread of malaria to Southern Europe in antiquity: new approaches to old problems|journal=Medical History|year=2004|volume=48|issue=3|pages=311–28|pmid=16021928|pmc=547919|doi=10.1017/s0025727300007651}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from those Romans the name "malaria" originated. They called it malaria (literally meaning "bad air") as they believed that the disease was a kind of miasma that was spread in the air, as originally conceived by [[Ancient Greeks]]. Then it was a medical consensus that malaria was spread due to miasma, the bad air. The first record of argument against the miasmatic nature of malaria was from an American physician John Crawford. Gorgas wrote an article "Mosquital Origin of Malarial Disease" in ''Baltimore Observer'' in 1807, but it provoked no consequences. An American physician Charles Earl Johnson provided a systematic and elaborate arguments against miasmatic origin of malaria in 1851 before the Medical Society of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malburne|first=Meredith|title=An Address before the Medical Society of North Carolina, at Its Second Annual Meeting, in Raleigh, May 1851, by Charles E. Johnson, M.D.: Summary|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/nc/johnsonch/summary.html|work=Documenting the American South|publisher=the University Library, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his important points were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Charles E|title=An Address before the Medical Society of North Carolina, at Its Second Annual Meeting, in Raleigh, May 1851|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/nc/johnsonch/menu.html|work=Documenting the American South|publisher=the University Library, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#The [[Mississippi Delta|delta of the Mississippi]] was a recorded healthy place although it has a nearby river, ponds, marshes and lots of stagnant water.
#Labourers of [[North Carolina]] were the healthiest people of working classes in spite of their constant exposure to swamps, and drinking swamp water.
#South American countries such as [[British Guiana]] and [[Brazil]] which were literally flooded with tropical swamps were free from malaria epidemics.
#[[Java Island (Amsterdam)|Java Island]] in Southeast Asia, a region known for epidemics, had luxuriant vegetation and agricultural fields, supplemented with hot and wet tropical climate, ideal for miasmatic disease, was but the healthiest part of Asia.
#A highly polluted [[River Thames]], which should cause miasmatic diseases, was but a good source of drinking water.
#On the other hand, the driest regions such as Guinea in Africa, Spain, Malta, Gibraltar, and several states of America, were frequented with malarial fevers.

==Scientific grounds==

===Disproof of miasma theory of malaria===
The notion that malaria was due to miasma was negated by the discovery of [[malarial parasite]]. A German physician Johann Heinrich Meckel was the first to observed in 1847 the protozoan parasites as black pigment granules from the blood and spleen of a patient who died of malaria. But he did not understand the parasitic nature and significance of those granules in connection with malaria. In 1849 a German pathologist [[Rudolf Virchow]] realised that it could be those granules that were responsible for the disease. In 1879 an Italian biologist Ettore Afanasiev further argued that the granules were definitely the causative agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cox|first=Francis EG|title=History of the discovery of the malaria parasites and their vectors|journal=Parasites &amp; Vectors|year=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/1756-3305-3-5|pmid=20205846| pmc=2825508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manson-Bahr|first=P|title=Milestones in malaria|journal=Medical Times|year=1948|volume=76|issue=11|pages=463|pmid=18100626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manson-Bahr|first=P|title=The malaria story|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine|year=1961|volume=54|pages=91–100|pmid=13766295|pmc=1870294}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Laveran malaria drawings.png|left|thumb| Laveran's drawing of pigmented parasites and the exflagellation of male gametocytes]]

A major discovery was made by a French Army physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran working in [[Algeria]], North Africa. At the hospital in Bône (now [[Annaba]]), he noticed spherical bodies from a patient’s [[blood film]], free or adherent to [[red blood cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bruce-Chwatt LJ |title=Alphonse Laveran's discovery 100 years ago and today's global fight against malaria |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=531–536 |year=1981 |pmid=7021827 |pmc=1439072}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November 1880 he observed from one patient's blood the actual living parasite, describing it as "a pigmented spherical body, filiform elements which move with great vivacity, displacing the neighboring red blood cells." He also observed the process of [[Plasmodium (life cycle)|maturation of the parasite]] (which is now called exflagellation of microgametocytes).

===Discovery of mosquito as disease vector===

In the early 1880s Laveran's germ theory of malaria was generally accepted by the science community. However pivotal problems still remained, such as what transmit the malarial parasites and how. The scientific clue emerged when a British medical officer Patrick Manson discovered for the first time that parasites were transmitted by mosquitoes. In 1877 while working in [[Xiamen|Amoy]], a coastal town in China, he found that the mosquito ''Culex fatigans'' (now ''[[Culex quinquefasciatus]]'') was the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] of the filarial [[roundworm]] that he called ''Filaria sanguinis hominis'' (but now ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]''). His findings were published in the ''China Customs Medical Report'' in 1878,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chernin|first=E|title=Sir Patrick Manson's studies on the transmission and biology of filariasis|journal=Reviews of Infectious Ddiseases|volume=5|issue=1|pages=148–66|pmid=6131527|year=1983|doi=10.1093/clinids/5.1.148}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relayed by Spencer Cobbold to the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society in London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cobbold|first=T.

==King's theory==

Based on the report of Manson's discovery, an American physician Albert Freeman Africanus King developed a proposition that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes.&lt;ref name=hempelmann/&gt; He revealed his idea in 1881 to his colleagues C.V. Riley and L.O. Howard, who did not share the same opinion. Unfettered he developed the theory with proper justifications and presented it before the [[Philosophical Society of Washington]] on 10 February 1882, under the title "The Prevention of Malarial Disease Illustrating inter alia the Conservative Function of Ague". He went so far as to suggest the complete covering of Washington, DC along the [[Washington Monument]] with giant net to protect the city from malaria.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; His idea was ridiculed as inconceivable as scientist still believed malarial parasite was spread through inhalation or ingestion from air (still not far from the miasma theory).&lt;ref name=lalchhandama/&gt; He did not give up, and instead formed a more elaborate argument which he published as a 15-page article in the September 1883 issue of ''[[The Popular Science Monthly]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daniels|first=WB|title=Albert Freeman Africanus King (1841-1914); his theory as to the transmission of malaria by mosquitoes|journal=The Medical Annals of the District of Columbia|year=1950|volume=19|issue=9|pages=499–505; passim|pmid=15438311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howard|first=L. O.|title=DR. A. F. A.

{{quote|I now propose to present a series of facts... with regard to the so-called “malarial poison,” and to show how they may be explicable by the supposition that the mosquito is the real source of the disease, rather than the inhalation or cutaneous of a marsh-vapor.}} 
King carefully selected his view in 19 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCollom|title=The Rôle of Insects in the Propagation of Disease|journal=The American Journal of Nursing|year=1901|volume=2|issue=3|pages=181–193|doi=10.2307/3402517|jstor=3402517}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anonymous|title=Albert King|journal=Nature|year=1941|volume=147|issue=3716|pages=85–85|doi=10.1038/147085d0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To paraphrase his lengthy arguments: occurrence of malaria always coincided with conditions that are also ideal for mosquitos, such as in the time of day, geographical area, temperature, and climate. But the flaw in his proposition was that he believed malaria was transmitted by mosquito through its eggs.&lt;ref name=lalchhandama/&gt;

==Manson's theory==

In 1889 [[Patrick Manson]] returned to England and worked at the [[Seamen's Hospital Society]] and also as lecturer on [[Tropical Diseases Bulletin|tropical diseases]] in [[St George's Hospital]] at London in 1882. His attention was soon drawn towards malaria and began to realise the implications of his own discovery of filarial transmission on malaria.&lt;ref name=eldridge/&gt; He strongly supported Laveran's germ theory of malaria, which was not yet completely embraced by the entire medical community of the time. He proposed that:&lt;ref name=manson-bahr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manson-Bahr|first=P|title=The Jubilee of Sir Patrick Manson (1878-1938): A Tribute to his Work on the Malaria Problem.|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|year=1938|volume=14|issue=157|pages=345–57|pmid=21313134|pmc=2477395|doi=10.1136/pgmj.14.157.345}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#malaria is caused by protozoan parasite,
#the protozoan is transmitted by mosquito, and (falsely)
#humans are infected from contaminated water in which infected mosquito had died.
Manson was unfortunate that he could not investigate his theory as he was not in malaria endemic country such as [[India]], where it could be experimentally proven. But fortunately he met a British army surgeon Ronald Ross, who was on vacation while serving in the [[Indian Medical Service]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=GC|title=Manson's demonstration of the malaria parasite 100 years ago: the major stimulus for Ross' discovery?|journal=The Journal of Infection|year=1994|volume=28|issue=3|pages=333–4|pmid=7916371|doi=10.1016/s0163-4453(94)92243-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chernin|first=Eli|title=Sir Ronald Ross vs. Sir Patrick Manson: A Matter of Libel|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|year=1988|volume=43|issue=3|pages=262–274|doi=10.1093/jhmas/43.3.262|pmid=3063748}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1894, he revealed to Ross with his hands on Ross' shoulders, saying, "Do you know, I have formed the theory that mosquitoes carry malaria just as they carry filaria."&lt;ref name=lalchhandama/&gt;

==Proof==
[[File:Ross, 20.Aug.1897.jpg|thumb|right| The page in Ross' notebook where he recorded the "pigmented bodies" in mosquitoes that he later identified as malaria parasites]]
In 1894 Patrick Manson devised an ingenious procedure for detecting malarial parasites at different [[Plasmodium (life cycle)|developmental stages]] from blood samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manson|first=P|title=On the Nature and Significance of the Crescentic and Flagellated Bodies in Malarial Blood|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1894|volume=2|issue=1771|pages=1306–8|pmid=20755205|pmc=2405325|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.1771.1306}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would later proved to be the tool for experimental proof of his theory. Manson demonstrated to and taught Ronald Ross the technique from which Ross became convinced of Laveran's germ theory. Trained and mentored by Manson, Ross returned to India in March 1895 to start his investigation. But to the dismay of Ross it was not an easy task. His first detection of malarial parasite from patients came only after two months of hard work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=R|title=Observations on Malaria Parasites made in Secunderabad, Deccan.|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1896|volume=1|issue=1831|pages=260–1|pmid=20755993|pmc=2406240|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.1831.260}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The disappointed Ross had to be encouraged by Manson calling the study as the "Holy Grail" of malaria research, and that Ross was the "[[Sir Galahad (poem)|Sir Galahad]]".&lt;ref name=lalchhandama/&gt; After one and half years he made no significant progress. On 20 August 1897 he made a momentous discovery that some mosquitoes had malarial parasites in them. He had fed the blood of a malarial patient (Husein Khan) to different groups of mosquitoes four days before, and found that only one type (which he called "brown type" or more commonly "dappled-winged mosquitoes", not knowing the species, which in fact was ''[[Anopheles]]'') acquired the malarial parasites in its stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=R|title=On some Peculiar Pigmented Cells Found in Two Mosquitos Fed on Malarial Blood.|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1897|volume=2|issue=1929|pages=1786–8|pmid=20757493|pmc=2408186|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.1929.1786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=R|author2=Smyth, J|title=On some peculiar pigmented cells found in two mosquitoes fed on malarial blood. 1897.|journal=Indian Journal of Malariology|year=1997|volume=34|issue=2|pages=47–55|pmid=9293695}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first evidence for Manson's theory that mosquito did carry the malarial parasite, and Ross would later famously call 20 August as "Malaria Day" (now adopted as [[World Mosquito Day]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinden|first=Robert E|title=Malaria, mosquitoes and the legacy of Ronald Ross|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/11/04-020735/en/|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=95|issue=11|pages=821–900|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gibson&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Mary E|title=Ronald Ross and the treatment of malaria|url=http://www.wellcomecollection.org/explore/time--place/topics/pioneers/articles/ronald-ross-and-malaria.aspx|publisher=Wellcome Collection|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mosquito Day|url=http://malarianomore.org.uk/world-mosquito-day|publisher=Malaria No More UK|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=GC|title=Ronald Ross (1857-1932): 100 years since the demonstration of mosquito transmission of Plasmodium spp--on 20 August 1897|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|date=Jul–Aug 1997|volume=91|issue=4|pages=487–8|pmid=9373663|doi=10.1016/s0035-9203(97)90295-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second experimental evidence came in the mid-1898 when Ross demonstrated the transmission of bird malaria ''Proteosoma relictum'' (now ''[[Plasmodium relictum]]'') between larks and mosquitoes, which he called "grey mosquitos" (which were ''Culex fatigans'', but now renamed ''[[Culex quinquefasciatus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bynum|first=WF|title=Ronald Ross and the malaria-mosquito cycle|journal=Parassitologia|year=1999|volume=41|issue=1-3|pages=49–52|pmid=10697833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=FF|title=On the centenary of Sir Ronald Ross's discovery of the role of the mosquito in the life cycle of the malaria parasite|journal=Journal of Medical Biography|year=1997|volume=5|issue=4|pages=200–4|doi=10.1177/096777209700500403|pmid=11619711}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rajakumar|first=K|author2=Weisse, M|title=Centennial year of Ronald Ross' epic discovery of malaria transmission: an essay and tribute|journal=Southern Medical Journal|year=1999|volume=92|issue=6|pages=567–71|pmid=10372849|doi=10.1097/00007611-199906000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that the mosquitoes ingested the parasites from infected birds and could infect healthy birds. He further discovered that the parasites developed in the stomach wall and were later stored in [[salivary glands]] of the mosquito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=R|title=Pigmented cells in mosquitos|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1898|volume=1|issue=1939|pages=550–1|pmid=20757668|pmc=2410758|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.1939.550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Ronald|title=Report on the cultivation of ''Proteosoma'', Labbé, in grey mosquitos|journal=Indian Medical Gazette|year=1898|volume=33|issue=11|pages=401–408|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/report-on-the-cultivation-of-proteosoma-labbe-in-grey-mosquitos/oclc/63606142}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a conclusive evidence that malarial parasites were indeed transmitted by mosquitoes.&lt;ref name=bynum/&gt; In his report Ross concluded that:
{{quote|These observations prove the mosquito theory of malaria as expounded by Dr Patrick Manson.}}
On 9 July 1898 Ross wrote Manson:
{{quote|Q.E.D. and [I] congratulate you on the mosquito theory indeed.}}

Ross' scientific evidences were soon fortified by Italian biologists including [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]], [[Amico Bignami]], and [[Giuseppe Bastianelli]], who discovered that human malarial parasite was transmitted by the actual biting (disproving one of Manson's hypotheses) of female mosquito. In 1899 they reported the infection of ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' with the mosquito ''[[Anopheles claviger]]''&lt;ref name="Cox 2010 5"/&gt; However the practical importance of validating the theory, i.e. control of mosquito vector should be an effective management strategy for malaria, was not realised by the medical community and the public. Hence in 1900 Patrick Manson clinically demonstrated that the bite of infected [[Anopheles|anopheline mosquitoes]] invariably resulted in malaria.&lt;ref name=manson-bahr/&gt; He acquired carefully reared infected mosquitoes from Bignami and Bastianelli in Rome. His volunteer at the [[London School of Tropical Medicine]], P. Thurburn Manson gave a detailed account of his malarial fevers and treatment after bitten by the mosquitoes. As he summarised, Manson's clinical trial showed that the practical solution to malaria infection was in:
#avoiding the neighborhood of native houses where mosquitoes are abundant,
#destroying tha habitats of mosquitoes, and
#protection from mosquito bite.&lt;ref name=manson1900/&gt;

'''Mount Sinai Hospital''' is a 319-bed major urban [[hospital]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], with its main campus located adjacent to [[Douglas Park (Chicago)|Douglas Park]] at 15th Street and California Avenue on the city's West Side. The hospital was established in 1912 under the name Maimonides Hospital, with a mission of serving poor immigrants from Europe while providing training to Jewish physicians, primarily of Eastern European descent.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Cutler, ''The Jews of Chicago: From Shtetl to Suburb'' (1996), p. 158-160.&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of financial difficulty, it closed in 1918, and was reopened as "Mount Sinai Hospital" in 1919, with 60 beds and continuing its original mission.

==History==
The second Jewish hospital to be established in the city, Mount Sinai Hospital differed from [[Michael Reese Hospital]], which had been established in 1881 on Chicago's South Side primarily by German Jews, whereas Mount Sinai was founded by Eastern European Jews. Unlike other hospitals, Mount Sinai had a [[kosher]] kitchen.

[[Morris Kurtzon]] sought to provide the West Side community in Chicago a suitable hospital, one where Jewish doctors could practice without facing exclusion from hospital staffs by [[anti-Semitism]]. Purchasing with his own money the bankrupt Maimonides Hospital, Kurtzon re-organized it under the name Mount Sinai Hospital Association. He refused an attractive offer to sell the property to the [[University of Illinois]], preferring to donate it for the benefit of the entire community. The community responded to this gesture with a strenuous effort to build financial support for the new hospital. Although women had not traditionally been welcome to participate in many communal activities, the early history of Mount Sinai included a strong presence of women among its supporters. Kurtzon devoted a good deal of his time to planning and designing the new facility. The final hospital plans were drawn up by the Chicago architectural firm of Schmidt, Garden and Erikson. Garcy Corporation of Piedmont, Alabama, designed custom equipment for the new hospital, much of it made of stainless steel.

==Patient services==
Mount Sinai Hospital is a non-profit institution, which provides charity care to 59% of its patients and is a teaching hospital affiliated primarily with [[Ross University School of Medicine]], but also [[Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science]] and the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. The hospital is operated by [[Sinai Health System (Illinois)|Sinai Health System]]. The hospital is an adult Level 1 [[trauma center]], chest pain center, and stroke center. Due to relatively low utilization and the availability of pediatric inpatient facilities at other institutions nearby, Mount Sinai in 2017 discontinued offering pediatric trauma care and hospitalization for children under age 16.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-mount-sinai-ends-pediatric-inpatient-0621-biz-20170620-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; While operating at a financial loss in an aging facility, even in its current state the hospital provides medical care to a vital part of the community. [[Ruth Rothstein]], who served as the president of the hospital from the 1970s to the 1990s, resisted calls to move Mount Sinai to the suburbs.

==Residency Training Programs==
Mount Sinai Hospital has four ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) accredited residency training programs. They include Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynecology. It has trained numerous physicians who went successfully in to primary care as well as competitive speciality fellowships. It also has Adult Cardiology and Interventional Cardiology fellowship programs.

In Japan, a '''public health centre''' (Japanese: 保健所 ''Hokensho'') is a government facility responsible for [[public health]] matters.

The primary role of public health centre is to prevent [[infectious disease]] and [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic health problems]]. It is responsible for monitoring air and water quality, inspecting and licensing waterworks, beauty salons, barbers, food processing facilities, restaurants, hotels, doctors and hospitals, and also [[Pest control|animal control]].　It also provides health consultation to the patients with [[mental illness]] or chronic health problems such as [[cancer]] and [[asthma]].

A study published in 1988 found the presence of antibodies against HIV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/August-2007/The-Pre-Pandemic-Puzzle/ The Pre-Pandemic Puzzle] by W. Pate McMichael August 2007 St. Louis Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Results of testing for HIV genetic material have been reported; however, the data have never been published in a peer-reviewed medical or scientific journal.

== Illness ==
In early 1968, a 15-year-old black teenager named Robert Rayford admitted himself to City Hospital in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=McMichael2007&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.stlmag.com/The-Pre-Pandemic-Puzzle/|title = The Pre-Pandemic Puzzle|last = McMichael|first = W. Pate|date = August 31, 2007|work = St. Louis Magazine|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; His legs and genitals were covered in warts and sores. He also had severe swelling of the testicles and pelvic region, which later spread to his legs, causing a misdiagnosis of [[lymphedema]]. He had grown thin and pale and suffered from [[shortness of breath]]. Rayford told the doctors that he had experienced these symptoms since at least late 1966. Tests discovered a severe [[chlamydia infection]] which had, unusually, spread throughout his body. Rayford declined a [[rectal examination]] request from hospital personnel,&lt;ref name="Crewsdon"/&gt; and was described as uncommunicative and withdrawn.&lt;ref name=McMichael2007/&gt;
Doctors treating Rayford suspected that he was homosexual or bisexual and had engaged in receptive [[anal intercourse]]. Eventually, he was moved to [[Barnes-Jewish Hospital]] (then called Barnes Hospital).

In late 1968 Rayford's condition seemed to have stabilized, but by March 1969 his symptoms reappeared and had worsened. He had increased difficulty breathing, and his [[white blood cell]] count had plummeted. The doctors found that his [[immune system]] was dysfunctional. He developed a [[fever]] and died of [[pneumonia]]&lt;ref name=McMichael2007/&gt; at 11:20 pm on May 15, 1969.

== Autopsy ==
An [[autopsy]] of Rayford, led by Dr. William Drake, uncovered several abnormalities. Small purplish lesions were discovered on Rayford's left thigh and his [[soft tissue]]. Drake concluded that the lesions were [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], a rare type of cancer that then mostly affected elderly men of Mediterranean or [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| year =| title =Kaposi's Sarcoma| publisher =USA Today| publication-place =| page =| url =http://www.healthscout.com/ency/68/297/main.html| accessdate =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120216112432/http://www.healthscout.com/ency/68/297/main.html| archivedate =2012-02-16| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaposi's sarcoma was later determined to be an [[AIDS defining clinical condition|AIDS-defining illness]].

These findings baffled the attending doctors, and a review of the case was published in the medical journal ''Lymphology'' in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elvin-Lewis M, Witte M, Witte C, Cole W, Davis J |title=Systemic Chlamydial infection associated with generalized lymphedema and lymphangiosarcoma |journal=Lymphology |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=113–21 |date=September 1973 |pmid=4766275}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the autopsy, blood and tissue samples were kept in cold storage at the [[University of Arizona]] and at the laboratory of Dr. Memory Elvin-Lewis, who had assisted in Rayford's autopsy.

== Later investigations ==

=== Tests ===
In 1984, HIV was first [[HIV#Discovery|discovered]] (originally called [["lymphadenopathy-associated virus", or LAV]]), and was spreading rapidly in the gay male communities of [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]]. Dr. Marlys Witte, one of the doctors who, like Elvin-Lewis, had cared for Rayford before death and also assisted in the autopsy, thawed and [[HIV test|tested]] preserved tissue samples from Rayford's autopsy, which tested negative.&lt;ref name="Crewsdon"/&gt; Three years later, in June 1987, Witte decided to test the tissue samples again using [[Western blot]], the most sensitive test then available. The [[HIV test#Western blot|Western blot]] test found that [[antibody|antibodies]] against all nine detectable HIV proteins were present in Rayford's blood. A second test found identical results.&lt;ref name=garry/&gt; A conference abstract published in 1999 (but never apparently published in a peer-reviewed journal) reported the presence in Rayford's samples of HIV genes very similar to the HIV IIIB isolate that was discovered in France in the 1980s, and stating that contamination was unlikely given that DNA testing was done on Rayford's samples without being cultured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/Abstracts/rr99.html |title=XIIth International Congress of Virology Abstract |date=2007-05-03 |access-date=2016-11-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503080625/http://www.tulane.edu/~dmsander/Abstracts/rr99.html |archivedate=2007-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{who|date=July 2017}} argue that these efforts to confirm the presence of HIV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in Rayford's case do not appear to have produced conclusive results, and that similarities to the HIV IIIB isolate are perhaps a red flag that the result may have reflected laboratory contamination rather than the identification of HIV in Rayford's tissues. In the absence of evidence of HIV genetic material in Rayford's samples, critics{{who?|date=July 2017}} argue the case cannot be considered a confirmed instance of HIV infection.

=== Impact on AIDS origin research ===
Rayford had never traveled outside the [[Midwestern United States]] and had told doctors he had never received a [[blood transfusion]]. Since Rayford's AIDS infection was almost certainly through sexual contact, and since he had never left the country, researchers presume that AIDS may have been present in North America before Rayford began showing symptoms in 1966.&lt;ref name="Gorman"/&gt; Rayford never ventured into cosmopolitan cities such as New York, Los Angeles, or San Francisco, where the HIV-AIDS epidemic was first observed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boy's 1969 Death Suggests Aids Invaded U.S. Several Times |author=Gina Kolata |date=October 28, 1987 |work=[[New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6173AF93BA15753C1A961948260&amp;sec=health&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctors and others who subsequently investigated the case in the early 1980s speculated that Rayford may have been sexually abused and may have been a [[Prostitution of children|child-prostitute]].&lt;ref name="Crewsdon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Blogs.discovermagazine.com_October_17_2014c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bodyhorrors/2012/10/22/aids_in_pre_aids_era/ |title=The Sea Has Neither Sense Nor Pity: the Earliest Known Cases of AIDS in the Pre-AIDS Era - Body Horrors |newspaper=''Discover'' magazine |date= October 22, 2012  |accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''San Francisco plague of 1900–1904''' was an epidemic of [[bubonic plague]] centered on [[San Francisco]]'s [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]]. It was the first plague epidemic in the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Elizabeth T. |date=May–June 1978 |title=Plague in the Continental United States, 1900–76 |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=297–301 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1431896/pdf/pubhealthrep00142-0091.pdf |pmc=1431896 |pmid=349602}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epidemic was recognized by medical authorities in March 1900, but its existence was denied for more than two years by [[Henry Gage]], the [[Governor of California]]. His denial was based on business reasons: the wish to keep the reputations of San Francisco and California clean and to prevent the loss of revenue from trade stopped by [[quarantine]]. The failure to act quickly may have allowed the disease to establish itself among local animal populations.&lt;ref name=Echenberg237&gt;Echenberg 2007, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Federal authorities worked to build a case to prove that there was a major medical health problem, and they isolated the affected area. Proof that an epidemic was occurring served to undermine the credibility of Gage, and he lost the governorship in the 1902 elections. The new governor, [[George Pardee]], quietly implemented a medical solution and the epidemic was stopped in 1904. There were 121 cases identified, including 119 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Risse|first1=Guenter B.|title=Plague, fear, and politics in San Francisco's Chinatown|date=2012|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-1-4214-0510-0|pages=277–298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Echenberg231&gt;Echenberg 2007, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], much of urban San Francisco was destroyed by fire, including all of the Chinatown district. The process of rebuilding began immediately but took several years. While reconstruction was in full swing, a second plague epidemic hit San Francisco in May and August 1907 but it was not centered in Chinatown. Rather, cases occurred randomly throughout the city, including cases identified across the bay in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. San Francisco's politicians and press reacted very differently this time, wanting the problem solved speedily.&lt;ref name=Dolan2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dolan |first=Brian |year=2006 |title=Plague in San Francisco (1900) |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=121 |pages=16–37 |url=http://www.publichealthreports.org/userfiles/121_SUP-HC/121SUP016.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331201940/http://www.publichealthreports.org/userfiles/121_SUP-HC/121SUP016.pdf |archivedate=March 31, 2016 |accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health authorities worked quickly to assess and eradicate the disease.&lt;ref name=Kellogg1920&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kellogg |first=W.H. |date=November 1920 |title=Present Status of Plague, with Historical Review |journal=American Journal of Public Health |publisher=American Public Health Association |location=Chicago |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=835–844 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sFg7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA835 |doi=10.2105/ajph.10.11.835|pmc=1362904 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To control one of the disease's [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], some $2&amp;nbsp;million was spent between 1907 and 1911 to kill as many rats as possible in the city.&lt;ref name=Evans1917&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=William Augustus |title=How to Keep Well: A Health Book for the Home |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pekrAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA292 |year=1917 |publisher=D.

==Background==
{{Main|Third plague pandemic}}
The third pandemic of the plague started in 1855 in China and eventually killed about 15 million people, mainly in India. In 1894, the plague hit [[Hong Kong]], a major trade port between China and the US.&lt;ref name=Echenberg6&gt;Echenberg 2007, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haas |first=Victor H. |date=March 1959 |title=When Bubonic Plague Came to Chinatown |journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=141–147 |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/content/8/2_Part_1/141.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; US officials were worried that others would get infections from cargo carried by ships that would cross the Pacific Ocean. For these reasons, all ships were rigorously inspected. At that time, however, it was not widely known that rats could carry plague, and that fleas on those rats could transmit the disease to humans.&lt;ref name=Echenberg7&gt;Echenberg 2007, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Ships arriving in US ports were declared clean after inspection of the passengers showed no signs of disease. Health officials conducted no tests on rats or fleas.&lt;ref name=Echenberg11&gt;Echenberg 2007, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Despite important advances in the 1890s in the fight against bubonic plague, many of the world's doctors did not immediately change their ineffective and outdated methods.&lt;ref name=Echenberg11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perry |first=J.C. |date=August 29, 1908 |title=Plague; Mode of Dissemination and Methods for Control |journal=Medical Record |publisher=William Wood and Company |editor=Thomas L. Stedman |volume=74 |issue=9 |page=345 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQlYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Kitasato Shibasaburō]] first described the plague bacteria in Hong Kong in 1894. Simultaneously but independently, [[Alexandre Yersin]] described and named the [[Yersinia pestis|plague bacterium]], and proved the rat to be a major vector in plague. Masanori Ogata and [[Paul-Louis Simond]], acting independently, proved the flea was a critical link in 1897. The same year, [[Waldemar Haffkine]] developed a vaccine to inoculate humans against the disease. These advancements were discussed in 1897 at medical conferences, but many doctors continued with their previous and outdated methods of dealing with the disease.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1898, the US [[Marine Hospital Service]] (MHS) chief surgeon, James M. Gassaway, felt obliged to refute rumors of plague in San Francisco. Supported by the city's health officer, Gassaway  that some Chinese residents had died of pneumonia or lung edema, and it was not bubonic plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gassaway |first=James M. |date=November 29, 1898 |title=False report of plague in San Francisco |journal=Public Health Reports |publisher=Association of Schools of Public Health |volume=13 |issue=51 |page=1503 |jstor=41453167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Honolulu Chinatown fire of 1900.jpg|thumb|In January 1900, [[Chinatown, Honolulu|Honolulu's Chinatown]] burned down in an effort to control [[bubonic plague]].]]
In the newly formed US [[Territory of Hawaii]], the city of [[Honolulu]] fell victim to the plague in December 1899. Residents of Honolulu, were reporting cases of fever and swollen [[Lymph node|lymph glands]] forming [[bubo]]s, with severe internal organ damage - quickly leading to death. Not knowing precisely how to control the spread of the disease, city health officials decided to burn infected houses. For four months, thousands of residents were evacuated and quarantined.

On January 20, 1900, changing winds fanned the flames out of control, and nearly all of Chinatown burned—{{convert|38|acre}}—leaving 6,000 without homes.&lt;ref&gt;Chase 2003, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Albert Pierce |title=Under Hawaiian Skies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_2CmsAMr75wC&amp;pg=PA387 |year=1922 |publisher=Advertiser Publishing Company |location=Honolulu |page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extensive maritime operations of the port of San Francisco caused concern in medical men such as [[Joseph J. Kinyoun]], the chief quarantine officer of the MHS in San Francisco, about the infection spreading to California. A Japanese ship, the S.S. ''Nippon Maru'', arriving in [[San Francisco Bay]] in June 1899 had two plague deaths at sea, and two more cases of stowaways found dead in the bay, with postmortem cultures proving they had the plague.&lt;ref name=Link1955&gt;{{cite journal |last=Link |first=Vernon B. |year=1955 |title=A History of Plague in the United States of America |journal=Public Health Monograph |volume=26 |pages=1–11 |url=http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/CommunicableDisease/DiseaseSurveillanceData/Weekly-MonthlyStatistics/Documents/aug04b.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221082603/http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/CommunicableDisease/DiseaseSurveillanceData/Weekly-MonthlyStatistics/Documents/aug04b.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York in November 1899, the British ship ''J.W. Taylor'' brought three cases of plague from Brazil, but the cases were confined to the ship.&lt;ref name=Link1955/&gt; The Japanese freighter S.S. ''Nanyo Maru'' arrived in [[Port Townsend, Washington]], on January 30, 1900, with 3 deaths out of 17 cases of confirmed plague. All of these ships were quarantined; they are not known to have infected the general population. However, it is possible that plague escaped some unknown ship by way of fleas or rats, later to infect US residents.&lt;ref name=Link1955/&gt;

In this atmosphere of grave danger, January 1900, Kinyoun ordered all ships coming to San Francisco from China, Japan, Australia and Hawaii to fly yellow flags to warn of possible plague on board.&lt;ref name=Chase18&gt;Chase 2003, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Many entrepreneurs and sailing men felt that this was bad for business, and unfair to ships that were free of plague. City promoters were confident that plague could not take hold, and they were unhappy with what they saw as Kinyoun's high-handed abuse of authority. On February 4, 1900, the Sunday magazine supplement of the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' carried an article titled "Why San Francisco Is Plague-Proof".&lt;ref&gt;Chase 2003, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Certain American experts held the mistaken belief that a rice-based diet left Asians with a lower resistance to plague, and that a diet of meat kept [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] free from this disease.&lt;ref&gt;Kraut 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EIqwDj9umzYC&amp;pg=PA85 p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infection==
[[File:James D. Phelan - Mayor of SF 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|Mayor [[James D. Phelan]] thought that Chinatown was a public health hazard.]]
In January 1900, the four-masted steamship S.S. ''Australia'' laid anchor in the [[Port of San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;Chase 2003, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The ship sailed between Honolulu and San Francisco regularly, and its passengers and crew were declared clean. Cargo from Honolulu, unloaded at a dock near the outfall of Chinatown's sewers, allowed rats carrying the plague to leave the ship and transmit the infection. However, it is difficult to trace the infection to a single vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Markel 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9aoTfHAEQvoC&amp;pg=PA224 p. 224]&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever it came from, the disease was soon established in the cramped Chinese [[ghetto]] neighborhood. A sudden increase in dead rats in Chinese-American communities, possibly the result of ship-borne rats traveling up the sewers and infecting local rats.&lt;ref&gt;Chase 2003, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors of the plague's presence abounded in the city, quickly gaining the notice of authorities from MHS stationed on [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] in [[San Francisco Bay]], including Chief Kinyoun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On The Plague In San Francisco |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=36 |issue=15 |page=1042 |publisher=The American Medical Association |location=Chicago |date=April 13, 1901 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOsBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1042 |doi=10.1001/jama.1901.52470150038003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Plague, ''American Medicine,'' and the ''Philadelphia Medical Journal.'' |journal=Occidental Medical Times |volume=15 |pages=171–179 |publisher=Occidental Medical Times |location=San Francisco |year=1901 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=izegAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bubonic Plague At San Francisco, Cal. |journal=Annual Report of the Supervising Surgeon General of the Marine Hospital Service of the United States for the Fiscal Year 1901 |page=491 |publisher=Government Printing Office |location=Washington |year=1901 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBznMQ1BK98C&amp;pg=RA2-PA491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Chinese-American named Chick Gin, Wing Chung Ging or Wong Chut King became the first official plague victim in California.&lt;ref&gt;Kalisch 1972, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Echenberg214&gt;Echenberg 2007, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chase17&gt;Chase 2003, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The 41-year-old man, born in China (San Francisco resident for 16 years) was a bachelor living in the basement of the Globe Hotel, in Chinatown, at the intersection of the streets, now called, Grant and Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;Chase 2003, p.  210&lt;/ref&gt; The Globe Hotel was built in 1857, with the appearance of an Italian palazzo. However, by the mid-1870s it was a squalid tenement crowded with Chinese residents. Just outside, Jackson Street was the Chinese red-light district, where unmarried men could visit "hundred-men's-wives".&lt;ref name=Chase17/&gt;

On February 7, 1900, Wong Chut King, the owner of a lumber yard, fell sick with what the Chinese doctors thought was [[typhus]] or [[gonorrhea]], the latter a [[sexually transmitted disease]] common to Chinatown's residents at that time.&lt;ref name=Dolan2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Echenberg214/&gt; After failed medications and no relief for his illness, he passed away in his bed after suffering for four weeks. In the morning, the body was taken to a Chinese undertaker where it was examined by San Francisco police surgeon, Frank P. Wilson, on March 6, 1900. Wilson called for A.P. O'Brien, a city health department officer, after finding suspiciously swollen lymph glands. Wilson and O'Brien then summoned Wilfred H. Kellogg, San Francisco's city bacteriologist, and the three men performed an autopsy as night closed. Looking through his microscope, Kellogg thought he saw plague bacilli.&lt;ref name=Chase18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kellogg |first=Wilfred H. |year=1900 |title=The Bubonic Plague In San Francisco |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=34 |issue=20 |pages=1235–1237 |doi=10.1001/jama.1900.24610200021001g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late at night, Kellogg ran the suspicious samples of lymph fluid to Angel Island to be tested on animals in Kinyoun's better-equipped laboratory - an operation that would take at least four days. Meanwhile, Wilson and O'Brien called upon the city's Board of Health and insisted that Chinatown be quarantined immediately.&lt;ref name=Shah120&gt;Shah 2001, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; When dawn came on March 7, 1900, Chinatown was circled by rope and surrounded by policemen preventing egress or access to anyone but Whites. The 12-block area was bordered by four streets: Broadway, Kearney, California and Stockton. Approximately 25,000–35,000 residents were unable to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Kraut 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EIqwDj9umzYC&amp;pg=PA84 pp. 84–85]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markel 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9aoTfHAEQvoC&amp;pg=PA63 pp. 63–64]&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Consul General [[Ho Yow]] felt that the quarantine was likely based on false assumptions and that it was entirely unfair to Chinese people and would seek an injunction to lift the quarantine.&lt;ref name=Markel65&gt;Markel 2005, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco mayor [[James D. Phelan]] was in favor of keeping the Chinese-speaking residents separated from the Anglo-Americans - claiming that Chinese- Americans were unclean, filthy, and "a constant menace to the public health."&lt;ref name=Markel65/&gt; Nevertheless, the Board of Health lifted the quarantine on March 9 after it had been in force for only 2½ days. O'Brien said, by way of explanation, that "the general clamor had become too great to ignore".&lt;ref name=Markel65/&gt; The animals tested in Kinyoun's lab seemed to be in normal conditions after the first 48 hours of being exposed to the possible plague-causing agents. The lack of early response cast doubt on the theory that plague was the cause of Wong Chut King's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/809317536|title=Plague, fear, and politics in San Francisco's Chinatown|last=1932–|first=Risse, Guenter B.,|date=2012|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=|isbn=9781421405100|location=Baltimore|pages=115–117|oclc=809317536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
[[File:Henry Gage.jpg|thumb|upright|left|California governor [[Henry Gage]] denied there was a plague.]]
Allied with powerful railroad and city business interests, California governor [[Henry Gage]] publicly denied the existence of any pestilent outbreak in the San Francisco, fearing that any word of the [[bubonic plague|bubonic plague's]] presence would deeply damage the city's and state's economy.&lt;ref name="Gage denies plague epidemic"&gt;Chase 2003, pp. 70, 72, 79–81, 85, 115, 119–122&lt;/ref&gt; Supportive newspapers, such as the ''[[San Francisco Call|Call]]'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle|Chronicle]]'' and the ''[[San Francisco Bulletin|Bulletin]]'', echoed Gage's denials, beginning what was to become an intense defamation campaign against quarantine officer Kinyoun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Power |first=J.

Gage]] that he intervene. Secretary Gage agreed, creating a three-man commission of investigators who were respected medical scholars, experienced with identifying and treating the plague in China or India. The commission examined six San Francisco cases and conclusively determined that bubonic plague was present.&lt;ref name=Clark1961/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tutorow |first=Norman E. |date=Summer 1996 |title=A Tale of Two Hospitals: U.S. Marine Hospital No. 19 and the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital on the Presidio of San Francisco |journal=California History |publisher=California Historical Society |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=154–169 |jstor=25177577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Kinyoun, the Treasury commission's findings were again immediately denounced by Governor Gage.&lt;ref name="Gage denies plague epidemic"/&gt; Gage believed the federal government's growing presence in the matter was a gross intrusion of what he viewed as a state concern. In his retaliation, Gage denied the federal commission any use of the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California's]] laboratories in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to further study the outbreak, by threatening the university's state funding.&lt;ref name="Gage denies plague epidemic"/&gt; The ''Bulletin'' also attacked the federal commission, branding it as a "youthful and inexperienced trio."&lt;ref name=Echenberg231/&gt;

The clash between Gage and federal authorities intensified. Wyman instructed Kinyoun to place Chinatown under a second quarantine, as well as blocking all [[East Asians]] from entering state borders. Wyman also instructed Kinyoun to inoculate all persons of Asian heritage in Chinatown, using an experimental vaccine developed by [[Waldemar Haffkine]], one known to have severe side effects. Spokesmen in Chinatown protested strenuously; they did not give their permission for this kind of mass experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trauner |first=Joan B. |date=Spring 1978 |title=The Chinese as Medical Scapegoats in San Francisco, 1870–1905 |journal=California History |publisher=California Historical Society |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=70–87 |jstor=25157817}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association]], also known as the Six Companies, filed suit on behalf of Wong Wai, a merchant who took a stance against what he perceived as a violation of his personal liberty.

Federal judge [[William W. Morrow]] ruled uncharacteristically in favor of the Chinese, largely because the defense by the State of California was unable to prove that Chinese Americans were more susceptible to plague than Anglo Americans. The decision set a precedent for greater limits placed on public health authorities seeking to isolate diseased populations.&lt;ref&gt;Kraut 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EIqwDj9umzYC&amp;pg=PA89 pp. 89–92]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McClain2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=McClain |first=Charles |date=November 17, 2006 |title=Of Medicine, Race, and American Law: The Bubonic Plague Outbreak of 1900 |journal=Law &amp; Social Inquiry |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=447–513 |issn=0897-6546 |doi=10.1111/j.1747-4469.1988.tb01126.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1747-4469.1988.tb01126.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1901 and 1902, the plague outbreak continued to worsen. In a 1901 address to both houses of the [[California State Legislature]], Gage accused federal authorities, particularly Kinyoun, of injecting plague bacteria into [[cadavers]], falsifying evidence.&lt;ref name=Skubik2002&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skubik.com/thesis%20summary.pdf |title=Public Health Politics and the San Francisco Plague Epidemic of 1900–1904 |publisher=Mark Skubik, San Jose State University |year=2002 |accessdate=August 19, 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to what he said to be massive scaremongering by the MHS, Gage pushed a censorship bill to gag any media reports of plague infection. The bill failed in the [[California State Legislature]], yet laws to gag reports amongst the medical community succeeded in passage and were signed into law by the governor. In addition, $100,000 was allocated to a public campaign led by Gage to deny the plague's existence.&lt;ref name="Gage denies plague epidemic"/&gt; Privately, however, Gage sent a special commission to [[Washington, D.C.]], consisting of [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]], newspaper and shipping lawyers to negotiate a settlement with the MHS, whereby the federal government would remove Kinyoun from San Francisco with the promise that the state would secretly cooperate with the MHS in stamping out the plague epidemic.&lt;ref name=Skubik2002/&gt;

[[File:Kinyoun kicked out 1900.jpg|thumb|upright|In October 1900, Kinyoun was the subject of a political cartoon about his being kicked out of his federal position.]]
Despite the secret agreement allowing for Kinyoun's removal, Gage went back on his promise of assisting federal authorities and continued to obstruct their efforts for study and quarantine. A report issued by the State Board of Health on September 16, 1901, bolstered Gage's claims, denying the plague's outbreak.&lt;ref name="Gage denies plague epidemic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=California State Board of Health |title=Report of the Special Health Commissioners Appointed by the Governor to Confer with the Federal Authorities at Washington Respecting the Alleged Existence of Bubonic Plague in California |place=Sacramento |publisher=Superintendent State Printing |year=1901 |edition=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCILAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chinese Racism - Chinatown, early 1900s ==
Widespread racism towards Chinese immigrants was socially accepted during the initial time of the Chinatown plague in the early 1900s. Standard social rights and privileges were oftentimes denied to the Chinese people, as view in the way American landlords would refuse to maintain their own property when renting to Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plague, Fear, and Politics in San Francisco's Chinatown|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781421405100|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[History of Chinese Americans]]. The living conditions in the Chinatown  community reflected the social norms and racial inequalities during that time for Chinese immigrants. Housing for the majority of  Chinatown Chinese immigrants were not fit nor adequate for human living, but with scarce housing options and America landlords unwilling to provide equal and fair housing, Chinese immigrants were left little option other than to live with such housing disparities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Discrimination against Chinese Americans culminated in two acts, the quarantine of San Francisco's Chinatown, and the permanent extension of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/5views/5views3g.htm|title=A History of Chinese Americans in California: THE 1900s|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extented quarantine of Chinatown was motivated more by racist images of Chinese Americans as carriers of disease than by actual evidence of the presence of [[Bubonic plague]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/5views/5views3g.htm|title=A History of Chinese Americans in California:THE 1900s|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the housing discrimination during this time health officials also scrounged around to look for people who were hiding their loved ones that caught the plague and wanted to take matters into their own hands. In result of the government trying to hide that there was a plague going on it was hurting the economy. This in turn stopped countries from wanting to trade produce and goods that would help America, specifically in the Bay Area, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dm00bu.html|title=A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries: Bubonic plague hits San Francisco|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2017-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court Involvement during the Plague===
The Chinese wanted the court system to show them some mercy. They needed to show them that they were being discriminated against. Many people were being affected by the quarantine because they worked outside of San Francisco. Due to this a limited amount of Chinese agreed to take the inoculation. On May 22, 1900 the press released information that people were experiencing severe pain from the vaccines. On May 24, 1900 with the help of [[Chinese Six Companies]] They hired the law firm of Reddy, Campbell, and Metson. Defendants included [[Joseph J. Kinyoun]] an all of the members of the San Francisco Board of Health. They brought the lawsuit because they were being segregated and forced to take an experimental vaccine that was causing more harm to the Chinese community. The Chinese wanted the courts to issue a "provisional injunction" to enforce their freedoms under the constitution. They should be able to travel outside of San Francisco. Chinese and Japanese residents were not allowed to travel outside of San Francisco without a health certificate. Judge [[William W. Morrow]] ruled that the defendants were violating their [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Morrow revealed that they would have to implement the same restrictions to everyone no matter their ethnic group. The defendants did not have enough evidence to prove that the Chinese were transmitting the plague. Morrow agreed with their claim that if they were why were they permitted to roam the streets of San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McClain|first1=C.J.|title=In Search of Equality: The Chinese Struggle against Discrimination in Nineteenth-Century America|date=1994|isbn=9780520205147|pages=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1900===

Upon the death of Wong Chut King, the San Francisco Health Board took immediate action to prevent the spread of plague: Chinatown was quarantined.&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Risse|first1=Guenter B.|title=Plague, fear, and politics in San Francisco's Chinatown|date=2012|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-1-4214-0510-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health officials, in order to prevent the propagation of the disease, made the decision of placing [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] under quarantine, without any notice to the residents - targeting Chinese residents only. White Americans that were walking the streets of Chinatown were allowed to leave; everybody else was forced to stay.&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press"/&gt; Physicians were restricted from crossing into [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] to identify and help the sick. The Health Board had to approve whether or not any health official crossed into the quarantined area.&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press"/&gt; Due to lack of evidence that the cause of death of King was plague, the quarantine was removed the day after to avoid controversy.&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press"/&gt;

Kinyoun's lab confirmed the disease was bubonic plague and informed the Health Board right away. In an attempt to avoid a second controversial quarantine, the Health Board continued with a house-to-house inspection to look for possible plague infested households - disinfecting those that were thought to be at risk of infection.&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press"/&gt; Participants in the house-to-house examination were mainly volunteer physicians and residents. On the contrary, other residents did not support the inspection and that the disinfecting plan was not being done in good faith. Believing a second quarantine would be soon implemented, worried residents began to flee quietly and hide in friends' houses outside of [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]].&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press"/&gt;

As days passed, more dead bodies were reported and autopsies revealed the presence of plague bacilli, indicating that a plague epidemic had hit San Francisco's Chinatown, but the health board still was trying to deny it. The health board attempted to keep all the information regarding the outbreak secret by implementing strict regulations of what physicians could write official death certificates.&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press" /&gt; Nevertheless, newspapers published the news of the presence of bubonic plague in San Francisco  to the entire nation.

The official inspection and disinfection of Chinatown finally began, thanks to the monetary contributions of the supervisors of the volunteer physicians, policemen, and inspectors that participated in the actual disinfection campaign. The sanitizing of Chinatown began to show results as the death toll slowly dropped throughout the month of March and the beginning of April.&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press" /&gt; Towards the end of April, the corpse of Law An, a Chinese laborer from a village near the [[Sacramento River]], was found in an alley in Chinatown. The cause of death of Law An was determined to be bubonic plague. After that, a few more Chinese residents that died suddenly were determined to be infested with plague bacilli.&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press" /&gt; The fear that the bubonic plague was spreading intensified.

The controversy of the vaccination program organized by Kinyoun with the help of Surgeon General Wyman spiked. The plan was to inoculated the Chinese residents with [[Waldemar Haffkine|Haffkine's vaccine]], a prophylactic anti-plague vaccine, that was intended to provide some protection against the plague for a 6-month period, no one spoke about the side effects and that the vaccine was still not approved for humans.&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press" /&gt; Most Chinese residents refused and demanded the vaccine to be tested in rats first. At first, representative of the Chinese community had agreed that inoculating the population with such serum could be a reasonable and safe solution, but soon after agreed with the rest of the Chinese population in that it was not ethical to try the vaccine in humans first. The representatives from the [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association|Chinese Six companies]] demanded the vaccination program to be eliminated as an option.  With much pressure and insistence from the Chinese community, the vaccination program was detained, but by then hundreds of Chinese, Japanese, other residents had already received the vaccine and were presenting horrific side effects from the injection.&lt;ref name="The Johns Hopkins University Press" /&gt;

===1901===

[[Joseph J. Kinyoun]] was feeling the pressure of the public to clear his reputation. He summoned the help of U.S. Surgeon General [[Walter Wyman]] to bring someone from the outside to investigate Kinyouns's procedures. In December 1900 Wyman selected Assistant Surgeon General Joseph H. White to manage the investigation surrounding all of the Pacific Coast stations. White wanted to focus on how food was handled while being imported from China and Japan. Kinyoun tried to hinder these advances because he did not want to publicly admit that there was an outbreak. White made his appearance in January 1901. White and Kinyoun attented the autopsy of Chun Way Lung who was said to have suffered from gonorrhea. Wilfred Kellogg and Henry Ryfkogel conducted the autopsy and achieved respect from White by revealing that Lung had died from the [[bubonic plague]]. White concluded that Kinyoun's bacteriological confirmation could no longer be credible.&lt;ref name="Risse, Guenter B. 2012 pp. 167-174"&gt;1932–, Risse, Guenter B., (2012). Plague, fear, and politics in San Francisco's Chinatown. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 167-174. {{ISBN|9781421405100}}. OCLC 809317536&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor Gage refused to support the diagnoses that were verified by the competent Pasteurians in San Francisco. Kinyoun was starting to express his frustration and suggested that independent outside experts confirm that the plague was present. White agreed and passed this information to the surgeon general. Kinyoun desired that his reputation be restored and that his findings were valid so that he could continue to investigate plague cases.
On January 26, Flexner, Novy, and Barker arrived in San Francisco. The three scientists were appointed to an official commission to prove if the plague existed.&lt;ref name="Risse, Guenter B. 2012 pp. 167-174"/&gt;

Gage reacted by sending a telegram to President [[William McKinley]] urging that the federal experts work with state health authorities. Gage's request was not granted because the federal government wanted the commission to be allowed to work independently. They would relay all of their findings to the treasury department and then forwarded to Gage. Flexner, Novy, and Barker scheduled an inspection of the sick and dead on February 6. The federal investigators split up the duties. Novy carried out bacteriological tests, while Barker accompanied by a Chinese interpreter visited the sick. By February 12, the team had studied six cases that all identified the characteristics of bubonic plaque. This was confirmed by pathological and bacteriological data. Flexner, Novy, and Barker completed their investigation on February 16. They met with Governor Gage the same day and informed him of their conclusion.&lt;ref name="Risse, Guenter B. 2012 pp. 167-174"/&gt;

Gage was upset and accused them of being a threat to public health. Over the next few weeks Gage questioned the diagnoses and blocked the publication of the final report. He blamed the commission for being bias and influenced by Kinyoun. Finally the two senators for California proposed that Gage needed to engage in friendly cooperation with federal authorities. Gage sent representatives to Washington to reach an agreement for federal authorities to suppress their findings concerning the plague in San Francisco. The federal authorities agreed to these demands after Gage's representatives verbally pledged to manage a sanitary campaign in Chinatown. This would be done secretively under the guidance of an expert from the [[Marine Hospital Service]] This deal was designed to avoid impairing the state's reputation and economy. Surgeon general Wyman took the majority of the blame. He was accused of violating U.S. laws and breaking international agreements that required him to notify all nations that there was an existence of contagious disease. Wyman and President McKinley destroyed the credibility of the American public health in the eyes of the nation and abroad.&lt;ref name="Risse, Guenter B. 2012 pp. 167-174"/&gt;

===1902===
Countering the continued denials made by San Francisco-based newspapers, reports from the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' and the [[Associated Press]] describing the plague's spread, publicly announced the outbreak throughout the United States. The state governments of [[Colorado]], [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] imposed quarantines of California - arguing that since the state had refused to admit to a health crisis within its borders, states receiving rail or shipping cargo from California ports had the duty to protect themselves.&lt;ref name=Skubik2002/&gt; Threats of a national quarantine grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3296|title=Migration and Disease|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 1902 general elections approached, members of the [[Southern Pacific]] board and the "Railroad Republican" faction&lt;ref&gt;For the "Railroad Republicans", see W. H. Hutchinson, "Prologue to Reform: the California Anti-Railroad Republicans, 1899–1905", ''Southern California Quarterly'' 1962 '''44'''(3): 175–218.&lt;/ref&gt; increasingly saw Gage as an embarrassment to state [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]]. Gage's public denials of the plague outbreak were to protect the state's economy and the business interests of his political allies.&lt;ref name="Gage denies plague epidemic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skubik2002/&gt; However, reports from federal agencies and certain newspapers continued to prove Gage incorrect. At the state Republican convention that year, the Railroad Republican faction refused Gage's renomination for governorship. In his place, former [[Mayor of Oakland]] [[George Pardee]], a German-trained medical physician, received the nomination. Pardee's nomination was largely a compromise between the Railroad Republican factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://governors.library.ca.gov/21-pardee.html|title=George Pardee 1903–1907|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final speech, to the California State Legislature, in early January 1903, Gage continued to deny the outbreak. He blamed the federal government, in particular, Kinyoun, the MHS, and the San Francisco Board of Health for damaging the state's economy.&lt;ref name="Gage denies plague epidemic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Skubik2002/&gt;

Adult Seckel mice display accelerated ageing.&lt;ref name="pmid19620979" /&gt; These findings are consistent with the [[DNA damage theory of aging]].

==Symptoms==
Symptoms include:
* [[intellectual disability]] (more than half of the patients have an IQ below 50)
* [[microcephaly]]
* sometimes [[pancytopenia]] (low blood counts)
* [[cryptorchidism]]
* low birth weight
* dislocations of pelvis and elbow
* unusually large eyes
* low ears
* small chin

==Genetics==
It is supposed to be caused by defects of genes on [[chromosome]] [[Chromosome 3 (human)|3]] and [[Chromosome 18 (human)|18]]. One form of Seckel syndrome can be caused by mutation in the gene encoding the [[ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related]] protein ({{Gene|ATR}}) which maps to chromosome 3q22.1-q24. This gene is central in the cell's DNA damage response and repair mechanism.

'''Sexual sadism disorder''' is the condition of experiencing [[sexual arousal]] in response to the extreme pain, suffering or [[humiliation]] of others.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.).'' Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several other terms have been used to describe the condition, and the condition may overlap with other conditions that involve inflicting pain.  It is distinct from situations in which consenting individuals use mild or simulated pain or humiliation for sexual excitement.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K., &amp; Blanchard, R. (1986). The concept of courtship disorder. ''Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy, 12,'' 79-92.&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''[[sexual sadism disorder|sadism]]'' and ''[[wikt:sadist|sadist]]'' are derived from [[Marquis de Sade]].

==Related terms and conditions==

===Current terminology===
''Sexual sadism disorder'' is the term employed by the current version of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] ([[DSM-5]]) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;  It refers to the "recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the physical or psychological suffering of another person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors" (p.&amp;nbsp;696).  It is classified as one of the [[paraphilia]]s, called an "[[algolagnia|algolagnic disorder]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;685), which is one of the "anomalous activity preferences" (p.&amp;nbsp;685).  The formal diagnosis of ''Sexual Sadism Disorder'' would apply if the individual has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person or if the urges cause significant distress to the individual.

''Sadomasochism'' appears in the current version of the [[ICD|International Classification of Diseases]] ([[ICD-10]]) of the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name =ICD10&gt;World Health Organization. (2007). ''International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems (10th rev., version for 2007). Retrieved from http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/index.htm?gf60.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  It refers to the "preference for sexual activity that involves bondage or the infliction of pain or humiliation" (p.&amp;nbsp;172), and divides sadomasochism into ''sadism'' and ''masochism'' according to whether the individual prefers to be the provider or recipient of it.  The ICD-10 specifies that mild forms of sadomasochism "are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity" (p.&amp;nbsp;172), and that the diagnosis would apply only if the behavior is preferred or required for sexual gratification.  The condition is classified as one of the disorders of sexual preference, which includes the paraphilias (p.&amp;nbsp;170).

''Paraphilic coercive disorder'' refers to the preference for non-consenting over consenting sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, D. (2010). Evidence regarding the need for a diagnostic category for a coercive paraphilia. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39,'' 411-418.&lt;/ref&gt;  It differs from sexual sadism disorder in that although the individual with this disorder may inflict pain or threats of pain in order to gain the compliance of the victim, the infliction of pain is not the actual goal of the individual.  
The condition is typically described as a paraphilia and continues to undergo research, but does not appear in the current DSM or ICD.  Alternate terms for the condition have included ''Biastophilia,''&lt;ref name = Cantor2014&gt;Cantor, J. M., &amp; Sutton, K. S. (2014). Paraphilia, gender dysphoria, and hypersexuality. In P. H. Blaney &amp; T. Millon (Eds.), ''Oxford textbook of psychopathology'' (3rd ed.) (pp. 589–614). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coercive Paraphilic Disorder,''&lt;ref&gt;Quiney, V. L. (2010). Coersive paraphilic disorder. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39,'' 405-410.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Preferential Rape.''&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K., &amp; Seto, M. C. (1998). Preferential rape in the theory of courtship disorder. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 27,'' 433-443.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BDSM]] or "bondage/discipline dominance/submission sadomasochism" is a colloquial term referring to the subculture of individuals who willingly engage in consenting forms of mild or simulated pain or humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal, A. (2009). ''Forensic and medico-legal aspects of sexual crimes and unusual sexual practices.'' New York: Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not currently a diagnosable condition in either the DSM or ICD system.  Alternative terms have included ''Bondage and Discipline (B&amp;D),'' ''Domination and Submission (D&amp;S),'' and ''Sadism and Masochism (S&amp;M)''. In scientific research, this sexual preference has also been called the hyperdominance pattern of sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K., Scher, H., &amp; Hucker, S. (1983). The courtship disorders. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 12,'' 369-379.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike individuals with sexual sadism disorder or paraphilic coercive disorder, individuals with ''hyperdominance'' seek to provoke pleasure in their partner(s) with the pain/humiliation.&lt;ref name = Cantor2014/&gt;

===Previous terminology===
''Sexual sadism'' is the term previously employed by the DSM-III-R,&lt;ref name = DSM3R&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1987). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., revised).'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; DSM-IV,&lt;ref name= DSM4&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1994). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.).'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; and DSM-IV-TR,&lt;ref name = DSM4TR&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.).'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was classified as a paraphilia.  In these versions of the DSM, sexual sadism pertained only to the infliction of real (not simulated) suffering (p.&amp;nbsp;530).  The condition was renamed ''sexual sadism disorder'' in DSM-5.

Sexual sadism was the term employed in the DSM-III,&lt;ref name = DSM3&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1980). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed.).'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; classifying the condition as a paraphilia.  The DSM-III noted that "the imagery in a Paraphilia, such as simulated bondage, may be playful and harmless and acted out with a mutually consenting partner….In more extreme form, paraphilic imagery is acted out with a nonconsenting partner, and is noxious and injurious to the partner" (p.&amp;nbsp;267). In DSM-III, sexual sadism could be diagnosed if:
# the person repeatedly and intentionally inflicted suffering on a nonconsenting person, to experience sexual excitement
# repeatedly or exclusively preferred simulated or mild suffering with a consenting sexual partner
# employs extensive, permanent, or potentially fatal suffering to achieve sexual excitement, regardless of the consent of the other person.

''Sadism'' was the term employed by the DSM-II.&lt;ref name = DSM2&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1968). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (2nd ed.).'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;  In that manual, the condition was classified as a sexual deviation, which was used to describe "individuals whose sexual interests are directed primarily toward…coitus performed under bizarre circumstances" (p.&amp;nbsp;44).  The term "paraphilia" did not exist in the DSM-II, and diagnoses did not have specific criteria until DSM-III.

''Sexual sadism'' was the phrase mentioned in DSM-I as one of the sexual deviations&lt;ref name = DSM1&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1952). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual: Mental Disorders.'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;39), but neither it (nor any of the other sexual deviations) received a specific label or diagnostic criteria.  The term paraphilia did not exist in the DSM-II, and diagnoses did not have specific criteria until DSM-III.

[[Sadistic personality disorder]] does not actually refer to any sexual interest and instead refers to the pervasive disregard for the well-being of others.  It is usually associated with a history of violence and criminality (which can include, but is not limited to sexual crimes).

==Features==
With paraphilic coercive disorder, the individual employs enough force to subdue a victim, but with sexual sadism disorder, the individual often continues to inflict harm regardless of the compliance of the victim, which sometimes escalates not only to the death of the victim,&lt;ref name = Dietz1990&gt;Dietz, P. E., Hazelwood, R. R., &amp; Warren, J. (1990). The sexually sadistic criminal and his offenses. ''Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, 18,'' 163-178.&lt;/ref&gt; but also to the mutilation of the body.  What is experienced by the sadist as sexual does not always appear obviously sexual to non-sadists: Sadistic rapes do not necessarily include penile penetration of the victim.  In a survey of offenses, 77% of cases included sexual bondage, 73% included anal rape, 60% included blunt force trauma, 57% included vaginal rape, and 40% included penetration of the victim by a foreign object.&lt;ref name = Dietz1990/&gt;  Moreover, in 40% of cases, the offender kept a personal item of the victim as a souvenir.&lt;ref name = Dietz1990/&gt;

On personality testing, sadistic rapists apprehended by law enforcement have shown elevated traits of impulsivity, hypersexuality, callousness, and psychopathy.&lt;ref&gt;Barbaree, H. E., Seto, M. C., Serin, R. C., Amos, N. L., &amp; Preston, D. L. (1994). Comparisons between sexual and nonsexual rapist subtypes: Sexual arousal to rape, offense precursors, and offense characteristics. ''Criminal Justice and Behavior, 21,'' 95-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there appears to be a continuum of severity from mild (''hyperdominance'' or ''BDSM'') to moderate (''paraphilic coercive disorder'') to severe ('sexual sadism disorder), it is not clear if they are genuinely related or only appear related superficially.&lt;ref name=Cantor2014/&gt;

Very little is known about how sexual sadism disorder develops.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;  Most of the people diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder come to the attention of authorities by committing sexually motivated crimes.&lt;ref name=Krueger2010&gt;Krueger, R. B. (2010). The DSM diagnostic criteria for sexual sadism. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 39,'' 325-345.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys have also been conducted to include people who are interested in only mild and consensual forms of sexual pain/humiliation (BDSM).&lt;ref name = Krueger2010/&gt;

Most of the people with full-blown sexual sadism disorder are male, whereas the sex ratio of people interested in BDSM is closer to 2:1 male-to-female.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, M. (1974). ''Sexual behavior in the 1970s.'' Chicago: Playboy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, A., Pomeroy, W. B., Martin, C. E., &amp; Gebhard, P. H. (1953). ''Sexual behavior in the human female.'' Philadelphia, PA: W. B. Saunders.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breslow, N., Evans, L., &amp; Langley, J. (1985). On the prevalence and roles of females in the sadomasochistic subculture: Report of an empirical study. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 14,'' 303-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

People with sexual sadism disorder'' are at an elevated likelihood of having other paraphilic sexual interests.&lt;ref name =DSM5/&gt;

==Typology==
Criminologist [[Lee Mellor]] created a six typology of sexually sadistic homicide offenders, based upon a combination of three binary factors&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homicide: A Forensic Psychology Casebook|last=Mellor|first=Lee|publisher=CRC Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=136-139}}&lt;/ref&gt;:                             ''Destructive'' versus ''Preservative'': Destructive sex sadists [[Mutilation|mutilate]] the bodies of their living victims, while Preservative sex sadists do not.                                          ''Prolonged'' versus ''Brief'':  The Prolonged sex sadist [[Torture|tortures]] his victim for an hour or more, while the Brief sex sadist does so over less time.                                            ''Elaborate'' versus ''Simple'': Where Simple sex sadists tend to use one or two methods of [[torture]], Elaborate sadists have three of the following four characteristics, (i) variation in torture methods, (ii) complex torture apparatus, (iii) psychological torture, (iv) record making (e.g.,using notes/media to document the process).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;          This renders eight possible categories, six of which Mellor was able to find multiple criminal offenders to exemplify:

This typology is compatible with the [[Necrophilia|necrophilia typology]], producing hybrid categories which help to understand the totality of the offender's [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] desires.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Biography==
Stuart B.

Dr. Levy led the discovery of the first energy-dependent antibiotic [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] mechanism and efflux protein (for [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracyclines]]).&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; His research into [[multiple drug resistance]] revealed a regulatory locus, mar, for intrinsic antibiotic resistance and virulence among the Enterobacteriaceae and other bacteria.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; He led the first, and perhaps only, prospective farm study showing that feed containing low dose antibiotics led to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in animals and the farm family.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; He has published over 300 papers, edited four books and two special journal editions devoted to antibiotic use and resistance.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; His 1992 book, ''The Antibiotic Paradox: How Miracle Drugs Are Destroying the Miracle'', now in its second edition, has been translated into four languages.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

Dr. Levy received his medical degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], completed his residency at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and performed postdoctoral research at the National Institutes of Health.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; He is a Fellow of the [[American College of Physicians]], [[Infectious Disease Society of America]], the [[American Academy of Microbiology]] and the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; He was Chairperson of the U.S. Fogarty Center study of “Antibiotic use and resistance worldwide” and helped write the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment report on antibiotic resistant bacteria.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; He consults for international and national organizations including the [[World Health Organization]], the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] and [[Institute of Medicine]], the U.S. FDA and U.S. EPA.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; In 1995 he received the Hoechst Roussel Award for esteemed research in antimicrobial chemotherapy from the American Society for Microbiology and has been awarded honorary degrees from Wesleyan and Des Moines Universities.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; Dr. Levy received the 2011 Hamao Umezawa Memorial Award by the International Society of Chemotherapy and the 2012 Abbott-ASM Lifetime Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;https://paratekpharma.com/about/founders/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Truth Initiative was founded in 1999 as a result of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|Master Settlement Agreement]] (MSA).  The MSA was announced in 1998, resolving the lawsuits brought by 46 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and five territories against the major U.S. cigarette companies, to recover state [[Medicaid]] and other costs from caring for sick smokers.  The four other states settled separately.  The tobacco industry agreed to pay the states billions of dollars in perpetuity, making the MSA the then-largest civil litigation settlement in U.S. history.  The states directed that a portion of the money they received from the settlement should be used to establish a national public health foundation dedicated to prevent youth smoking and helping smokers quit: the American Legacy Foundation, now Truth Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naag.org/assets/redesign/files/msa-tobacco/MSA.pdf|title=Master Settlement Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=National Association of Attorneys General|access-date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the Truth Initiative partnered with Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Ad Council to combat opioid addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://truthinitiative.org/news/expanding-our-mission-opioid-education-and-prevention-campaign|title=Expanding our mission with an opioid prevention campaign|date=2018-06-06|work=Truth Initiative|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/06/07/trump-administration-launches-opioid-education-campaign/676809002/|title=White House launches opioid education campaign that targets young people using shock value|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

=== Truth Campaign ===
{{Main|Truth (anti-tobacco campaign)}}

Truth Initiative's signature program is its Truth campaign, a youth smoking prevention mass media public education program that has been widely credited with contributing to a significant drop in teen smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2016.pdf|title=Monitoring the Future National Survey Results on Drug Use 1975-2016|last=|first=|date=|website=Monitoring the Future|access-date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, 23% of American 8th, 10th and 12th graders smoked.  As of 2016, that figure was 6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/resources/audio/podcast-using-tobacco-money-t/6319/|title=Podcast: Using Tobacco Money to Stamp Out Youth Smoking|website=The Chronicle of Philanthropy|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign exposes tobacco industry practices as well as the health effects and social consequences of smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Advocacy-Group-Shows-How/234836|title=Advocacy Group Shows How Rebranding Can Rebuild Momentum|date=2016-01-07|work=The Chronicle of Philanthropy|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Truth Initiative Schroeder Institute ===
Researchers in the Truth Initiative Schroeder Institute publish dozens of peer-reviewed research articles each year with the goal of identifying methods to minimize the harms of tobacco use, measure the effectiveness of interventions and identify best practices for tobacco control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://truthinitiative.org/our-mission|title=Our Mission|work=Truth Initiative|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research is also done to assess the Truth campaign's efforts, both pre-and post-market, including the use of the longitudinal Truth Longitudinal Cohort (TLC) survey of more than 10,000 young people and a continuous tracking study to assess campaign awareness and message receptivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3049629/how-the-truth-campaign-plans-to-end-youth-smoking-once-and-for-all|title=How The Truth Campaign Plans To End Youth Smoking Once And For All|date=2015-08-13|work=Fast Company|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s the American Legacy Foundation (as the Truth Initiative was then known) gave around $10 million of the settlement funds it managed to the [[University of California San Francisco]] (USCF) to help it formalize and expand the collection of internal tobacco industry documents that its library already hosted; the collection was then named the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library.&lt;ref name=Hurt2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hurt|first1=RD|last2=Ebbert|first2=JO|last3=Muggli|first3=ME|last4=Lockhart|first4=NJ|last5=Robertson|first5=CR|title=Open doorway to truth: legacy of the Minnesota tobacco trial.|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date=May 2009|volume=84|issue=5|pages=446–56|doi=10.1016/S0025-6196(11)60563-6|pmid=19411441|pmc=2676127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: American legacy foundation's $15 million gift creates permanent home for tobacco industry documents at UCSF|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2001/D/200114836.html|work=University of California - San Francisco|date=January 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409200744/http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2001/D/200114836.html|archivedate=April 9, 2005|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of May 2017, the library contained 14.7 million internal documents (nearly 89 million pages) created by major tobacco companies related to their advertising, manufacturing, marketing, sales and scientific research activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/about/data/|title=Legacy Tobacco Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community and Youth Engagement ===
Truth Initiative provides individuals, coalitions, and organizations information and methods to reduce tobacco use in their communities.  The organization trains and educates young people interested in tobacco control and partners with community-serving organizations to reduce tobacco use.  This includes a grant program for community colleges and [[historically black colleges and universities]] to create tobacco-free campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://truthinitiative.org/community-and-youth-engagement|title=community and youth engagement|date=2015-08-27|work=Truth Initiative|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of youth activism programs include:
* National Summit on Youth Activism: A training program for high school students that provides activism strategies, media training and approaches to community engagement
* Youth Activism Fellowship: A year-long training program for young adults that prepares participants to carry out a tobacco control project in his or her community
These community engagement programs are often an "on the ground" extension of the Truth campaign's work.  Supporters of the campaign are called upon to support other anti-tobacco issues, such as a 2017 rally outside a Walgreens shareholders meeting in New York that was organized to pressure the pharmacy's board of directors to stop selling tobacco in its stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2017/01/26/group-calls-on-walgreens-to-end-sales-of-tobacco-products-.html|title=Group Calls on Walgreens to End Sales of Tobacco Products|work=TWC News|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BecomeAnEx is a program that was created in 2008; it is a free, online community and set of resources for individuals who want to quit smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-health/2016/12/15/do-smoking-cessation-online-communities-actually-help-people-quit/|title=Do smoking cessation online communities actually help people quit? - On Health|date=2016-12-15|work=On Health|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovations ===
The innovations center within Truth Initiative designs, builds and markets digital smoking cessation and prevention products that are centered around online social networks, text messaging and web and mobile applications.  Any revenue generated by the innovations programs helps support other work at the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://truthinitiative.org/our-mission|title=Our Mission|work=Truth Initiative|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of these programs include:

* BecomeAnEX: Created in 2008, BecomeAnEX is a free, online resource for individuals who want to quit smoking.  Its website hosts a community forum and features blogs written by other smokers and ex-smokers that discuss quit strategies, challenges and successes.  In addition to the online community, the site offers cessation tools, counseling, medication information and other cessation support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-health/2016/12/15/do-smoking-cessation-online-communities-actually-help-people-quit/|title=Do smoking cessation online communities actually help people quit? - On Health|last=Cutrona|first=Sarah|date=2016-12-15|work=BioMed Central|access-date=2017-06-10|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* EX Program: Launched in 2017 in collaboration with [[Mayo Clinic]], the EX Program is a digital quit smoking program based on BecomeAnEx that health systems, health plans and employers can purchase and offer to their employees and members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://truthinitiative.org/news/how-employers-and-health-plans-can-save-money-and-help-people-quit-smoking|title=Digital quit-smoking program reduces the burden of smoking for employers|date=2017-05-10|work=Truth Initiative|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''universal stress protein''' ('''USP''') domain is a [[Protein superfamily|superfamily]] of [[conserved gene]]s which can be found in [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[fungi]], [[protozoa]] and [[plants]].&lt;ref name="Siegele et al"&gt;{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Siegele DA, etal | title=Universal Stress Proteins in Escherichia coli | journal=[[Journal of Bacteriology]] | volume=187 | year=2005 | pages=6253–6254 | doi=10.1128/jb.187.18.6253-6254.2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins containing the domain are induced by many environmental stressors such as nutrient starvation, drought, extreme temperatures, high salinity, and the presence of uncouplers, antibiotics and metals.&lt;ref name="Siegele et al" /&gt;

In the presence of these stressors, ''Usp'' genes are upregulated resulting in large quantities of Usp [[proteins]] being produced by the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. The over production of USP [[genes]] allows the [[organisms]] to better cope with stresses by largely unknown mechanisms. However, the USPs will alter the expression of a variety of genes that help to cope with stress.&lt;ref name="Tkaczuk KL 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Tkaczuk KL, etal | title=Structural and functional insight into the universal stress protein family | journal=[[Evolutionary Applications]] | volume=6 | year=2013 | pages=434–449 | doi= 10.1111/eva.12057}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

[[File:Haemophylus influenzae USP.png| 400px | thumb | The protein structure of a Universal Stress Protein found in ''Haemophylus influenzae'' &lt;ref name="Sousa et al 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Sousa MC | title=Structure of Haemophylus influenzae Universal Stress Protein At 1.85A Resolution. | journal=[[Structure (journal)|Structure]] | volume=9 | year=2001 | pages=1135–1141 | doi=10.2210/pdb1jmv/pdb}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The primary function of this superfamily is to protect the organism from [[environmental stress]] such as exposure to [[UV light]], which may induce [[genes]] containing the USP domain in order to protect the [[DNA]] and more generally the cell from further damage.&lt;ref name="Siegele et al" /&gt; During '''bacterial''' '''starvation''' the USP genes upregulated will often arrest [[cell growth]] and promote its metabolism to adapt to sparse [[nutrients]].&lt;ref name="Siegele et al" /&gt;

Recent research also suggests proteins containing this domain have functions beyond the realms of dealing with environmental stresses.&lt;ref name="Nachin et al 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Nachin L, etal | title=Differential Roles of the Universal Stress Proteins of Escherichia coli in Oxidative Stress Resistance, Adhesion, and Motility | journal=[[Journal of Bacteriology]] | volume=187 | year=2005 | pages=6265–6272 | doi=10.1128/JB.187.18.6265-6272.2005| pmc=1236625 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nachin et al. demonstrated in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' that USPs are involved in actions such as [[adhesion]] and [[motility]]. The researchers, through means of [[Gene knockout|"knocking out"]] USP genes known as ''UspE'' and ''UspC'', saw results suggesting an inability to swim and completely lack of motility, respectively. Conversely, mutants for genes ''UspF'' and ''UspG'' were shown to have enhanced swimming abilities. Therefore, mobility is affected both positively and negatively USPs within ''E. coli''. This demonstrates USPs influence throughout the cell could be widespread for a number of reasons.

Additionally, in ''Halmonas elongate'', there is a USP called TeaD has been described as a key regulator in the [[Membrane transport|transport]] of [[Ectoine]] across the cell membrane.&lt;ref name="Schweikhard"&gt;{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Schweikhard ES, etal | title= Structure and function of the universal stress protein TeaD and its role in regulating the ectoine transporter TeaABC of Halomonas elongata DSM 2581(T). | journal=[[Biochemistry (journal)|Biochemistry]] | volume=49 | year=2010 | pages= 2194–2204 | doi=10.1021/bi9017522}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates how versatile USPs can be. Their function, while primarily encompasses increasing survival during stressful conditions, is not always limited to this.

==Evolution==
The ubiquitous nature of these proteins suggests the domain evolved in an ancestral species as well as highlighting the clear biological significance these proteins have in order to  still be present the three domains of life. It has been suggested that the USP A domain was part of an ancient protein family. This is due to the similarity in structure between many distantly related organisms.&lt;ref name="Aravind"&gt;{{Cite journal  |vauthors=Aravind L, etal |title= Monophyly of class I aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, USPA, ETFP, photolyase, and PP-ATPase nucleotide-binding domains: implications for protein evolution in the RNA. | journal=[[Protein]] | volume=48 | year=2002| pages=1–14 | doi=10.1002/prot.10064}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aravind et al. confirmed these ideas with extensive evolutionary analysis. Aravind suggested that these proteins were part of a much larger protein structural family which was present and diversified in our last universal common ancestor for all extant life.&lt;ref name= "Aravind" /&gt;  
The original function has been suggested to be a nucleotide binding domain which was implicated in signal transduction &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Becker JD |title= The nodulin vfENOD18 is an ATP-binding protein in infected cells of Vicia faba L. nodules | journal=[[Plant Mol Biol]] | volume=47 | year=2001| pages=749–759}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
As the USP domain is widespread across many organisms, there is great diversity in the structures of these proteins. For ''Haemophilus influenzae'', its UspA resides in the cytoplasm. The protein forms an asymmetric [[Protein dimer|dimer]] with characteristic alpha and beta fold structures. There are differences among different bacteria in areas such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] [[binding sites]].&lt;ref name="Siegele et al" /&gt; In this case, UspA does not have ATP binding activity. Generally, USPs form dimers and have domains for [[nucleotide]] binding activity. However, as it is such a diverse group, often with little known about the exact structure, it’s not possible to comment on each USP. In addition to this, UspA may reside in different areas of the cell. For example, in this case it was in the [[cytoplasm]] but for others, it may be in the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref name="Sousa MC"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Sousa MC | title=Structure of the universal stress protein of Haemophilus influenzae.| journal=[[Bichemical Sciences]] | volume=9 | year=2001 | pages=1135–1141 | doi=10.1016/s0969-2126(01)00680-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bacteria==
Much of the research into USP is done on bacteria, specifically ''E. coli'' (Strain K-12). Consequently, much is known about the USP domains in bacteria. In ''E. coli'' there are six families of USP domains which are present in more than 1000 different proteins.&lt;ref name="Bateman A 2004"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Bateman A | title=The Pfam protein families database| journal=[[Nucleic Acids Research]] | volume=32 | year=2004 | pages=138–141 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkh121 | pmid=14681378 | pmc=308855}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The six families are Usp A, -C, -D, -E, -F and –G which are triggered by differing environmental insults and often act via varying mechanisms.&lt;ref name= "Bateman A 2004" /&gt;

UspA is the most commonly studied USP due to its widespread presence within bacterial genomes. UspA is especially implicated in the resistance of a huge number of stressors most notably tetracycline exposure and high temperatures, with the exception of not forming a response to cold shock. It is thought UspA is especially important to the recovery of ''E. coli'' following starvation of nutrients.&lt;ref name="Siegele et al" /&gt;  UspA during normal growth conditions does not seem to influence gene expression. However, during stressful conditions such as carbon starvation, UspA has been shown to have a global influence on gene expression. A proposed mechanism for such a change in [[gene expression]] is that UspA has been suggested to bind to DNA. When UspA is mutated, ''E. coli'' becomes far more vulnerable UV induced DNA damage.&lt;ref name="O'Toole R et al 2003"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It’s important to note the USP responses are independent of many other stress responses seen in bacteria such as [[rpoS]].&lt;ref name="Gustavsson et al 2002"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Gustavsson N | title=The universal stress protein paralogues of Escherichia coli are co-ordinately regulated and co-operate in the defence against DNA damage|journal=[[Molecular Microbiology (journal)|Molecular Microbiology]] | volume=43 | year=2002 | pages=107–117 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02720.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bacteria USP response.png|400px|thumb | This schematic shows a generalised bacterial response to an environmental stress. In this case, it depicts increased levels of Nitric Oxide which stimulates ''Usp'' gene transcription. This results in an anti-stress response from the cell which may or may not include the responses listed within the diagram.&lt;ref name="Zhang W et al 2013" /&gt;]]

The induction of USP proteins have also been implicated in transitions not only in metabolism or growth but in changes in the colonies' entire phenotype. Bacterial colonies can produce formations known as [[biofilms]]. Zhang and colleagues demonstrated that USPs may be involved in the promotion of intertidal biofilms.&lt;ref name="Zhang W et al 2013"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Zhang W| title=Adaptation of intertidal biofilm communities is driven by metal ion and oxidative stresses| journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=3 | year=2013 | pages=3180 | doi=10.1038/srep03180}}
&lt;/ref&gt; They observed that during stressful conditions involving metal ions and oxidative stresses that the biofilm phenotype would form. Upon analysis of these biofilms, it could be seen that there was a greatly upregulated level of UspA which Zhang suggests, may be involved with induction of biofilm formation. It is thought UspA may be involved in signalling processes which will upregulate genes involved with biofilm production.&lt;ref name= "Gustavsson et al 2002" /&gt; With findings such as these, it's beginning to be accepted that USPs are acting using an extremely wide range of mechanisms to ensure cell survival.

===Regulation===
In bacteria, the USP genes can be regulated by sigma factors within [[RNA polymerase]]s. This includes sigma factor σ70 which through binding to a single promoter region, upregulates the transcription of UspA in bacteria. The genes are regulated in a monocistronic fashion.&lt;ref name="Kvint K et 2003"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Kvint K | title=The bacterial universal stress protein: function and regulation.| journal=[[Curr Opin Microbiol]] | volume=6 | year=2013 | pages=140–145}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, UspA, UspC, UspD and UspE are over induced during stationary phase through regulation of RecA. RecA is known for its involvement in the repair of DNA via [[homologous recombination]] following [[DNA damage|damage]]. Consequently, the four Usp domain genes are thought to be mediating the management or protection of DNA.&lt;ref name="Diez A 2002"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Diez A | title=The universal stress protein A of Escherichia coli is required for resistance to DNA damaging agents and is regulated by a RecA/FtsK-dependent regulatory pathway.|journal=[[Molecular Microbiology (journal)|Molecular Microbiology]] | volume=36 | year=2002 | pages=1494–1503}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the mechanism exhibited by the proteins, one thing which can be concluded is that USP domains are crucial for survival of many bacterial species. Gomes et al. found that UspA deletions in ''Listeria'' severely impaired survival as well as listeria’s stress response by [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]].&lt;ref name="Gomes CS 2011"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Gomes CS| title=Universal Stress Proteins Are Important for Oxidative and Acid Stress Resistance and Growth of Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e In Vitro and In Vivo.| journal=[[PLOS]] | volume=6 | year=2011 | pages=e24965 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024965}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

USP domain genes are regulated by a number of proteins involved with [[Cell growth|growth]], [[DNA repair]] and [[cell division]]. Notable positive regulation occurs via the action of [[ppGpp]], [[RecA]] and [[FtsZ]] dependent regulatory pathways. USP domain genes are also under the negative control of FadR.

==Plants==
[[Plants]] contain many hundreds of USP domains and genes. These genes are notably induced by environmental stresses such as [[drought]]. When a lack of [[Tissue hydration|hydration]] occurs, biochemical changes induced by the actions of USPs ensue. In response to drought, there is a reduction in [[photosynthetic]] [[carbon]] production as well as a reduction in [[energy metabolism]].&lt;ref name="Isokpehi RD"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Isokpehi RD | title=Identification of drought-responsive universal stress proteins in viridiplantae.| journal=[[bioinform Biol Insights]] | volume=5 | year=2011 | pages= 41–58 | doi=10.4137/BBI.S6061}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These actions are suggested to occur due to their implications in increasing energy conservation. Water limiting conditions are a common environmental pressure which plants will need to cope with on a regular basis, depending on their habitat. These resistant [[phenotypes]] will have an increased survival as they allow the plant to conserve energy in times of restricted water which is key to [[glucose]] production through [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name= "Isokpehi RD" /&gt;

==Clinical significance==

===Tuberculosis===
[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]], the infectious agent responsible for [[Tuberculosis]] (TB), persists within an estimated two billion people. TB is known for its ability to transition into a latent state whereby there is slow growth but high persistence within the mammalian host in structures known as [[granulomas]].&lt;ref name="Ramakrishnan L"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Ramakrishnan L | title=Revisiting the role of the granuloma in tuberculosis| journal=[[Nature Reviews]] | volume=12 | year=2012 | pages=352–366 | doi= 10.1038/nri3211}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These granuloma structures are made up of various cellular materials and immune cells. These include macrophages, neutrophils, cellulose and fats. It has long been proposed that USPs play a significant role in the persistence of TB within the human host. This is due to observations of elevated ''Usp'' genes within ''M. tuberculosis'' in the latent granuloma stage of the infection.&lt;ref name="O'Toole R" /&gt;

There are eight types of USPs within ''M. tuberculosis'', all of which have an ATP binding domain. It has been found that within ''M. tuberculosis'', these USPs are regulated by FtsK and FadR.&lt;ref name="Drumm JE" /&gt; One recent finding shows that the induction of USPs within ''M. tuberculosis'' results in USP binding activity with intracellular cAMP which has indirect implications on transcription within the bacteria.&lt;ref name="Banerjee et al"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Banerjee A | title=A Universal Stress Protein (USP) in Mycobacteria binds cAMP| journal=[[The Journal of Biological Chemistry]] | volume=12 | year=2015 | pages= 1–28 | doi= 10.1074/jbc.M115.644856| pmc=4432290}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of ''M. tuberculosis''' USPs are suggested to be induced by the [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] conditions found within the granuloma. Specifically, Rv2623, a type of USP in ''M. tuberculosis'', is induced by the presence of [[nitric oxide]], [[reactive oxygen species]] and a downshift in [[pH]]. All of these conditions are suggested to be produced by the actions of [[macrophages]] which are particularly prevalent within the granuloma structures that are characteristic of TB latent infections.&lt;ref name="O'Toole R"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=O'Toole R | title=Universal stress proteins and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.| journal=[[Research in Microbiology]] | volume=6 | year=2003 | pages= 387–392}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These conditions have been found to upregulate a particular USP gene called ''rv2623'', as well as an additional 50 genes involved in long term persistence in the mammalian host. It was suggested this USP gene was involved in inducing the latent response within the mammalian host. This stage of the infection is currently chronic with no effective treatments. This makes these kinds of findings extremely valuable.

Rv2623 has an ATP binding domain which if knocked out results in a hyper-virulent form of the bacteria.&lt;ref name="Drumm JE"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Drumm JE | title=Mycobacterium tuberculosis universal stress protein Rv2623 regulates bacillary growth by ATP-Binding: requirement for establishing chronic persistent infection.| journal=[[PLoS Pathog.]] | volume=5 | year=2009 | pages= e1000460 | doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000460}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding these processes aids researchers in their quest to provide effective treatment for those suffering from TB. Rv2623 is also a key [[biomarker]] aiding the diagnostic process for TB. Therefore, these USP genes could be crucial for the long term survival of the bacteria meaning that there may be potential therapeutic avenues of research to explore in treating latent TB.&lt;ref name="Hingley-Wilson"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Hingley-Wilson SM | title=Individual Mycobacterium tuberculosis universal stress protein homologues are dispensable in vitro| journal=[[Tuberculosis]] | volume=90 | year=2010 | pages= 236–244 | doi=10.1016/j.tube.2010.03.013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This comes at a time whereby TB kills many thousands of people a day and is becoming increasing problematic to treat with the rise of [[Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|multi-drug-resistant TB]].

===Salmonella===
Similarly, USPs are crucial for the survival of [[Salmonella]], the causative agent in Salmonellosis. In [[developing countries]], food poisoning of this kind is a potentially life-threatening condition. The USPs have influence in growth arrest, stress responses and virulence.&lt;ref name="Liu WT"&gt;
{{Cite journal | author=Liu WT | title=Role of the universal stress protein UspA of Salmonella in growth arrest, stress and virulence| journal=[[Microbial Pathogenesis]] | volume=42 | year=2007 | pages= 2–10 | doi=10.1016/j.micpath.2006.09.002}}
&lt;/ref&gt; UspA is induced by [[metabolic]], [[oxidative]] and [[temperature]] related stress. In these conditions UspA is over produced through the [[transcriptional regulation]] by ppGpp and RecA. These responses have been suggested to be involved in the protection of DNA. As a result, UspA aids Salmonella to resist stressors produced by the mammalian [[immune system]] assisting in survival and hence, pathogenicity.&lt;ref name="Liu WT" /&gt; When UspA is inactivated in Salmonella, the mutants die prematurely, demonstrating how crucial these proteins are to survival and persistence. Again, understanding these processes may aid researchers in developing effective drugs to treat these infections.&lt;ref name="Liu WT" /&gt;
