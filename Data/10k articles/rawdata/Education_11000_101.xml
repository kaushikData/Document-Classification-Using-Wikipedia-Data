The '''American Association of Physics Teachers''' ('''AAPT''') was founded in 1930 for the purpose of "dissemination of knowledge of physics, particularly by way of teaching."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/aboutaapt/ About AAPT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 10,000 members that reside in over 30 countries. AAPT publications include two [[peer-reviewed journal]]s, the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'' and ''[[The Physics Teacher]]''. The association has two annual National Meetings (winter and summer) and has regional sections with their own meetings and organization. The association also offers grants and awards for physics educators, including the Richtmyer Memorial Award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/Programs/awards/richtmyer.cfm Richtmeyer Memorial Award, AAPT website]&lt;/ref&gt; and programs and contests for physics educators and students. It is headquartered at the American Center for Physics in [[College Park, Maryland]].

==History==
The American Association of Physics Teachers was founded on December 31, 1930, when forty-five physicists held a meeting during the joint [[American Physical Society|APS]]-AAAS meeting in Cleveland specifically for that purpose.

The AAPT became a founding member of the [[American Institute of Physics]] after the other founding members were convinced of the stability of the AAPT itself after a new constitution for the AAPT was agreed upon.

==Contests==
The AAPT sponsors a number of competitions. The [[Physics Bowl]], [[Six Flags]]' [[roller coaster]] contest, and the US Physics Team are just a few. The US physics team is determined by two preliminary exams and a week and a half long "boot camp." Each year, five members are selected to compete against dozens of countries in the [[International Physics Olympiad]] (IPHO).

'''Anticipatory democracy''' is a theory of [[civics]] relying on democratic [[decision making]] that takes into account [[futurology|predictions of future events]] that have some credibility with the electorate. The phrase was coined by [[Alvin Toffler]] in his book ''[[Future Shock]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=qsPgTpt_jrKEB5CI0IAF&amp;ct=result&amp;id=SvbQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Anticipatory+democracy%22&amp;q=Toffler#search_anchor | title=Anticipatory democracy | work=The Indian journal of public administration, Volume 26 | date=1980 | accessdate=December 8, 2011 | pages=879}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was expanded on in the 1978 book ''Anticipatory Democracy'', edited by [[Clement Bezold]].

Other well-known advocates of the anticipatory approach include [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Heidi Toffler]], [[K. Eric Drexler]], and [[Robin Hanson]]. They all advocate approaches where the public, not just experts, participate in this "anticipation".

The FutureMAP program of the [[Information Awareness Office]] program of the [[United States of America|United States]] government proposed a prediction market prior to its cancellation on July 29, 2003.

== Variants ==

[[Bioregional democracy]] can appear as a variant of anticipatory democracy in that it anticipates (using a similar scientific process) the [[ecological health]] outcomes of any given action. However it usually relies more on far less fragile means, and less on compared measures and quantities.

An alternative, [[deliberative democracy]], may combine with either the anticipatory or the bioregional model.  It relies less on formal models and a [[market system]] for betting on future events, and more on discussion.

Deliberative, anticipatory and bioregional approaches can all be considered variants of [[participatory democracy]] with different thresholds of ease of participation, [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], concern for non-human life or future generations, and reflection of participants' tolerances versus preferences or ideals of [[truth]].  Sometimes a deliberative model is described as more [[left-wing politics|"left"]] and an anticipatory model as more [[right-wing politics|"right"]]. Those who wish to avoid this debate and see merits to both approaches, e.g. [[Green politics|Greens]], usually prefer the generic term "[[participatory democracy]]". This term has become fundamental to [[green politics]] itself.
 
Other terms which likewise have more specific associations with advocates or methods include: [[grassroots democracy]], [[semi-direct democracy]], [[consensus democracy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11002">The '''Arts Olympiad''' is an international art competition for children ages 8 to 12 organized by [[International Child Art Foundation]] with one million participants from seventy countries. Each competition is four years long and it is held every four year. The competition includes the element of art and peace to encourage children around the world to use creativity and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promising Practices - Arts Olympiad|url=http://www.arizonahealthmatters.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=PromisePractice&amp;file=promisePractice&amp;pid=769|publisher=The Healthy Communities Institute|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dr. Ashfaq Ishaq, founder of the International Child Art Foundation, started the first Arts Olympiad competition in 1999&lt;ref name="1st-ao"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Arts Olympiad (1997-2000)|url=http://www.icaf.org/whatwedo/ao/1st-ao.php|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address the issue which was coined decades earlier as the "fourth grade slump" in creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Torrance|first=Ellis Paul|title=Understanding the fourth grade slump in creative thinking: final report|year=1967|publisher=University of Minnesota|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers at the time suggested that the phenomenon is a result of a drop in creativity around the ages of nine as they start conforming to [[standardized test]]ing and to please parents and teachers. The plan was to let children who were the winners of [[U.S. state]]s and other countries to come together in a festival to let them work together and learn other cultures with the goal to move future generations toward [[World peace|global peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Jane Hess|title=Get Out and Give Back: World Children’s Festival|url=http://www.washingtonlife.com/2011/06/13/get-out-and-give-back-world-children%E2%80%99s-festival/|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Washington Life Magazine|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme for the first Art Olympiad was ''My World in the Year 2000'' to ask children to create art in which they envisioned themselves in the [[new millennium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future Of Peace: Art By Young People|url=http://go.worldbank.org/HE9OOAUR30|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was one million children in 86 countries in the program which was run between 1997 and 2000. The winning pieced from around the world were exhibited at the ''World Children’s Festival'' in 1999 on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]]. The artworks were also later exhibited at the [[White House Millennium Council#White House Millennium Celebration|White House Millennium Celebration]], the [[United Nations Headquarters]], and the 2003 [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group|World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings]] in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="1st-ao"/&gt;

Since then the format of the global competition, a festival in Washington, DC and global exhibitions have been following in the next Arts Olympiad cycles. The 2nd Arts Olympiad was held between 2001 and 2004 with the theme of ''Me in the New Millennium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dally|first=Ashley|title=Me in the New Millennium.(Perspective)(ICAF's 2000-2004 Arts Olympiad)|journal=ChildArt|date=1 April 2003|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-140305540.html|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 3rd Arts Olympiad (2005-2008), the theme was shifted to relate art and sport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture of Peace Project and Resources: Arts Olympiad|url=http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/uk/uk_visu_projet.asp?Proj=00087|publisher=International Year for the Culture of Peace - Unesco|accessdate=8 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707045049/http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/uk/uk_visu_projet.asp?Proj=00087#|archive-date=2010-07-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the artist-athlete ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The President's Challenge / About / Advocates / Nonprofit|url=https://www.presidentschallenge.org/about/advocates/nonprofit.shtml|publisher=The President’s Council on Fitness, Sports &amp; Nutrition|accessdate=8 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025013502/https://www.presidentschallenge.org/about/advocates/nonprofit.shtml#|archive-date=2012-10-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth Arts Olympiad (2009-2012) continued the same theme with title ''My Favorite Sport''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCAC Partners International Child Art Foundation(ICAF) |url=http://www.ncac.gov.ng/ncacicf.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222172708/http://www.ncac.gov.ng/ncacicf.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 February 2013 |publisher=National Council for Arts &amp; Culture, Nigeria |accessdate=8 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection Process==
During the first two years of the competition, local schools are participated in the Arts Olympiad lesson plan. The artworks as the result of the lessons are then put into a selection process.

The selection process in the United States is first done from at the local [[school district]]. The selection of artworks from within a school or school district. The artworks are then submitted to Washington, DC for another selection to have a representative of each participating state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Berwick Academy selected to represent Maine at World Children's Festival|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110311/GJNEWS_01/703119949&amp;template=SouthernMaineRegion|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Fosters Daily Democrat|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, the partner in each country will administrate the selection. The selection can be in many phases involving the competition at the local level and at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=150 in Arts Olympiad|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/1/3/central/13010258&amp;sec=central|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=The Star Online|date=3 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gana niño mazatleco Olimpiada del Arte a nivel nacional|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones.php?id=660595&amp;id_seccion=84363|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Noroeste.com|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners who represent the participating U.S. states and countries are invited to the World Children's Festival in Washington, DC.

==World Children's Festival==
The World Children's Festival is a three-day festival held every four years on the National Mall in Washington, DC for winners of the Arts Olympiad to participate. The festival includes over 50 performances and many art-related workshops. It also has sessions for the winners from different countries to co-create artworks with many adult artists.&lt;ref name="south-south"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jordan |first=Richard |title=4th World Children's Festival Held at the National Mall in Washington, DC |url=http://www.southsouthnews.com/pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=c45230b5-620e-4126-9bfe-9bcfca02812b |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714104844/http://www.southsouthnews.com/pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=c45230b5-620e-4126-9bfe-9bcfca02812b |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |newspaper=South-South News |date=22 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Before the event, the Arts Olympiad winners from Washington, D.C. are asked to be ambassadors for the festival and exchange emails with international winners to welcome to the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Children's Festival|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/misc-events/the-world-childrens-festival,1209274/critic-review.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international winners are welcomed to the host families around the Washington area.

Children share ideas and work together during the three-day festival. On the last night of the festival, the celebratory dinner is held with all guests dressing in [[Folk costume|national attire]].&lt;ref name="south-south"/&gt;

Similar festivals have been replicated in other counties such as the European Children’s Festival at Olympia Park in Munich in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founder of World’s Largest Art Program for Children Earns The Academy’s Distinguished Service Award|url=http://ussa.edu/publications/news/2011/10/27/founder-of-worlds-largest-art-program-for-children-earns-the-academys-distinguished-service-award/|publisher=United States Sports Academy|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Exhibitions==
After the World Children's Festival, the winning pieces will travel to exhibitions in the U.S. and internationally. The past exhibitions have been in [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Japan]], [[Uganda]], [[Italy]], [[Egypt]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAF Exhibitions 1998-2011|url=http://icaf.org/pdfs/ICAF%20Exhibitions%201998-2011.pdf|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of Winners==
The organizer have seen the potential and the importance of Art Olympiad winners to promote the cause. An example was demonstrated when a winner from [[Peru]] who have gone through difficulties in arranging competition because there was no office of the Internal Child Art Foundation in the country, that child eventually set up and organize the competition in the country for the next season with the support from the [[Ministry of Education (Peru)|ministry of education]]. With that, they started encouraging the winners to contribute back to the program and set up a youth board for the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashfaq Ishaq Discusses Challenges Faced Due To Lack of Arts Education |url=http://www.eclips.cornell.edu/clip.do?id=5127&amp;clipID=5127&amp;tab=TabClipPage |publisher=Charles H.

===Youth Board Members===
In each cycle of the Arts Olympiad competition, a number of winners are choose to serve the youth board of the organization. Their roles are to be organization's [[spokesperson]]s, conduct fundraising to support the programs, write for ChildArt magazine, help stage and be the [[master of ceremonies]] at the World Children's Festival, and nominate innovative leaders, companies and organizations for the World Children's Award.

Since the formation of the youth board there have been 38 members from two dozen counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ICAF Youth Board|url=http://www.icaf.org/about/youth.php|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bernard Daly Educational Fund''' is an education [[trust fund]] established in 1922 for the benefit of students graduating from high school in [[Lake County, Oregon]].  It is the oldest continuously operated place-based college scholarship fund in the [[United States]]. The fund is managed by a local [[board of trustees]].  Its assets total over $6,800,000, making it one of the largest scholarship funds in [[Oregon]].

== Bernard Daly ==

[[Bernard Daly]] was a doctor, businessman, banker, rancher, state representative, state senator, county judge, and regent of Oregon State Agricultural College (now [[Oregon State University]]).  Daly was born in [[Ireland]] on February 17, 1858.  He immigrated to the [[United States]] with his parents in 1864.  After graduating from medical school, he joined the [[United States Army]].  In 1887, Daly left the army and moved to [[Lakeview, Oregon]] where he began a private medical practice. Over the years, Daly played a very important role in the economic development of Lake County, establishing a number of successful businesses.&lt;ref name="FEC"&gt;Cooper, Forest E., ''Introducing Dr. Daly'', Lake County Historical Society, Maverick Publications: Bend, Oregon, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaLande, Jeff and Cain Allen, [http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=F2976147-B540-BAE5-46F263903C3840DD "Dr. Bernard Daly"], The Oregon History Project, [[Oregon Historical Society]], ''www.ohs.org'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Daly died on January 4, 1920, he had business interests throughout Lake County.  He was the largest stockholder in the Bank of Lakeview.  He owned the largest ranch in south-central Oregon as well as a number of other businesses. He also owned at least 14 buildings in downtown Lakeview.  All together his partnerships and investments brought the value of his estate to almost $1,000,000, a very large sum in 1920.&lt;ref name="LCE"&gt;[http://www.irishsheepherders.com/dr_bernard_daly.htm "Dr. Bernard Daly Dies"], ''Lake County Examiner'' and ''Lakeview Herald'', Lakeview, Oregon, January 8, 1920 (posted on Irish Sheepherders of Lake County website, ''www.irishsheepherders.com'').&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship fund ==

In his will, Daly gave his fortune to the people of Lake County in the form of the Bernard Daly Educational Fund.  In his will, Daly wrote:

{{cquote|It is my earnest desire to help, aid and assist worthy and ambitious young men and women of my beloved county of Lake, to acquire a good education, so that they may be better fitted and qualified to appreciate and help to preserve the laws and constitution of this free country, defend its flag, and by their conduct as good citizens reflect honor on Lake county and the state of Oregon.&lt;ref name="FEC"/&gt;}}

The fact that his will specifically directed that Daly scholarships be granted to women as well as men was very progressive for that era.  Based on the terms of the will, the scholarships must be used to attend "schools, colleges, and technical schools of the State of Oregon."&lt;ref name="FEC"/&gt;

The first Daly Fund scholarships were awarded in 1922.&lt;ref name="FEC"/&gt;  Today, the education fund Daly established is the oldest continuously operating place-based college scholarship in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Sam, [http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/lakeview/about-this-blog Daly Fund Research Project], College of Education, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, accessed 14 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It provides scholarships to three Lake County high schools, located in Lakeview, [[Paisley, Oregon|Paisley]], and [[Silver Lake, Oregon|Silver Lake]].  Together, the three schools graduate approximately 100 students per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicschoolreview.com/county_schools/stateid/OR/county/41037 "Lake County High Schools – Oregon"], Public School Review, ''www.publicschoolreview.com'', January 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year, approximately 40 Lake County students attend college on Daly scholarships.

Since it was established in 1922, the Fund has continued to grow.  As of 2006, it had over $6,800,000 in assets available to support scholarships for Lake County students.&lt;ref name="IRS"/&gt;

The Bernard Daly Educational Fund is governed by a five-person board of trustees.  As of 2007, the trustees are:  Dr. Mike Sabin of Lakeview (chairman); James C.

'''Bishop Scott Academy''' was a school located in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]]. Affiliated with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the school was named for the [[Bishop]] [[Thomas F. Scott (bishop)|Thomas Fielding Scott]]. The school opened in 1870 to educate young men in good citizenship and prepare them to enter the ministry. Later a military department was added to the school before the academy closed in 1904. The school organized the first [[American football]] team and held the first football game in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in 1889.

==Prior schools==

=== Trinity School for Boys ===
The academy was related to an earlier attempt by Scott to found a diocesan school.&lt;ref name=hma/&gt; The Reverend William Richmond had started a school at [[Yamhill, Oregon|Yamhill]] in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Robson says that Richmond's school started at Yamhill, was moved to [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]], then to Lake Oswego.&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Scott moved Richmond's school to present-day [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]], where Scott had purchased 70 acres that included a school building dating to 1850. Here Scott established the Diocesan School for Boys.&lt;ref name=Marschner /&gt; Bernard Cornelius, a graduate of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], was appointed in 1856 by Scott as principal over 17 boarders. A primary department opened in 1858, and the school was renamed Trinity School for Boys. The school offered "both religious and secular education".&lt;ref name=Marschner /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tyler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=Robert L|title=Thomas Fielding Scott: Bishop of Oregon|journal=Oregon Historical Quarterly|date=March 1954|volume=1|issue=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornelius resigned in 1860, and the school closed for two years. In 1862 it reopened under leadership of the Reverend Michael Fackler. Although Cornelius returned to the reigns in 1863, he could not halt declining enrollment. Trinity school closed in 1866&lt;ref&gt;Tyler says the school closed in 1865.&lt;/ref&gt; and the trustees sold the property.&lt;ref name=Marschner&gt;{{cite book|last=Marschner|first=Janice|title=Oregon 1859: A Snapshot in Time|year=2008|publisher=Timber Press|location=Portland|isbn=978-0881928730|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-UW6M_gw48C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Trinity+School+for+Boys%2BOregon#v=onepage&amp;q=Trinity%20School%20for%20Boys%2BOregon&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oregon"&gt;Corning, Howard M. 1956. ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords &amp; Mort Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Funds and property were provided to Scott's successor, [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (bishop)|Bishop B. Wistar Morris]], to establish another school, but located in [[Portland, Oregon]]. The land comprised 38 city lots along 19th Street,&lt;ref name=Matson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matson|first=Robert W|title=Joseph Wood Hill: "Civilian Soldier" in Education and Politics|journal=Oregon Historical Quarterly|date=Spring 1989|volume=90|issue=1|pages=5–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; between Couch and Everett Streets in Portland.

=== Bishop Scott Grammar and Divinity School ===
[[File:Bishop Scott Grammar and Divinity School.png|thumbnail|right|The Bishop Scott Grammar School in 1874]]
The newly completed Bishop Scott Grammar and Divinity School opened as a boarding and day-school for boys on September 6, 1870, under principal Charles H. Allen.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scott" /&gt; Comprising three storeys above a basement, the building housed 2 classrooms, recitation rooms, a parlour, library, 16 rooms for boarders, a suite for the principal and his family, and its own chapel, called Saint Timothy's. Although the total costs amounted to $15,000, no debt remained.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Journal&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Proceedings of the 11th Annual Convention and the 46th Annual Report of the Church in the Diocese of Oregon|year=1899|publisher=E F Palmer|location=Portland, OR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after opening the school had a new head master: Professor R. W. Laing, M.A., L.L.D., assisted by the Reverend George Burton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrington|first=William G|title=Church almanac for the year of our Lord, 1872|year=1871|publisher=Protestant Episcopal Tract Society|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1873 the property was valued at $30,000, after the addition of the chapel, school rooms, and the dormitory. Costs were defrayed from tuition fees of $150 per annum, and interest from an $7,000 endowment—the proceeds from the sale of the Oswego property. Eighty pupils attended school, thirteen down from the previous year, drawn from Oregon, Washington, California, Utah, Alaska, and British Columbia. The faculty comprised three teachers: Junior Master, William M. Barker; Primary Master, Mr. Grant; and Senior Master, Rev. A. N. Wrixon.&lt;ref name=Report /&gt; As chaplain, Burton conducted services "in the large schoolroom of the Grammar School" at 10.30am, and Sunday School at 2pm in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Home News|url=http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn84022673/1873-08-08/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=The New Northwest|date=8 August 1873|location=Portland, OR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of Christmas Term on 1 September, Rev. Burton, now rector of Trinity Parish, was ensconced as head master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shinn|first=George Wolfe|title=King's handbook of notable Episcopal churches in the United States|year=1889|publisher=Moses King|location=Boston, MA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XM8YAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it had been since 1870, the school was still administered directly by Bishop Morris. Subjects included modern languages, music, singing, drawing, chemistry, and penmanship. Oregon's superintendent of education found that the grammar school's "philosophical and chemical apparatus [were] unsurpassed in the State", and mentioned that the school library contained 1,500 books.&lt;ref name=Report /&gt;

The school had replaced almost all its faculty by 1874, and added women to the staff for the first time. Laing and Barker continued, alongside the new head master and chaplain, Rev. D'Estaing Jennings, M.A. Miss I. A. Buss was added as "Preceptress" (female teacher), and Matron Maria Emery had been appointed. A military tone was introduced, in the form of Drill Master R. R. Anderson and the organization of the Bishop Scott Cadets. Drilling was viewed not only in terms of military preparedness, but as a form of exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Education in Oregon: St Helen's Hall and the Bishop Scott Grammar School|url=http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn85042522/1874-03-21/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=Willamette Farmer|date=21 March 1874|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other newly appointed faculty included drawing teacher Edward T. Coleman and music teacher Richard T. Yarndley.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 1877 the grammar school was heavily damaged by fire.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction|year=1874|publisher=Mart. V. Brown, State Printer|location=Salem, OR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WqlYv_f8QlYC|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before fire almost destroyed the library and equipment, the enrollment stood at 43 day pupils and 40 boarders.&lt;ref name=Biennial&gt;{{cite book|title=Biennial Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Oregon to the Legislative Assembly. 10th Regular Session|year=1878|volume=3|publisher=Mart.

[[File:Joseph Wood Hill, ca. 1905..png|150px|thumbnail|Joseph Wood Hill (b. 1856), in ca. 1905.]]
Joseph Wood Hill was the new principal when the rebuilt school opened on the same premises in September 1878.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oregonian" /&gt; Burton had been deposed by Bishop Morris in May that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Eleventh Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church|year=1878|publisher=Orphan's Press|location=Brooklyn, NY|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBsRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA104&amp;dq|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new building was smaller than the one it replaced, although "admirable" and "of superior architectural character", to fit in with the homes in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Biennial /&gt;

Hill was a native of [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], [[Connecticut]], having attained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Yale University]] earlier in 1878. He had responded to an address that Bishop Scott gave to a class at Yale. [[Noah Porter]], Yale's president, recommended Hill for his character, teaching experience, and maturity.&lt;ref name=Biennial /&gt; After his appointment, Hill studied medicine at [[Willamette University College of Medicine|Willamette University's College of Medicine]] in Portland,&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt; graduating as a [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in 1881. At college he rowed, and became a member of the [[Gamma Nu]] fraternity.&lt;ref name=Gaston&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaston|first=Joseph|title=Portland, Oregon, Its History and Builders: In Connection with the Antecedent Explorations, Discoveries, and Movements of the Pioneers that Selected the Site for the Great City of the Pacific, Volume 3|year=1911|publisher=S.J.

Only five boarding pupils attended the school at the start, and there were "less than twenty pupils, all told".&lt;ref name=Journal /&gt; Hill leased the school building from the bishop, and later from the board of [[trustees]] that had been appointed when Oregon became a separate [[diocese]] in 1889.&lt;ref name=Journal /&gt;

Echoing the beliefs of Bishop Scott in the value of private over public education,&lt;ref name=Tyler /&gt; Hill modelled the school after the private boarding schools on the east coast, like the one that he himself had attended. He filled the initial faculty vacancies with Yale graduates, such as John W. Gavin and English teacher Allan Elsworth. At the same time he did subsidize from his own pocket those students for whom the $300 annual fees were a hardship.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt;

Hill spent his vacations visiting exemplary private schools throughout the United States, and gradually became convinced that military discipline was essential for the Academy. In 1886, he declared that pupils should wear uniforms.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt;

Illustrating the amount of control the principal was granted by Bishop Morris, Hill renamed the school the Bishop Scott Academy in 1887. A military department was added, and the Academy became the first school on the West Coast to adopt military discipline. Hill had an [[Armory (military)|armory]] built that measured 5,000 square feet—"the largest indoor space in Portland" for some time. Although intended as a drill hall, the armory was also used for dances, which Hill believed would provide cadets with a graceful posture.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Oregonian /&gt;
[[File:Bishop Scott Academy advertisement 1900.png|thumbnail|right|A 1900 newspaper advertisement for the Academy]]
In order to promote military training, the federal government loaned weapons to schools which employed a qualified officer as military commandant.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt; Hill appointed Lieutenant Colonel F. E. Patterson in 1887 as instructor in mathematics and [[military tactics]]. Consequently, the steamship ''Oregon'' brought [[Springfield rifle]]s and "two 3-inch rifled field pieces and carriages" in 1890 to the Academy "from the [[Benicia Arsenal|Benicia arsenal]], California". Academy cadets could now learn how to use [[light artillery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City and County Official Paper|url=http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn96061150/1890-07-02/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=The Daily Morning Astorian|date=2 July 1890|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 the Academy became the first school permitted to sit Yale University's entrance examinations without direct supervision of Yale faculty.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt; The uniforms for the intake of 234 students that year were supplied by Thomas Kay Woolen Mills' store in Salem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn99063952/1891-09-24/ed-1/seq-3/|title=Uniforms|accessdate=5 February 2013|newspaper=Evening Capital Journal|date=September 24, 1891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavin organized the first [[American football|football]] team in the Northwest at the Academy, which held the first football game in the Northwest in 1889. Gavin had learned to play while studying at Yale. Until that time, [[rugby union]] had been the preferred form of football at the school.&lt;ref name=hma&gt;{{cite web|last=Robson|first=Mary Farrand|title=Hill Military Academy|url=http://gesswhoto.com/hill-academy.html|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristyn McIvor|author2=Joel D. Freeman|author3=Luana Hellmann Hill|title=Legacy of the twenty-six: a celebration of the first 100 years of the Multnomah Athletic Club|year=1991|publisher=Multnomah Athletic Club|location=[Portland, Or.]|isbn=978-0-9629107-0-8|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many institutions across the [[United States]], the school was badly affected by the economic depression that followed the [[Panic of 1893]]. Hill recalled that he had 70 pupils by June 1893; but in September only 12 returned when the school re-opened.&lt;ref name=Journal /&gt; The principal's own financial state also suffered due to the Panic, his investment in real estate, and the general contraction of the Oregon economy. Hill tried to deflect the impact by assigning the lease of the school to the diocesan secretary, thus placing the Academy out of the reach of his debtors. He also transferred some of his properties to his wife.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt;

Desiring to further formalize the military aspect of the Academy, Hill asked for a serving officer to be assigned. Accordingly, the federal War Department appointed Captain W. A. Kimball in 1895.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt; The [[United States Army]] now in effect controlled the Academy's military section.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt; When the [[Spanish–American War]] broke out, 30 alumni from the Academy served, fourteen as [[Officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commissioned officers]].&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt;

The school also became the first in the Pacific Northwest to implement the [[Sloyd]] system of instruction, with Hill personally contributing financially to the purchasing in 1895 of the required equipment.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt;
[[File:BSA 1904.png|thumb|1903 advertisement for Bishop Scott Academy]]
After 23 years of service, Hill retired in 1901 after a disagreement with the school's board of trustees. Some of the trustees had argued that the diocese should operate the school. They said that the diocese had acted outside its legal limits in granting a lease to Hill.&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt; Not wishing to become an employee of the diocese, Hill departed on amiable terms. His first wife, Jessie K. Adams, died in 1901. Hill married Laura E. MacEwan, the widow of the Academy's chaplain, that same year. Originally a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Hill shifted allegiance to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] in 1896, due to his support for the [[gold standard]]. A [[Freemason]], Hill obtained the [[Knights Templar (Freemasonry)|Knights Templar]] degree of the [[York Rite]].&lt;ref name=Gaston /&gt; He started the [[Hill Military Academy]] elsewhere in the city, and later became an agent for [[William Howard Taft|President William Howard Taft]].&lt;ref name=Matson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young Cadets Drill at Hill Military Academy|url=http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=00080420-24AB-1E9F-9D1880B05272FE9F|publisher=Oregon History Project|accessdate=September 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur C. Newill, who had read [[classics]] at [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford]], was appointed as Hill's successor. The Academy's enrollment declined after having reached 234 in 1901, and under financial pressure the Diocese closed the school in 1904.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt;

Subsequently, several unsuccessful attempts were made to revive the Academy in [[Yamhill County, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt; For example, in June 1913 ''The Ontario Argus'' announced that "the Bishop Scott Grammar School for Boys" would reopen in September, north of Yamhill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brief news of Oregon|url=http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn00063520/1913-06-19/ed-1/seq-3/|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=The Ontario Argus|date=19 June 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And, as of 2016, available in high schools as an [[AP Computer Science|AP]] course. The course material is available for free with a range of certificates available for a fee.

CS50 lectures are recorded and uploaded to several services including [[iTunes U]], edX (where it is known as CS50x), and YouTube. Additional video "walkthroughs" are recorded with professors and volunteer students. Course questions, called problem sets, or "psets" for short, are available in both PDF and HTML format. Students can upload problem set answers, and some questions are graded by automation. Students can also use special software to check their code in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]. In 2016, CS50 became the first university course to offer students the possibility to watch all lectures entirely in [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CS50 Moves Away from Traditional Lectures, Toward Virtual Reality|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/31/CS50-moves-from-lectures/|website=The Crimson|date=2016-08-31|author=Fahs, C.

The '''Cusanuswerk''' is one of the thirteen [[Germany|German]] sponsorship organizations financed by the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research|Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)]] to promote gifted students. It is headquartered in [[Bonn]].

== History ==
The Cusanuswerk was founded in 1956 under the authority of the [[German Bishops' Conference]]. Name giver of the organization is the medieval scholar [[Nicholas of Cusa]]. The aim of the Cusanuswerk is to promote gifted Catholic students until their university graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cusanuswerk.de/bewerbung/universitaeten/grundauswahlverfahren/|title=Startseite|trans-title=|language=German|author=|date=|work=Cusanuswerk.de|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988 to 1995, the Cusanuswerk was directed by [[Annette Schavan]]; from 2004 to 2011 it was led by Josef Wohlmuth.&lt;ref&gt;Employees. http://www.cusanuswerk.de/wir-ueber-uns/mitarbeiter/&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2011, he was succeeded by Georg Braungart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cusanuswerk.de/de/startseite/archiv-aktuelles/detailansicht/deutsche-bischofskonferenz-beruft-neuen-leiter-fuer-das-cusanuswerk/|title=Startseite|trans-title=|language=German|author=|date=|work=Cusanuswerk.de|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auxiliary bishop Christoph Hegge, [[Münster]], is the commissary of the German Bishops' Conference for the Cusanuswerk since 2013.

== Stipend and support ==
The Cusanuswerk awards public funds to "particularly gifted catholic students of all disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cusanuswerk.de/de/startseite/bischoefliche-studienfoerderung/|title=Startseite|trans-title=|language=German|author=|date=|work=Cusanuswerk.de|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application ===
For admission, candidates have to apply at the organization or suggested for application by university lecturers or high school teachers.

The selection is a multi-step procedure. At its end, around one quarter of all applicants will be admitted. Admission depends on three main criteria including academic performance, [[Volunteering|social engagement]] and catholic denomination. Admission is possible starting at the entrance to university but also at later stages as long as five semesters of standard study period remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cusanuswerk.de/de/bewerbung/ueberblick/|title=Startseite|trans-title=|language=German|author=|date=|work=Cusanuswerk.de|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual exhibition is organized for applicants studying arts, displaying works of all nominated applicants.

=== Financial support ===
Financial support is subject to the rules by the Federal Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmbf.de/de/294.php|title=Die Begabtenförderungswerke - BMBF|trans-title=|language=German|first=|last=BMBF-Internetredaktion|date=|work=BMBF.de|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of either a fixed monthly lump-sum or a more generous means-tested scholarship for students in need, similar to the regulations of the [[Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz|BAföG]]. Doctoral students receive a scholarship independent of their financial background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cusanuswerk.de/foerderung/stipendien/|title=Startseite|trans-title=|language=German|author=|date=|work=Cusanuswerk.de|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional support is available for study and research stays abroad.

=== Academic support ===
The academic support includes regular educational events as well as a spiritual enrichment program. It is expected that support recipients attend an annual summer school organized by the Cusanuswerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cusanuswerk.de/programm/ueberblick/|title=Startseite|trans-title=|language=German|author=|date=|work=Cusanuswerk.de|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their studies, Cusanuswerk scholarship holders form groups at the location of their college. An appointed liaison professor provides additional support. All local scholarship groups elect representatives. Representatives of all local groups meet semiannually for a joint assembly (Cusanerkonferenz).

Social engagement and the acquisition of international experience are particularly encouraged for scholarship holders.

The Cusanuswork also offers special career support for women based on mentorships and additional seminars.

==History==
The aim of EduKart was to bring more flexibility into the [[Higher education in India|Indian education system]]. It was started by Ishan Gupta and Mayank Gupta in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iimnet.com/profiles/blogs/edukart&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://insideiim.com/the-insideiim-entrepreneurship-series-interview-with-mayank-gupta-co-founder-edukart-com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, EduKart secured $500,000 in funding from a consortium of early-stage institutional and angel investors. The group includes Kima Ventures, Amit Patni and Arihant Patni, AKM Systems (Shiven Malhotra), Vibhor Mehra and alumni from Stanford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Being in Koramangala got us visibility in right circles: Ishan Gupta, CEO, Edukart| author=  | publisher = [[The Economic Times]]| date = 2013-09-09 | url = http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-09-09/news/41903520_1_education-hub-edukart-koramangla| accessdate = 2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = EduKart raises $500,000 to make waves in India’s online education market | author= Robin Wauters | publisher = The Next Web| date = 2013-05-30 | url = https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/05/30/edukart-raises-500000-to-crack-indias-online-education-market/| accessdate = 2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Elks Club Building''' is the second and former [[Club (organization)|club]]house of the '''Manila Elks Lodge #761—Manila Lodge 761''', better known as the '''Manila Elks Club''', in [[Manila]], the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.manilaelks.org/about-us/manila-elks-lodge-761/lodge-history/ Manilaelks.org: Manila Elks Club history]&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by [[William E. Parsons]].&lt;ref name="McCallus"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCallus|first=Joseph|title=The MacArthur Highway and Other Relics of American Empire in the Philippines|date=2010|publisher=Potomac Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manila Elks Lodge #761 is a unique branch club of the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks—BPOE]], an American [[fraternal order]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilaelks.org Manilaelks.org: homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of only two Elks Club established outside of current [[United States territory]], the other being in [[Panama]] near the former American territory of the [[Panama Canal Zone]],

==History==
The Manila Elks Club was founded after the [[Spanish–American War]] [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|ended in 1898]] which resulted in the transfer of the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Philippines]] to the [[United States]] control.  In 1901, a group of Americans residing in Manila for the "unbridled entrepreneurial possibilities,"and "yearning for camaraderie and solidarity," petitioned the national Elks organization to allow the founding of an Elks Club on American soil in the Philippines. .&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The Grand Exalted Ruler of the Grand Lodge in the United States approved the petition in 1905.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

The first [[Club (organization)|clubhouse]], formerly Clubhouse of the Order of the Elks, was established along Calle Victoria in [[Intramuros, Manila]]. In 1904, it moved to Calle San Luis opposite the Old [[Luneta]].

Finally in 1910, it built its permanent home at the site that was used to be occupied by the Manila Overseas Press Club and now occupied by the [[Museo Pambata ng Maynila]]. Following the proposed [[Manila Plan]] of [[Daniel Burnham]], the Elks Club was housed in a three-story building with features similar to the [[Manila Army and Navy Club]] co-located on the same piece of property.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alarcon 2008 82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alarcon|first=Norma|title=The Imperial Tapestry, American Colonial Architecture in the Philippines|date=2008|publisher=University of Santo Tomas Publishing House|isbn=978-971-506-474-3|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; One building housed a civilian club and the other a military club.  The original Manila Elks Club building, designed in the [[Mission Revival architecture|Mission Revival style]] modeled on the [[architecture of the California missions]], opened in 1910 on the land purchased in the [[Luneta Park]] extension, in the [[Ermita|Ermita District]] of Manila.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

After the inauguration of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], ending the U.S. territorial [[Insular Government|Insular Government of the Philippine Islands]], this clubhouse housed the United States [[High Commissioner to the Philippines]] and his staff from 1935 to 1940.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

In 1942, during the World War II [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]], Japanese forces marched directly to the Elks Club and the adjacent Army and Navy Club, taking almost 100 residents from both clubs to be imprisoned in the [[Santo Tomas Internment Camp]].

This first Elks Club building was left in ruins by the war's end.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; It was later destroyed during the war, after which a two-story edifice was built by the Cojuangco family in February 1949.&lt;ref name="Alarcon 2008 82" /&gt;

In February 1949, the Elks Lodge #761 opened the newly rebuilt Manila Elks Club building on the site of the first, though on the renamed [[Roxas Boulevard|Dewey Boulevard]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The Elks occupied this building until the 1960s.  The building along Roxas Boulevard was later acquired by the Philippine government.&lt;ref name="Alarcon 2008 82" /&gt;

==Elks Lodge #761 present-day==
In the 1960s, because of issues of foreign ownership of the property, the Elks Lodge #761 (the Manila Elks Club) moved out of its second clubhouse to new facility in the [[Flag Village]] area of Makati, across from where the [[Rockwell Center]] is today.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

In 1977, the Elks Lodge #761 moved again, acquiring 1000 square meters of space on the 7th floor of the Corinthian Plaza building in central [[Makati City]], [[Metro Manila]], where they are still located.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilaelks.org/about-us/manila-elks-lodge-761/ Manilaelks.org: About]&lt;/ref&gt;   It still is "the American Club in the Philippines".

The 1949 second Manila Elks Club building and its grounds, on renamed [[Roxas Boulevard]], now houses the [[Museo Pambata]] or the [[children's museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museopambata.org/ Museopambata.org: Official '''Museo Pambata''' website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum was founded by Dr. [[Estefania Aldaba-Lim]] in 1994, who was a [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|Philippine presidential cabinet member]], active in UNICEF (the [[United Nations Children's Fund]]), and founded the Institute of Human Relations at [[Philippine Women's University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Fun Museum at the Old Elks Club Building in Manila|url=http://traveleronfoot.wordpress.com/2008/07/21/a-fun-museum-at-the-old-elks-club-building-in-manila/|work=TRAVELER ON FOOT: A TRAVEL JOURNAL|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Championship in Forestry Skills''' is a competition in [[forestry]] skills among students from European forestry and agricultural colleges, staged each year since 2002. The students are formed into teams and tested in various disciplines. 

== Goals ==
The short‐term goal of the competition is the presentation of the latest achievements in [[logging]] techniques, logging machinery tools and loggers safety equipment and a comparison of these at an international level in theory and practice.

The long‐term aim of the competitions is to increase the appreciation of forest work and to draw general attention to forestry training and the forestry industry on both a national and international level. These competitions play a particularly significant role in creating international contacts between students and schools, which contribute to the furthering peaceful coexistence between nations.

== Structure ==
This competition is a team competition between schools of the [[EU]]. The best team from each country may attend the competition. Students who are in forestry training and between 16 – 25 years of age are eligible to compete. A team consists of four participants. Each participant must compete in theory and practice components.

In planning and carrying out the competitions, special attention is paid to safety aspects in working techniques.

The competition consists of two parts. First part is demonstrating specific knowledge of working with a [[chainsaw]] and consists of five disciplines (Fitting a new chain, [[Log bucking|Bucking]] by combined cut, Precision bucking, Undercut and [[Felling]] Cut, and [[Limbing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XIV European Championship of Forestry Skills|url=http://forestryskills.eu/en/hello/|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part is demonstrating knowledge about forests. This part takes place over an approximately 3&amp;nbsp;km long orientation course, within which are 16 points. At each point the competitors must demonstrate their knowledge of forest surveying, or recognize tree and animal species, forest pests and diseases of trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulary(sic): European Students Championships in Forestry Skills: 3.6 Event VI:  Forestry Course|url=http://www.lfs-st-andrae.ksn.at/eigene_dateien/regelwerk_em2013/Rules_Forestry_course_2012.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner is the one country whose competitors achieve the highest number of points from both parts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12646">'''François Tuefferd''' (30 May 1912 – 17 December 1996) was a French photographer, active from the 1930s to the 1950s. He also ran a darkroom and gallery in Paris, Le Chasseur d'Images, where he printed and exhibited the works of his contemporaries. His best-known imagery features the French circus.

== Biography ==
Born into a well-to-do family on 30 May 1912 in [[Montbéliard]] (Doubs), Tuefferd was encouraged in his early interest in photography by his father, Jean-Pierre Tuefferd,  doctor and capable amateur photographer and, from 1959 to 1965, mayor of Montbéliard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Blondet-Bisch, Thérèse | author2=Gunther, Thomas Michael | author3=Bibliothèque de documentation internationale contemporaine (France) | author4=Mois de la photo (festival) (2008 : Paris, France) | title=Une traversée photographique du XXe siècle = a photographic survey of the 20th century | publication-date=2008 | publisher=Créaphis | isbn=978-2-35428-021-5 | page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuefferd studied at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand|Lycee Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris in 1920. He made his first photographs in 1925 with a vest-pocket [[Kodak]] and on his first trip to [[Tunisia]] in 1929. Resident there in 1931 he joined the 4th [[Zouave]]s Regiment, and equipped with a [[Leica Camera|Leica]] and a ''Spido'' press camera by L. Gaumont &amp; Cie, he made portraits of soldiers and landscapes of the desert as well as documenting the Tunisian population, hitherto ignored by photographers.

== Career ==
Tuefferd began exhibiting in the salons in the 1930s, including the influential XXXI Salon International D'Art Photographique ([[Société française de photographie|Societe Francaise de Photographie]]) in 1936, which was judged by [[Laure Albin Guillot|Laure Albin-Guillot]].&lt;ref&gt;Revue française de photographie et de cinématographie. Tome XVI 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

On leave, he met [[George Hoyningen-Huene]] who lent him his [[Rolleiflex]] to take pictures of the shooting of a parody of ''[[L'Atlantide (1932 film)|L'Atlantide]]'' by [[G. W. Pabst|GW Pabst]]. Impressed by the quality of the photos, Hoyningen-Huene offered him an internship at ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' studios in Paris in the autumn ([[Condé Nast]] SA),&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Baqué ''Les Documents de la modernité: anthologie de textes sur la photographie de 1919 à 1939'', J. Chambon, 1993. 534&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked in the studio, [[darkroom]] and [[Photo manipulation|retouching]] workshop on advertising and product shots. In March 1932, he left the ''Vogue'' studio and entered that of Gaston Grenier. There he set up a specialized facilities for [[35mm format|35 mm]] processing and very quickly photographers such as Rogi André, [[Ilse Bing]], [[Robert Capa]], [[Ergy Landau]] and [[Man Ray]] became his clients. He photographed the liner [[SS Normandie|''SS'' ''Normandie'']] in 1936.

== First Paris gallery dedicated to photography ==
In June 1937, with an inheritance, Tuefferd opened the Le Chasseur d'Images gallery at 46 [[Rue du Bac, Paris|rue du Bac]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Leenaerts, Danielle | title=Petite histoire du magazine Vu (1928-1940) : entre photographie d'information et photographie d'art | publication-date=2010 | publisher=PIE Peter Lang | isbn=978-90-5201-585-9 | page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first Paris gallery dedicated to photography&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Bouqueret, Christian | author2=Chauvanne, Blandine | author3=Musée Sainte-Croix | author4=Musée Réattu | author5=Musée de Carcassonne | title=La nouvelle photographie en France 1919-1939 : Poitiers, Musée Sante-Croix, 7 octobre - 1er décembre 1986 Arles, Musée Réattu, 19 décembre 1986 - 8 mars 1987, Carcassonne, Museée des Beaux-Arts, 25 mars - 30 mai 1987 | publication-date=1986 | publisher=Musée de la Ville de Poitiers et de la Société des Antiquaires de l'Ouest | page=1935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he showed both known and unknown photographers.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Michael Gunther, Tuefferd, Chasseur d'images, Paris, Bibliothèque Historique de Paris, 1993, p. 98,&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emmanuel Sougez]] was first to exhibit there in June 1937.  German photographer [[Herbert List]] pinned his prints directly to the wall as it was customary in the photo galleries of the time. Others followed in solo or group exhibitions: Pierre Adam, Marcel Arthaud, Ilse Bing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Dryansky, Larisa | author2=Houk, Edwynn | title=Ilse Bing : photography through the looking glass | publication-date=2006 | publisher=H.N. Abrams | isbn=978-0-8109-5546-2 | page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serge Boiron, [[Bill Brandt]], Max Del, Louis Caillaud, Yvonne Chevalier, André Garban, Sandro Guida, [[Pierre Jahan]], Henri Lacheroy, René-Leon Servant.

Le Chasseur d'Images also presented the original illustrations of Arts et Métiers Graphiques "Photographie" albums from 1938 to 1939. He organized the first ''Rectangle'' exhibition, of works by the group of 13 exclusively French photographers whose founder was Sougez,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Sougez, Emmanuel | author2=Sougez, Marie Loup | author3=Rochard, Sophie | author4=Palais de Tokyo (Museum : Paris, France) | title=Emmanuel Sougez : l'éminence grise | publication-date=1993 | publisher=Créaphis | isbn=978-2-907150-36-1 | page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presented the Modernist photography club, Le Noir et Blanc, successor to the Rolleiclub. The gallery could present up to 150 30 × 40&amp;nbsp;cm prints and photographs were sold for 100 [[Franc]]s. Shows rarely exceeded two weeks in duration and on opening nights, the gallery provided an invaluable rendezvous for photographers. Mobilization for war in September 1939 brought an end to the enterprise.

''La reproduction des couleurs'' ([1. éd.]). Presses universitaires de France, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1940, he returned to Paris and devoted himself to documenting, in a [[Humanist photography|humanist]] mode,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Thézy, Marie de | author2=Nori, Claude | title=La photographie humaniste : 1930-1960, histoire d'un mouvement en France | publication-date=1992 | publisher=Contrejour | isbn=978-2-85949-145-1 | page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; the world of the circus that visited Paris every year and in which he found a unique subject, a world of its own redolent of Old Paris, and for years photographed trapeze artists seen from below, spotlit against a dark background and gasping spectators craning their necks, as well as behind-the-scenes vignettes of circus performers applying makeup, practicing, eating and training animals.&lt;ref&gt;François Tuefferd (1999) Le Cirque, éditions RMN, 1999 ISBN 2-7118-3661-&lt;/ref&gt;

He was stills photographer for Pathé-Cinéma’s ''Port d'attache'' and ''[[The Secret of Madame Clapain|Le Secret de Madame Clapain]].'' For the publisher Prisma, he wrote the practical component of a photography correspondence course and articles for ''L'Agenda Prisma.''

== Postwar in France and Tunisia ==
In 1945, after making documentaries for the tourist commission, Tuefferd went back to Tunisia to shoot documentary films on [[Ramadan]], on the island of [[Djerba]], in [[Kairouan]], and a falcon hunt. Banned in Paris from continuing his professional practice during the [[Vichy France|Régime de Vichy]], he went to [[New York City]] to reunite with his artist friends, among them [[Alexander Calder]] whom he had met in Tunisia.

In 1946, he helped co-found the influential [[Le Groupe des XV]] with René Servant, [[Marcel Bovis]], [[Lucien Lorelle]], Jean Séeberger, and Emmanuel Sougez.

In 1949, he returned to France and resumed his work on the circus. He contributed photography to the journals ''L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui : revue mensuelle | publication-date=1930 | publisher=L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui | issn=0003-8695 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Courrier des métiers d'art,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Beaux-arts : revue d'information artistique | publication-date=1923 | publisher=[Gazette des Beaux-Arts] | issn=1144-1283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Métiers de France.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Société d'encouragement aux métiers d'art (France) | title=Le Courrier des métiers d'art | publication-date=1900 | publisher=Société d'encouragement aux métiers d'art | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/14944963 | accessdate=14 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in America ==
In the early 1950s Tuefferd lived for a time in [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson]], NH and photographed in the USA, and in 1955 was included by [[Edward Steichen]] in the seminal world-touring ''[[The Family of Man]]'' that commenced at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

In the midst of a snowstorm on [[Mount Cardigan|Mt Cardigan]], NH, in 1968 met his wife-to-be Helen (née McDougall, 17 February 1932 – 30 April 2016) who was a member of the [[Appalachian Mountain Club]], participating in [[White Mountain Peak|White Mountain]] hikes.&lt;ref&gt;Obituaries.

He died on December 17, 1996 and was survived by his wife Helen, and his two sons, Max and Nanook.

The [[Musée national des Arts et Traditions Populaires (France)|Musée National des Arts et Traditions]] posthumously showed his circus imagery in an exhibit in 1999 entitled ''François Tuefferd: "Le cirque", photographs 1933-1954.''

The '''Fulbright Commission in Iceland''' is an inter-governmental organization that administers the [[Fulbright Program]] in Iceland by offering Fulbright grants to students and scholars.  It is located in the center of Iceland's capital, [[Reykjavík]]. The Commission also administers nominations for the Frank Boas Scholarship for International Legal Studies at the [[Harvard Law School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardboasscholars.org/history.html |title=Harvard Boas Scholars |publisher=Harvard Boas Scholars |date= |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Cobb Family Fellowship for Icelandic citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundingusstudy.org/Listing.asp?MDSID=IIF-70&amp;AdListingID= |title=International Scholarships &amp;#124; Funding for US Study &amp;#124; Cobb Family Fellowship for Icelandic Graduate Students |publisher=Fundingusstudy.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission also serves as the only Education USA advising center in Iceland, providing impartial advice on U.S. education opportunities.

==Program and grants==
The Icelandic Fulbright Commission was founded in 1957, when a bi-national agreement between Iceland and the United States was signed on February 23, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fulbright.is/en/about_fulbright/fulbright_in_iceland/|title=Fulbright in Iceland  -  About Fulbright  -  Fulbright|website=www.fulbright.is|language=is|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grants are awarded to students of Icelandic and American descent for graduate and post-graduate studies, while scholar grants are awarded to Icelandic scholars to undertake research  in the United States and for American scholars to teach and do research in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fulbright.is/en/about_fulbright/fulbright_in_iceland/&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission offers approximately 6-10 student grants annually to Icelandic citizens and another 1-2 grants for Icelandic scholars who plan to conduct research in the US. Approximately 5-6 grants are offered to US students and another 3 on average to US scholars each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://fulbright.is/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Icelandic Fulbright Commission administers two other grants offered to Icelandic citizens. The Frank Boas scholarship for L.L.M Law study at Harvard University, is competed for annually by 9 European countries, of which Iceland is one. The Cobb Family Fellowship is funded by a former US Ambassador to Iceland [[Charles E. Cobb]]. and his wife [[Sue M. Cobb|Sue M.Cobb]]. The grant is offered annually to one Icelandic graduate student in any field at [[University of Miami, Florida]].

Currently, the Iceland Fulbright Commission has supported over 1300 grantees, approximately 900 to Icelanders and 450 U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.visir.is/hornsteinn-i-samskiptum-islands-og-bandarikjanna/article/2012706219971 |title=Vísir - Hornsteinn í samskiptum Íslands og Bandaríkjanna |publisher=Visir.is |date= |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic has become a major focus of the work of the Fulbright Commission in Iceland. In early 2014, the Commission concluded an agreement with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MFA). The agreement sets up a three year pilot project whereby the Ministry funds the Fulbright-MFA Arctic Scholar Grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utanrikisraduneyti.is/frettir/nr/7928|title=Samstarf við Fulbright stofnunina á sviði norðurslóðafræða|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This grant brings one US scholar to Iceland per academic year for one semester to teach, as well as conduct research. The grant is open to scholars in a wide variety of Arctic fields.

In January 2015, the Commission signed an agreement with the [https://www.nsf.gov/ US National Science Foundation (NSF)] for a three-year pilot project to bring U.S. scholars and fellows to Iceland to conduct research in a wide variety of fields in the social and natural sciences, as they relate to the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eca.state.gov/highlight/us-iceland-fulbright-commission-and-national-science-foundation-collaborate-support-arctic|title=U.S.-Iceland Fulbright Commission and the National Science Foundation Collaborate to Support Arctic Research {{!}} Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs|website=eca.state.gov|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fulbright.is/images/uploads/annual%20report%20FY%202015.pdf Annual Report FY2015] Fulbright Commission&lt;/ref&gt;NSF provides funding for Fulbright-NSF Arctic Research Grants and the Commission administers the grants program and provides infrastructure, services, and support to grantees. This is the first such partnership between the NSF and Fulbright. In addition to the Fulbright-NSF grants, we are participating in the [http://www.cies.org/program/fulbright-arctic-initiative Fulbright Arctic Initiative] (FAI). The FAI brings together Fulbright scholars from all Arctic Council states to collaborate across disciplines on pressing issues facing the Arctic.

==Funding and Board==
The Commission is funded by the U.S. and Icelandic governments. The Icelandic Minister of Education and the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland are the Honorary Chairmen of the Board. The Ministry of Education  and the U.S. Embassy appoint the Commission's Board of Directors, four Icelanders and four Americans, in addition to one alternate each. The Board hires an Executive Director, who is responsible for the hiring of other staff and for the day-to-day running of the Commission&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fulbright.is/en/about_fulbright/members_of_the_board_and_staff/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education USA Advising Center==
The Commission hosts the only Education USA Advising Center in Iceland. The Advising Center is one of a network of over 450 centers around the world. Providing comprehensive and impartial advice on education opportunities in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educationusa.info/Iceland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fulbright Alumni Association in Iceland==
The Alumni Association was founded on March 25, 2008. The Association hosts various events,including an annual [[Thanksgiving]] dinner.

==Partnership Award==
The Partnership Award was established in 1991 when Ambassador [[Charles E. Cobb]], then the US Ambassador to Iceland, and Ambassador [[Sue M. Cobb]] presented the city of [[Reykjavík]] with the sculpture Partnership &lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/alf07/5428347164/&lt;/ref&gt; in commemoration of 50 years of [[Iceland-United States relations|diplomatic relations between Iceland and the United States]]. In 2003 the Fulbright Commission in Iceland was asked to administer the Cobb Partnership Award. The Partnership Award is awarded biannually. The Commission’s Board of Directors nominate an American who has been an outstanding advocate of American values in Iceland and has strengthened the ties between the two countries. As of 2013, fourteen recipients have been awarded the Cobb Partnership Award.

==Events and publications==
The Commission is also responsible for coordinating, organizing and sponsoring various events throughout the year to highlight the Fulbright Program and the work of the Commission, promote higher education in the US and provide information to students on the US education system. The Commission also publishes an annual report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fulbright.is/images/uploads/Fulbright%20Annual%20Report-FY2011.pdf Annual Report FY 2011]. Fulbright Commission Iceland.&lt;/ref&gt; and a semi-annual newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fulbright.is/images/uploads/Newsletter-1.pdf Newsletter Fulbright Commission Iceland.] Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4826">'''Future Leaders Exchange''' ('''FLEX''') is a scholarship [[student exchange program]] administered by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] through funding from the [[Freedom Support Act]]. The program provides opportunities for high school students (ages 15–19) from [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] (from 2015 including [[Baltic states]]), initially including [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Poland]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Ukraine]], to spend a year in the [[United States]], living with a host family and attending an American high school. The program seeks to develop the leadership abilities and cultural awareness.

The competition is intense. Only about one in fifty applicants are ultimately selected.&lt;ref name="eca"&gt;[http://exchanges.state.gov/youth/programs/flex.html Future Leaders Exchange] at the [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] site&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was created in 1992 after former Senator [[Bill Bradley]]’s conviction "that the best way to ensure long-lasting peace and understanding between the U.S. and Eurasia is to enable young people to learn about democracy firsthand through experiencing it".&lt;ref name="ciee"&gt;[http://www.ciee.org/flex/ FLEX page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926040337/http://www.ciee.org/flex/ |date=2009-09-26 }} at [[CIEE]] site&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception in 1993, more than 18,000 high school students from 12 Eurasian countries (two more countries which used to participate in the program are [[Belarus]] and [[Uzbekistan]]) have studied in the U.S. under the program.&lt;ref name="eca"/&gt;

On 1 October 2014 Russia pulled out of the programme. Russian students remaining in the US were allowed by the Russian side to complete their scholarship, and in the next editions, Russian students will be replaced by students from Ukraine and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/06/russia-exhcange-_n_5942142.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fakty.interia.pl/swiat/news-nyt-ukrainscy-uczniowie-zajma-miejsca-rosjan,nId,1532653#iwa_item=12&amp;iwa_img=0&amp;iwa_hash=40441&amp;iwa_block=facts_news_small&lt;/ref&gt;

The motive behind Russia's decision to end the cooperation was the case of a 16 year old student who had refused to return to Russia and searched for asylum in the USA on the grounds of his sexual orientation. He had met a homosexual couple and asked them for help to stay in the USA. He was put under the couple's tutelage. Russian officials criticized the USA for lack of responsibility towards Russian students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/world/europe/russia-cancels-exchange-program-after-a-student-seeks-us-asylum.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hall of Worthies''', or '''Jiphyeonjeon''' ({{IPA-ko|tɕipʰjʌndʑʌn}}; {{korean|hangul=집현전; 集賢殿}}), was a royal research institute set up by [[Sejong the Great]] of the [[Korea]]n [[Joseon Dynasty]] in March 1420.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jiphyeonjeon|url=http://www.hangeulmuseum.org/sub/eng_new/hangeul/jiphyeon.jsp|website=Digital Hangeul Museum|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Set up during the beginning of his reign, King Sejong staffed the Hall of Worthies with talented scholars and instructed them to conduct a variety of research activities to strengthen his rule and the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yi|first1=Tae-jin|title=Reexamination of King Sejong's Achievements|url=http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=473&amp;sword=&amp;flag=long|website=Koreana|publisher=The Korea Foundation|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hall of Worthies is best known for the role it played in the development of the [[Hangul]] script, the official alphabet in the Korean language.

==Purpose==
The Hall of Worthies originally served an advisory role to the king, and King Sejong restructured and expanded its role into an academic research institute. During the early part of King Sejong's reign, the Hall of Worthies served as a legislative system, but its role eventually grew to hold discussions regarding Joseon's national policy. The Hall of Worthies would also later act as an organ of press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Window on Korean Culture - 10 Hall of Worthies and the Invention of Hangeul|website=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHVrjVvEBSQ|publisher=The Korea Foundation|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
The Hall participated in various scholarly endeavors, of which the best-known may be the compilation of the ''[[Hunminjeongeum]]'', in which the [[hangul]] writing system was first formulated. In the Hunminjeongeum, King Sejong wrote a preface which explained the origin and purpose of the newly created alphabet, Hangul. He then instructed his scholars of the Jiphyeonjeon (Hall of Worthies) to write detailed explanations of each of its letters along with examples of each of them. The purpose of the Hunminjeongeum was to provide instructions on how to use the new alphabet. The definitive edition of the Hunminjeongeum is known as the Haerye Edition of Hunminjeongeum (Haerye refers to the explanations and examples of the Hall of Worthies scholars, which were previously missing in other known editions)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunminjeongeum|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/world_heritage/hunminjeongum.jsp|website=Cultural Heritage Administration|publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the Hall of Worthies, Jeong In-ji, compiled the Hunminjeongeum, and his treatise explaining the creation of the script, he wrote that the work was widely introduced to the public on the tenth day of the ninth lunar month of 1446, which was October 9, 1446, on the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paik|first1=Syeung-gil|title=Preserving Korea's Documents: UNESCO's 'Memory of the World Register'|url=http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=664&amp;lang=English|website=Koreana|publisher=The Korea Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucianism ideals were very important to King Sejong, and he wanted his subjects to have a medium through which they could learn the ethics and morals of Confucianism. During his 14th year in power, King Sejong instructed his scholars at the Hall of Worthies to compile outstanding examples of the fundamental principles in human relationships (filial piety, loyalty to the state, and wifely devotion) from both Korean and Chinese history.&lt;ref name=reexamination /&gt; This compilation of works would become the book "Conduct of the Three Fundamental Principles in Human Relationships" (Samgang Haengshildo, Hanja: 三綱行實圖, Hangul: 삼강행실도). Unfortunately, this work was originally recorded in Chinese characters, and thus, the general public could not read it until it was translated into hangul some 30 years later.&lt;ref name=reexamination&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yi|first1=Tae-jin|title=Reexamination of King Sejong's Achievements|url=http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=473&amp;lang=English|website=Koreana|publisher=The Korea Foundation|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the invention of Hangul and published works such as Samgang Haengshildo, the Hall of Worthies was involved in publication of numerous scholarly and scientific writings, which contributed to reputation of Sejong's reign as the golden age of Korean culture.

==Disbandment==
The Hall of Worthies was disbanded by [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]] ({{lang-ko|세조}}) after many of its members (notably the [[six martyred ministers]]) plotted to assassinate Sejo in 1456, following the latter's usurpation of the throne from [[Danjong of Joseon|King Danjong]]. However, a similar organization, the [[Hongmungwan]] ({{lang-ko|홍문관}}), Office of Special Advisors, continued much of the same work, though without enjoying the same prestige or output it had during the earlier period.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18527">{{Introductory article|Cooperative learning}}
[[Cooperative learning]] is the instructional use of small groups so that students work together to maximize their own and each other's learning.&lt;ref name="JJH(2008)"&gt;Johnson, D. W., Johnson, R. T., &amp; Holubec, E. (2008) "Cooperation in the classroom" (8th ed.). Edina, MN: Interaction Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperative learning  may be contrasted with competitive and individualistic learning.  The key difference between these teaching approaches is the way students' learning goals are structured. The goal structure specifies the ways in which students will interact with each other and the teacher during the instructional session. Within cooperative situations, individuals seek outcomes that are beneficial to themselves and beneficial to all other group members.  In competitive learning students work against each other to achieve an academic goal such as a grade of "A" that only one or a few students can attain. Finally, in individualistic learning students work by themselves to accomplish learning goals unrelated to those of the other students.
In cooperative and individualistic learning, student efforts are evaluated on a criteria-referenced basis while in competitive learning teachers grade in a norm-referenced basis.

==History and theoretical roots ==
In the mid-1960s, cooperative learning was relatively unknown and largely ignored by educators.  Elementary, secondary, and university teaching was dominated by competitive and individualistic learning.&lt;ref name="JJH(2008)" /&gt;  Cultural resistance to cooperative learning was based on [[social Darwinism]], with its premise that students must be taught to survive in a "dog-eat-dog" world, and the myth of "rugged individualism" underlying the use of individualistic learning.  While competition dominated educational thought, it was being challenged by individualistic learning largely based on [[B. F. Skinner]]'s work on programmed learning and behavioral modification.  Educational practices and thought, however, have changed.  Cooperative learning is now an accepted and highly recommended  instructional procedure at all levels of education.

Most of the original theories of cooperative learning have their roots on social interdependence and Lewinian field theory.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, M (1949).  A theory of cooperation and competition. "Human Relations", 2, 129-152&lt;/ref&gt; Theorizing on social interdependence began in the early 1900s, when one of the founders of the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt School of Psychology]], [[Kurt Koffka]], proposed that groups were dynamic wholes in which the interdependence among members could vary.  One of his colleagues, [[Kurt Lewin]] refined Koffka's notions in the 1920s and 1930s while stating that (a) the essence of a group is the interdependence among members (created by common goals) which results in the group being a "dynamic whole" so that a change in the state of any member or subgroup changes the state of any other member or subgroup, and (b) an intrinsic state of tension within group members motivates movement toward the accomplishment of the desired common goals.  For interdependence to exist, there must be more than one person or entity involved, and the persons or entities must have impact on each other in that a change in the state of one causes a change in the state of the others.  From the work of Lewin's students and colleagues, such as Ovisankian, Lissner, Mahler, and Lewis, it may be concluded that it is the drive for goal accomplishment that motivates cooperative and competitive behavior.
In the late 1940s, one of Lewin's graduate students, [[Morton Deutsch]], extended Lewin's reasoning about social interdependence and formulated a theory of cooperation and competition.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, M (1949).  An experimental study of the effets of cooperation and competition upon group processes. "Human Relations", 2, 199-232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, M (1962) Cooperation and trust: Some theoretical notes. In M.R. Jones (Ed.) "Nebraska symposium on motivation", 275-319. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebrasca Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch conceptualized three types of social interdependence–positive, negative, and none.  Deutsch's basic premise was that the type of interdependence structured in a situation determines how individuals interact with each other which, in turn, largely determines outcomes.  Positive interdependence tends to result in promotive interaction, negative interdependence tends to result in oppositional or contrient interaction, and no interdependence results in an absence of interaction.

==Types==
According to Johnson and Johnson,&lt;ref name="JJ(2008)" /&gt; there are three types of cooperative learning: formal, informal and cooperative base groups.

===Formal===

Formal cooperative learning consists of students working together, for one class period to several weeks, to achieve shared learning goals and complete jointly specific tasks and assignments.&lt;ref name="JJ(2008)"&gt;Johnson, D.W &amp; Johnson R.T. (2008). Social Interdependence Theory and Cooperative Learning: The Teacher's Role. In Gillies, R.B., Ashman A.F. &amp; Terwel J. (Eds.) ''The Teacher's Role in Implementing Cooperative Learning in the Classroom''(pp.9-37)New York, US:Springer&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, Johnson &amp; Holubec&lt;ref name="JJH(2008)" /&gt; describe the teachers' role in formal cooperative learning groups. It includes (a) making preinstructional decisions about tasks, objectives, group size and composition, roles, materials and room assignment (b) explaining the task and cooperative structure to the students (c) monitoring students' learning and intervening to provide assistance in completing the task or using group skills effectively and (d) assessing students' learning and helping students process how well their groups functioned.

===Informal===

Informal cooperative learning consists of having students work together to achieve a joint learning goal in temporary groups that last from a few minutes to one class period.&lt;ref name="JJH(2008)" /&gt;  The students take part in focused discussions before and after the lesson and interspersing pair discussions throughout the lesson. 
Informal cooperative learning ensures students are actively involved in understanding what is being presented.  It is also useful to set a mood conducive to learning, help set expectations, provide closure to an instructional session and precue the next session.&lt;ref name="JJ(2008)" /&gt;  Moreover, during the informal cooperative learning techniques, teachers have time to move around the class listening to what students are saying. This can give instructors insight into how well students understand the material, as well as being behavior that increases the individual accountability of each student participating in the discussions.

Two important aspects of using informal cooperative learning groups are to (a) make the task and the instructions explicit and precise and (b) require the groups to produce a specific product (such as a written answer). 
According to Johnson, Johnson and Holubec&lt;ref name="JJH(2008)" /&gt; the informal cooperative learning procedure is organized in the following way:
# Introductory Focused Discussion:  Teachers assign students to pairs or triads and explain  the task of answering the questions in a five-minute period with the goal of reaching consensus (to promote positive goal interdepence).  The discussion task is aimed at promoting advance organizing of what the students know about the topic to be presented and establishing expectations about what the lecture will cover. 
# Intermittent Focused Discussions:  Teachers divide the lecture into 10 to 15 minute segments (length of time a motivated adult can concentrate on information being presented).  After each segment, students are asked to turn to the person next to them and work cooperatively in answering a question that requires students to cognitively process the information. Each student first formulates his or her own answer before sharing and listening to the other members' ideas. Finally, the pair integrates the two answers, synthesizing them into a single and superior answer.
#Closure Focused Discussion:   Students participate in a five-minute closing discussion task summarizing what they have learned from the lecture and integrating the information into existing conceptual frameworks.  The task may also point students toward what the homework will cover or what will be presented in the next class session.

===Cooperative base groups===

Cooperative base groups are long-term, heterogeneous cooperative learning groups with stable membership.&lt;ref name="JJH(2008)" /&gt;  Typically, cooperative base groups are heterogeneous in membership (especially in terms of achievement motivation and task orientation), meet regularly (for example, daily or biweekly), and last for the duration of the class (a semester or year), or, preferably, for several years.

The agenda of the base group can include academic support tasks (such as editing each other's essays), personal support tasks (such as getting to know each other and helping each other solve nonacademic problems), routine tasks (such as taking attendance), and assessment tasks (such as checking each other's understanding of the answers to test questions when the test is first taken individually and then retaken in the base group).

Members' primary responsibilities are to (a) ensure all members are making good academic progress (i.e., positive goal interdependence) (b) hold each other accountable for striving to learn (i.e., individual accountability), and (c) provide each other with support, encouragement, and assistance in completing assignments (i.e., promotive interaction).

Permanent cooperative base groups provide the arena in which caring and committed partnerships can be created that provide the social support needed to improve attendance, personalize the educational experience, increase achievement, and improve the quality of school life.

===Integrated use of all three types===

These three types of cooperative learning may be used together.&lt;ref name="JJH(2008)" /&gt;  A typical class session may begin with a base group meeting, which is followed by a short lecture in which informal cooperative learning is used.  The lecture may then be followed by a formal cooperative learning lesson.  Near the end of the class session, another short lecture may be delivered with the use of informal cooperative learning.  The class may end with a base group meeting.
Using the group meetings can help the students evaluate what they learned and help them with class building. Using small groups for class building will make the class stronger as a whole and give the classes a stronger understanding of the topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webb|first1=Noreen|title=Promoting Helping Behavior in Cooperative Small Groups in a Middle School Mathematics|journal=American Educational Research Journal|date=1994|volume=23|jstor=1163314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic elements of cooperation==
Not all groups are cooperative.  Johnson and Johnson&lt;ref name="JJ(1989)"&gt;Johnson D. W., &amp; Johnson, R.  (1989). " Cooperation and competition: Theory and research". Edina, MN: Interaction Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J(2003)"&gt;Johnson, D.W (2003) Social interdependence:  The interrelationships among theory, research, and practice "American Psychologist" 58(11), 931-945.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JJ(2005)"&gt;Johnson, D.W &amp; Johnson R.T. (2005) New developments in social interdependence theory. "Psychological monographs", 131, 285-360.&lt;/ref&gt;  describe the five elements that need to be present for a group to be cooperative:

*'''[[Positive interdependence]]''' exists when group members perceive that they are linked with each other in such a way that one cannot succeed unless everyone succeeds.   Group members realize, therefore, that each person's efforts benefit not only him- or herself, but all other group members as well.  Positive interdependence creates a commitment to other people's success as well as one's own and is the basis of cooperative learning.
*'''Individual and group accountability'''.  The group has to be clear about its goals and be able to measure (a) its progress in achieving them and (b) the individual efforts of each of its members. The group must be accountable for achieving its goals and each member must be accountable for contributing his or her share of the work.
* '''Promotive interaction''' (preferably face-to-face). Promotive interaction occurs when members share resources and help, support, encourage, and praise each other's efforts to learn.  Promotive interaction includes activities and interpersonal dynamics that can only occur when students promote each other's learning, i.e., orally explaining how to solve problems, discussing concepts, and teaching one's knowledge to classmates.
*'''Interpersonal and small group skills'''.  In cooperative learning groups students are required to learn academic subject matter (taskwork) and also to learn the interpersonal and small group skills required to function as part of a group (teamwork).  Group members must know how to provide effective leadership, decision-making, trust-building, communication, and conflict-management skills. Teachers have to teach teamwork skills just as purposefully and precisely as teachers do academic skills.
*'''Group processing'''.  Group processing exists when group members discuss how well they are achieving their goals and maintaining effective working relationships.  Groups need to describe what member actions are helpful and unhelpful and make decisions about what behaviors to continue or change.

==Research==

The study of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic efforts is commonly recognized as one of the oldest fields of research in social psychology.  In the late 1800s, [[Norman Triplett|Triplett]] in the United States, [[John Turner (psychologist)|Turner]] in England, and Mayer in Germany conducted a series of studies on the factors associated with competitive performance.  Since then over 750 studies have been conducted on the relative merits of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic efforts.  The research has focused on numerous outcomes, which may be subsumed within the broad and interrelated categories of effort to achieve quality of relationships and psychological health.&lt;ref name="JJ(1989)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="J(2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JJ(2005)" /&gt;

'''Effort to achieve''': Cooperation promotes considerably greater effort to achieve than does competitive or individualistic efforts.&lt;ref name="JJ(1989)" /&gt; In this meta-analysis by [[David W. Johnson (scholar)|David Johnson]] and [http://www.cehd.umn.edu/ci/faculty/Johnson.html Roger Johnson],&lt;ref name="JJ(1989)" /&gt; effort to achieve includes such variables as achievement (effect-sizes = 0.67 and 0.64 compared to competitive and individualistic efforts), long-term retention, time on-task (effect-sizes = 0.76,and 1.17), use of higher-level reasoning strategies (effect-sizes =0.93 and 0.97), generation of new ideas and solutions, transfer of what is learned within one situation to another, intrinsic motivation, achievement motivation, continuing motivation to learn, and positive attitudes toward learning and school.

'''Quality of relationships''': cooperation generally promotes greater interpersonal attraction among individuals (effect sizes = 0.67 and 0.60 compared to competitive and individualistic efforts respectively)&lt;ref name="JJ(1989)" /&gt; and greater social support (effect-sizes = 0.62 and 0.70).

'''Psychological health''': Johnson and Johnson define  psychological health as the ability (cognitive capacities, motivational orientations, and social skills) to build, maintain, and appropriately modify interdependent relationships with others to succeed in achieving goals.&lt;ref name="JJ(1989)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="J(2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JJ(2005)" /&gt; People who are unable to do so often (a) become depressed, anxious, frustrated, and lonely, (b) tend to feel afraid, inadequate, helpless, hopeless, and isolated, and (c) rigidly cling to unproductive and ineffective ways of coping with adversity.
Several scientific studies&lt;ref name="JJ(1989)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="J(2003)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JJ(2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JN(1977)"&gt;Johnson, D.W. &amp; Norem-Heibeisen, A. (1977). Attitudes toward interdependence among persons and social health. "Psychological Reports", 40, 843-850.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JamesJ(1983)"&gt;James, S. &amp; Johnson (1983). The relationship between attitudes towards social interdependence and psychological health within three criminal populations. "Journal of social psychology", 121, 131-143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JamesJ(1988)"&gt;James, S.  &amp; Johnson (1988). Social interdependence, psychological adjustment, orientation towards negative life stress and quality of second marriage. "Journal of social psychology", 128(3), 287-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JJK(1986)"&gt;Johnson, D.W., Johnson, R.T., &amp; Krotee, M. (1986). The relationship between social interdependence and psychological health within the 1980 United States ice hockey team. "Journal of Psychology" 120, 279-292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TXJJ(2008)"&gt;Tjosvold, D., XueHuang, Y., Johnson, D.W. &amp; Johnson, R. (2008) Social interdependence and orientation toward life and work. "Journal of Applied Social Psychology". Vol.38(2),  pp. 409-435.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown a strong relationship between cooperativeness and psychological health, a mixed picture was found with competitiveness and psychological health, and a strong relationship was found between an individualistic orientation and psychological pathology.

Finally, there is evidence that cooperation promotes more frequent use of higher level reasoning strategies than do competitive (effect size = 0.93) or individualistic (effect size = 0.97) efforts.&lt;ref name="JJ(1989)" /&gt;  Similarly, cooperation tends to promote more accurate perspective taking than do competitive (effect size = 0.61) or individualistic (effect size = 0.44) efforts.&lt;ref name="JJ(1989)" /&gt;  Thus, the more cooperative learning experiences students are involved in, the more mature their cognitive and moral decision making and the more they will tend to take other people's perspectives in account when making decisions.

"'''Itsy Bitsy Spider'''" (also known as "'''Incy Wincy Spider'''" in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article97265265 |title=Watervale Notes. |newspaper=[[The Northern Argus]]|location=Clare, South Australia |date=21 December 1944 |accessdate=23 July 2014 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Great Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/learning/schoolradio/subjects/earlylearning/nurserysongs/F-J/incy_wincy_spider|title=BBC - School Radio - Nursery songs and rhymes - Nursery rhymes and songs: Incy wincy spider|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other similar-sounding names) is a popular [[nursery rhyme]] and [[fingerplay]] that describes the adventures of a [[spider]] as it ascends, descends, and reascends the downspout or "waterspout" of a [[Rain gutter|gutter]] system (or, alternatively, the spout of a [[teapot]] or open-air reservoir). It is usually accompanied by a sequence of gestures that mimic the words of the song. Its [[Roud Folk Song Index]] number is 11586.

==Lyrics==
A commonly used version uses these words and gestures:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datsplat.com/words-to-the-itsy-bitsy-spider/|title=Words to The Itsy Bitsy Spider - datSplat!|website=www.datsplat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiggle fingers upwards.
(As in the first line)&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

Other versions exist.

==Origins==
The song can be found in publications including an alternative version in the book, ''Camp and Camino in Lower California'' (1910),{{sfn|North|1910}} where it was referred to as [the classic] "Spider Song".{{sfn|North|1910|pages=[https://archive.org/stream/campcaminoinlowe00nort#page/n343/mode/2up/ 279–280]}} It appears to be a different version of this song using “blooming, bloody” instead of "itsy bitsy". It was later published in one of its several modern versions in ''Western Folklore'', by the California Folklore Society (1948),&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Marian. "Children's Rhymes Accompanied by Gestures," Vol. 7, No. 1, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Mike and Peggy Seeger's, ''American Folk Songs for Children'' (1948).&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.efdss.org/cgi-bin/query.cgi?index_roud=on&amp;amp;op=and&amp;amp;query=spider%20spout&amp;amp;start=1&amp;amp;output=Record&amp;access=off ''Vaughan Williams Memorial Library'' Online search], retrieved 19 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[Maziar Bahari]]'s company Off-Centre Productions created an animated version of the song featuring an animated mouse character called "Journo".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|KmEXo8SKQAw|Itsy Bitsy Spider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyrics as described in 1910, as being from the 'classic' "Spider Song":{{sfn|North|1910|pages=[https://archive.org/stream/campcaminoinlowe00nort#page/n343/mode/2up/ 279–280]}}
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;Oh, the blooming, bloody spider went up the spider web,
The blooming, bloody rain came down and washed the spider out,
The blooming, bloody sun came out and dried up all the rain,
And the blooming, bloody spider came up the web again.&lt;/poem&gt;

The song is sung by and for children in countless languages and cultures. In Germany the melody is used for the song "{{Interlanguage link multi|Spannenlanger Hansel|de}}".

==Recordings==

The popular nursery rhyme has been covered and sampled a number of times. [[Bart Simpson]] sang the rhyme in the tenth episode of season four of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Lisa's First Word]]". It was featured in the children's program ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Something You Can Do with Your Finger]]". A child singing the rhyme twice can be heard in the opening of the ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' episode, "[[Criminal Minds (season 9)|Gatekeeper]]". It is one of the main musical themes in the 2006 horror movie ''[[Séance (2006 film)|Séance]]''.

One of the earliest Yugoslav composers to obtain high international regard, his works have been performed by symphony orchestras throughout Europe and North America.

== Biography ==
Coming from a rather 'classical' background, he met [[Pierre Schaeffer]] whom he considers his 'true and only master'; Schaeffer's teachings turned Malec into one of the most important leaders of the Groupe de recherches musicales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Culot|first=Hubert|title=Musicweb international|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2005/Apr05/malec_orchestralworks_timpani1C10786.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he dedicated himself to a more radical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=All Music|first=All Music|title=All Music|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ivo-malec-sonoris-cuasa-ottava-alta-exempla-w124931/review}}&lt;/ref&gt; style. He received a number of awards including the Grand Prix National de Musique in 1992. He is resident in France since 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Discogs|first=Discogs|title=Discogs|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Ivo+Malec}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught at the Paris Conservatoire from 1972 to 1990 where he taught composers such as [[Edith Canat de Chizy]], [[Denis Dufour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denis Dufour|url=http://www.cdmc.asso.fr/en/compositeurs/biographies/dufour_denis|work=Biography|publisher=Centre de documentation de la musique contemporaine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Hurel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurel|first=Philippe|title=Official site|url=http://www.philippe-hurel.fr/en/accueil.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe Leroux]] and Gerard Pesson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pesson|first=Gerard|title=Official site|url=http://www.mondayeveningconcerts.org/bios/pesson.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{See LMST|Ivo|Malec}}

Malec's approach to composition which in ways is similar to that of [[Denis Dufour]] or [[Xenakis]] is the emphasis on all aspects of sound including texture, density, movement, timbre and notably sonic character and form and the use of sound objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bick|first=Andreas|title=The Concept of "Sound Object" by Pierre Schaeffer|url=http://silentlistening.wordpress.com/2008/05/09/the-concept-of-%E2%80%9Esound-object%E2%80%9C-objet-sonore-by-pierre-schaeffer/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Friends'' (1994–2004)===
Depressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached [[Warren Littlefield]] at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance about her career. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged Aniston to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her for ''[[Friends]]'',&lt;ref name="shuter20120503"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/03/warren-littlefield-jennifer-aniston_n_1475363.html | title=Warren Littlefield Talks Jennifer Aniston's Journey To 'Friends' | work=The Huffington Post | date=May 3, 2012 | accessdate=August 7, 2013 | author=Shuter, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|buchanan20130807}} a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC's 1994–1995 fall lineup.

Thus, Aniston was cast as [[Rachel Green]]. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but turned it down to do ''Friends''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2011/02/jennifer-aniston-turned-down-saturday-night-live-cast-job/1|work=USA Today|first=Ann|last=Oldenburg|title=Jennifer Aniston turned down 'Saturday Night Live' job|date=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played the character of Rachel from 1994 until the show ended in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Pilot (Friends)|The Pilot]]|series=[[Friends]]|credits=[[Marta Kauffman]], [[David Crane (producer)|David Crane]], and [[Kevin S.

Following a four-year hiatus from cinema, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of the romantic comedy ''[[She's the One (1996 film)|She's the One]]'', with [[Cameron Diaz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filmography|url=http://www.anistoncenter.com/jennifer-aniston-filmography/|publisher=anistoncenter.com|accessdate=November 15, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129011123/http://www.anistoncenter.com/jennifer-aniston-filmography/|archivedate=November 29, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aniston's first starring vehicle was the film ''[[Picture Perfect (1997 film)|Picture Perfect]]'' (1997), in which she starred as a struggling young advertising executive, opposite [[Kevin Bacon]] and [[Jay Mohr]]. While the film received mixed reviews, it was a moderate commercial success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pictureperfect.htm|title=Picture Perfect|accessdate=November 5, 2018|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Aniston's performance was more warmly received, with many critics suggesting that she had screen presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/picture-perfect/critic-reviews|title=Critic Reviews for Picture Perfect at Metacritic|accessdate=July 30, 2010|publisher=metacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by [[Paul Rudd]]) in the romantic comedy ''[[The Object of My Affection]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Janet|last=Maslin|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C06E6D8143CF934A25757C0A96E958260|title=The Object of My Affection Review|accessdate=August 8, 2008|date=April 17, 1998|work=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999, she starred as a restaurant waitress in the [[cult film]] ''[[Office Space]]''  for director [[Mike Judge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Office Space' reunion: Cast and director talk Jennifer Aniston and, um yeahhh, making a cult smash – VIDEO|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/10/07/office-space-reunion-interview/|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It will no longer be possible to consider her in the same way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Good Girl|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-good-girl-2002|publisher=rogerebert.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2191">In [[academic publishing]], the '''lead author''', or '''first author''', is the first named [[author]] of a [[publication]] such as a [[research article]] or [[audit]].

[[Academic authorship]] standards vary widely across disciplines. In many academic subjects, including the natural sciences, computer science and electrical engineering, the lead author of a research article is typically the person who carried out the research and wrote and edited the paper.  The list of trailing co-authors reflects, typically, diminishing contributions to the work reported in the manuscript. Sometimes, journals require statements detailing each author's contributions to be included in each publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Editorial: What did you do? ''Nature Physics'' now requires a statement of authors' contributions to a paper|journal=Nature Physics|volume=5|pages=369|year=2009|doi=10.1038/nphys1305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other disciplines (such as mathematics) however, authors are typically listed alphabetically rather than by contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ams.org/profession/leaders/culture/CultureStatement04.pdf|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|year=2004|title=2004 Statement on The Culture of Research and Scholarship in Mathematics: Joint Research and Its Publication}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/science.pdf|title=Is POPL Mathematics or Science?|author=[[Andrew Appel]]|date=January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of multi-author papers has increased in recent decades, reflecting increasingly complex multi-investigator research projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Weltzin|first1=J. F.|first2=R. T.|last2=Belote|first3=L. M.|last3=Thomas|first4=J. K.|last4=Keller|first5=C.

[[File:Ministère de l'Éducation Nationale - Paris - 2.jpg|thumb|The head office of the ministry]]
The '''Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research''' ({{lang-fr|Ministère de l'Éducation nationale, de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche}}), or simply "Ministry of National Education", as the title has changed no small number of times in the course of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] is the French government [[French government ministers|cabinet member]] charged with running France's public educational system and with the supervision of agreements and authorizations for private teaching organizations.

The Ministry's headquarters is located in the 18th century ''Hôtel de Rochechouart'' on the rue de [[Grenelle]] in the [[7th arrondissement of Paris|7th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid2606/mentions-legales.html à propos du site - mentions légales - crédits]." Ministry of National Education. Retrieved on 6 May 2011. "Ministère de l’éducation nationale, de la jeunesse et de la vie associative Secrétariat général - Délégation à la communication 110 rue de Grenelle 75007 Paris"&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that National Education is France's largest employer, and employs more than half of the [[French Civil Service|French state civil servants]], the position is traditionally a fairly strategic one. The current minister is [[Jean-Michel Blanquer]].

==History==
A governmental position overseeing public education was first created in [[France]] in 1802.  Following the various regime changes in France in the first decades of the 19th century, the position changed official status and name a number of times before the position of '''Minister of Public Instruction''' was created in 1828.  For much of its history, the position was combined with that of [[Minister of Public Worship]], who dealt with issues related to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], except in instances where the Minister of Public Instruction was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]].  The position has also occasionally been combined with [[Minister of Sports (France)|Minister of Sports]] and Minister of Youth Affairs.  In 1932, the office's title was changed to '''Minister of National Education''', although it was briefly changed back in 1940–1941, and was renamed '''Minister of Education''' during the Presidency of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] (1974–1981). In 1975, it created the ''[[Comité d'études sur les formations d'ingénieurs]]'' which studies the training and job placement of engineers in France.

The '''National Association of Student Personnel Administrators''' is a U.S.-based student affairs organization boasting more than 13,000 members at 1,400 campuses, and 25 countries.&lt;ref name="About NASPA"&gt;{{cite web |title = About NASPA|publisher = NASPA|url = https://www.naspa.org/about|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1919 at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], NASPA is one of many organizations focused on [[graduate enrollment management]].

== History ==
[[Image:Universal North Building.JPG|thumbnail|right|NASPA headquarters in Washington, D.C.]]
In December 1918, Robert Rienow, the dean of men at the [[University of Iowa]] desired to create a meeting that would bring together various [[Dean of Men|deans of men]] in the midwest. He, with [[Thomas Arkle Clark]], dean of men at the [[University of Illinois]], facilitated the founding meeting held at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in January 1919. The first meeting was quite small - three deans of men and three professors having campus interests were in attendance.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | author = Rhatigan, James J. | title = NASPA History | publisher = NASPA | year = 1989 | url = http://www.naspa.org/about/history.cfm | accessdate = 2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Louis A. Strauss of the [[University of Michigan]] referred to the first meeting as the "Conference of Deans and Advisers of Men." This label was used in prevalence until 1929 when it was changed to the National Association of Deans and Advisers of Men (NADAM). The new name was more fitting because many American universities did not have the "Dean of Men" title. Thomas Arkle Clark was the first person to claim the title in 1909, although he assumed the responsibilities in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Thomas Arkle Clark Award | publisher = Alpha Tau Omega | url = http://www.ato.org/nat/awd_tac.shtml | accessdate = 2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Goodnight, dean of men at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], served as host for this historic first meeting. Retroactively, he is referred to as the first president of NADAM.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

In 1925, the first piece of "research" - presented by John Bennett of Teachers College, [[Columbia University]] - was offered at a NADAM meeting. It dealt with the prevalence of the office of dean of men in American colleges and universities. The last meeting of the '20s was the first to be conducted away from the college campus; there were 76 participants, each paying dues of $10.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

In the 1930s, there were continued requests for publications to be submitted to the conferences. The ''NASPA Journal'', as a result, was first introduced in 1963. Before that time, newsletters were the primary way of communicating regarding published material.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

One of the Association's major preoccupations in the 1940s was [[World War II]] and its aftermath. The adaptation of campuses to the war effort are reflected in the conference minutes, and the problems relating to veterans once the war was over took the rest of the decade. The decade was noted by the presence of Armour Blackburn of [[Howard University]], the first African-American administrator to participate and serve on an executive committee.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

As student affairs offices began to change and administrators no longer used "Dean of Men" and "Advisor of Men" as their titles, the organization followed suit.  Mary Ethel Ball, acting dean of students at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], became the first female "institutional representative," although women had participated in meetings since the 20s. Dean Wesley P. Lloyd at [[Brigham Young University]] recommended a name change in 1951 to the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA). This gave a new breadth to the organization, which stated its purpose: "to discuss and study the most effective methods of aiding students in their intellectual, social, moral, and personal development".&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

Five commissions were established at the 1951 conference to deal with substantive, ongoing issues (e.g., professional relationships, [[ethics]], [[Professional Development|professional preparation]]). A secondary benefit of the commissions was in making more members able to participate in the association's activities.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

The 1960s marked many changes in NASPA. For the first time, outside funding was secured for a NASPA activity, making the association an early leader in educating members concerning [[drug abuse]]. NASPA was an active participant in the development of the Joint Statement on [[Rights]] and Freedoms of Students. From 1966 until the end of the decade and beyond, crisis was the most prominent [[campus]] issue and the most prominent association concern. Some deans were enormously successful in protecting both their campuses and the rights of students, but disruption of campuses became more prevalent.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

During the 1970s, increased regionalization heightened opportunities for involvement across the whole spectrum of NASPA's membership. Alice Manicur of Frostbug State College became the first female president, and community colleges began to make their presence felt. George Young at [[Broward Community College]] was the first [[community college]] person to serve as president of NASPA.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

It was during this decade that NASPA first established a national office under the leadereship of Channing Briggs at [[Portland State University]]. Upon Briggs' retirement in 1981, Richard F. Stevens became the second [[executive director]], and the national office was moved to [[Ohio State University]]. In 1985, the association voted to move its headquarters to [[Washington, D.C.]], and in 1987 Elizabeth M. Nuss of [[Indiana University]], succeeded Stevens. In 1995, Gwendolyn Dungy succeeded Nuss.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; In 2000 the [[National Association for Women in Education]] was merged into NASPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IegaBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=National+Association+for+Women+in+Education&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBWoVChMIpraG0uPlxgIVyckUCh1Z3QYO#v=onepage&amp;q=National%20Association%20for%20Women%20in%20Education&amp;f=false|title=Deans of Women and the Feminist Movement: Emily Taylor's Activism|date=December 2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=113748134X|page=187|author=Kelly C.

Laurence Smith, Vice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management at [[Eastern Michigan University]], initiated the concept of the Centers for Innovation in February 2000, proposing centers for [[leadership]], [[policy|public policy]], [[research]], and [[technology]] to guide professional development for the association. &lt;ref name="Recent History"&gt;{{cite web | author = Tuttle, Kathryn Nemeth | title = Recent History | publisher = NASPA | date = May 6, 2008 | url = http://www.naspa.org/about/history2.cfm | accessdate = 2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Civics Bureau''' ({{lang-ms|Biro Tata Negara}}), abbreviated '''BTN''', was an [[Government agency|agency]] of the Malaysian previous ruling [[government of Malaysia|government]] under [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition in the [[Prime Minister's Department]]. It was established in 1974 as the Youth Research Unit (Unit Penyelidikan Belia) under the Youth Ministry, but was renamed and transferred in 1981. BTN's stated objective is to nurture the spirit of patriotism and commitment to excellence among Malaysians, and train leaders and future leaders to support the nation's development efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Latar Belakang |url=http://www.btn.gov.my/v2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=351&amp;Itemid=41 |accessdate=21 November 2009 |publisher=Biro Tata Negara |language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt; BTN's programmes are controversial, and many accuse them of explicitly promoting ''[[ketuanan Melayu]]'' and the former governing coalition [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lim Kit Siang |title=Any Najib apology for the rank racism of BTN indoctrination courses? |url=http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2008/09/04/any-najib-apology-for-the-rank-racism-of-btn-indoctrination-courses/ |work=The New Straits Times |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anwar trains his sights on 1 Malaysia |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/25013-anwar-trains-his-sights-on-1-malaysia |work=The Malaysian Insider |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Azly Rahman |title=Create radical social futurists, dismantle Biro Tata Negara -- that threat to national unity |url=http://malaysia-today.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28726:create-radical-social-futurists-dismantle-biro-tata-negara-that-threat-to-national-unity&amp;catid=1:a-republic-of-virtue&amp;Itemid=100088 |work=Malaysia Today |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November 2009, the [[Selangor]] state government issued a ban prohibiting state civil servants, employees of state subsidiaries, and students at state-owned institutions from attending BTN courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tan Yi Liang |title=Selangor boycotts Biro Tata Negara programmes |url=http://www.thesundaily.com/article.cfm?id=40637 |work=The Sun Daily |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mazlinda Mahmood |title=No Biro Tatanegara courses for Selangor govt employees |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/articles/8ku/Article/index_html |work=The New Straits Times |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127134134/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/articles/8ku/Article/index_html |archivedate=27 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2009, the [[Penang]] state government followed suit and banned all state civil servants from attending the controversial courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penang bans civil servants from attending BTN courses |url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/32309 |work=Sin Chew |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 13 August 2018, Youth and Sports Minister [[Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman]] from the new federal government under [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH) announced that the BTN and [[National Service Training Programme (Malaysia)|National Service Training Programme]] (PLKN) were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/08/13/syed-saddiq-btn-and-national-service-are-abolished/ Syed Saddiq: BTN and National Service are abolished]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.malaymail.com/s/1661883/syed-saddiq-btn-national-service-abolished Syed Saddiq: BTN, National Service abolished]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of racism==
Although BTN has been the subject of various allegations over the years, in late 2009, it became the subject of greater controversy, when many allegations of racism and political propaganda appeared in quick succession. One BTN alumnus claimed that he was "taught a song with lyrics like 'the land that you walk upon is owned by others'. Lecturers told us the [[Malay people|Malays]] were forced to depend on the [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] for support after 1998 because some Malays had betrayed their own race," in reference to Malays voting against the [[Barisan Nasional]] in [[Malaysian general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. [[Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad]], another alumnus and assemblyman for Seri Setia in the [[Selangor State Assembly|State Legislative Assembly of Selangor]], claimed that the BTN camp he attended was "racial and political in nature," with trainers telling attendees that Malays require [[affirmative action]] and criticising the opposition [[Parti Islam SeMalaysia]] (PAS) as "deviationist". Amirudin Shari, assemblyman for [[Batu Caves]], claimed that "participants are indoctrinated with propaganda about '[[Ketuanan Melayu]]' and external threats".&lt;ref name="patriotism camps"&gt;{{cite news |title=KL patriotism camps ‘racist and political’ |url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44127-kl-patriotism-camps-racist-and-political |work=The Malaysian Insider |date=21 November 2009 |accessdate=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another alumnus claims he was taught that the Chinese were "the Jews of Asia," and part of a [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to topple the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Asrul Hadi | last=Abdullah Sani | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=‘BTN taught me the Chinese are the Jews of Asia’ | date=27 November 2009 | publisher=The Malaysian Insider | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44775-btn-taught-me-the-chinese-are-the-jews-of-asia | work = | pages = | accessdate = 27 November 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another alumnus alleged she was "told that the Malays were the most supreme race in the world, we were God's chosen few, that the others were insignificant. We were warned about certain elements in our society and abroad, determined to undermine Malay excellence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mariam | last=Mokhtar | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=BTN: Divisive, racist, {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated | date=5 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/119070 | work =Malaysiakini | pages = | accessdate = 7 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2009, Nik Nazmi, Amirudin and five other [[Pakatan Rakyat]] state assemblymen asked the Selangor government to stop requiring students at its universities and colleges to attend BTN courses. After the Selangor government issued a ban prohibiting state employees and students at state institutions from attending BTN programmes, the State Executive Councillor for Education, Dr. Halimah Ali, described the courses as "indoctrination by the Barisan Nasional government" and said, "the courses promote racism and my own children who have attended BTN have been given booklets that encourage hate towards the opposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Neville |last=Spykerman |title=Selangor moves to stop BTN ‘brainwashing’ | date=26 November 2009 |url=http://themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44582-selangor-moves-to-stop-btn-brainwashing |work=The Malaysian Insider |accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, BTN deputy director Hamim Husin was reported for referring Chinese as ''Si mata pepet'' (the slant-eyed) and Indians as ''Si botol'' (the drinkers) during a closed-door function of Puteri UMNO (Women youth wing of [[United Malays National Organisation]]) delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Su Lyn|first1=Boo|title=Malays must rule the country, says BTN rep|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/malays-must-rule-the-country-says-btn-rep#sthash.hm9a6NCx.dpbs|accessdate=21 June 2015|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|date=27 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526175152/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/malays-must-rule-the-country-says-btn-rep|archivedate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kashuerin|first1=Suresh|title=Kit Siang: Racist BTN should be dissolved|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/19/kit-siang-racist-btn-should-be-dissolved/|accessdate=21 June 2015|publisher=Free Malaysia Today|date=19 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621211148/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/19/kit-siang-racist-btn-should-be-dissolved/|archivedate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Minister in Prime Minister's department [[Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz|Nazri Aziz]] reported that the deputy director has been suspended from duty since October 2010 and a warning letter has been issued. However, the duration of suspension was not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Si sepet, si kaki botol, pegawai rasis digantung (Si sepet, Si kaki botol, racist employee is suspended)|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/147567|accessdate=21 June 2015|publisher=Malaysiakini|date=8 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530150545/http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/147567|archivedate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response by the Malaysian government==
''The Malaysian Insider'' reported in November 2009 that in response to brewing controversy, the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Cabinet]] had discussed the need to revamp BTN. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Idris Jala]] arranged a briefing for the Cabinet on the effects of BTN programmes, and the meeting concluded with the Prime Minister reportedly saying, "This must end." In an editorial, the publication said: "''The Malaysian Insider'' understands that there are moves within the administration to dilute the syllabus of BTN courses, as a compromise. But such half-measures are not likely to be enough if Najib is serious about reversing what many Malaysians see as institutionalised racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Leslie | last=Lau | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Najib’s BTN dilemma | date=28 November 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44845-pkr-najib-faces-btn-dilemma | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 29 November 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Malay titles|Tan Sri]] [[Muhyiddin Yassin]] defended BTN, saying its programmes inculcate nationalism and unity among Malaysians in line with the Prime Minister's [[1Malaysia]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DPM defends BTN courses against racist brainwashing charges  |url=http://themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44692-muhyiddin-btn-courses-not-political-indoctrination |work=The Malaysian Insider |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BTN Courses Not Political Indoctrination - Muhyiddin  |url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=458094 |work=BERNAMA |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Malay titles|Datuk]] [[Ahmad Maslan]] said "knowledge and information ... presented at these courses are based on historical facts and data ... collected from various agencies and ... experts" and are consistent with 1Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Teaching based on historical facts and data'  |url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=458094 |work=The New Straits Times |date=27 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad, who is also head of the BTN, denied allegations that it was systemically racist: "Out of the 1,000 lectures given, maybe only one minute the lecturer had a slip-up so it is unfair that you portray BTN as racist just for that." Describing typical course contents, he said participants "are taught about the Federal Constitution, the social contract, the position of the Malays in this country and 60 per cent of the population are the bumiputras." Although Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Nazri Aziz]] previously told the press that the Cabinet had ordered a revamp of BTN courses to eliminate elements inconsistent with 1Malaysia, Ahmad denied this, saying that Cabinet merely wanted an "upgrade" as opposed to a "revamp".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Syed Jaymal | last=Zahiid | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=More flip-flop as BTN chief speaks out | date=1 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45128-more-flip-flop-as-btn-chief-speaks-out- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 1 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding, Nazri insisted that "Whatever word you use, upgrade or revamp ... to me, it is a change of module. Datuk Ahmad Masalan is a member of the Cabinet, he can’t dispute my statement." Nazri also criticised the denial of allegations against BTN, saying that opposition members who had previously been in government like Leader of the Opposition [[Anwar Ibrahim]] "know, so what is there to deny?" and said that BTN had been used to promote certain political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Syed Jaymal | last=Zahiid | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Nazri says no point denying what BTN is | date=1 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45161-nazri-says-no-point-denying-what-btn-is- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 1 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahathir's involvement in BTN==
Former Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] defended BTN as meant to inculcate the values of discipline and hard work in public servants and scholars: "What we tried to teach them is that they should have new values, new culture...because the culture and the value-system they have is not conducive to success. If they want to serve the government well, they must accept and practice a certain value system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Shazwan | last=Mustafa Kamal | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=Dr M says criticisms against BTN an ‘exaggeration’ | date=7 December 2009 | publisher= | url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45729-dr-m-says-criticisms-against-btn-an-exaggeration- | work=The Malaysian Insider | pages= | accessdate=7 December 2009 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212223735/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45729-dr-m-says-criticisms-against-btn-an-exaggeration- | archivedate=12 December 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling party-owned ''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'' newspaper criticised the decision to change the BTN curriculum, claiming Nazri was acting on his own and urging the government not to "bow down" to the opposition.&lt;ref name='nazri dr m'&gt;{{cite news | first=Asrul Hadi | last=Abdullah Sani | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=Nazri calls Dr M a racist for defending BTN | date=7 December 2009 | publisher= | url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45724-nazri-calls-dr-m-a-racist-for-defending-btn | work=The Malaysian Insider | pages= | accessdate=7 December 2009 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212223732/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45724-nazri-calls-dr-m-a-racist-for-defending-btn | archivedate=12 December 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Nazri branded Mahathir's statement "bloody racist," criticising both him and ''Utusan Malaysia'' for denying the allegations against BTN:

{{quote|Don't think that people outside do not know about the syllabus based on patriotism for Malays. ... They all know what the syllabus is all about so who are we to say that it did not happen? You want to lie? You make people laugh. I mean there are people who attended the courses who came out very angry. There were many instances of the use of words like ''ketuanan Melayu''. It is ridiculous... Do they want to say that Malaysia belongs only to the Malays and the government is only a Malay government? Should only the Malays be given the spirit of patriotism? Other races are not patriotic about their country?&lt;ref name='nazri dr m'/&gt;}}

Nazri denied that criticism from Pakatan Rakyat or the Selangor government decision were reasons for the Cabinet decision, saying: "...courses run by BTN using public funds must be used properly and it amounts to millions so if you want to talk about patriotism, patriotism for all, not just the Malays, for all Malaysians. It's not because of the Selangor state government that we changed the syllabus so it's long before that."&lt;ref name='nazri dr m'/&gt; In response, Mahathir accused Nazri of hypocrisy, saying "I must be a racist if Nazri says I am racist. Don't ever say that I am not. He knows everything. He belongs to a party which is racist... which is [[United Malays National Organisation|Umno]]. ... Umno is a party ''perkauman'' [racism] and is meant only for Malays and nobody [else] can join. So he (Nazri) is in a racist party but says he is against racism. So he should resign from the party." Mahathir is a former President of Umno, and was still a member of it and the time of making the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=You belong to a racist party: Dr M to Nazri | date=8 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/119320 | work =Malaysiakini | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koh Tsu Koon]], another Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, defended Nazri, saying perhaps Mahathir was unaware of the nature of BTN's curriculum: "[R]ecent feedback from participants since last year showed that the BTN course has diverted from its earlier version. Participants, including JPA [Public Services Department] scholars, felt very upset and disheartened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=G. | last=Manimaran | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Nazri finds another backer in tiff with Dr M | date=8 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45862-nazri-finds-another-backer-in-tiff-with-dr-m | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former BTN director and Member of Parliament for [[Sungai Petani]], [[Johari Abdul]] then alleged that Mahathir was responsible for changes in the BTN programme, saying that under Mahathir, BTN courses emphasised propaganda supportive of the ruling party, making claims such as "If the Umno-BN government falls, then ... the Malays would be enslaved in their own country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Syed Jaymal | last=Zahiid | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Dr M transformed BTN to a super-racist agency, says former director | date=8 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45873-dr-m-transformed-btn-to-a-super-racist-agency-says-former-director- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Members of Parliament, such as deputy chair of the Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club and MP for [[Kinabatangan]], [[Bung Mokhtar Radin]], argued that BTN still served a useful purpose: "I don't see it as racist. It is one of the government agencies that have taught society the characteristics of a great nation and understand the real Malaysia. BTN has also played a role since independence towards strengthening racial harmony in this country. So I really regret the actions by Pakatan state governments to prohibit the activities by BTN because BTN has never had the intention to weaken any party members but it is a platform for the public to gain knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Asrul Hadi | last=Abdullah Sani | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Umno backbenchers maintain BTN is not racist | date=9 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45989-umno-backbenchers-maintain-btn-is-not-racist- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaked presentation slides ==
From 11 March 2015 until 15 June 2015, BTN had published a series of presentation slides which was available on its official website. One of the presentation slides had claimed [[Malay language|Malay]] [[Small press|independent publishers]] to be "anti-establishment", in which their "movement without supervision from the authorities" will "bring a negative effect on the government" and  giving birth to "new icons of the young generation that spread extreme and free ideas".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The slide had also recommended that government officials ban any books having "explicit and free" content produced by them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerakan Indie Di Malaysia (Indie Movement in Malaysia)|url=https://archive.org/details/GerakanIndieDiMalaysia|publisher=Biro Tata Negara|accessdate=23 June 2015|language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BTN slaps bull’s-eye on Malay counterculture for anti-establishment bent|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-slaps-bulls-eye-on-malay-counterculture-for-anti-establishment-bent|accessdate=23 June 2015|agency=Malay Mail online|date=15 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623143632/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-slaps-bulls-eye-on-malay-counterculture-for-anti-establishment-bent|archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has raised ire from the publishers, who had collectively made a media statement demanding a public apology from the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malay indie group strikes back at BTN, demands public apology|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malay-indie-group-strikes-back-at-btn-demands-public-apology|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=The Malay Mail Online|date=20 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623144619/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malay-indie-group-strikes-back-at-btn-demands-public-apology|archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, BTN decided to take down all the controversial slides from its website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BTN removes slides from website after caught with pants down|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-removes-slides-from-website-after-caught-with-pants-down|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=The Malay Mail Online|date=15 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616175133/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-removes-slides-from-website-after-caught-with-pants-down|archivedate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining that the content of the slides were meant for "academic discussion" only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No hard feelings, BTN boss tells ‘indie’ scene after attack slides leaked|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/no-hard-feelings-btn-boss-tells-indie-scene-after-attack-slides-leaked|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=The Malay Mail Online|date=16 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623145631/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/no-hard-feelings-btn-boss-tells-indie-scene-after-attack-slides-leaked|archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other slides published by the agency included a slide that examined the performance of the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) ruling coalition from 1959 to 2014 with racial breakdown of popular votes towards BN and [[Pakatan Rakyat]] (PR) seats and also percentages of Muslim and non-Muslim [[member of parliament]] (MPs) in [[Parliament of Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politik Malaysia|url=https://archive.org/details/POLITIKMALAYSIA|publisher=Biro Tata Negara|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another slide had accused Chinese newspapers of being "fine needles that penetrate the government whilst promoting opposition movements." The national opposition party [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) is accused of using several Malay leaders to purportedly "destroy the Malay community". DAP was also accused in the slide of controlling the minds of people from [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] by invoking the issue of [[Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur v Menteri Dalam Negeri|the use of the name "Allah" in the context of local Christian presses]], and inciting separation of both states from Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Tarrence|title=BTN is Apartheid 2.0 in M’sia, says DAP|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/16/btn-is-apartheid-2-0-in-msia-says-dap/|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=Free Malaysia Today|date=16 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618195549/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/16/btn-is-apartheid-2-0-in-msia-says-dap/|archivedate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slide also claimed that a change in the current government will cause "political instability" in the country, bringing up comparisons with the [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|Khmer Rouge regime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perkembangan Cabaran Politik semasa dalam negara (Development of current political challenges in the country)|url=https://archive.org/details/PERKEMBANGANCABARANPOLITIKSEMASADALAMNEGARA|publisher=Biro Tata Negara|accessdate=23 June 2015|language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another slide presents a breakdown of a list of the 10 richest men in Malaysia, where most of them are Chinese, and also the situation of Christians "being allowed to build large churches despite only accounting for 9.1% of the total population in Malaysia". It also argued that "racism can unite a nation or race", whereas the racial minorities in Malaysia "already have their needs fulfilled as entitled under [[international human rights law]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rasis (Racist)|url=https://archive.org/details/RASIS|publisher=Biro Tata Negara|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BTN’s own slides proof of racism, says Kasturi|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/21/btns-own-slides-proof-of-racism-says-kasturi/|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=Free Malaysia Today|date=21 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623151745/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/21/btns-own-slides-proof-of-racism-says-kasturi/|archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abolishment ==
In August 2018, [[Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman]], the Youth and Sports Minister of Malaysia announced that the National Civics Bureau will be abolished with immediate effect. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysias-national-service-programme-national-civics-bureau-abolished-says-youth-and|title=Malaysia's NS programme, National Civics Bureau abolished, says Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq|last=hermesauto|date=2018-08-13|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.malaymail.com/s/1661883/syed-saddiq-btn-national-service-abolished|title=Syed Saddiq: BTN, National Service abolished {{!}} Malay Mail|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to scrap the BTN programme was made during two successive Cabinet meetings, because evidence shown that the programme was misused to spread misguided indoctrination.

'''Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning''' ('''POGIL''') is a student-centered, group-learning instructional strategy and philosophy developed through research on how students learn best. POGIL was devised in 1994 to better teach general [[chemistry education|chemistry]]. Today, POGIL is implemented in a wide range of subjects in more than 1,000 American high schools and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etsu.edu/news/2015/09_sep/patrickbrowntextbook.aspx|title=Professor authors Anatomy and Physiology textbook|author=Dr. Patrick Brown|work=News|publisher=East Tennessee State University|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

There are two crucial aspects to the design of a POGIL activity. First, sufficient appropriate information must be provided for the initial "Exploration" so that students are able to develop the desired concepts. Second, the guiding questions must be sequenced in a carefully constructed manner so that not only do students reach the appropriate conclusion, but at the same time various process and learning skills are implemented and developed. 

Typically the first few questions build on students' prior knowledge and direct attention to the information provided by the model. This is followed by questions designed to help promote the recognitions of relationships and patterns in the data, leading toward some concept development. The final questions may involve applying the concepts to new situations and generalizing students' new knowledge and understanding. Thus, POGIL activities follow the structure of the learning cycle of exploration, concept invention and application, and has a strong basis in constructivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00104.2012|title=Process-oriented guided-inquiry learning improves long-term retention of information|author=Thea Vanags, Kristen Pammer, and Jay Brinker|date=20 July 2012|work=How We Teach|publisher=American Physiological Society|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classroom implementation ==

Students in a POGIL classroom may work in small groups of three or four to tackle a specifically designed activity. Each student is assigned a role, such as a task manager, recorder, spokesperson or reflector. The instructor acts as a facilitator who listens to the discussions between students, intervening at appropriate times to help facilitate student learning. In their groups, students may discuss and analyze problems and their answers to questions that are crafted to help lead them to consider the general ideas in question and to construct their own understanding of important concepts. As they formulate their ideas, they may share their understanding and discoveries with other groups.

Rather than having the instructor begin class by defining terms and laying out concepts, students work actively to master material and formulate a deeper understanding of content. Built into the experience is the support of a variety of important process skills, including communication, teamwork, and [[critical thinking]], which translates to a more complete understanding of the entire concept, and a lasting understanding of the material. 

== The POGIL Project ==

The teaching method of POGIL is supported by the POGIL Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/pkal/pogil/how.html|title=How to Use Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning|work=Science Education Resource Center|publisher=Pedagogies of Engagement: Resource Collections|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[non-profit]] [[501(c)3]] organization based in Lancaster, PA. The POGIL Project has earned numerous grants from the National Science Foundation and other sources. The POGIL Project is based on an understanding of the important components of an effective faculty development structure. The project trains faculty to implement POGIL in their classrooms, and creates new POGIL materials through an multitude of opportunities including [[workshops]], on-site visits, and consultancies. The project also hosts an annual POGIL National Meeting to grow and expand the POGIL community. 

The current director of The POGIL Project is Rick Moog, a Professor of Chemistry at [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]]. Dr. Moog has used POGIL materials in his teaching since 1994, and is a co-author of POGIL materials for both general and [[physical chemistry]].

The '''Scottish Science Advisory Council''' is a government organisation that is Scotland's highest level advisory body for science, engineering and technology.

The group of experts provide independent advice to the [[Scottish Government]]. Members are appointed by the [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning]].
It acts in an advisory role and does not direct any research funding, which comes from the [[UK Research Councils]].

==History==
Scotland has a [[Scottish inventions and discoveries|proud tradition]] of science research and innovation, but this tends to be exclusively found in its main universities. R&amp;D in Scottish industry is lower than the rest of the UK ([[Countries of the United Kingdom|RUK]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottishscience.org.uk/sites/default/files/article-attachments/SSAC-Report-business-R%26D-in-Scotland-A-missing-link.pdf Report August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland has 10% of the population of the UK but produces 30% of the [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]s in microbiology and genetics. The [[University of Dundee]] is noted for its work in biochemistry.

However in physical sciences, from 1999–2004, there was a 12% drop in Scottish graduates, and a 17% drop in engineering and technology graduates. In the post-war years, and up to the early 1990s, Scotland was producing more than its fair share of science and engineering graduates; it was seen a popular and challenging option, although mainly among males. Now, proportionately more children at Scottish schools are perceived to be indifferent to the challenges that science presents. Older science teachers at Scottish schools are not being replaced in the number needed. ''Why Science Matters'', the 2003 report, found that Scotland was short of around 350 chemistry teachers and 200 physics teachers. 

The organisation was announced in August 2001, and founded by the Royal Society of Edinburgh, with funding from the Scottish Executive.

From 1 January 2007, it moved to the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser. Previously it had been at the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

She studied singing in her native country with the soprano [[Mimi Hviid]] before making her professional debut at the [[Gamle Logen]] in Oslo in 1920. She then pursued further voice studies in Rome with [[Rosina Storchia]] and made her Italian debut at the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]] in 1925 as Norina in [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[Don Pasquale]]''. She was heard at that house later that year as Rosina in [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''. She was then heard in the title role of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'' at [[La Scala]], and during her time in Milan studied singing further with the conductor [[Antonio Votto]]. She was soon heard at the [[Opéra-Comique]] in Paris as Santuzza in [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]''. After further engagements in the French provinces, she became a member of the [[National Theatre, Oslo]] where she remained active for the rest of her career. As an educator, she was the singing teacher of [[Eva Gustavson]].

She was raised in [[Lee's Summit, Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=110633 Kansas City, MO Library bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310210615/http://www.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=110633 |date=March 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and she studied at [[Palm Beach Junior College]] in Florida. She worked on the staff of publisher [[Lyle Stuart]] and published a book about shopping in New York.

In 1969 she published, under the pseudonym of "J.", ''The Sensuous Woman'', subtitled "the first how-to book for the female who yearns to be all woman". It was also published as ''The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman''. The book spent eight weeks at No. 1 on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list and nearly a year on the list overall.&lt;ref&gt;John Bear, ''The No. 1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In later editions, she used the name Terry Garrity. A spoken-word record album was made in 1969, based on the book, called ''J – The Way To Become A Sensuous Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Voxpop, [http://www.voxpopmusic.com/ViewProdDetails.asp?prod_code=11676&amp;Prod_name=The+Way+To+Become+A+Sensuous+Woman&amp;CAT_CODE=15&amp;SUBCAT_CODE=36 "J – The Way To Become A Sensuous Woman" (LP)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311141307/http://www.voxpopmusic.com/ViewProdDetails.asp?prod_code=11676&amp;Prod_name=The+Way+To+Become+A+Sensuous+Woman&amp;CAT_CODE=15&amp;SUBCAT_CODE=36 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyp Records, [http://www.hipwax.com/music/oddpop/sex_ed.html "The Amorous Arts"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, she published ''Total Loving: how to love and be loved for the rest of your life'', and in 1984, ''Story of "J": the author of The Sensuous Woman tells the bitter price of her crazy success'', with her brother John Garrity as co-author. In this book she and her brother discuss how she coped with [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;John Garrity, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1998/weekly/980907/teeingoff.html "Teeing Off: The Wrong Diagnosis?] Sports Illustrated/CNN, September 2, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Cooperative''' was an informal group of famous French academics organized in 1907 to teach their children at a higher level than was available in Paris at the time. The group started when [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] noticed the strong mathematical potential of their daughter, [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irène]]. Unable to find a school that could meet her needs, they joined forces with several other parents with strong academic backgrounds including [[Paul Langevin]] and [[Jean Perrin]], and decided to take turns teaching one another's children. 

The curriculum of The Cooperative was varied and included not only the principles of science and scientific research but such diverse subjects as Chinese and sculpture, with great emphasis placed on self-expression and play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/ci/1992/IreneJoliot-Curie.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714121032/http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/ci/1992/IreneJoliot-Curie.html |archivedate=2007-07-14 |df= }} Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6698">The WAC Clearinghouse publishes [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]], [[Open access|open-access]] journals and books, as well as other professional resources for teachers and instructional materials for students. [[Writing across the curriculum|Writing-across-the-curriculum]] (WAC) refers to a formal programmatic approach within contemporary secondary and higher education composition studies that promotes the importance of writing in classes outside of composition. 

Working in partnership with the Association for Writing Across the Curriculum Programs (AWAC), the WAC Clearinghouse operates as a publishing collaborative, drawing on contributions from more than 125 individuals serving on the editorial boards of [[Academic journal|academic journals]] supported by the Clearinghouse, as editors or reviewers of its book series, as editors of resource pages on its website, and as members of the overall Clearinghouse editorial board. The open-access character of the scholarship available through the Clearinghouse book series provides free access to scholarly books and [[Textbook|textbooks]], providing students and teachers with an alternative to purchasing scholarly and classroom instructional materials. For individuals and libraries who wish to own print copies of its books, the Clearinghouse works with [[University Press of Colorado|University Press of Colorado]] to make print books available in low-cost editions. The Clearinghouse also collaborates with other open-access publishers in the field of [[Composition_studies|writing studies]], including Computers and Composition [[Digital printing|Digital Press]] and Writing Spaces, which both publish  open-access scholarly work, including innovative, [[Multimodality|multimodal]] digital writing projects, using traditional academic peer reviewed processes. The WAC Clearinghouse addresses several disciplinary areas within writing studies, such as [[Second language writing|second-language writing]], [[Writing fellow|writing fellows]], and writing in the [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] disciplines.

==History==
Established in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/about/brief-history/|title=A Brief History of the WAC Clearinghouse|accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Clearinghouse is among the most successful open-access publishing projects in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazerman|first1=Charles|title=Open access book publishing in writing studies: A case study|journal=First Monday|date=7 January 2008|volume=13|issue=1|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2088/1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmquist|first1=Mike|last2=Mullin|first2=Joan|last3=Blalock|first3=Glenn|editor=Lee Nickoson|others=Mary P.

The Clearinghouse also has published 90 books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neff|first1=Joyce Magnotto|last2=Whithaus|first2=Carl|title=Writing Across Distances and Disciplines: Research and Pedagogy in Distributed Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9f-OAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT239|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135596767|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides access to peer-reviewed resources for teachers who wish to use writing in courses across the disciplines, including a bibliography (published in collaboration with CompPile, which became part of the Clearinghouse in 2018), resource pages on writing fellows programs and [[Second language|second-language]] learners, conference proceedings, WAC program descriptions, a list of scholarly journals, and the 2014 Statement on WAC Principles and Practices, among others.

==Sustainable Publishing Initiative==

In May 2012, to mark its fifteenth year of operation, the WAC Clearinghouse launched the 25 Collective, a demonstration project for sustainable publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/sustain/|title=The Sustainable Publishing Initiative|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the project was to publish 25 new books for a total expenditure of $50,000—a cost far below that borne by traditional academic presses. Leveraging university resources (office space, computing resources, and web servers), the project operated within its budget and had, by March 2017, reached its goal, producing 29 books at an average cost of less than $2000 per book. The success of the project led to the launch of the Colorado State University Open Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://press.colostate.edu/|title=Colorado State University Open Press|accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a publishing project that supports the use of the publishing collaborative model developed through the WAC Clearinghouse in other disciplines.

==Support==

The Clearinghouse is hosted by [[Colorado State University]] and receives support from the Colorado State University Open Press. It also receives support from donations and funds from purchases of selected books in print form. Donations are used to defray costs associated with honoraria for graduate students who serve as copy editors and designers for Clearinghouse books, for accessibility to the Web site and publications, for the purchase of [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN numbers]], and for software and equipment expense. Interested patrons my donate online or by check through the Clearinghouse Web site.
