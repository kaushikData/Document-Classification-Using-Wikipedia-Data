'''Akiva Arieh Weiss''', also spelled '''Aryeh''' (1868-1947), was the initiator and  founder of a Jewish settlement, Ahuzat Bayit, established in 1909 in [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem|Ottoman Palestine]], which grew to become "the first Hebrew city", [[Tel Aviv]], today [[Israel]]'s main economic hub.

==Biography==
Weiss, a jeweler and watchmaker, was born in the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanford |title=Ahuzat Bayit and the Founding of Tel Aviv in 1909 |url= https://lib.stanford.edu/eliasaf-robinson-tel-aviv-collection/ahuzat-bayit-and-founding-tel-aviv-1909 |website=stanford.edu |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=27 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027171738/https://lib.stanford.edu/eliasaf-robinson-tel-aviv-collection/ahuzat-bayit-and-founding-tel-aviv-1909 |archivedate=27 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He immigrated from [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] to Palestine in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kohen|first1=Edna Yekutieli Kohen - Granddaughter of Akiva Aryeh Weiss|title=Tel-Aviv Centennial - Akiva Aryeh Weiss (1868-1947)|url=http://www.boeliem.com/content/2008/791.html|website=boeliem.com/index.html|publisher=Boeleim; Complete Reference to Israeli Stamps|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[president]] of the then newly established [[building cooperative]] named simply ''Ahuzat Bayit'', [[Hebrew]] for Building Society, Weiss presided over the 1909 real estate lottery in which 66 Jewish families drew numbers written on seashells to determine the allocation of lots in the about-to-be established city of Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name="AzaryahuTroen2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Azaryahu |first1=Maoz |last2=Troen |first2=Selwyn Ilan |title=Tel-Aviv, the First Century: Visions, Designs, Actualities |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yLQrEPLDkGAC&amp;pg=PA31 |accessdate=19 April 2014 |year=2012 |publisher= Indiana University Press |isbn= 9780253223579 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kosharek |first=Noah |url= http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1079400.html |title= Seashell lottery |publisher= [[Haaretz]] |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weiss was a founder of the textile industry in [[Mandatory Palestine]], and built the earliest textile [[factory]], the [[Lodzia House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BarOr|title=43 Nahmani Street, Tel Aviv-Jaffa – Lodzia House |url= http://www.amnon-baror.co.il/projectpt1/%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%95%D7%91-%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%99-43-%D7%AA%D7%9C-%D7%90%D7%91%D7%99%D7%91-%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%93%D7%96%D7%99%D7%94/?lang=en |website= amnon-baror.co.il/?lang=en |accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Weiss' visions which became reality was the establishment of a [[Israeli diamond industry|Jewish diamond industry]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="1900to37"&gt;[http://www.israelidiamond.co.il/english/news.aspx?boneID=1450 The Early 1900s] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061107080722/http://www.israelidiamond.co.il/English/NEWS.aspx?boneid=1450 |date=2006-11-07 }} by Shira Ami&lt;/ref&gt;

==House==

The cornerstone of Weiss's Tel Aviv house at #2 Herzl Street was laid in 1909.  Originally a single-story structure, the upper floor was added in the 1920s.  The house was restored between 1996 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amnon Bar &amp; Co.

'''M. P Appachu Ranjan''' (born 11 September 1957) is an Indian politician who was the Former Minister for Youth Services and Sports in Karnataka,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karnataka.gov.in/dyss/Pages/home.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128043046/http://www.karnataka.gov.in/dyss/Pages/home.aspx |archivedate=2014-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a state in Southern India. He is a leader of the BJP in Karnataka and a fifth time Member of the [[Karnataka Legislative Assembly]]  from Madikeri Constituency in [[Kodagu district]], [[Karnataka]]. He belongs to the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] [[Hindu]] community.

==Personal life==

Mandepanda Poovaiah Appachu Ranjan was born on 11 September 1957 in a village called Chembebellur in Virajpet Taluk of [[Kodagu District]]. His parents were Poovaiah and Kamavva of the Mandepanda family. He completed his Pre-University College education and Bachelor of Arts from [[Vivekananda College, Puttur]]. He is married to Shyla Appachu and has 2 sons and a daughter. A good sportsman, Ranjan was the member of college hockey and football teams. In 1997, he won the best sportsman award in a sports tourney organised for South Indian MLAs.

==Political career==

He entered politics in the year of 1978 as a member of the then Janatha Party and after being active in public life as the member of the Kumbur School Development Management Committee, president of the Madapur VSSSN, correspondent of the Chennamma Junior College in Madapur, director of the Kodagu District Coffee Growers Society in [[Madikeri]], member of the [[Kushalnagar]] APMC, he was formally elected as a mandal panchayat member. He held various posts over the years amassing immense experience in the field of managing Co-operative and Agricultural organizations.

Mr. Ranjan’s major foray into politics came in 1980 when he was elected president of the BJP youth wing in Madapur. He occupied the post of the [[Somwarpet]] taluk BJP president from 1986 to 1991 and later served as the president of the Kodagu BJP unit from 1991 to 1995. It was during his tenure that the BJP stormed the Congress bastion in Kodagu to win all three Assembly segments, others being D.S. Madappa (Madikeri) and H.D. Basavaraj (Virajpet). Somwarpet constituency was done away with during the delimitation after which Kodagu was reduced to Madikeri and Virajpet constituencies.

Mr. Ranjan won the Assembly elections for the first time from [[Somwarpet]] in 1994 serving till 1999. He won again for the second time from the same constituency in 1999 to stay till 2004. However, he lost to B.A. Jivijaya of the Congress (now with JD(S)) in the next election (2004). Mr. Ranjan came back in the 2008 elections winning from [[Madikeri]] constituency. He once again retained the seat by a margin of 4629 votes in 2012 despite an Anti-Incumbency wave against the BJP in the state. He retained the seat again in 2018 by winning by a margin of 16015 votes. Thus he has been elected five times as MLA, thrice from [[Madikeri]] and twice from [[Somwarpet]].

He rose to prominence by being the chairman of the Privilege Committee and Petition Committee of the legislature. He served as the chairman of the Karnataka State Sports Authority in 2008 as also Karnataka Land Army Corporation Limited in the same year. Mr. Ranjan is a member of the State BJP Executive Committee and was in charge of Mysore division.&lt;ref&gt;http://bjpkarnataka.org/candidate/appachu-ranjan/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he was inducted as Cabinet Minister for Youth Services and Sports in Jagadish Shettar’s cabinet and was made the District in-charge minister of Kodagu District. Another highlighted feature of his political career is Hadi Vasthavya in 2011; he became the first M.L.A of Karnataka to stay in forest-covered areas and remote villages to understand and solve the issues of people living in highly backward regions. He stayed in Balegundi ST Colony, Taluk SC Colony ChikkaBandara, and in a remote village in Kothnalli.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/appachu-ranjan-secures-a-berth-after-a-long-journey/article3634319.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appachu Ranjan Committee==

He headed the joint house committee to probe into the ruckus created by some of the Opposition members during the trust vote of the BJP government on October 11, 2010 was set up by the then House Speaker [[K.G.Bopaiah]]. In its 287-page report tabled in the House, the panel headed by him recommended suspension of Rahim Khan, Kakaso Panduranga Patil, U T Khader, N A Harris, (all Congress) B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan, H C Balakrishna, C S Puttaraju, M T Krishnappa (all JD-S) for one year. It recommended suspension of B K Sangamesh, Suresh Gowda, P M Ashok, H P Manjunath, (all Congress), Bandeppa Kashempur, K Raju and K P Bache Gowda (all JD-S) for six months. It was a controversial recommendation and created a standoff in the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/standoff-continues-in-assembly-111011400074_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few house committees that dewelled into indiscipline in a State Assembly.

==Minister for Youth Services and Sports and District in-charge of Kodagu==

He was inducted into Jagadish Shettars cabinet as Minister for Youth Services and Sports on July 12, 2012. He was instrumental in drafting the Youth policy and recommending the Sports policy. Vivekanada Youth Policy was unveiled for the first time and various youth retreat center were established. As Sports Minister, Karnataka ‘s highest sportsperson award “the Ekalayva award” was changed to be given on the basis of marks and merit rather than recommendation. As District Incharge Minister of Kodagu, his top priority was in Health, Education, Road &amp; Transports, House for the Homeless and Environment. During his tenure, Government permissions were given to Engineering College in Kushalnagar, Sainik School in Kudige, Mangalore University Branch in Aluvara, Kushalnagar, and a Medical College was recommended as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17003">'''Audrey Marie Santo''' (December 19, 1983 – April 14, 2007), often referred to as '''Little Audrey,''' was an [[United States|American]] young woman from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] through whom [[miracle]]s were said to have happened after she suffered severe [[brain damage]] in a near-drowning accident.&lt;ref name=Tench&gt;{{cite web

==Accident==

Audrey Santo was the youngest of four children born to Linda and Steve Santo. On August 9, 1987, three-year-old Audrey was playing outside in the driveway with her four-year-old brother Stephen. When Stephen came inside alone, Linda and her twelve-year-old son, Matthew, went to look for Audrey and found her face down in the backyard swimming pool. Matthew dived in and pulled Audrey from the pool, and she was rushed to the hospital.&lt;ref name="Weingarten"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/santo.htm | title=Tears for Audrey | last=Weingarten | first=Gene | work=Washington Post | date=1998-07-19 | accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audrey remained in a [[coma]] for about three weeks, in [[intensive care]]. According to Linda Santo, doctors recommended she be placed in an institution, but the family wanted her at home. In November, almost four months following the accident, Audrey was brought home.&lt;ref name="LAS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.littleaudreysantofoundation.org/little_audrey_santos.html | title=Little Audrey's Story | work=Little Audrey Santo Foundation |accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audrey's father Steve Santo left the family during the weeks after the accident.&lt;ref name="Weingarten" /&gt; He returned years later,&lt;ref name=Kush&gt;{{cite web|last=Kush|first=Bronislaus B.|title=Santo Parents Keep Faith in God and Their Daughter|url=http://www.telegram.com/static/audrey/audrey30.html|work=Telegram &amp; Gazette|date=2000-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to leave again.&lt;ref name=Jolivet&gt;{{cite web|last=Jolivet|first=Dave|title=Mother of Little Audrey Santo Carries On Daughter's Message of God's Infinite Love|url=http://www.anchornews.org/news/february_2010/february_19_2010_2.php|work=The Anchor: The Official Catholic Newspaper of Fall River Diocese|date=2010-02-19|accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==

Once she returned home, Audrey required 24-hour nursing care, provided by her devoted family and a team of nurses provided by the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. She breathed through a [[Medical ventilator|ventilator]] and was on a [[feeding tube]] for sustenance, taking only [[Sacramental bread|communion wafers]] by mouth.&lt;ref name="Weingarten" /&gt;

Audrey's family contended that she was in a state called [[akinetic mutism]] — unable to speak and with limited movement, but fully alert and awake.&lt;ref name="LAS" /&gt; However, Edward Kaye, the pediatric neurologist who treated her for eight years following the accident, told a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' reporter that "the cell death is about as bad as you can get and still be alive. Her [[Electroencephalography|EEGs]] are profoundly abnormal. She has brain stem activity, but very, very little above the [[brainstem|brain stem]]."&lt;ref name="Weingarten" /&gt; A coma specialist, Ed Cooper, brought in by Linda Santo to help Audrey communicate with her hands, told CBS's ''48 Hours'' in 1999, "If she can become consistent with movements of her hands, down for 'yes,' up for 'no,' or vice versa, it would be meaningful. Right now it's inconsistent."&lt;ref name=48hours&gt;{{cite web|last=Moriarty|first=Erin|title=The Miracle of the Dripping Oil|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-miracle-of-dripping-oil/|work=CBS News|publisher=48 Hours|accessdate=2014-03-18|date=1999-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Međugorje==

The Santo family is [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]. About a year after the accident, Linda took Audrey to [[Međugorje]], a popular pilgrimage site in the then [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], where the [[Virgin Mary]] is said to have appeared periodically to six local Catholics since 1981. This was a difficult and expensive journey with an incapacitated four-year-old child, but Linda believed it would result in Audrey being healed, even bringing a pair of sandals for Audrey to use once she was restored to health.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edieclark.com/audrey_s_story_13570.htm | title=Audrey's Story | last=Clark | first=Edie | website= edieclark.com |year=2002 | accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audrey was present at one of the alleged apparitions. According to her mother, she seemed to be aware, and nodded her head as if to say 'yes'. Linda states that Audrey communicated directly with the Virgin Mary and agreed to become a [[victim soul]]. In Catholic popular spirituality, a "victim soul" is someone who willingly takes on the suffering of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mzRypTpuHZAC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;ots=8paWwYhL71&amp;dq=victim+soul+catholicism&amp;sig=NJGCG3z6zWo_qJ14sYMsQ4zfaek |title= Between Heaven and Earth: The Religious Worlds People Make and the Scholars Who Study Them |first= Robert A. |last= Orsi |year= 2005 |publisher= Princeton University Press |isbn= 0691049033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= I. |last= Duffer |title= The Art of Divine Love, or Berthe Petit |publisher= Lulu.com |isbn= 1411603214 |pages= 9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audrey subsequently went into [[cardiac arrest]] and almost died, requiring a medical evacuation back to the United States. Her mother interpreted the child's heart failure as due to the apparition site's proximity to "the biggest [[abortion]] clinic in Yugoslavia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ellen |last=Barry |title=The Strange Case of Audrey Santo |newspaper=Boston Phoenix |date=1997-12-25 |url=http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/features/97/12/25/AUDREY_SANTO.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013184217/http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/features/97/12/25/AUDREY_SANTO.html |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miracle claims==

After the family returned from Međugorje, numerous miracles were purported to have occurred in Audrey's bedroom and within the house. The claimed miracles in Audrey's home included icons weeping blood or oil, a bleeding statue of [[Jesus]], blood appearing spontaneously in a tabernacle and on [[Eucharistic Miracle#Miracles of the Bleeding Host|consecrated communion wafers]], oil dripping down the walls of the garage, and the [[Virgin Mary]] appearing in cloud formations overhead. Linda Santo and a nurse have also claimed that Audrey sometimes bore the [[stigmata]], although this has never been shown in a photograph.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt; Miraculous healings were attributed to Audrey and people with various diseases or injuries claim to have been cured either by visiting Audrey's house or by [[intercessory prayer]] offered by others at Audrey's house.

As word spread about Audrey, hundreds of visitors began coming to pray for healing near Audrey's bedside. Eventually, the family set up visiting hours and built a window in Audrey's bedroom wall through which visitors could view her.&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi3QTK3DMRE#t=1046 | title=Signs from Heaven | work=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit! | date=2005-07-25 | accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The window was later removed by order of the bishop.&lt;ref name="Nickell" /&gt; Audrey was also on several occasions taken to a nearby college stadium or a large church, for a mass at which she could be viewed by the public.&lt;ref name="Weingarten" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;

===Oil===

Starting with one painting, and spreading to include many paintings and icons within the home, oil was said to exude from many objects near Audrey, and to spontaneously fill containers. No one ever claimed to have seen the moment of onset of such an event, only the already-oiled item. The oil was collected in cups and given to visitors on cotton balls.&lt;ref name="Nickell"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/miracles_or_deception_the_pathetic_case_of_audrey_santo/ | title=Miracles or Deception: The Pathetic Case of Audrey Santo|first= Joe|last=Nickell|authorlink=Joe Nickell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test commissioned by ''The Washington Post'' from Microbac Laboratories of Pittsburgh found that sample contained 80 percent corn or soybean oil, and 20 percent chicken fat.&lt;ref name="Weingarten" /&gt; Another test done by ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' found a sample of the oil to be 75% olive oil, and other tests found different or inconclusive results. Linda Santo agreed in response to a reporter's questioning that it was impossible to prove someone did not apply the oil to the statues, but insisted that she had not done so.&lt;ref name="Nickell" /&gt;

===Blood===

During several masses at which Audrey was present, what seemed to be human blood appeared on consecrated communion wafers, or "hosts," although as with the oil no one claims they saw the moment the blood appeared. A substance that appeared to be blood also appeared in a chalice at the Santo home, and a statue of Mary appeared to cry blood.&lt;ref name="Nickell" /&gt;

There have been no published accounts of tests on the blood. In the ''Washington Post'' story, the reporter says that Audrey's pediatrician, John Harding, intended to examine the blood-smeared communion wafer under a microscope but felt that would be blasphemous and decided to use a magnifying glass instead. No findings from this examination are mentioned. In the same story, Linda Santo is quoted as saying, "'If there weren't four bleeding hosts,' she asks, 'if there was just a child in a bed, would anyone pay attention to this?'"&lt;ref name="Weingarten" /&gt;

===Healing===

Many people have claimed that visiting Audrey, praying for her intercession, or having others pray or visit on their behalf has resulted in miraculous healing, including Joey Parolisi of [[Methuen, Massachusetts|Methuen]], [[Massachusetts]] who claims his mother's prayer at Audrey's bedside healed his injury, although his physician stated that Joey had always had a 75% chance of recovering.&lt;ref&gt;Heaney, Joe. "Healed man swears by girl's mystical powers." The Boston Herald, November 10, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A Rhode Island mother also claims that an intercessory prayer to Audrey saved her choking daughter.&lt;ref name="ABC1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=96249&amp;page=1 | title=Believers pray for "miracle" coma girl | accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman with metastatic breast cancer, Andrea Pearson attributed her improvement to Audrey, although her oncologist attributed the improvement to a medication she had just started taking; Pearson's cancer later spread to the brain.&lt;ref name=48hours /&gt;

Audrey once had a rash similar to a rash usually experienced by those undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, although Audrey never underwent such therapy. Those around her believed this was evidence that, as a "victim soul", she had taken on the suffering of some visitor with cancer.&lt;ref name="Weingarten" /&gt;

==Roman Catholic Church's position==
In 1999, the Bishop of Worcester at the time, Daniel P. Reilly, released his preliminary findings on the case. In that report, the Bishop said that "The most striking evidence of the presence of God in the Santo home is seen in the dedication of the family to Audrey."

As for the purported miracles, he said "I want to underscore that any paranormal occurrences are not miraculous in and of themselves".

He also stated in regard to the claim that Audrey was a purported "Victim Soul", "We must proceed quite cautiously here, since this term is not commonly used by the Church except for Christ himself who became the victim for our sins and transgressions on the cross."  The report further states that "The term "victim soul" is not an official term in the Church. It was used in some circles in the 18th and 19th century when there was a fascination with suffering and death."

And with regard to the many pilgrims who were praying to Audrey while she was still alive, he said "praying to Audrey is not acceptable in Catholic teaching." Further, it was stated that "One should only pray for Audrey. Our faith teaches us to pray to God and to pray for the intercession of the saints. Therefore, the distribution of a "Prayer to Audrey" should cease immediately."

In the case of the purported miracle oil, his report stated: "We must be careful not to identify this oil as "[[Holy Oil (Christianity)|holy oil]]," which could be used to anoint a person. The Sacrament of the [[Anointing of the Sick]], which can only be celebrated by a priest or bishop, uses oil blessed by the bishop at the Mass of Chrism, and is given to those who are seriously ill."

While the Bishop's report does not confirm any of the alleged miracles and cautions against some of the beliefs being promoted, it had nothing but praise for the care Audrey had received from her family.  The bishop lauded the "excellent care the family gives to their daughter. This has manifested itself in her physical condition, for example, she has not apparently had bedsores in the eleven years she has been confined to her bed."  He celebrated their "constant love and devotion to their daughter is a miracle in the broad sense of the word. They have always recognized the human dignity of their daughter, despite the circumstances."

Reilly, Bishop of Worcester''.&lt;ref name="worcesterdiocese.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worcesterdiocese.org/audrey.html |title=Diocese Issues Interim Findings on Miraculous Claims |accessdate=April 16, 2007 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928100126/http://www.worcesterdiocese.org/audrey.html |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }} Statement by Most Rev. Daniel P. Reilly, Bishop of Worcester&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application for sainthood===

A nonprofit foundation is pursuing the process of sainthood for Audrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wcvb.com/Push-For-Little-Audrey-s-Sainthood-Begins/11253606 | title=Push For 'Little Audrey's' Sainthood Begins | date=2012-04-12 | accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop of Worcester, Robert J. McManus, gave official recognition to the foundation, allowing them to present their application to the Vatican, while remaining neutral himself as to whether Audrey should be a saint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kandra|first=Deacon Greg|title='Little Audrey' Considered for Sainthood?|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/national/story.php?id=30029|work=Catholic Online|accessdate=2014-03-18|date=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatification and canonization will require at least two fully documented and authenticated miracles. The board of directors of the Audrey Santo Foundation asked in a web update on August 12, 2013 that "if anyone has specific knowledge of any such miracles, they must come forward [so] that the proper protocol is followed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from Board of Directors|url=http://www.littleaudreysantofoundation.org/foundation_news_updates.html|work=Little Audrey Santo Foundation|accessdate=2014-03-18|date=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and funeral==
Whether or not her healing miracles are real, she herself did not receive any such healing, and was bedridden and unable to talk or move until her death on April 14, 2007 from cardio-respiratory failure. Family, friends and clergy were at her side. The [[vigil]] was held April 17, 2007 and the [[funeral mass]] on April 18, 2007, both at [[Cathedral of Saint Paul in Worcester|St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. The public was allowed to attend these two events, but the burial was private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brittonfuneralhomes.com/sitemaker/sites/britto0/obit.cgi?user=santo |title=Audrey Marie Santo |accessdate=April 16, 2007 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503100125/http://www.brittonfuneralhomes.com/sitemaker/sites/britto0/obit.cgi?user=santo |archivedate=May 3, 2008 }} Britton Funeral Homes&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gloria Jean Watkins''' (born September 25, 1952), better known by her [[pen name]] '''bell hooks''',&lt;ref name="pen-name"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dinitia Smith |title=Tough arbiter on the web has guidance for writers |work=The New York Times |date=September 28, 2006 |page=E3 |quote=But the Chicago Manual says it is not all right to capitalize the name of the writer bell hooks because she insists that it be lower case. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/books/28chic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American author, [[Feminism|feminist]], and [[Activism|social activist]]. The name "bell hooks" is derived from that of her maternal great-grandmother, Bell Blair Hooks.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell, "Inspired Eccentricity: Sarah and Gus Oldham" in Sharon Sloan Fiffer and Steve Fiffer (eds),''Family: American Writers Remember Their Own'', New York: Vintage Books, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;152.{{pb}}

The focus of hooks' writing has been the [[intersectionality]] of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[capitalism]], and [[gender]], and what she describes as their ability to produce and perpetuate systems of [[oppression]] and class domination. She has published over 30 books and numerous scholarly articles, appeared in [[documentary film]]s, and participated in public lectures. She has addressed race, class, and gender in education, art, history, [[sexuality]], mass media, and [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/He-Ho/Hooks-Bell.html|title=Bell Hooks Biography - life, childhood, children, name, school, mother, young, book, information, born|website=www.notablebiographies.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
hooks was born in [[Hopkinsville]], a small, segregated town in [[Kentucky]], to a working-class family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/He-Ho/Hooks-Bell.html|title=Bell Hooks Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Veodis Watkins, was a custodian and her mother, [[Rosa Bell Watkins]], was a homemaker. She had five sisters and one brother. An avid reader, she was educated in [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], and wrote of great adversities when making the transition to an [[Racial integration|integrated]] school, where teachers and students were predominantly white. She later graduated from [[Hopkinsville High School]] in [[Hopkinsville]], [[Kentucky]]. She obtained her BA in English from [[Stanford University]] in 1973, and her [[Master of Arts|MA]] in English from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Significant Contemporary American Feminists: A Biographical Sourcebook|last=Scanlon|first=Jennifer|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0313301254|location=Westport, CT|pages=125–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, after several years of teaching and writing, she completed her doctorate in literature at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], with a [[dissertation]] on author [[Toni Morrison]].

===Career===
hooks' teaching career began in 1976 as an English professor and senior lecturer in Ethnic Studies at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Gary L. |last1=Anderson |first2= Kathryn G|last2=Anderson|title=hooks, bell (1952– )|date=2007|publisher=SAGE Reference|pages=704–706|edition=vol. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her three years there, Golemics, a Los Angeles publisher, released her first published work, a [[chapbook]] of poems titled "[[And There We Wept]]" (1978), written under her pen name, "bell hooks". She adopted her maternal great-grandmother's name as a pen name because her great-grandmother "was known for her snappy and bold tongue, which [she] greatly admired". She put the name in lowercase letters "to distinguish [herself from] her great-grandmother." She said that her unconventional lowercasing of her name signifies what is most important is her works: the "substance of books, not who I am."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=bell hooks Speaks Up | author=Heather Williams | website=The Sandspur (2/10/06) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She taught at several post-secondary institutions in the early 1980s and 1990s, including the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[San Francisco State University]], [[Yale]], [[Oberlin College]] and [[City College of New York]].&lt;ref name="gale"&gt;"bell hooks." Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2010. Literature Resource Center. Accessed 12 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[South End Press]] published her first major work, ''[[Ain't I a Woman? (book)|Ain't I a Woman?: Black Women and Feminism]]'' in 1981, though it was written years earlier, while she was an undergraduate student.&lt;ref&gt;''Teaching to Transgress'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades since its publication, ''Ain't I a Woman?'' has gained widespread recognition as an influential contribution to feminist thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Google Scholar]] shows 894 citations of ''Ain't I a Woman'' (as of August 30, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ain't I a Woman?'' examines several recurring themes in her later work: the historical impact of sexism and racism on black women, devaluation of black womanhood, media roles and portrayal, the education system, the idea of a [[White supremacy|white-supremacist]]-[[Capitalism|capitalist]]-[[patriarchy]], the [[marginalization]] of black women, and the disregard for issues of race and class within feminism. Since the publication of ''Ain't I a Woman?'', she has become eminent as a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] political thinker and [[cultural critic]]. She targets and appeals to a broad audience by presenting her work in a variety of media using various writing and speaking styles. As well as having written books, she has published in numerous scholarly and mainstream magazines, lectures at widely accessible venues, and appears in various documentaries.[[File:bellhooks.jpg|thumb|bell hooks in 2009|left|247x247px]]She is frequently cited by feminists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Book Review: Feminism is for Everybody by bell hooks | url=http://underneathabook.blogspot.com/2012/02/book-review-feminism-is-for-everybody.html | accessdate =2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=10 Years of "Feminism is for Everybody" | url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/09/07/10-years-of-feminism-is-for-everybody/ | website=Ms. Magazine Blog (2010 September 7) | accessdate =2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Feminism is for Everybody: Further Discussion | url=http://feministclassics.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/feminism-is-for-everybody-further-discussion/ | accessdate =2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; as having provided the best solution to the difficulty of defining something as diverse as "feminism", addressing the problem that if feminism can mean everything, it means nothing. She asserts an answer to the question "what is feminism?" that she says is "rooted in neither fear nor fantasy... 'Feminism is a movement to end [[sexism]], sexist exploitation and oppression{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;bell hooks, ''Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics'', Pluto Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has published more than 30 books, ranging in topics from black men, [[patriarchy]], and [[masculinity]] to self-help, engaged [[pedagogy]] to personal [[memoirs]], and sexuality (in regards to feminism and politics of aesthetic/[[visual culture]]). A prevalent theme in her most recent writing is the community and communion, the ability of loving communities to overcome race, class, and gender inequalities. In three conventional books and four children's books, she suggests that communication and literacy (the ability to read, write, and think critically) are crucial to developing healthy communities and relationships that are not marred by race, class, or gender inequalities.

She has held positions as Professor of [[African-American studies|African-American Studies]] and English at [[Yale University]], Associate Professor of [[Women's studies|Women's Studies]] and American Literature at [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], Ohio, and as Distinguished Lecturer of English Literature at the [[City College of New York]].

In 2002, hooks gave a [[commencement speech]] at [[Southwestern University]]. Eschewing the congratulatory mode of traditional commencement speeches, she spoke against what she saw as government-sanctioned violence and oppression, and admonished students who she believed went along with such practices. This was followed by a controversy described in the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' after an "irate Arizonian"&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web | title=bell hooks Digs In | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2002-05-24/93217/ | author=Lauri Apple | website=The Austin Chronicle (May 24, 2002) | accessdate =December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; had criticized the speech in a letter to the editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Postmarks - Southwestern Graduation Debacle | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/columns/2002-05-24/93184/ | website=The Austin Chronicle (May 24, 2002) | accessdate =December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper reported that many in the audience booed the speech, though "several graduates passed over the provost to shake her hand or give her a hug".&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt;

In 2004, she joined [[Berea College]] in [[Berea, Kentucky|Berea]], Kentucky, as Distinguished Professor in Residence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berea.edu/appalachiancenter/people/default.asp Berea.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528042644/http://www.berea.edu/appalachiancenter/people/default.asp |date=May 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where she participated in a weekly feminist discussion group, "Monday Night Feminism"; a luncheon lecture series, "Peanut Butter and Gender"; and a seminar, "Building Beloved Community: The Practice of Impartial Love".

Her 2008 book, ''belonging: a culture of place'', includes a candid interview with author [[Wendell Berry]] as well as a discussion of her move back to [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/belonging-a-culture-of-place/oclc/228676700&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Belonging: a culture of place|last=Hooks|first=bell|date=2009-01-01|isbn=9780415968157|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has undertaken three scholar-in-residences at [[The New School]]. Mostly recently she did one for a week in October 2014.

==Influences==
Those who have influenced hooks include African-American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and feminist [[Sojourner Truth]] (whose speech ''Ain't I a Woman?'' inspired her first major work), Brazilian educator [[Paulo Freire]] (whose perspectives on education she embraces in her theory of engaged pedagogy), Peruvian [[theologian]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Gustavo Gutiérrez]], psychologist [[Erich Fromm]], playwright [[Lorraine Hansberry]], [[Buddhist]] monk [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], African-American writer [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], Guyanese historian [[Walter Rodney]], African-American [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] leader [[Malcolm X]], and African-American [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] (who addresses how the strength of love unites communities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iapl.info/CONFERENCE_HISTORY/IAPL_2001/iapl_2001_keynote_speaker.htm Notes on IAPL 2001 Keynote Speaker, bell hooks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070131175411/http://www.iapl.info/CONFERENCE_HISTORY/IAPL_2001/iapl_2001_keynote_speaker.htm |date=January 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1844 Building a Community of Love, bell hooks &amp; Thich Nhat Hanh]&lt;/ref&gt; hooks says of Martin Luther King Jr.'s notion of a beloved community, "He had a profound awareness that the people involved in oppressive institutions will not change from the logics and practices of domination without engagement with those who are striving for a better way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Beloved Community: A Conversation between bell hooks and George Brosi|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/appalachian_heritage/v040/40.4.brosi03.html|journal = Appalachian Heritage|date = 2012-01-01|issn = 1940-5081|pages = 76–86|volume = 40|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/aph.2012.0109|first = George|last = Brosi|first2 = Bell|last2 = Hooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom'' ==
In her 1994 book ''Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom,'' hooks writes about a transgressive approach in education where educators can teach students to "transgress" against racial, sexual, and class boundaries in order to achieve the gift of freedom. To educate as the practice of freedom, bell hooks describes it as "a way of teaching in which anyone can learn."&lt;ref name="1952- 11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/877868009|title=Teaching to transgress : education as the practice of freedom|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|isbn=9781135200015|location=New York|pages=11|oclc=877868009|date=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks combines her practical knowledge and personal experiences of the classroom with feminist thinking and critical pedagogy. Hooks investigates the classroom as a source of constraint but also a potential source of liberation. She argues that teachers' use of control and power over students dulls the students' enthusiasm and teaches obedience to authority, "confin[ing] each pupil to a rote, assembly-line approach to learning."&lt;ref&gt;(hooks, ''Teaching to Transgress'' 12)&lt;/ref&gt; She advocates that universities should encourage students and teachers to transgress, and seeks ways to use collaboration to make learning more relaxing and exciting. She describes teaching as a performative act and teachers as catalysts that invite everyone to become more engaged and activated. Performative aspect of learning "offers the space for change, invention, spontaneous shifts, that can serve as a catalyst drawing out the unique elements in each classroom."&lt;ref name="1952- 11"/&gt; Hooks also dedicated a chapter of the book to [[Paulo Freire]], written in a form of a playful dialogue between herself, Gloria Watkins and her writing voice, bell hooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30668295|title=Teaching to transgress : education as the practice of freedom|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415908085|location=New York|pages=45–59|oclc=30668295}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last chapter of the book, hooks raised the critical question of eros or the erotic in classrooms environment. According to hooks, eros and the erotics do not need to be denied for learning to take place. She argues that one of the central tenets of [[feminist pedagogy]] has been to subvert the [[Mind–body dualism|mind-body dualism]] and allow oneself as a teacher to be whole in the classroom, and as a consequence wholehearted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30668295|title=Teaching to transgress : education as the practice of freedom|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415908085|location=New York|pages=193|oclc=30668295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope'' ==
In 2004, ten years after the success of Teaching to Transgress, bell hooks published ''Teaching Community: A Pedagogy of Hope''. In this book, hooks offers advice about how to continue to make the classroom a place that is life-sustaining and mind expanding, a place of liberating mutuality where teacher and student together work in partnership.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/846494699|title=Teaching community : a pedagogy of hope|last=1952-|first=hooks, bell,|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135457921|location=New York|pages=XV|oclc=846494699}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks writes that education as a practice of freedom enable us to confront feelings of loss and restore our sense of connections and consequently teaches us how to create community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Hooks locates hope in places of struggle where she witnessed individuals positively transforming their lives and the world around them. For hooks educating is always a vocation rooted in hopefulness.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==''All About Love: New Visions''==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|{{BLP sources section|date=February 2017}}
{{BLP primary sources|section|date=April 2018}}}}
After many disputes with ex-boyfriends about the nature of love, bell hooks published ''[[All About Love: New Visions]]'' in 2000. She explains how her past two long-term boyfriends were foiled by "patriarchal thinking" and sexist gender roles, so neither relationship ever really had a chance. She continuously wanted to recommend a book for the men to read, but could not find one that would clearly make her point to support her argument. For this reason, she decided to write her own, which would go into depth about her true feelings towards love.
	
In this book, hooks combines her personal life experiences, along with philosophical and psychological ideas, to shape her thesis and discuss her main concepts. She criticizes the way in which love is used in today's society. To further explain, how we use the word without much meaning, when referring to how much we like or enjoy our favorite ice cream, color, or game. Hooks is very disturbed by the fact that our culture has lost the true meaning of love, and believes it is because we have no shared definition.&lt;ref name="hooks 2001 4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the first chapter of her book primarily focuses on what she thinks the definition of love is, which she explains includes components such as care, affection, trust, respect, honesty, communication, and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She proposes that if we all came to the agreement that love is a verb rather than a noun, then we would all be happier.&lt;ref name="hooks 2001 4"/&gt; Hooks believes love is more of an interactive process. It is not about what we just feel, but more about what we do. She states, "So many people think that it's enough to say what they feel, even if their actions do not correspond to what they are feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/chat/transcripts/2000/2/hooks/index.html|title=CNN - bell hooks|website=edition.cnn.com|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell hooks strongly clarifies why society needs to adopt a universal definition of love.

bell hooks began her book with a series of spiritual messages, which include biblical verses to support her definition of love. She claims that a standard definition of love must include spiritual growth for one's self and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she refers to biblical messages, she does not promote religion in her book; on the contrary, she encourages spiritual thinking. Hooks identifies flaws with relationships nowadays since there is a loose understanding about love. She shares personal experiences about fearing rejection and emotional pain. As a result, she acknowledges lacking full commitment and expressing vulnerability because of the fear of not receiving those things in return, so giving care and affection are the minimal expectations she had in her relationships. However, those love components were not enough. Hooks introduces the necessity of practicing self-love and care to sustain healthy relationship with a concrete understanding of love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, this book sheds some light on what hooks sees as the modern day abandonment of love and what it means for people of today to experience love. One argument she proposes is how love cannot exist in the middle of a power struggle. Hooks goes as far as to present a number of problems she finds with our modern ideals of love and proposes their possible solutions. She includes the propositions of full reconstruction and transformation of modern-day love based on "affection, respect, recognition, commitment, trust and care" (Nonfiction Book Review). Hooks also points out what she sees to be the roots of the problems regarding modern day love, those being gender stereotypes, domination, control, ego, and aggression (Nonfiction Book Review).

Another argument hooks discusses is one in which she describes how starting from a very young age, boys and girls are constantly being knocked down and told to fit into the tiny boxes of characteristics that are expected of them. Hooks points out that the boy is denied his right to show, or even have, any true feelings. To further explain, she uses men in the American culture as an example, and describes how they have been socialized to mistrust the value and power of love. While the girl is taught that the most important thing she can do is change herself and her own feelings, with the hopes of attracting and pleasing everyone else. These unfair expectations lead boys and girls to grow up into men and women who are convinced that lies are the way to go, and no one should be showing their truest feelings to each other. This leads to the paradox hooks points out because in order to have a functional, and healthy loving relationship, honesty is a natural requirement. In bell hooks's own words, "Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another central argument in hooks's ''All About Love'' is the way in which it is almost impossible for women to find happiness in what she sees as a brutal culture where men are taught to worry more about sexual satisfaction and performance than actually loving someone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=all about love - new visions|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2001|isbn=9780060959470|location=New York|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reality pointed out by hooks, paired with the fact that women focus so strongly on obtaining themselves a partner, leads to most relationships being completely one sided. In this case, the men are emotionally satisfied, and the women are left without any true happiness. Hooks points out that despite these evident problems in modern-day love culture, love can be revived, and this is what she is arguing throughout her book.

Bell hooks wrote this book to inform the world how we can change the way we think about love, our culture, and one another. She teaches us ways to love in a face of a planet of love-lessness. Her New Visions demonstrate how love is possible, and stress that all love is important—romantic, friendship, our love of strangers, and community.

==''Feminist Theory''==
Noting a lack of diverse voices in popular [[feminist theory]], bell hooks published the book ''[[Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center]]'' in 1984. In this book, she argues that those voices have been marginalized, and states: "To be in the margin is to be part of the whole but outside the main body."&lt;ref&gt;(hooks, ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', xvi)&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks argued that if feminism seeks to make women equal to men, then it is impossible because in Western society, not all men are equal. She claimed, "Women in lower class and poor groups, particularly those who are non-white, would not have defined [[women's liberation]] as women gaining social equality with men since they are continually reminded in their everyday lives that all women do not share a common social status."&lt;ref&gt;(hooks, ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'')&lt;/ref&gt;

She used the work as a platform to offer a new, more inclusive feminist theory. Her theory encouraged the long-standing idea of sisterhood but advocated for women to acknowledge their differences while still accepting each other. Hooks challenged feminists to consider gender's relation to race, class, and sex, a concept known as [[intersectionality]]. She also argues for the importance of male involvement in the equality movement, stating that, in order for change to occur, men must do their part. Hooks also calls for a restructuring of the cultural framework of power, one that does not find oppression of others necessary.&lt;ref&gt;(hooks,92)&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of this restructuring involves allowing men into the feminist movement, so that there is not a separationist ideology, so much as an incorporating camaraderie. Additionally, she shows great appreciation for the movement away from feminist thought as led by bourgeois white women, and towards a multidimensional gathering of both genders to fight for the raising up of women. This shifts the original focus of feminism away from victimization, and towards harboring understanding, appreciation, and tolerance for all genders and sexes so that all are in control of their own destinies, uncontrolled by patriarchal, capitalist tyrants.&lt;ref&gt;(hooks,74)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another part of restructuring the movement comes from education; bell hooks points out that there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer like the rest of the masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.

In "Rethinking The Nature of Work", bell hooks goes beyond discussing work and raises a pertinent question that feminists may need to ask themselves. "Many Women active in feminist movement do not have radical political perspectives and are unwilling to face these realities, especially when they, as individuals, gain economic self-sufficiency within the existing structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminist Theory : From Margin to Center|last = hooks|first = bell|publisher = Pluto Press|year = 1984|isbn = 978-0-89608-614-2|location = London|pages = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media theory===
In her book ''Reel to Real'', hooks discusses the effect that movies have on any given individual, with specific emphasis on the black female spectator. She argues that, although we know that movies are not real life, "no matter how sophisticated our strategies of critique and intervention, [we] are usually seduced, at least for a time, by the images we see on the screen. They have power over us, and we have no power over them."{{sfn|hooks|1996}}

Hooks focuses on problematic racial representations. Bell hooks has written a number of essays and articles, and in ''Reel to Real'' she describes her experiences growing up watching mainstream movies as well as engaging in the media. Hooks believes that to engage in film was to engage in the negation of black female representation in the media.{{sfn|hooks|1996}} hooks states, "Representation is the 'hot' issue right now because it's a major realm of power for any system of domination. We keep coming back to the question of representation because identity is always about representation".{{sfn|hooks|1996}}

===Film theory===
Asserting that for her, the "gaze" had always been political, bell hooks explains how growing up she began to grow curious as to how much influence black parents were given as a result of black slaves being punished for looking at their white owners. She wondered how much had been absorbed and carried on through the generations to shift not only parenting, but spectatorship as well.{{sfn|hooks|1996}} In what is described as an "oppositional gaze", hooks explains the sometimes overwhelming desire to look and thus stating that by looking, actually declares a defiantly, "Not only will I stare, I want my look to change reality."{{sfn|hooks|1996}} The cinema became a place of critical analysis and a place where black men could view narratives starring white women without the risk of being lynched or murdered for being perceived as a threat.{{sfn|hooks|1996}}

==Criticism==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2017}}

Although much of the criticism aimed at hooks is in regard to politics, liberals and conservatives alike have critiqued her informal style of writing.{{Original research inline|date=May 2017}} After the release of her first book, ''Ain't I a Woman: Black Women in Feminism'', hooks's writing was criticized as "ahistorical [and] unscholarly"; many{{Who|date=May 2017}} complained about the absence of footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell-Scott|first=Patricia|title=The Centrality of Marginality|journal=The Women's Review of Books|date=1985|volume=2|issue=5|page=3|doi=10.2307/4019632|jstor=4019632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooks does not provide a bibliography for any of her work, making it difficult to find the editors and publication information for the pieces listed under the "notes" section of her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettis|first=Joyce|title=A Review of Feminist Theory: From Margin To Center|journal=Journal of Women in Culture and Society|date=1986|volume=11|issue=4|pages=788–789|doi=10.1086/494279}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In "Theory as Liberatory Practice," hooks explains that her lack of conventional academic format was "motivated by the desire to be inclusive, to reach as many readers as possible in as many different locations as possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haley|first=Shelly|title=Practicing Freedom|journal=The Women's Review of Books|date=1995|volume=7|issue=6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Remembered Rapture: The Writer at Work; By bell hooks; Mother to Mother," Nicole Abraham criticizes hooks's unconventional format rationalization. Abraham suggests that, if her rationalization for not providing footnotes and bibliographic information in her writing is that it will help her reach a broader (presumably a less academic) audience, hooks either assumes the average person has "no real interest or knowledge about who really wrote what ideas and where we can look for more thoughts on similar subjects" or "she mean[s] that we are lazy readers who have not the sophistication to grapple with the complications of an endnote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Nicole|title=Remembered Rapture: The Writer at Work; by bell hooks; Mother to Mother; by Sindiwe Magona|journal=Southern African Feminist Review|date=1999|volume=3|issue=2|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bezmiâlem Sultan''' (fully ''Devletlu İsmetlu Bezmiâlem Valide Sultan Aliyyetü'ş-Şân Hazretleri''; 1807 – 2 May 1853) (''Bezm-î Âlem or Bazim-î Âlam'', meaning "feast of the world") was the second wife of [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mahmut II]], and the mother of Sultan [[Abdülmecit I]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Origin==
[[File:Bezm-i Âlem Valide Sultan Camii (Dolmabahçe Mosque).jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Dolmabahçe Mosque]] of Bezm-î Âlem [[Valide Sultan]].]]

Majority of sources note that she was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] whose birthname was Suzi.&lt;ref name="Goodwin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |first=Godfrey |date=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUMhBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Private%20World%20of%20Ottoman%20Women%20by%20Godfrey%20Goodwin&amp;pg=PT133#v=onepage&amp;q=Bezmialem%20Valide&amp;f=false |title=The Private World of Ottoman Women |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alan |first=Palmer |date=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wExCJpgNlmMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PT124#v=onepage&amp;q=Georgian&amp;f=false |title=The Decline and Fall of the Ottoman Empire |publisher=[[Faber &amp; Faber]] |isbn=978-0-57-127908-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated by Esma Sultan, a sister of Mahmut II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schiffer |first=Reinhold |date=1999 |title=Oriental Panorama: British Travellers in 19th Century Turkey |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
She is said to have been buxom and a bath attendant before entering the imperial harem.&lt;ref name="Goodwin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="palmer"/&gt; She had a beautiful face and extraordinary white and beautiful hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sakaoğlu |first=Necdet |date=2007 |title=Famous Ottoman Women |publisher=Avea}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to Sultan Mahmud II in 1822. As mother of Sultan [[Abdülmecit I]], she was [[Valide Sultan]] from 1839 to 1853.&lt;ref name="palmer"/&gt; One source says [[Mahmud II]] died of alcoholism, rather than tuberculosis, and she is reported to have convinced [[Abdülmecit I]] to destroy his father's wine cellars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1800.htm&lt;/ref&gt; She was thirty one and was still young enough to despise and mistrust the elder non statesman who had made himself minister. She advised her son to allow Hüsrev to incur the odium of seeking terms from M. Ali but urged him to resist the Grand Vizier's attempts to advance his nominees to important offices of the state. Abdülmecit duly played for time, awaiting Reşit's return from England before taking any major decisions on policy. His mother had given sound counsel. So shrewd was her judgement of men and their motives that the Valide Sultan continued to influence the choice of ministers until shortly before her death fourteen years later. Bezmialem also recommended Reşit to Abdülmecit because she believed he understood what Mahmut had been seeking to achieve in his reform programme.

She was popular and respected as Valide Sultan and she also exerted political influence. It is noted that her son and his ministers consulted her on the affairs of state. Like other influential Ottoman women, she was a patron of arts and architecture. Amongst notable structures she commissioned are Kasr-i Dilküşa (Dilküşa Summer Palace) at the [[Yıldız Palace]] complex, Bezm-î-Âlem Valide Sultan Fountain, and [[Dolmabahçe Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]]. Her burial place is located at Divanyolu Street inside the tomb of [[Mahmut II]] in [[Istanbul]].

'''Billy Zoom''' (born '''Tyson Kindell''' on February 20, 1948, in [[Savanna, Illinois]]) is an [[United States|American]] guitarist, best known as one of the founders of the [[punk rock]] band [[X (U.S. band)|X]]. He is an Orange, CA, resident and owns the Billy Zoom Custom Shop near Old Towne Orange. At 68-years-old, Zoom was diagnosed in 2015 with an aggressive form of bladder cancer and began immediate treatment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/zoom-670959-help-billy.html&lt;/ref&gt; He has since stated that he is "cancer-free" but will continue receiving chemotherapy treatments.&lt;ref&gt;http://loudwire.com/x-billy-zoom-cancer-free-return-to-shows-between-treatment/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
The son of a [[Big Band]] [[woodwinds]] player, Kindell began playing a variety of instruments, including [[violin]], [[accordion]], [[piano]], [[clarinet]], tenor, alto, and baritone [[saxophone]]s, [[flute]], [[banjo]], and [[guitar]].

Upon moving to [[Los Angeles]] in the 1960s, he worked as a session guitarist while attending technical school for training in electronics repair. He has an insider's reputation as an expert in the maintenance, restoration, and modification of vintage tube [[guitar amplifier|amplifiers]], and [[Combo Organs]]. He has performed custom technical work on the amps for a host of electric guitarists and bassists.

==Career==
[[File:X 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Billy Zoom (center) performing with the band [[X (American band)|X]] in 2004]]
Although best known as [[guitarist]] and founding member of [[punk rock]] band [[X (U.S. band)|X]], Zoom has also worked with [[rockabilly]] legend [[Gene Vincent]], [[The Blasters]], [[Etta James]], [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Mike Ness]], and dozens of other major recording artists. On stage, he is known for his wide-legged stance, big grin and tendency to make eye contact with audience members. He adopted this presence in reaction to many guitarists whose body histrionics and facial expressions gave the impression that they were playing very difficult parts on their instruments. Zoom wanted to make everything look easy.

In June 2008, in honor of his contributions to both the world music community and the legacy of Gretsch guitars, Gretsch unveiled the G6129BZ Billy Zoom Custom Shop Tribute Silver Jet.

[[Joan of Arc]] (1412–1431) was formally [[canonization|canonized]] as a [[saint]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on 16 May 1920 by [[Pope Benedict XV]] in his bull ''Divina Disponente'',&lt;ref&gt;Pope Benedict XV, ''Divina Disponente'' (Latin), 16 May 1920, http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xv/la/bulls/documents/hf_ben-xv_bulls_19200516_divina-disponente.html.&lt;/ref&gt; which concluded the [[canonization]] process that the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] instigated after a petition of 1869 of the [[French Catholic hierarchy]].  Although pro-English clergy had Joan [[execution by burning|burnt at the stake]] for [[heresy]] in 1431, she was rehabilitated in 1456 after [[Retrial of Joan of Arc|a posthumous retrial]]. Subsequently she became a [[folk saint]] among French Catholics and soldiers inspired by her story of being commanded by God to fight for [[France]] against [[Kingdom of England|England]]. Many French regimes encouraged her cult, and the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was sympathetic to the canonization petition prior to the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 separation of church and state]].

==Path to sainthood==

===Death and 15th century===
As with other saints who were excommunicated or investigated by ecclesiastic courts, such as [[Athanasius]], [[Teresa of Ávila]], and [[John of the Cross]], Joan was put on trial by an Inquisitorial court. In her case, the court was influenced by the [[England|English]], which occupied northern France, leading to her execution in the marketplace of [[Rouen]]. When the French retook Rouen in 1449, a series of investigations were launched. Her now-widowed mother [[Isabelle Romée]] and Joan's brothers Jéan and [[Pierre d'Arc|Pierre]], who were with Joan at the [[Siege of Orleans]], petitioned [[Pope Nicholas V]] to reopen her case. The formal appeal was conducted in 1455 by [[Jean Bréhal]], [[Inquisition|Inquisitor-General]] of France, under the aegis of [[Pope Callixtus III]]. Isabelle addressed the opening session of the appellate trial at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] with an impassioned plea to clear her daughter's name. Joan was exonerated on 7 July 1456, with Bréhal's summary of case evidence describing her as a [[martyr]] who had been executed by a court which itself had violated [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Church law]]. &lt;ref&gt;Pernoud, Regine. "Joan of Arc by Herself and Her Witnesses". Scarborough House, 1994; pp 268-269.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1457, Callixtus [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] the now-deceased Bishop [[Pierre Cauchon]] for his persecution and condemnation of Joan. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JO-CJZ-cOz8C&amp;pg=PA1010&amp;lpg=PA1010&amp;dq=%22pierre+Cauchon%22+Pope+Callixtus+III&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Km6mp0bvNH&amp;sig=RW2TpF5z-HyVYjYzZsZmnCYWC5I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf947UuJ3RAhUnwVQKHRX4CLEQ6AEIPTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pierre%20Cauchon%22%20Pope%20Callixtus%20III&amp;f=false Reviews: ''Le Martyre de Jéanne d'Arc''] by [[Léo Taxil]] ''[[The Tablet]]'' Vol. 75; No. 2616 (28 June 1890), pps. 1010-1011 [[Google Books]] 30 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Orléans]] had commemorated her death each year beginning in 1432, and from 1435 onward performed a religious play centered on the lifting of the siege. The play represented her as a divinely-sent savior guided by angels. In 1452, during one of the postwar investigations into her execution, [[Cardinal d'Estouteville]] declared that this play would merit qualification as a [[pilgrimage]] site by which attendees could gain an [[indulgence]].

Not long after the appeal, [[Pope Pius II]], who died in 1464, wrote an approving piece about her in his memoirs.

===16th century===
Joan was utilized as a symbol of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], a group organized to fight against [[Protestant]] groups during the [[Wars of Religion]]. An anonymous author wrote a biography of Joan's life, stating that it was compiled "By order of the King, [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] of that name" in circa 1500. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-5AnyffsHu4C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=The+First+Biography+of+Joan+of+Arc:+Translated+and+Annotated+by+Daniel+Rankin+and+Claire+Quintal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RU49D0KMCn&amp;sig=R3OoYfg6Tm_vCkfzE9JgxVbJQVM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirmKPn0obTAhUO12MKHduwDDkQ6AEIJDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20First%20Biography%20of%20Joan%20of%20Arc%3A%20Translated%20and%20Annotated%20by%20Daniel%20Rankin%20and%20Claire%20Quintal&amp;f=false ''The First Biography of Joan of Arc: Translated and Annotated by Daniel Rankin and Claire Quintal''] [[University of Pittsburgh Press]] (1964) [[Google Books]]  2 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th and 19th centuries===

Joan's [[cult of personality]] was opposed by the leaders of the [[French Revolution]] as she was a devout [[Catholicism|Catholic]] who had served the [[List of French monarchs|monarchy]]. They banned the yearly celebration of the lifting of the siege of [[Orleans]], and Joan's relics, including her sword and banner, were destroyed. A statue of Joan erected by the people of Orléans in 1571 (to replace one destroyed by [[Protestants]] in 1568) was melted down and made into a [[cannon]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fds-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA319&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=%22jeanne+d'arc%22+relics+destroyed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H9GWFWx2_M&amp;sig=kiXCCU60qRqHUgIe3Qw-cqI1dR4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwill7LVpPLSAhUO-2MKHcyfD1MQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jeanne%20d'arc%22%20relics%20destroyed&amp;f=false "The Maid of Orléans"] by [[Andrew Lang]] ''[[The English Illustrated Magazine]]'' Vol. 16 (October 1896-March 1897), pps. 315-320 [[Google Books]] March 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Nicolas Lenglet Du Fresnoy]] and [[Clément Charles François de Laverdy]] are credited with the first full-length biographies of Joan, several English authors ironically sparked a movement which lead to her canonization. [[Harvard University]] [[English literature]] professor Herschel Baker noted in his introduction to ''[[Henry VI (play)|Henry VI]]'' for ''[[The Riverside Shakespeare]]'' how appalled [[William Warburton]] was by the depiction of Joan in ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', and that [[Edmond Malone]] sought in "Dissertation on the Three Parts of Henry VI" (1787) to prove [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had no hand in its [[Shakespeare authorship question|authorship]] (1974; p.&amp;nbsp;587). [[Charles Lamb]] chided [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] for reducing Joan to "a pot girl" in the first drafts of ''[[The Destiny of Nations]]'', initially part of [[Robert Southey]]'s ''[[Joan of Arc (poem)|Joan of Arc]]''. She was the subject of essays by [[Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope|Lord Mahon]] for ''[[Quarterly Review|The Quarterly Review]]'', &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1XYBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Philip+Stanhope+joan+of+arc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0y-yeuNHRAhUL-GMKHQNXBcoQ6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Philip%20Stanhope%20joan%20of%20arc&amp;f=false ''Joan of Arc: Reprinted From Lord Mahon's Historical Essays''] [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] (1853) [[Google Books]] January 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Thomas De Quincey]] for ''[[Tait's Edinburgh Magazine|Tait's]]''. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7Q0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=DOMR%C3%89MY+15th+century+map&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FQLMqf1Qtw&amp;sig=NF6SqVkU1Ie3vBxLtbMa-z15br0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1_NmGs9HRAhVS0GMKHYelBtkQ6AEIKTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=DOMR%C3%89MY%2015th%20century%20map&amp;f=false "Selections" ''English Classic Series #69'']; Maynard, Merrill &amp; Co.

As Joan found her way further into [[Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc|popular culture]], the [[Government of France]] commissioned [[Emmanuel Frémiet]] to erect a statue of her in the [[Place des Pyramides]] -- the only public commission of the state from 1870 to 1914. The [[French Navy]] dedicated [[French ship Jeanne d'Arc|four vessels]] to her: a 52-gun [[frigate]] (1820); a 42-gun frigate (1852); an [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[corvette]] [[French ironclad Jeanne d'Arc|warship]] (1867); and an [[Armored cruiser|armored]] [[French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (1899)|cruiser]] (1899). [[Philippe-Alexandre Le Brun de Charmettes]]'s biography (1817), and [[Jules Quicherat]]'s account of her [[Trial of Joan of Arc|trial]] and [[Retrial of Joan of Arc|rehabilitation]] (1841-1849) seemed to have inspired canonization efforts.

In 1869, to celebrate the 440th anniversary of Joan lifting the Siege of Orléans, [[Félix Dupanloup]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orleans|Bishop of Orleans]], invited the bishops whose [[List of Catholic dioceses in France|dioceses]] included the towns which Joan entered or liberated during her career to Orléans &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xgcFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=%22Joan+of+Arc%22+Cardinal+Dupanloup+pius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ll6WReJEDO&amp;sig=YrSEGmuZFjUT4STd_M4sTw76la4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkkL-ky-DXAhUJjFQKHdNgCtU4ChDoAQg8MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Joan%20of%20Arc%22%20Cardinal%20Dupanloup%20pius&amp;f=false "The Festival of Joan of Arc at Orleans"] ''Evangelical Christendom'' [[Evangelical Alliance]] (June 1, 1869) Vol X; pps. 206-207 [[Google Books]] November 29, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1874, [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] began to be collected, received by Cardinal [[Luigi Bilio]] in 1876. Dupanloup's successor, Bishop [[Pierre-Hector Coullié]], directed an inquest to authenticate her acts and testimony from her trial and rehabilitation.

However, the path to sainthood did not go smoothly. On 20 August 1902, the [[papal consistory]] rejected adding Joan to the [[Calendar of saints]], citing: she launched the [[Siege of Paris (1429)|assault on Paris]] on the birthday of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]]; her capture ("proof" her claim that she was sent by God was false); her attempts to escape from prison; her abjure after being threatened with death; and doubts of her [[Virginity|purity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/indiana?a=d&amp;d=IJ19020907.1.24 "Was Not Made a Saint: Why Consistory Refused to Canonize Joan of Arc"] ''[[Indianapolis Journal]]'' (7 September 1902), p. 12 ''newspapers.library.in.gov'' 25 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=srRCAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA612&amp; "Joan of Arc Not to be Canonized"] ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' (11 April 1903) Vol. XLVII; No. 2416, p. 610 [[Google Books]] 25 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November 1903, the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] met to discuss Joan's cause at the behest of [[Pope Pius X]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=BOSTONSH19031003-01.2.13 "Editorial Notes"] ''The Sacred Heart Review'' [[Boston College]] (3 October 1903) Vol. 30; No. 14, p. 5 ''newspapers.bc.edu'' 26 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5bqKct7ChQYC&amp;pg=PA845&amp; "Notes"] ''[[The Tablet]]'' (28 November 1903) Vol. 102; No. 3316, p. 845 [[Google Books]] 26 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; A decree proclaiming Joan's heroic virtue was issued on 6 January 1904 by Cardinal [[Serafino Cretoni]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iyc9KW3XoxMC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22the+tablet%22+Cauchon+Callixtus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BIa8zc_sE3&amp;sig=U0fVS5GcFONxyEkPN87idkmARV0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY0oKx3_LSAhVT3mMKHUsPAMgQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20tablet%22%20Cauchon%20Callixtus&amp;f=false "Joan of Arc - Her Heroic Virtue: Text of the Decree"] ''[[The Tablet]]'' (16 January 1904) Vol. 103; No. 3323, pp. 88-89 [[Google Books]] 26 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  and Pius proclaimed her [[The Venerable|venerable]] on 8 January.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AmQJAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA392&amp; ''Life of His Holiness Pope Pius X''] by Josef Schmidlin and [[Anton de Waal]] (1904) [[RCL Benziger|Benziger Brothers]], p. 392 [[Google Books]] 26 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Decree of the Three Miracles was issued on 13 December 1908, and The Decree of [[Beatification]] was read five days later, which was issued formally by the Congregation of Rites on 24 January 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wZ46AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA743&amp;lpg=PA743&amp;dq=%22Congregation+of+Rites%22+%22joan+of+arc%22+1903&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fiKxPzwoUx&amp;sig=P__eyw43xHniKLOYAquZWhF_t0c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMxuW8g_PSAhUTwGMKHRfKC_EQ6AEIITAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Congregation%20of%20Rites%22%20%22joan%20of%20arc%22%201903&amp;f=false "The Blessed Joan of Arc"] by Bishop [[Thomas James Conaty]] ''The West Coast Magazine'' Vol. 7; No. 6.

Her beatification approximately coincided with the French invention of the [[Coining (metalworking)|Janvier transfer engraving machine]] (also called a die engraving pantograph), which facilitates the creation of minted coins and commemorative medallions. This invention, together with the already well-established French sculptural tradition, added another element to Joan's beatification: a series of well-made religious art medals featuring scenes from her life.

In 1911, [[Edmond Richer]]'s ''La premiére histoire en date de Jeanne d'Arc: histoire de la Pucelle d'Orléans'', written between 1625 and 1630, was published in two volumes in 1911 by [[Henri and Jules Desclée]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prdl.org/author_view.php?s=10&amp;limit=10&amp;a_id=872&amp;sort= "Edmond Richer (1560-1631)"] ''[[Post-Reformation Digital Library]]''. Retrieved 15 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War I]], French troops carried her image into battle with them. During one battle, they interpreted a German searchlight image projected onto low-lying clouds as an appearance by Joan, which bolstered their morale greatly. [see: ''The Maid of Orléans: The Story of Joan of Arc Told to American Soldiers'' by [[Charles Saroléa]], Georges Crès &amp; Cie (1918)]

Her canonization was held on 16 May 1920. Over 60,000 people attended the ceremony, including 140 descendants of Joan's family.

Joan of Arc's feast day is 30 May. Although reforms in 1968 moved many medieval European saints' days off the general calendar in order to make room for more non-Europeans, her feast day is still celebrated on many local and regional Church calendars, especially in France. Many Catholic churches around the globe have been named after her in the decades since her canonization.

She has become especially popular among [[traditionalist catholics|Traditional Catholics]], particularly in France—both because of her obvious connection to this country as well as the fact that the Traditional Catholic movement is strongest there. This movement within the church, which includes those few orders and societies which refused to accept the changes made by the [[Second Vatican Council]], has compared the 1988 excommunication of Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] (one of the founders of the [[Society of Saint Pius X]]) to Joan of Arc's excommunication by a corrupt pro-English bishop in 1431.

'''Dolly Akers''' or '''Dolly Smith Cusker Akers''' (March 23, 1901 – June 5, 1986) was an [[Assiniboine]] woman who was the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] elected to the [[Montana Legislature]] and first woman elected to the Tribal Executive Board of the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes on the [[Fort Peck Indian Reservation]].&lt;ref name=WHM&gt;{{cite web|title="I am a very necessary evil": The Political Career of Dolly Smith Cusker Akers|url=http://montanawomenshistory.org/dolly-smith-cusker-akers-champion-to-some-foe-to-others/|website=Women's History Matters|publisher=Montana Historical Society|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood and Personal Life==

Dolly Smith Cusker Akers was born in [[Wolf Point, Montana]] to Assiniboine tribal member Nellie Trexler and Irish-American William Smith. She grew up on the Fort Peck Reservation. As a teenager, she attended an Indian boarding school, the Sherman Institute in Riverside, California. After she graduated at age sixteen, she returned to Montana and married George Cusker in 1917. The couple ranched near Poplar and had one daughter, Alvina. George Cusker died in 1941 and in 1944, Dolly married John Akers. She was widowed a second time in 1959. She died in Helena in 1986.&lt;ref name=Catalog&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolly Smith Cusker Akers papers, 1927-1985|url=http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv98514|website=Archives West|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

In 1923, Cusker accompanied two tribal representatives, Bear Hill and Dave Johnson, to Washington, D.C., as a translator to lobby for school funding.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Alvina Welliver [Dolly Akers' daughter], November 13, 1985, in the Akers, Dolly Smith Cusker Vertical File, Montana Historical Society Research Center&lt;/ref&gt; While there, she also advocated that Indians be given universal citizenship. The [[Indian Citizenship Act]] was passed in 1924. Not all Indians supported passage of this act, which provided voting rights for Native Americans, because they feared that it was another step toward assimilation and that it undermined tribal sovereignty.

Dolly's husband George Cusker served on the Tribal Council Executive Board; she often attended in his stead. Ultimately, she was appointed to the board in her own right.&lt;ref name=WHM /&gt;

In 1932 Cusker was elected to the state house as a Democrat (she later became a Republican). She became the first American Indian to serve in the Montana legislature and was the only woman serving in the 1933-34 legislative session.&lt;ref name=WHM /&gt; She was appointed to the Federal Relations Committee and was a special representative of the governor to the U.S. Secretary of Interior.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=First Indian Woman Legislator Dies at 85|publisher=Great Falls Tribune|date=June 7, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akers remained politically engaged for her entire life. She visited Washington, D.C., 57 times as a tribal delegate and was a member of the Fort Peck Tribal Council off and on for forty years.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; Her career was not without controversy. For example, in 1959, she was removed from the tribal council by a vote of 279 to 189 and "barred forever from holding office and representing the Fort Peck Sioux and Assinniboine tribes." That vote was later overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dolly Akers Reinstated by Indian Bureau Ruling|publisher=Great Falls Tribune|date=January 11, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akers frequently challenged the Indian Bureau's management of tribal resources, believing that tribes (and individual Indians) should be permitted to manage their own affairs just as non-Indians could.  "Why should Indian people," she asked in 1952, "be forced to live under a law made some 80 years ago? That is the year in which the Indian Commissioner referred to Indians as ‘wild beasts!’"&lt;ref name=WHM /&gt;

Her belief in Indian autonomy led her to support the controversial policy of [[Indian termination policy|Termination]], that advocated "terminating" the U.S. government's treaty obligations to tribes in order to encourage individual Indians to integrate into the larger Euro-American society. Looking back on her career, she was most proud of successfully lobbying for a regulation permitting tribes to hire their own legal counsel and the 1968 Indian Civil Rights Act.&lt;ref name=WHM /&gt;

'''José Erasmo Janer Gironella''' (1833-1911) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] entrepreneur and politician. As a businessman he is considered a member of the textile-industry-related [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[bourgeoisie]], which enjoyed peak of its power in the mid-19th century; Janer represented this group during its declining phase. Politically he earned his name as a [[Carlist]] and headed the Catalan branch of the party between 1902 and 1910.

[[File:Casa Erasme de Gònima 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[:ca:Casa Erasme de Gònima|Ca l'Erasme]], Barcelona]]
Some scholars consider the Janer family past an illustration of [[social history]] in Catalonia, its rise and decline demonstrating patterns of change within the local ruling strata.&lt;ref&gt;the author who studied family patterns among the Catalan wealthy notes that a group of families – including the Gónimas and the Janers – took advantage of social mobility opportunities of the late 18th century and emerged as new bourgeoisie related to the textile industry; "in the 19th century this extremely tight kindred moved their wealth into land and other status markers. They held political power through the Junta de Comerc and the municipal administration. Yet in the next generations their situation and circumstances changed radically"; according to the author, the endogamous marriage pattern first contributed to the rise, and then to the fall of the Gónima-Janer and other merchant families, Gary Wray McDonogh, ''Good Families of Barcelona: A Social History of Power in the Industrial Era'', Princeton 2014, {{ISBN|9781400858231}}, see esp. pages 148, 159 and 161&lt;/ref&gt; Erasmo's paternal grandfather [[Domingo Janer Sunyer]] (1762-1807) was son to a provincial doctor&lt;ref&gt;Domingo Janer Sunyer's father – his name not referred – originated from Igualada, Anna Vallugera Fuster, ''El mercat artístic a Barcelona (1770-1808). Producció, consum i comerç d'art'' [PhD thesis Universidad de Barcelona], Barcelona 2015, p. 875, also Reis Fontanals, ''Erasme de Gònima, l'Oberkampf català'', [in:] ''Barcelona Quaderns d'História'' 17 (2011), p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced his career as a petty merchant from [[Esparreguera]];&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Creixell, Teresa-María Sala, ''Retrat de família: els secrets dels Gónima'', [in:] ''Barcelona Quaferns d'Historia'' 12 (2005), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; rising to prosperity, he was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;see the graph in Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; He married heiress&lt;ref&gt;named Josefa Gónima Coll (1767-1802), Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; to an emergent Gónima textile fortune;&lt;ref&gt;the Gónima industrial empire was founded by her father Erasme de Gónima (1746-1827), who "exemplified the rapid social mobility possible for late 18-th century industrialists in Barcelona. Born a weaver in provincial Catalonia, by his death he was a noble", Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 158. He is considered one of the greatest textile industrialists of his time and compared to a French-Swiss tycoon, [[Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf]], see Fontanals 2011&lt;/ref&gt; both died prematurely. Their only son and the future father of Erasmo, [[:ca:Erasme de Janer i de Gònima|Erasmo Janer Gónima]] (1791-1862), inherited the hugely successful business in 1821; at that time it was crowned with the largest European [[Textile manufacturing|textile factory]] which employed some 1,200 workers.&lt;ref&gt;Fontanals 2011, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Himself representative of a new strata of commerce and industry tycoons which started to surpass landed aristocracy and old urban bourgeoisie,&lt;ref&gt;"his descendants, however, did not enter the economic and social world of either the old landed aristocracy or the new bourgeoisie. The result was an endogamous group "between" the other two categories. Elite social marginality reflected economic change within a new milieu". Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-19th century Janer Gónima brought the family to business and political climax. Member of executive boards of countless economic organizations,&lt;ref&gt;Janer Gónima was e.g. in the first Junta of Societat Econòmica d'Amics del País (1822), the first Junta of l'Institut Agrícola Català de Sant Isidre (1851), in the executive board of Comisió de Fábriques, in Junta de Comerç and numerous other bodies. He was also director of Teatre Principal in Barcelona, Fontanals 2011, pp. 233 and passim, ''Erasme de Janer i de Gónima'' entry, [in:] ''Gran Enciclopédia Catalana'' online, available [https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0034318.xml here]&lt;/ref&gt; he held key positions in municipal administration, served as [[alcalde]] of [[Barcelona]] in 1846 and as a provincial deputy in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Janer Gónima served in Junta Superior Gubernativa de Barcelona in 1835, as mayor of the city during a few months in 1846, as a Moderate Party deputy to Corts de Barcelona in two strings of 1852-1854 and 1856-1858, Ramon Arnabat Mata, ''Revolució i contrarevolució a Catalunya durant el trienni liberal (1820-1823)'' [PhD thesis Universitat Pompeu Fabra], Barcelona 1999, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century he shut down the textile factory&lt;ref&gt;Janer Gónima he sold the textile manufacturing business to Salvador Juncadella in 1856, Jaume Artigues i Vidal, ''Les fàbriques d'indianes com a model d'espai fabril'', [in:] ''Barcelona Quaderns d'Historia'' 17 (2011), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; and re-focused the family business on finance,&lt;ref&gt;Janer Gónima was among co-founders of a few insurance and re-insurance companies, especially Caja de Ahorros y Monte de Piedad de Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; railways&lt;ref&gt;e.g. he engaged in construction of the first railway lines from Barcelona, first to Mataró and then to Tarragona, Creixel, Sala 2005, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; and commerce.&lt;ref&gt;''Fons Gónima-Janer. Ariu Biblioteca de Catalunya'' [information leaflet], Barcelona 2011, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1813 Janer Gónima married Josefa Gironella Ayguals, daughter to another Barcelona textile industry tycoon.&lt;ref&gt;Josefa Gironella Ayguals was daughter to fabricant d'indianes Josep Gironella and granddaughter to Cristóbal de Gironella Pujols, the founder of the dynasty. He was member of the register of commerce, director of Junta de Comerc and a "ciutadá honrat" of Barcelona after 1780; the family was ennobled in 1780, Wray McDonogh 2014, pp. 159-160.

It is not clear what happened to his brother Erasme. In one genealogical chart Erasme appears to be the oldest of the siblings, Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 160, yet it is not clear whether he died in early infancy, entered a religious order or for any other reason did not inherit the family fortune&lt;/ref&gt; At unspecified time though probably in the 1840s he frequented the [[Piarist]] college of St. Anthony in Barcelona,&lt;ref&gt;''Josep Erasme de Janer i Gironella'' entry, [in:] ''Escola Pia Sant Antoni'' service, available [http://santantoni200.escolapia.cat/josep-erasme-de-janer-i-gironella-1833-1911/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; to complete education while studying law at [[University of Barcelona|Universidad de Barcelona]] and graduating most likely in the mid-1850s.&lt;ref&gt;''La Defensa'' 19.03.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1095519&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually getting engaged in running the family business, in 1864 José Erasmo married Dolores Milá de la Roca Vilaseca;&lt;ref&gt;Dolores Milá de la Roca died in 1910, her birth date is not known, ''El Correo Español'' 30.07.10, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029789041&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; her family, also ennobled merchants, became landowners rather than engaged in potentially profitable but risky urban ventures.&lt;ref&gt;Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Basking in inherited opulence the couple settled in the Janer family residence in Barcelona, in the iconic building known as [[:ca:Casa Erasme de Gònima|Ca l'Erasme]].&lt;ref&gt;''Josep Erasme de Janer i Gironella'' entry, [in:] ''Escola Pia Sant Antoni'' service, available [http://santantoni200.escolapia.cat/josep-erasme-de-janer-i-gironella-1833-1911/ here]; the iconic Ca l'Erasme is considered one of two best examples of Catalan bourgeoisie architecture, Sílvia Canalda i Llobet, Carme Narváez Cases, Joan Sureda, ''Cartografías visuales y arquitectónicas de la modernidad: Siglos XV-XVIII'', Barcelona 2011, {{ISBN|9788447535408}}, p. 123.

José Erasmo and Dolores had 7 children, though only two of them married: the second oldest son&lt;ref&gt;the oldest son Erasme Janer Milá de la Roca (1866-1886) entered the Jesuit order and died prematurely&lt;/ref&gt; and the family heir [[:ca:Ignasi de Janer i Milà de la Roca|Ignacio Janer Milá de la Roca]] became a locally known historian and writer,&lt;ref&gt;the second-oldest son Ignacio Janer Milá de la Roca (1869-1919) in 1894 married Soledad de Durán de Brichfeus, descendant of two lines of the minor nobility.

==Conservative to Carlist (1864-1876)==
[[File:Federico Madrazo - Retrato de Juan de la Pezuela.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[:es:Juan de la Pezuela|Juan de la Pezuela]]]]
As heir to the former mayor of Barcelona and son to one of the most potent men in the city Janer was destined to become a public figure, yet political preferences of his ancestors are not entirely clear. Historians note that as tycoons of new bourgeoisie the Janers and the Gónimas were [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberals]],&lt;ref&gt;one author claims that Liberalism was naturally the option embraced by a new breed of Catalan industrialists, including the ancestors of Janer Gironella, Wray McDonogh 2014, pp. 148, 161&lt;/ref&gt; while the Gironellas were even related to the revolutionary [[Progressive Party (Spain)|exaltado]] version of Spanish liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;the maternal uncle, Antonio Gironella Ayguals, was a revolutionary Exaltado at one point deported to the Canary Islands; he was the co-founder of a masonic lodge, see ''La finca de Gironella'', [in:] ''Historia Sarria'' service, available [http://www.historiadesarria.com/gironella.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; One source claims that during the [[First Carlist War]] his father joined the liberal Barcelona juntas&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Santirso Rodríguez, ''Gerifaltes de antanó. Los señores catalanes en el primer carlismo'', [in:] ''Militars. Espai i História'' XXIII (2000), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; while another one states that in the mid-1840s he was a [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]],&lt;ref&gt;Creixell, Sala 2005, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; which might point to not an unusual conservative evolution of certain section of the [[:es:Moderantismo|Moderados]]. One author notes that Janer himself sort of neared Traditionalist outlook during his academic years,&lt;ref&gt;''La Defensa'' 19.03.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1095519&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; yet his first public engagements did not demonstrate such a penchant. In the late 1850s and early 1860s he was noted for engagement in various institutions related to local business, recorded as member of [[:es:Instituto Agrícola Catalán de San Isidro|Instituto Agrícola Catalan]]&lt;ref&gt;''Revista de agricultura práctica, economía rural, horticultura y jardineria'', Barcelona 1855, available [http://www.bibgirona.cat/pandora/viewer.vm?id=0000634214&amp;page=179&amp;search= here]; during the lifetime of his father and for some time afterwards in the press Janer Gironella was referred to as "José de Janer", probably to avoid confusion with his father, usually noted as "Erasmo de Janer"; it was only later that he started to feature as "José Erasmo de Janer" and eventually as "Erasmo de Janer"&lt;/ref&gt; and an insurance company ''La Providencia''&lt;ref&gt;''El Lloyd Español'' 12.08.62, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004064538&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or sitting in the board of Asociación de Socorros y Protección a la Clase Obrera y Jornalera&lt;ref&gt;''La Corona'' 25.02.63, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026768560&amp;page=7 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Junta de Patronato of his Barcelona borough.&lt;ref&gt;''La Corona'' 19.06.63, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026770652&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; One source claims he initially practiced as a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;B. de Artagan [Reynaldo Brea], ''Políticos del carlismo'', Barcelona 1912, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1860s Janer was first noted running for public office, as propietario and haciendario competing for the concejal post in the Barcelona [[ayuntamiento]];&lt;ref&gt;''La Corona'' 01.11.64, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026779807&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; there is no confirmation of his success. It seems that during final years of the [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabelline monarchy]] he neared the entourage of the then capitán general of Catalonia and the [[Moderate Party (Spain)|Conservative]] politician, [[:es:Juan de la Pezuela|Juan de la Pezuela]]; Janer used to address him in public homage letters&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Córdoba'' 18.08.68, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=4050048&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated by Pezuela to the last Isabelline city council, where he was sitting as the youngest [[Councillor|concejal]] until the body was dissolved during the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|1868 revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Defensa'' 19.03.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1095519&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal en 1888.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal|Tirso Olazábal]]]]
One author claims that Janer passed from Conservative to Carlist position when faced with the revolutionary developments of the late 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Melchor Ferrer, ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'', vol. 28, Sevilla 1959, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources maintain he fielded his candidature in elections to the [[Spanish general election, 1869|Constituent Assembly of 1869]] and indeed in 1871 he was already reported as nominated by the regional Carlist junta as their representative in the [[Spanish general election, 1871|Cortes elections]] from [[Sant Feliu de Llobregat]],&lt;ref&gt;''La Independencia'' 20.02.71, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0027323561&amp;page=17 here]&lt;/ref&gt; the bid which proved unsuccessful. In 1872 Janer became president of Círculo Católico-Monárquico in Barcelona&lt;ref&gt;Artagan 1912, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; and entered the provincial party executive, noted as member of the Barcelona Junta Provincial Católico-Monárquica. In the council he was sitting with his father-in-law, Manuel Milá de la Roca,&lt;ref&gt;''La Regeneración'' 02.03.72, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026701939&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and forged the lifelong friendship with the junta leader and later Catalan Carlist leader, [[Luis de Llauder y Dalmases]]. Following outbreak of the [[Third Carlist War]] Janer found himself the target of [[First Spanish Republic|Republican]] persecutions and had to flee the city a number of times.&lt;ref&gt;''Erasme de Janer i de Gónima'' entry, [in:] ''Gran Enciclopédia Catalana'' online, available [https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0034318.xm here] l&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually with his family&lt;ref&gt;when in France during the Third Carlist War Janer was accompanied at least by 2 children, Edina Polácska, ''Karlista emigráció Franciaországban (1872–1876)'' [PhD dissertation University of Szeged], Szeged 2008, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; he sought exile in France and settled in [[Saint Jean de Luz]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Defensa'' 19.03.11, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1095519&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source he joined a small team, led by [[Tirso de Olazábal y Lardizábal|Tírso de Olazábal]] and busy procuring arms for the Carlist troops;&lt;ref&gt;''La Defensa'' 19.03.11&lt;/ref&gt; it is likely that taking advantage of his wealth, Janer contributed financially.&lt;ref&gt;a number of sources claim vaguely that Janer dedicated his fortune to the Carlist cause, yet none of them provides any details, compare ''Erasme de Janer i de Gónima'' entry, [in:] ''Gran Enciclopédia Catalana'' online, available [https://www.enciclopedia.cat/EC-GEC-0034318.xml here], Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 159, Gemma Tribó Travería, ''El naixament de la fira i els grans propietaris'', [in:] ''L'Espai'' 2 (1999), p. 72, Creixell, Sala 2005, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the second row (1877-1888)==
[[File:El Correo Catalan.png|thumb|left|''El Correo Catalan'' logotypes]]
It is not clear whether Janer's massive property was embargoed during the war, whether he suffered any other persecutions and when he returned to Barcelona after the Carlist military defeat. A number of sources point vaguely to the late 1870s when claiming that together with Milá de la Roca and Llauder Janer was among co-founders of a new Carlist daily which would remain in print for the following 60 years, ''[[:es:El Correo Catalan|El Correo Catalan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''El Norte'' 30.07.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3069163&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here], Artagan 1912, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879 he entered the Barcelona ayuntamiento&lt;ref&gt;''Diari Catalá'' 30.05.79, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3032856&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;presentacion=pagina here], see also Cèlia Cañelles Julià, Rosa Toran, ''Els governs de la ciutat de Barcelona (1875-1930): Eleccions, partits i regidors. Diccionari biografic'', Barcelona 2014, available online [https://books.google.es/books?id=DRzHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT184&amp;dq=erasme+janer+gironella&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl1fSh4ubZAhWjyKYKHZogALwQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=erasme%20janer%20gironella&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt; yet duration of his term is not known; except a 1888 spell in Junta Municipal&lt;ref&gt;''La Dinastía'' 17.08.88, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001504024&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; it proved to be a unique Janer's episode in official administration. In the 1880s he was noted rather for looking after his family enterprises, especially in Caja de Ahorros.&lt;ref&gt;''La Dinastía'' 08.03.84, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001332479&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scholars claim that he demonstrated neither interest nor skills in commercial activities and that during his tenure the family business went into decline;&lt;ref&gt;Ceixell, Sala 2005, p. 181; the authors claim that Janer Gironella did not demonstrate much interest in family business. His stand gave rise to "three generations theory", namely that a family business can be sustained and developed during 3 generations only&lt;/ref&gt; some go as far as to claim that to sustain the Carlist cause he kept selling off his private property&lt;ref&gt;in the early 20th century Janer Gironella sold his rural property in Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Tribó Travería 1999, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; or even that he ruined his fortune with the legitimist zeal.&lt;ref&gt;Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Janer was also known for engagement in numerous public initiatives, often flavored with charity: he held executive or presidential positions in Junta de Obra, Junta de la Beneficiencia in his Nuestra Señora del Carmen parish, Real Archicofradía de la Virgén de los Dolores,&lt;ref&gt;Artagan 1912, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; Junta Local de Salvament de Náufrags&lt;ref&gt;Cañelles Julià, Toran 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and various makeshift committees, e.g. the body assisting victims of the 1885 [[earthquake]] in [[Andalusia]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Ilustración'' 11.01.85, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001419348&amp;page=15 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lluís Maria de Llauder i de Dalmases.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Luis de Llauder y Dalmases|Lluís Llauder Dalmases]]]]
In the 1880s Carlism did not exist as organized structures present in the Spanish public life; the movement languished as a set of loose quasi-political initiatives flavored with Traditionalist spirit and intransigent religiosity. Part of this strategy was mobilizing support by means of mass pilgrimages; Janer contributed as member of the Barcelona Junta Organizativa branch, which co-ordinated the 1882 [[romería]] to [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 14.01.82, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000060006&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Adhering to the same line he used to sign various public letters denouncing perceived injustice to the Catholics and secular course of the government, e.g. the entire Janer family subscribed to a 1883 document which protested curtailment of Catholic rights;&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 14.06.83, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000069956&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1884 he emerged as leader of the Catalan branch of Asociación Católica.&lt;ref&gt;Cañelles Julià, Toran 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Stress on religious features, focus on Traditionalist values and de-emphasizing of dynastical threads was very much the vision of the Carlist political leader [[:es:Candido Nocedal|Candido Nocedal]] and later his son [[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Ramón]]. Janer seemed on perfect terms with both&lt;ref&gt;compare his taking part in initiatives of Nocedal and Sarda y Salvany, ''El Ancora'' 17.01.82, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=2225936&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that the Nocedalistas, known also as [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrists]], were increasingly on collision course with the claimant [[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos]]; as late as in 1886 Janer took part in a homage banquet honoring Ramón Nocedal.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 10.03.86, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000099159&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when in 1888 the Integrists broke away from Carlism to form their own Traditionalist organization Janer decided to stay loyal to his king; in 1889 he was already lambasted by the Integrists as the sidekick of Llauder.&lt;ref&gt;''La Fidelidad Castellana'' 20.05.89, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1068123&amp;interno=S&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;posicion=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deputy leader (1889-1901)==
[[File:De Cerralbo.JPG|thumb|160px|left|[[Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa|Marques de Cerralbo]]]]
Following the Integrist secession Carlism abandoned its quasi-political format of the 1880s and assumed a decisively more active political stance; the nationwide structures started to emerge, initially styled as committees celebrating 1,400 years since the [[:es:Conversión de Recaredo|Conversion of Recaredo]]. In Catalonia the organization was headed by Llauder, yet Janer – together with Manuel de Torrents – was nominated its vice-president, effectively the second-in-command in the regional party infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Jordi Canal, ''El carlisme catala dins l'Espanya de la restauracio: un assaig de modernització politica (1888-1900)'', Barcelona 1998, {{ISBN|9788476022436}}, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; However, his contribution to Carlist buildup seems meager. Though Carlist candidates started to take part in electoral campaigns and under the new nationwide leadership of [[Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa|Marqués de Cerralbo]] the movement took shape of an organized modern political party, there is little information on Janer's public activity in the early 1890s. Despite consolidation and growth of Catalan Carlism under the regional leadership of Llauder, Janer neither stood as candidate in elections nor was recorded as active in supporting electoral campaigns. While de Cerralbo was striving to implement a new formula of mass mobilization&lt;ref&gt;on the new format of Carlism as build by de Cerralbo see Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis], Madrid 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Janer seemed attached rather to old-style patterns and at best took part in closed-door party feasts, like the one in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 14.02.93, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029793065&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His popular initiatives stuck to the pilgrimage format, e.g. when organizing workers' romería to Rome in 1894&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 22.02.94, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029793843&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or signing homage letter to the [[papal nuncio]]; the document protested the governmental secularization policy.&lt;ref&gt;''La Dinastía'' 28.10.94, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001611057&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carlos Duke of Madrid.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Don Carlos]]]]
In 1895 Janer was officially confirmed by de Cerralbo as vice-president of the Catalan Carlist organization,&lt;ref&gt;''El Baluarte'' 10.10.95, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1001468&amp;interno=S&amp;presentacion=pagina&amp;posicion=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; yet he still remained in the shadow of Llauder. He was barely mentioned when new party círculos in the region were being opened, typically noted when presiding over official banquets&lt;ref&gt;Canal 1998, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; or entertaining royal Carlist figures, e.g. the second wife of the claimant Berthe do Rohan, who visited Barcelona in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 16.12.96, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029797312&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though historiographic studies either on Catalan&lt;ref&gt;a monograph on Catal Carlism during the late 19th century mentions Janer only 2 times in rather episodical roles, see Canal 1998&lt;/ref&gt; or nationwide Carlism&lt;ref&gt;the work nearest to the overall history of late 19th century Carlism does not mention Janer at all, compare Fernández Escudero 2012&lt;/ref&gt; of the 1890s barely mention his name, de Cerralbo was apparently satisfied with Janer's contribution to the cause; Jefe Delegado addressed him with effusive letters of gratitude and thanked him for electoral efforts;&lt;ref&gt;''Correo de Tortosa'' 28.9.96&lt;/ref&gt; press of the era provides little evidence of such support.&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 18.09.96&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, it seems that in the late 1890s the Catalan Carlism was vibrant yet increasingly leaderless and disorganized. Since 1898 due to his poor health Llauder's leadership became largely theoretical, while the movement was plagued by personal squabbles, emerging social radicalism, urban [[pistolerismo]], [[Catalanism|Catalanist]] sympathies and insurrectional currents. None of the sources consulted mentions Janer when discussing the local [[:es:Sublevación carlista de octubre de 1900|1899-1900 Carlist revolts in Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Janer is not a single time mentioned in works dealing in detail with the Carlist conspiracy and revolts of 1899-1900, see Joan Villarroya i Font, ''1900.

==''Jefe'' (1902-1910)==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
Janer's tenure fell on a period when Catalan Carlism was challenged by massive social and political change, the decade which shifted the region's centre of gravity from rural traditional hinterland to the coastal strip, dominated by new urban classes. The rising Catalanist and anti-establishment tide gave rise to [[Catalan Solidarity (1906)|Solidaridad Catalana]]; on the one hand the Carlists were attracted by its opposition to the [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]] regime, on the other they were estranged by [[Republicanism in Spain|Republican]], [[Catalan nationalism|nationalist]] and secularist features of the alliance. Janer, who in 1903-1905 limited himself to making appointments&lt;ref&gt;''La Lucha'' 13.07.05, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1077455&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and presiding over party feasts,&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 18.05.93, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000507516&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1906 gave in to the pressure of pro-Solidaridad Carlists like Solferino and [[:es:miguel junyent|Junyent]] and permitted access to the pact. His key concern was that only authorized individuals were allowed to stand on joint electoral lists&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 09.05.06, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029806932&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the move did not go beyond a temporary tactical cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;''La Tarde'' 02.04.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1104760&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with anti-Solidaridad opposition in the party ranks&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the Catalan branch of Juventud Carlista protested to Janer over taking part in alliance with overtly pro-republican and secular zealots, ''La Cruz'' 17.04.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3046469&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; he enforced discipline&lt;ref&gt;Albert Balcells, Joan B. Culla, Conxita Mir, ''Les eleccions generals a Catalunya de 1901 a 1923'', Barcelona 1982, pp. 122-123; in 1908 Janer dissolved a local branch for opposition to official policy, ''La Correspondencia de España'' 12.09.98, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000587982&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; yet it seems he kept vacillating himself.&lt;ref&gt;the press provides conflicting evidence of Janer's stand towards Solidaridad, compare ''El Intransigente'' 09.04.07, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029755530&amp;page=2 here], ''La Tarde'' 02.04.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1104760&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''La Reconquista'' 06.04.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1015247&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''La Lucha'' 07.04.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1079420&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Carlist access was rewarded with [[Electoral Carlism (Restoration)|great success in the 1907 elections]]&lt;ref&gt;the claimant congratulated Janer on excellent electoral results, ''La Lucha'' 11.05.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1079447&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; but it seems that Janer had few regrets when the alliance fell apart in 1908, even though debates persisted until 1909.&lt;ref&gt;in 1909 Solferino resigned from provincial Barcelona jefatura due to differences with Janer over strategy for forthcoming elections, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 01.12.09, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000286038&amp;page=3 here], ''El Restaurador'' 01.12.09, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1014600&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another problem Janer had to face as a regional leader was the insurrectional tide, rising among the Catalan Carlists. Though the 1900 preparations boiled down to few isolated attempts some sections of the party kept gearing up for a violent overthrow of the regime. Janer called for discipline and tried to marginalize the radicals;&lt;ref&gt;''La Rioja'' 06.02.06, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3081688&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagin here] a&lt;/ref&gt; when in 1906 they staged a [[:es:Guillermo Moore|local revolt in Martorell]], easily crushed by the government forces, Janer first disauthorised the action&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 19.09.08, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029807472&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and then expulsed the insurrectionists from the party,&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 20.10.06, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029807602&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; again in full agreement with the claimant.&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Madrid'' 28.09.06, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000533648&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dissent was mounting, fuelled also by personal squabbles and issues related to tactical alliances with the [[Alfonsism|Alfonsists]]; to enforce discipline at times Janer opted for dissolution of municipal&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. the 1906 Valls affair, related Joaquín Avella and his Alfonsist leaning, ''El Porvenir'' 1.12.06; other titles claimed the problem was rather about Solidaridad, see ''La Cronica de Valls'' 10.8.07&lt;/ref&gt; or even provincial party jefaturas.&lt;ref&gt;in May 1907 Janer dissolved Junta Provincial of Tarragona in relation to its stand on elections to the Senate, ''La Cruz'' 25.05.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3046501&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; A few local party heavyweights like [[Josep de Suelves i de Montagut|Tamarít]] grumbled against Janer and some, like Solferino, resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;''Las Provincias'' 07.04.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000312848&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vich 1906.jpg|thumb|160px|Janer at a Carlist feast in [[Vic]]h, 1908]]
Janer seemed overwhelmed by problems and apparent decomposition of the party in Catalonia; he first tried to step down in 1906, but his resignation was not accepted by the claimant;&lt;ref&gt;''La Tarde'' 10.07.06, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1103443&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1908 he again handed over his resignation, also to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;''El Día'' 15.03.08, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002528282&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary press noted that Janer was a great Christian, grand citizen and by all means an extraordinary person, but neither a good leader nor an impressive politician, tending to inactivity and with scarce faith in the cause.&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Madrid'' 15.09.04, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000503807&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; He is not recorded as engaged in heated debates shaping the nationwide Carlist politics.&lt;ref&gt;in 1909-1912 Carlism was increasingly paralysed by the conflict between the key party theorist [[Juan Vázquez de Mella|Vázquez de Mella]] and the official party leader Bartolomé Feliú; Janer has not been mentioned by any study related, see Fernández Escudero 2012, Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, ISBN 97884878638202, and Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El caso Feliú y el dominio de Mella en el partido carlista en el período 1909-1912'', [in:] ''Espacio, tiempo y forma'' 10 (1997), pp. 99–116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 Janer eventually got his resignation accepted by the new Carlist king [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]], who appointed Solferino his successor.&lt;ref&gt;''La Hórmiga de Oro'' 19.02.10, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0012093769&amp;page=13 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The reason quoted was Janer's poor health&lt;ref&gt;''El Bien Público'' 20.01.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1000139152&amp;interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed it seems that his life force deteriorated, especially after the 1910 death of his wife. Following resignation he mostly withdrew into privacy and in public remained engaged only in family business, until death performing managerial duties in Caja de Ahorros.&lt;ref&gt;Wray McDonogh 2014, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known for his success in promoting Sun's anti-imperialist foreign policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Eugene Chen|author1=Howard L. Boorman|author2=Richard C. Howard|journal=Biographical Dictionary of Republican China|location=New York|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|date=1967|volume=I|pages=180–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Chen's father, Chen Guangquan, was known as Joseph Chen or Achan. He was of [[Hakka]] ancestry from [[Meixian District|Meixian]]. After taking part in the [[Taiping Rebellion]] against the [[Manchu dynasty]], he fled to the [[French West Indies]] where he met his wife, Mary Longchallon (Marie Leong), also a Chinese immigrant. Chen, as well as the Longchallon family, had been required by the French authorities to accept the Catholic faith as a condition of immigration.

Eugene was the oldest of Chen Guangquan and Mary Longchallon's three sons. Both parents of Eugene Chen were Chinese immigrants to Trinidad.&lt;ref name="cor" /&gt;  His wife Aisy was of African and French blood.

===Education===
After attending a Catholic school, St Mary's College, Trinidad, Chen qualified as a barrister and became known as one of the most highly skilled solicitors in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Boorman, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; The family did not speak Chinese at home; and, since there were no Chinese schools, he also did not learn to read [[Chinese script|Chinese]]. It was later said of him that his library was filled with Dickens, Shakespeare, Scott, and legal books, that he "spoke English as a scholar"; "except for his color, neither his living nor his habits were Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fMrit6tcO_AC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=Eugene+Chen+-Eoyang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bTDF2uE1iS&amp;sig=fNhYCDltyl3G43xTJTaery9h3D4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=42J2UKHEIKSryQGZn4DIDw&amp;ved=0CGUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Eugene%20Chen%20-Eoyang&amp;f=false | title=Eugene Chen  | accessdate=October 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101061322/https://books.google.com/books?id=fMrit6tcO_AC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;dq=Eugene+Chen+-Eoyang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bTDF2uE1iS&amp;sig=fNhYCDltyl3G43xTJTaery9h3D4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=42J2UKHEIKSryQGZn4DIDw&amp;ved=0CGUQ6AEwCQ |archivedate=January 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional life==
Chen eventually left the island to live in London, where he heard [[Sun Yat-sen]] speak at a rally against the Manchu government in China. Sun persuaded him to come to China and contribute his legal knowledge to the new Republic in 1912. Chen took the [[Trans-Siberian Railroad]], and shared the journey with [[Wu Liande|Wu Lien-te]], a physician born in Malaysia. Learning that Chen had no Chinese name, Wu suggested "Youren" as the equivalent of "Eugene".

After Sun was forced to flee to Japan in 1913, Chen remained in Peking, where he began a second career in journalism.  Chen edited the bilingual ''Peking Gazette'' 1913-1917, then founded the ''Shanghai Gazette'', the first of what Sun envisioned as a network of newspapers across China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinaheritagenewsletter.anu.edu.au/features.php?searchterm=030_wagner.inc&amp;issue=030 |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes|title=China Heritage Newsletter |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029214201/http://chinaheritagenewsletter.anu.edu.au/features.php?searchterm=030_wagner.inc&amp;issue=030 |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chen had given up his initial support for [[Yuan Shikai]] and became a strong critic of the government, accusing it of "selling China", for which offence he was imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yuantsungchen.com/images/Archive/Peking%20Gazette%201917%2005%2018.pdf |accessdate=October 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes|title=Peking Gazette |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216231823/http://yuantsungchen.com/images/Archive/Peking%20Gazette%201917%2005%2018.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, Chen joined Sun in Canton to support the southern government, which he helped to represent at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], where he resisted Japanese and British plans for China. In 1922, Chen became Sun's closest adviser on foreign affairs, and developed a leftist stance of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] nationalism and support of Sun's alliance with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Boorman,p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chen's revolutionary diplomacy===
Chen's diplomacy led one historian to call him "arguably China's most important diplomat of the 1920s and instrumental in the rights recovery movement."&lt;ref&gt;Philip C.C. Huang, "Biculturality in Modern China and in Chinese Studies," ''Modern China'' 26.1 (2000), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Chen welcomed Sun's alliance with the Soviet Union, and worked harmoniously with [[Michael Borodin]], the chief Soviet and foreign policy adviser to Sun Yat-Sen on the reorganization of the [[Guomindang|Nationalist Party]] at Canton in 1923.  After Sun's death, Chen was elected to the Central Executive Committee of Kuomintang, Nationalist Minister for Foreign affairs at Canton, and Ruler of Hankow, all being achieved in 1926 he was forced to resign in April 1927.  Over the next two years, Chen lodged vigorous and articulate protests over continued imperialist policies with the American and British governments, as well as negotiating with the British authorities over the massive labor strikes in Hong Kong.  When Chiang Kai-shek's [[Northern Expedition]] appeared on the verge of unifying the country, Chen joined the [[Government of the Republic of China in Wuhan|rival Nationalist government]] at [[Wuhan#National government moved its capital to Wuhan|Wuhan]]. In January 1927, the Nationalists at Wuhan forcibly took control over the foreign concession there, and when violent crowds also took the foreign concession at [[Kiukiang]], foreign warships gathered at Shanghai. Chen's negotiations with the British led to confirmation of Chinese control of the two concessions and this success was hailed as the start of a new revolutionary foreign policy. The situation soon reversed. The foreign powers retaliated for the deadly xenophobic attacks on foreigners by elements of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] in Nanking, and Chiang Kai-shek launched [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|White Terror attacks]] on leftists in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;Boorman, p.182-183&lt;/ref&gt; Chen sent Borodin, his sons [[Percy Chen]] and [[Jack Chen]], and the American leftist journalist [[Anna Louise Strong]] in an automotive convoy across Central Asia to Moscow. He, his daughters Si-lan and Yolanda,Mme. Sun Yat-sen, and the American journalist [[Rayna Prohme]] traveled from Shanghai to Vladivostok, and once again by Trans-Siberian Railway to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Percy Chen, ''China Called Me: My Life Inside the Chinese Revolution'' (Boston: Little Brown, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1927年宋庆龄陈友仁在莫斯科.jpg|thumb|300px|1927 Chen and Soong Qingling in Moscow]]

Life in Moscow from 1928 was far from easy.  After an initial warm public reception, Stalin showed little tolerance for living symbols of the Soviet failure in China. Chen and Mme. Sun were frustrated in their attempts to establish a leftist Chinese front, and soon left Moscow.  After a period of exile he went to Hong Kong before being appointed Foreign Minister by General [[Chiang Kai-Shek]] in 1931.  After brief service with governments in China which challenged the Nanking government, Chen was finally expelled from the Kuomintang for serving as Foreign Minister in the [[Fukien Rebellion]] of 1934. He again took refuge in Paris, but returned to Hong Kong after the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war with Japan]]. He was taken to Shanghai in the spring of 1942 in hopes of persuading him to support the [[Reorganized National Government of China|Japanese puppet government]], but he remained loudly critical of that "pack of liars" until his death in May, 1944, at the age of 66.&lt;ref&gt;Boorman, p. 180-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1899, Chen married Agatha Alphosin Ganteaume (1878–1926), known as Aisy, a French Creole whose father owned one of the largest estates in Trinidad. They had eight children, four of whom survived childhood: [[Percy Chen]] (1901-1986), a lawyer, worked with his father for many years; Sylvia (Silan) Chen (1905-1996), an internationally known dancer, married the American film historian [[Jay Leyda]]; Yolanda (Yulen) Chen (1913-2006), who stayed in the USSR for the rest of her life and came to the prominence as a camerawoman; and [[Jack Chen]] (1908-1995), who made an international reputation as a journalistic cartoonist during the Sino-Japanese War, and who wrote  [[A Year In Upper Felicity]], an account of his experience in the countryside during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;id=t8wdOqCde-YC&amp;q=Alphonsine#v=snippet&amp;q=Alphonsine&amp;f=false |title=Return to the Middle Kingdom: One Family, Three Revolutionaries, and the ... - Yuan-tsung Chen - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Jack married [[Chen Yuan-tsung]].

Aisy died of breast cancer in May 1926. Chen and [[Georgette Chen]] were married in 1930 and remained together until his death in 1944.

'''Dorothea Sarah Florence Alexandra, Lady Phillips''' (née Ortlepp; 14 June 1863 &amp;ndash; 23 August 1940) was a [[South Africa]]n art patroness and promoter of indigenous culture. She was married to [[Lionel Phillips|Sir Lionel Phillips, 1st Baronet]], a mining magnate and politician and was known by one of her middle names, Florence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/archframes.php?archid=5973|title=PHILLIPS, Lady Florence|website=www.artefacts.co.za|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Florence Ortlepp was born in [[Cape Town]] in 1863, the only daughter of Albert Frederick Ortlepp, a Colesberg land surveyor and naturalist, and Sarah Walker. She received her education at [[Rondebosch]] and later in [[Bloemfontein]]. Lionel Phillips met her on the diamond-diggings and married her in 1885. They moved to Johannesburg in 1889. She travelled extensively from 1887, but returned hurriedly to be with her husband during his trial following the [[Jameson Raid]]. After his sentence, reprieve and exile, they left for London and established a home in [[Grosvenor Square]] while maintaining a country house at Tylney Hall in Hampshire. While the couple lived in London, Florence acquired a keen interest in art and bought numerous works by artists of the time, including [[William Orpen]], [[William Rothenstein]], [[Walter Sickert]], [[Philip Wilson Steer]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Claude Monet]] and [[Alfred Sisley]]. She presented many of these works to the Johannesburg Art Gallery, which she actively helped to establish.

On a visit to South Africa in 1905, she commissioned [[Rudolf Marloth]] to undertake his Flora of South Africa, a mammoth work published in 6 volumes between 1913 and 1932.

==Art collection==
After resettling in Johannesburg, she started acquiring paintings with a view to eventually founding an art gallery, which after many difficulties took shape as the [[Johannesburg Art Gallery]]. She played a leading role in projects aimed at cultivating and preserving the local artistic heritage. She persuaded Sir [[Max Michaelis]] to donate his considerable collection of 17th century Dutch and Flemish paintings to the city of [[Cape Town]]. She headed a movement to preserve and restore the [[Koopmans-de Wet House|Koopmans-De Wet House]] in Cape Town and was an enthusiastic collector of Africana furniture, both for her own home and public institutions. She was instrumental, with Prof. G.E. Pearse, in establishing a Faculty of Architecture at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]].

== Literary output ==

In 1913 her book "A Friendly Germany: Why Not?" was published pleading for friendly relations between England and Germany. She was of the opinion that Britain and Germany should unite against the self-determination movement amongst the Asians and Africans, which she referred to as "The Black and the Yellow Perils".

==Later life==
Florence and Lionel Phillips eventually settled at the farm [[Vergelegen]] near Somerset West in 1924. Here they devoted their spare time to encouraging the preservation of national heritage culture and artefacts. They also sponsored immigrants through the 1820 Settlers Memorial Association and a number of other public causes. Many of the [[Randlords]] and their wives commissioned portraits of themselves from leading European society portraitists of the time. The living room of the Vergelegen Manor House is adorned by a youthful and opulent portrayal of Florence by the Italian artist [[Giovanni Boldini]], while a more mature and sombre rendering by the British portraitist [[Sir William Nicholson]] is to be seen in the Music Room. The Boldini portrait was presented by Lady Phillips to the SA National Gallery in the 1930s.

She died in 1940&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; at [[Vergelegen]], [[Somerset West]]. She and her husband are buried in the Brixton Cemetery in Johannesburg. They had two sons and a daughter.

[[File:Foxygrandpa1904.jpg|right|240px|thumb|[[Carl E. Schultze]]'s ''Foxy Grandpa'' (1904)]]
'''''Foxy Grandpa''''' was an American [[gag-a-day]] newspaper [[comic strip]] featuring an eponymous character, created by [[cartoonist]] [[Carl E. Schultze]] drawing under the name of “Bunny.”

''Foxy Grandpa'' made its first appearance on January 7, 1900.&lt;ref name=lambiek-schultze&gt;{{Cite web|last=[[Lambiek]] Comiclopedia|title= Carl Edward Schultze|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/s/schultze_carl.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strip initially ran in the ''[[New York Herald]]'', but it moved to the ''[[New York American]]'' on February 16, 1902.&lt;ref name=toonopedia-foxy&gt;{{cite web |last= Don Markstein's [[Toonopedia]] |title= Foxy Grandpa|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/foxygran.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Selchow and Righter]] licensed ''Foxy Grandpa'' for the Foxy Grandpa Hat Party Game (similar to [[Pin the Tail on the Donkey]]) after 1900. Between 1901 and 1917, ''Foxy Grandpa'' was published in books, more than 30 volumes from four different publishers. The strip was also adapted to Broadway shows and early silent films (with Foxy Grandpa played by stage performer [[Joseph Hart (entertainer)|Joseph Hart]]). In 1912, the strip was briefly distributed by the [[C. J. Mar Syndicate]], but it was dropped in 1918.

In the typeset ''Foxy Grandpa's Stories'', distributed by [[Newspaper Feature Syndicate]], Foxy Grandpa was the narrator, appearing in a one-panel cartoon at the top of each column. This feature lasted through the 1920s and well into the 1930s. In 1929, the strip appeared in America's first comics periodical, ''[[The Funnies]]''.&lt;ref name=toonopedia-foxy/&gt;

==Characters and story==
The strip revolved around Foxy Grandpa, an elderly gentleman, with two mischievous grandsons (Chub and Bunt) who constantly try to trick him. Foxy Grandpa, however, always managed to get the better of the two boys, combining brains with a perverse sense of humor, while demonstrating skills at acrobatics, illustration and construction of various small devices.&lt;ref name=toonopedia-foxy/&gt;

The comic was drawn in [[text comics|text comic]] style, with the text and dialogue written underneath the images. 

==Cultural legacy==
*In the 1938 film [[Crashing Hollywood (1938 film)|''Crashing Hollywood'']] the squirrelly Movie mogul Hugo Wells is called "Foxy Grandpa".
*In the 1944 film ''[[Murder My Sweet]]'' detective [[Phillip Marlowe]] refers to the villainous Jules Amthor as "Foxy Grandpa".
*In the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode "One Krab's Trash," "Foxy Grandpa" is written on a trucker hat offered to [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] by his boss, Mr. Krabs.
*In the [[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]] strip for Sunday, April 8, 1951, Rackety Coon Chile and Alabaster Allligator are less than thrilled with a story being told to them by Albert and wonder if they might be able to move to another strip.  Alabaster suggests "Foxey [sic] Grandpa".

'''Henry Hurwitz Jr.''' (December 25, 1918 – April 14, 1992), was a physicist at [[General Electric Company]] who pioneered the theory and design of nuclear power plants and helped engineer the reactor for the [[USS Seawolf (SSN-575)|Seawolf]] nuclear submarine.

==Biography==
He was born in Manhattan on December 25, 1918. He graduated from [[Cornell University]] in 1938, with an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in physics. He then went to [[Harvard University]] in 1939 and received a [[Ph.D.]] in quantum mechanics in 1941. His first marriage ended in divorce.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1943 he was recruited by [[Hans Bethe]] to help [[Edward Teller]]'s staff of researchers at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico develop the thermonuclear reactions for the [[hydrogen bomb]]. In 1946, Hurwitz became one of the first scientists to work at GE's [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]] in [[Schenectady, New York]]. In 1947 he transferred to the GE Research and Development Center to become manager of the Nucleonics and Radiation Branch. His team of scientists used advanced theta-pinch techniques to harness fusion reactions.

In 1955, a year after [[Fortune Magazine]] named him as one of the top 10 scientists in U.S. industry, Hurwitz contributed to establishing the first atomic containment sphere for [[GE]]. The development advanced industry-wide safety protocols for enclosing nuclear reactors.

His interest in electronic devices, computer applications, and chemical engineering prompted GE to recognize Hurwitz's accomplishments in 1975 by naming him a Coolidge Fellow, the GE R&amp;D Center's highest honor.  Hurwitz also is noted for his efforts to raise awareness about the dangers of [[Radon]], and later received the [[Glenn T. Seaborg Medal]] in 1989 from the [[American Nuclear Society]].

He died on April 14, 1992 in [[Schenectady, New York]] of [[cancer]], at age 73.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2468">'''James Ross''' (9 May 1835 &amp;ndash; 20 September 1871) was a Metis [[journalist]], [[lawyer]], and member of the [[provisional government]] established by [[Louis Riel]] during the [[Red River Rebellion]] of 1869 &amp;ndash; 1870. He graduated with honours from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1857. He also received a Master of Arts from the same university later in 1865. He was the [[Métis in Canada|Métis]] son of Scottish immigrant author and [[Hudson's Bay Company]] fur trader/administrator [[Alexander Ross (fur trader)|Alexander Ross]] and Sarah (Timentwa),an Okanagan tribal woman. James married Margaret Smith in Toronto on 18 May 1858.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ross_james_1835_71_10E.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross represented the views of the [[English Canadian|anglophone]] community in the [[Red River Colony]], defusing tensions between the [[French language|French]]- and [[English language|English]]-speaking delegates of the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] National Committee. He served on the Convention of Forty&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/12539.Convention%20of%20Forty%20revised.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (January 25, 1870 to February 10, 1870) as a representative of St. John's Parish. Ross served as translator of the speeches of the French delegates, and also served on the "Committee of Six" responsible for drafting the "List of Rights" that were presented to the [[Government of Canada]] during the negotiations that led to the [[Manitoba Act]] of 1870 and the entry of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Manitoba]] into the [[Canadian Confederation]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ross_james_1835_71_10E.html&lt;/ref&gt;James Ross died of tuberculosis on September 20, 1871.

[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''John Denton Pinkstone French, 1st Earl of Ypres''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KP|GCB|OM|GCVO|KCMG|ADC|PC}} (28 September 1852 – 22 May 1925), known as '''Sir John French''' from 1901 to 1916, and as '''The Viscount French''' between 1916 and 1922, was a senior [[British Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]. Born in Kent to an [[Anglo-Irish]] family, he saw brief service as a [[midshipman]] in the [[Royal Navy]], before becoming a [[cavalry]] officer. He achieved rapid promotion and distinguished himself on the [[Nile Expedition|Gordon Relief Expedition]]. French had a considerable reputation as a womaniser throughout his life and his career nearly ended when he was cited in the divorce of a brother officer whilst in [[British Raj|India]] in the early 1890s.

French became a national hero during the [[Second Boer War]]. He won the [[Battle of Elandslaagte]] near Ladysmith, escaping under fire on the last train as the [[Siege of Ladysmith|siege]] began. He then commanded the Cavalry Division, winning the Battle of Klip Drift during a march to [[Siege of Kimberley|relieve Kimberley]]. He later conducted [[Counter-insurgency]] operations in [[Cape Colony]].

During the Edwardian Period he commanded [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] at [[Aldershot Command|Aldershot]], then served as Inspector-General of the Army, before becoming [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS, the professional head of the British Army) in 1912. During this time he helped to prepare the British Army for a possible European War, and was also one of those who insisted, in the so-called “cavalry controversy”, that cavalry still be trained to charge with sabre and lance rather than only fighting dismounted with firearms. During the [[Curragh incident]] he had to resign as CIGS after promising [[Hubert Gough]] in writing that the Army would not be used to coerce Ulster Protestants into a [[Home Rule Crisis|Home Rule Ireland]].

French’s most important role was as [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) for the first year and a half of the [[World War I|First World War]]. He had an immediate personality clash with the French General [[Charles Lanrezac]]. After the British suffered heavy casualties at the battles of [[Battle of Mons|Mons]] and [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]] (where [[Horace Smith-Dorrien|Smith-Dorrien]] made a stand contrary to French's wishes), French wanted to withdraw the BEF from the Allied line to refit and only agreed to take part in the [[First Battle of the Marne]] after a private meeting with the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Herbert Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], against whom he bore a grudge thereafter. In May 1915 he leaked information about [[Shell Crisis of 1915|shell shortages]] to the press in the hope of engineering Kitchener’s removal. By summer 1915 French’s command was being increasingly criticised in London by Kitchener and other members of the government, and by [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]], [[Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet|Robertson]] and other senior generals in France. After the [[Battle of Loos]], at which French's slow release of [[XI Corps (United Kingdom)|XI Corps]] from reserve was blamed for the failure to achieve a decisive breakthrough on the first day, [[H. H. Asquith]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], demanded his resignation. Haig, who was formerly French's trusted subordinate and who had saved him from bankruptcy by lending him a large sum of money in 1899, replaced him.

French was then appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces]] for 1916–18. This period saw the country running increasingly short of manpower for the Army. Whilst the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Battle of Ypres]] was in progress, French, as part of [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]’s manoeuvres to reduce the power of Haig and Robertson, submitted a paper which was critical of Haig's command record and which recommended that there be no further major [[Offensive (military)|offensive]]s until the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF) was present in strength. He then became [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] in 1918, a position he held throughout much of the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1922), in which his own sister was involved on the republican side. During this time he published ''1914'', an inaccurate and much criticised volume of memoirs.

==Early life and career==
===Family===
French's family was related to the [[Baron de Freyne|French/De Freyne family]] which had gone to [[County Wexford|Wexford]] in the fourteenth century and had substantial estates at Frenchpark, [[County Roscommon|Roscommon]]. French always regarded himself as "Irish", although his branch of the family had lived in England since the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=heath130&gt;Heathcote, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchfamilyassoc.com/FFA/CHARTSWEB/IREFa.htm|title=French Family of Frenchpark, and Cloonshanville Priory|publisher=French Family Association|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p15"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was Commander John Tracey William French, [[Royal Navy|RN]], of Ripple Vale in Kent (born 1808, died 1854), who had fought at [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] and under [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Napier]] in support of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro]] in the [[Liberal Wars|Portuguese Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p15"/&gt; His mother was Margaret Eccles from [[Glasgow]], who, after suffering a breakdown after her husband's death, was eventually institutionalised after being diagnosed as insane.&lt;ref&gt;Cassar 1985, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1867, leaving French to be brought up by his sisters.&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p52"&gt;Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33272?docPos=3|title=John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at a [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] preparatory school and [[Eastman's Royal Naval Academy]] at [[Portsmouth]]&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; before joining the [[Royal Navy]] in 1866.&lt;ref name=lh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/FRENCH.shtml|title=FRENCH, Sir John Denton Pinkstone, (1852–1925), 1st Earl of Ypres, Field Marshal|publisher=Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives|accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Navy===
He joined the Royal Navy because it gave him a chance to leave home four or five years earlier than the Army. From August 1866 he trained on board the three-decker battleship [[HMS Britannia (1820)|HMS ''Britannia'']] at Dartmouth. He obtained only an "average" certificate, which required him to do a further six months training on board another ship—the frigate [[HMS Bristol (1861)|HMS ''Bristol'']] at Sheerness from January 1868—before qualifying as a midshipman.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p17-9"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, he served as a midshipman on [[HMS Warrior (1860)|HMS ''Warrior'']], commanded by Captain Boys, an old friend of French's father.  She patrolled in the [[English Channel]] and off Spain and Portugal.  While in [[Lisbon]], French was able to hire horses and ride over [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]’s old battlefields.  During his service, he also witnessed the accidental sinking of [[HMS Captain (1869)|HMS ''Captain'']].  He resigned from the Royal Navy in November 1870,&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p17-9"/&gt; as he was discovered to be [[Acrophobia|acrophobic]]&lt;ref&gt;Wells, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; and to suffer from seasickness.&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2006, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early army career===
French joined the [[West Suffolk Militia|Suffolk Artillery Militia]] in November 1870,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24069|page=888|date=27 February 1874}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was expected to put in about two months a year with the regiment. He initially failed his exams (mathematics and foreign languages) for a regular commission, and had to hire a new tutor, losing the fees he had paid in advance to the previous one.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p20-2"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;

He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the [[8th King's Royal Irish Hussars]] on 28 February 1874,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; a prestigious regiment whose officers often drank [[claret]] for breakfast, but there is no evidence that he ever served with them.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p20-2"/&gt; He transferred to the [[19th Hussars]] on 11 March 1874,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24074|page=1591|date=10 March 1874|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly as it was cheaper—following the sale of the family home at Ripple Valley French’s private income of £1,000 per annum was enough to cover the £500–£600 required by his new regiment.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p20-2"/&gt; He was posted to [[Aldershot Command]], which then contained a division (three infantry brigades and one cavalry) under [[James Hope Grant|Sir Hope Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; He became an expert hunter and steeplechaser, permanently damaging the little finger of his right hand in a fall.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th Hussars were posted to Ireland in June 1876. In September 1877 French was one of two lieutenants who persuaded seventy drunk and mutinous troopers, who had armed themselves with sticks and threatened "murder" if infantry pickets were sent after them, to return to barracks (the ringleaders were subsequently imprisoned—they had been protesting at an unpopular commanding officer, who remained in command for another sixteen months).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1880 the 19th were deployed by rail to [[Ballinrobe]] and [[Lough Mask]], to protect labourers ricking hay at the height of the [[Charles Boycott|Captain Boycott]] disturbances. An Irishman hamstrung French’s horse with a sickle while he was sitting on it.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p27"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

He became adjutant of his regiment on 1 June 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24876|page=4624|date=24 August 1880|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the 19th Hussars had only one major, but as three different men held that rank in three years (1877–80) the resulting turnover of officers brought French his promotion to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p27"/&gt; on 16 October 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24899|page=5614|date=9 November 1880|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became adjutant of the [[Northumberland Hussars]] on 1 April 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=24963|page=1919|date=19 April 1881|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Northumberland he missed out on active service: the 19th Hussars took part in the [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|occupation of Egypt]] and [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]] (13 September 1882), but French's applications to rejoin his regiment were rejected by the War Office.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p29"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in the number of majors in the 19th Hussars brought French promotion to that rank on 3 April 1883.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p30"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25264|page=4227|date=28 August 1883|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; These promotions (captain at the age of 28, major at 30) were relatively rapid.&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p53"&gt;Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan===
French was initially expected to rejoin his regiment when they returned to Ireland, but the emergence of [[Muhammad Ahmad|the Mahdi]] in the Sudan required them to remain in the theatre, fighting Mahdist forces in the eastern Sudan [[Suakin Expedition|near Suakin]]. French eventually rejoined the regiment when they returned to [[Cairo]] in October 1884.&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

French took part in the [[Nile Expedition|Sudan expedition]] to relieve Major General [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]] in 1884.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; He was second-in-command to his friend Lieutenant Colonel Percy Barrow, with the cavalry which accompanied Brigadier General [[Herbert Stewart|Sir Herbert Stewart]] as he took the short route across 176 miles of desert (the other British force under Major General [[William Earle (soldier)|Earle]] marched the long way along the bend of the Nile).  Most of the cavalry work was in reconnaissance and warding off Dervish raids, although they did—at a walk—pursue the retreating enemy after the [[Battle of Abu Klea]] in January 1885. By the time they reached the Nile the horses had not been watered for between 56 and 72 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 35–39&lt;/ref&gt; During the retreat back across the desert via Jakdul—the expedition had reached [[Khartoum]] too late to save Gordon—Major French led a rearguard of thirteen men, again warding off Dervish attacks and impressing [[Redvers Buller]] and [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Sir Garnet Wolseley]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

He was promoted to [[lieutenant colonel]] on 7 February 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25450|page=1091|date=10 March 1885|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2004, p. 42) gives the date of this promotion as August.&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, this was an unusually early promotion, and he was appointed second-in-command of the 19th Hussars.  His experience of handling cavalry with scarce water would stand him in good stead in South Africa.  In January 1886 he briefly acted as Commanding Officer when Colonel Barrow died.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow had been severely wounded at El Teb in February 1884, and a wound opened up again while he was tent-pegging in preparation for the regimental sports day. He died within thirty hours&lt;/ref&gt; but French was considered too young for the position, and Colonel Boyce Combe was transferred in from the [[10th Hussars]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

From June 1886 to April 1888 French was stationed at Norwich with the regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt; He became Commanding Officer of the [[19th Hussars]]—still aged only 36—on 27 September 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=25882|page=7078|date=11 December 1888|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2004, pp. 43–44) again does not quite tally with the London ''Gazette'' here, stating that he took command of his regiment in spring 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; He impressed [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] by his initiative in organising his regiment into squadrons commanded by majors.&lt;ref&gt;Previously the largest permanent unit was the troop; some of these were too small for effective training, while the captains commanding them varied widely in age and experience. Wood had been lobbying the War Office for some time to introduce permanent peacetime squadrons, and they finally ordered all cavalry regiments to make the change in the 1890s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===India and divorce scandal===
[[Image:Major-General Sir J.D.P. French.jpg|thumb|right|Colonel French in full dress uniform, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, photo plate 1&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the few photographs of French taken before his appearance aged dramatically, and hinting at his success as a womaniser.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p46"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;]]
He was promoted brevet colonel (7 February 1889), and was posted to India in September 1891.&lt;ref name=heath131&gt;Heathcote, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; There, at cavalry camp during an exercise in November 1891, he first met Captain [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], with whose career his own was to be entwined for the next twenty-five years.&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p53"/&gt; French became Assistant Adjutant-General of Cavalry in 1893.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt;

In India serving initially at [[Secunderabad]] and [[Bangalore]], French worked closely with [[George Luck]], a noted trainer of cavalry, albeit with perhaps an excessive emphasis on parade-ground drill.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; French commanded a brigade of Indian Cavalry on manoeuvres near [[Lahore]] in January 1893.  He seems not to have acquired the deep affection for India common in officers who served there.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p46"/&gt;

French’s wife did not accompany him to India (they seem to have lived apart for a while after his return from Egypt, although if so they must have been reconciled as his daughter Essex was conceived in 1886).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 42–44&lt;/ref&gt; When commanding the 19th Hussars in India French was cited for adultery with the wife of a brother officer during his leave (inevitably christened "French leave" by his colleagues) in the Indian hills; he was lucky this did not terminate his career.&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, p.53"&gt;Reid 2006, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; There were also unsubstantiated rumours that French had had affairs with the daughter of an Anglo-Indian railway official and also, earlier in his career, with his commanding officer’s wife.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p372"&gt;Holmes 2004, p.372&lt;/ref&gt; A later tale, that he had once been the lover of the Irish nationalist [[Maud Gonne]], appeared in [[Mary Colum]]'s ''"Life and the Dream"'' (1947), although his biographer comments that it "lacks firm evidence."&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

He was on half-pay in 1893–95, possibly as a result of the Indian divorce scandal, and reduced to bicycling with his sons as he could not afford to keep horses.&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, p.53"&gt;Reid 2006, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; According to his son Gerald he would hop alongside the bicycle as he never mastered the art of mounting it.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===A career saved twice===
Two years on half pay would normally have meant compulsory retirement but in autumn 1894 he temporarily commanded a cavalry brigade under Lieutenant General Sir James Keith-Fraser on the manoeuvres in the [[Vale of the White Horse]] in Berkshire.  French commented that the role of modern cavalry was not to "cut and hack and thrust" but rather to herd the enemy within range of friendly artillery. His handling of the brigade was seen as one of the few successful parts of the manoeuvres, and Luck replaced Keith-Fraser as Inspector General. The introduction of cavalry brigades was also an innovation, supported by French.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Buller got him a job as Assistant Adjutant-General at Army Headquarters on 24 August 1895,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26662|page=5196|date=17 September 1895|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing a new cavalry training manual (in practice extensively assisted by Captain [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]]).&lt;ref name=heath131/&gt; However, Buller had been Adjutant-General since 1890, and French’s appointment coincided with Luck’s arrival as Inspector-General, suggesting that Luck’s influence was more important.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p372"/&gt; Ian Beckett agrees, adding that French was also a protege of the influential General [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]].&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p53"/&gt;

French went on to be Commander of the [[2nd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Cavalry Brigade]] at [[Canterbury]] on 1 May 1897&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=26849|page=2447|date=4 May 1897|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Commander of the [[1st Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Cavalry Brigade]] at [[Aldershot Command]] on 12 January 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27043|page=301|date=17 January 1899|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haig, recently returned from the Sudan War, was French's brigade-major at Aldershot.&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p53"/&gt; French was promoted temporary major-general early in 1899.  There were some accusations that these promotions, for a man whose career had so recently nearly ended, relied too much on powerful patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1899, at his own request, French borrowed £2,500, in a formal contract with interest, from Haig. He was within 24 hours of bankruptcy—which would have required him to resign his commission—after unwise investments in South African mining shares (Transvaal Golds), which crashed in value as war loomed. [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]] believed the loan was never repaid,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 50–52&lt;/ref&gt; but Haig's biographer Walter Reid believes that the loan was probably repaid in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2006, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boer War==
===Early war===
====Arrival====
French embarked from Southampton for the [[Second Boer War]] on 23 September 1899, inviting Haig to share his cabin.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; War had not yet officially been declared when French put to sea.  British troops were being sent in the hope of intimidating President [[Paul Kruger|Kruger]] of the Transvaal into granting voting rights to the Uitlanders—non-Boer settlers—which would break the Boer stronghold on political power.  It had the opposite effect, as the Boers issued their own ultimatum on 9 October, while the British troops were still at sea, in the hope of provoking an anti-British rising by the Boers of the British-ruled Cape Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed both a major-general on the staff and a local major-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27119|page=5814|date=22 September 1899|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French arrived at [[Cape Town]] on 11 October.  He had expected to command a cavalry brigade under Lieutenant General [[George White (British Army officer)|White]] in Natal, White also had the equivalent of a division of infantry but Colonel Brocklehurst was appointed to this command, while French and Haig were ordered to Natal "for the present," which they guessed correctly meant that they were to take charge of the Cavalry Division when Buller’s Army Corps arrived.  After steaming to [[Durban]] French and Haig arrived in [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]] at 5.40am on 20 October, just as hostilities were beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elandslaagte====
On the morning of his arrival, French was ordered to investigate reports that the Boers had taken [[Elandslaagte]], north-east of Ladysmith, cutting communications with Major General [[Penn Symons|Symon]]’s force at [[Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal|Dundee]]. Taking with him the [[5th Royal Irish Lancers|5th Lancers]], six squadrons of [[Natal Carbineers]] and [[Natal Mounted Rifles]], a battery of field artillery and a brigade of infantry under Colonel [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]], he made contact with the Boers at 13.00 that day.  White was initially cautious but on 21 October, having learned of Symons’ victory at [[Battle of Talana Hill|Talana]] the previous day, he permitted French to attack.  Concerned at French’s lack of experience at commanding infantry, White initially proposed that his chief of staff Maj-Gen Hunter take command, but Hunter advised that French should be left in command.  White himself came merely to observe, satisfied that the infantry were in Hamilton’s capable hands.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 62–67&lt;/ref&gt; French enjoyed numerical superiority of around 3:1.&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham 1979, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27282|page=916|date=8 February 1901|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elandslaagte saw British cavalry charge with the lance, cutting down fleeing Boers amid gory scenes described by one British officer as "most excellent [[Boar hunting|pig-sticking]]". This was portrayed as proving the continued relevance of old-fashioned cavalry charges, but in fact owed much to special circumstances: the success of Hamilton’s preceding infantry attack, and the fact that the charge was carried out at dusk.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; French celebrated the anniversary of [[Battle of Elandslaagte|this small battle]] for the rest of his life.  At the time it was seized on by the press in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

That night White ordered all British forces to fall back on Ladysmith, where it was soon clear that they were about to be besieged by the combined Transvaal and Orange Free State forces. French spent much of the 26 and 27 October patrolling around the advancing Boer forces. On 30 October his cavalry fought dismounted at Lombard’s Kop north-east of Ladysmith; this was the right flank of [[Battle of Ladysmith|three unsuccessful actions]]—the others being Nicholson’s Nek and an infantry action at Long Hill in the centre which ended in near-rout—fought by White’s troops on "Mournful Monday".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Although French pointed out that cavalry were unlikely to be of much use in a besieged town, White refused him permission to break out. On 2 November, after he had spent the morning on a raid on a Boer [[Wagon_fort#Laager|laager]], French received orders to leave Ladysmith. French and Haig escaped under fire on the last train out as the [[Siege of Ladysmith|Boer siege]] began; Boers tore up the track minutes after the train passed.  Steaming from Durban on 3 November, he arrived at Cape Town on 8 November, meeting with Buller, whose Army Corps was then arriving.&lt;ref name=heath131/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

====Colesberg operations====
French was initially ordered to assemble the Cavalry Division at Maitland, near Cape Town. Now a local lieutenant general like Buller's other four division commanders, he was then ordered to take command of forces covering the Colesberg area, filling in the gap between [[Baron Methuen|Methuen]]'s division (operating at Orange River Station, with a view to relieving [[Siege of Kimberley|Kimberley]] and [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]]) and [[William Forbes Gatacre|Gatacre]]’s Division at Stormberg. On 18 November he went up to De Aar, nearer the front, to confer with Maj-Gen [[Andrew Gilbert Wauchope|Wauchope]], in charge of the lines of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

French arrived at Naawpoort on the afternoon of 20 November, and personally led a reconnaissance the following morning. The Boer force of General Schoeman{{efn|Boer General Hendrik Jacobus Schoeman (1840–1901), son of [[Stephanus Schoeman]], State President of the South African Republic (1860–1862)}} had been reinforced by local Boers, and French, not strong enough to attack Arundel directly, conducted an active defence. At one stage, in late November and until 14 December, he was also required to extend his forces east to Rosmead to protect the railway to Port Elizabeth on the coast. A Boer penetration here would have cut off Cape Colony from Natal. French was proud of having achieved "moral ascendancy" (keeping the initiative, in modern parlance) over the Boers despite his force of 2,000 men being outnumbered by two to one.  French's subordinate Colonel T.C. Porter won a small action near Vaal Kop on 13 December, but the Boers captured that place on 16 December, causing French to go forward and take personal command. Around this time he offered to cancel his plans to advance on Colesberg and lend his cavalry to Methuen, who had been defeated at [[Battle of Magersfontein|Magersfontein]], but this was rejected as there was insufficient water even for Methuen's own horses in the Modder River sector.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 72–75&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Field Marshal [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Frederick Roberts]]' appointment as Commander-in-Chief on 17 December 1899 (following the defeats of [[Black Week]]) and arrival at Cape Town on 10 January, French was the only senior British commander to conduct active operations.  Although Schoeman’s force had grown further in size, he had lost the confidence of his subordinates and, after a Boer council of war, fell back on a strong position surrounded by hills at Colesberg (29 December) just as French had been preparing to outflank him.  French instead (1 January 1900) pinned down the Boer forces and turned their right flank (the British left). The fighting went on until 25 January, with French several times attempting to turn the Boer flanks but pulling back as his forces ran into resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 76–79&lt;/ref&gt;

French did not succeed in capturing Colesberg, but he had prevented a Boer invasion of the Cape and tied down Boer forces which might have been used elsewhere. [[Leo Amery|Amery]]'s ''Times History'', highly critical of British generalship during this period, later wrote of his "almost unbroken series of successes", showing grasp of tactics and skill at throwing every available man into battle at the exact right moment. Cavalry—often fighting dismounted—never made up more than half of his force, and were usually outnumbered three-to-one by Boer cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 80–81, 154&lt;/ref&gt; There were some accusations that French was a glory-hunter.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Roberts===
====Cavalry Division====
French was one of the few senior officers to be retained by Roberts.&lt;ref name=heath131/&gt; Roberts summoned French to Cape Town on 29 January to inquire about expenditure of horses and ammunition around Colesberg. The plan for the Relief of Kimberley, as the ''Official History'' later put it, "only incidentally disclosed" in the meeting. French came away with the impression that he had "only with difficulty persuaded (Roberts and Kitchener) on 29 January to send the Cavalry Division and himself in command of it". Given that he received written orders on 30 January, this is unlikely to have been the case, but French’s insecurity was increased by this turn of events—not only did he belong to the wrong faction in the Army—[[Wolseley ring|the followers of Wolseley and Buller]]—now in eclipse, but he had up until now been denied command both of the cavalry brigade in Natal and the Cavalry Division (instead being given ''ad hoc'' forces to command in both cases).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

French was affectionate about "dear old Bobs" but sometimes took a dim view of his military abilities. He correctly predicted that the centralisation of transport would lead to a collapse in supply arrangements.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p84"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; French disliked [[William Nicholson, 1st Baron Nicholson|Nicholson]], under whose control Roberts had centralised all transport, and retained autonomy for Cavalry Division transport.&lt;ref name=heath131/&gt;

Unlike Roberts, French and Haig believed that cavalry should still be trained to charge with cold steel as well as to fight dismounted with firearms. They appreciated the value of good colonial troops and trained Mounted Infantry, but had already (according to Haig's letter to his sister 8 December 1899) insisted that the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade|New Zealand Mounted Rifles]] fix bayonets to their carbines to use as lances, and were sceptical about the Colonial "Skallywag" units which Roberts was raising. Roberts also appointed the [[Charles Hay, 20th Earl of Erroll|Earl of Erroll]] as Assistant Adjutant-General (AAG) of the Cavalry Division, with Haig, to whom Buller had promised the job, as his deputy—French did his best to bypass Erroll and work through Haig.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January French returned to the Colesberg front to break up his old command, leaving Maj-Gen R.A.P. Clemens to cover the Colesberg area with a mixed force.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

====March to relieve Kimberley====
Kitchener ordered French (10 February) "The cavalry must [[Siege of Kimberley|relieve Kimberley]] at all costs … If it fails neither I nor [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|the Field Marshal]] can tell what the effect on the Empire may be".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; French promised Roberts (10 February) that if he were still alive he would be in Kimberley, where the civilian population was urging Colonel [[Robert Kekewich|Kekewich]] to surrender, in five days.&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2006, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

French’s Cavalry Division consisted of three cavalry brigades and two brigades of mounted infantry, although the latter did not accompany them when they broke camp at 3&amp;nbsp;am on 11 March—a separate provisional brigade of mounted infantry was provided instead. Roberts gave an inspirational speech to French’s brigade and regimental commanders. Rather than cross the [[Modder River]] directly (Kimberley lay around 25 miles north-east), they made an envelopment move: first over 20 miles south to Ramdam, then about 15 miles east to seize the [[Riet River]] Crossings, then about 25 miles (roughly north-north-east) to Klip Drift on the Modder, then another 20 miles north-west to Kimberley.  This was to be accomplished across arid land in five days, with much of the travel by moonlight as it was the middle of summer.  French carried only six days’ rations for the men and five days’ forage for the horses.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt;

The force left Ramdam at 2&amp;nbsp;am on 12 February, with only 4,000 horsemen rather than the 8,000 he had expected to have, but French felt he had to push on rather than wait for straggling units to catch up (the brigades’ staffs were all new, and brigadiers only joined their units in the course of the march). De Kiel’s Drift on the Riet was seized by mid afternoon—French ordered his cavalry to gallop for it as soon as he saw the way was clear—but the crossing was soon in what Haig called "an indescribable state of confusion" as Roberts had neglected to order priority for Cavalry Division baggage. Kitchener, arriving in the evening, ordered French to seize Waterval Drift, another crossing a few miles to the northwest where he had left a brigade masking a small Boer force under [[Christiaan de Wet|de Wet]]. Although this was done, the advance could not be resumed until 10.30am—with the sun high in the sky—on 13 February, and accompanied by five baggage wagons which had managed to get through the logjam at De Kiel’s Drift.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

====Klip Drift====
French’s division moved in line of squadron columns across a five-mile wide front, halting between 12.30 and 1&amp;nbsp;pm at the well at Blauuwboschpan, where he left a garrison to hold until the infantry arrived. He brushed aside a small Boer force (perhaps 300 men) which attempted to block his path to the Modder River, but concerned that he might be attacked from the east by de Wet’s main force, moved quickly at 2&amp;nbsp;pm to seize the crossings at Rondeval and Klip Drift (he aimed to at least threaten two crossings to avoid the delay which had happened at De Kiel's Drift). By 5&amp;nbsp;pm he was able to send a galloper to Roberts with the message that he was across the Modder. He had lost only three men wounded, although 40 horses had died of exhaustion and over 500 were incapable of further work. French then had to wait a day while [[Thomas Kelly-Kenny|Kelly-Kenny]]’s [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Infantry Division]] made a forced march from the Riet Crossings to the Modder Crossings, during which time [[Piet Cronje|Cronje]], believing French’s advance to be a feint, missed an opportunity to reinforce the area.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipped with three days' supplies, French resumed his advance at 9.30am&lt;ref&gt;Holmes gives this as 9.30''pm'', which appears to be an error. Pakenham 1979 p. 314 states that it was 9.30am&lt;/ref&gt; on 15 February. At Abon’s Dam, five miles north of the Modder, French sent his cavalry, supported by the fire of 56 guns, charging up a valley between two Boer held ridges. The charge was led by the [[9th Queen's Royal Lancers|9th]] and [[16th The Queen's Lancers|16th Lancers]]. The Boer riflemen, perhaps 600 in number, were able to achieve little at ranges of 1,000 yards.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Amery|Amery]]'s ''Times History'' later wrote "the charge at Klip Drift marks an epoch in the history of cavalry", arguing that French had "divined" that a cavalry charge made with "reckless, dare-devil confidence" could cut through a line of "unseen" enemy infantry who could have resisted a cautious attack by British infantry. The ''Official History'' called it "the most brilliant stroke of the war". He was also later praised by the cavalry writer [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]] and by the German history of the campaign, which cited Klip Drift as evidence that cavalry could still charge infantry armed with magazine rifles. These claims were exaggerated. French had attacked a thinly-held part of the line, under cover of artillery fire and dust clouds, inflicting only 20 Boer casualties to sword and lance (as opposed to 60 at Elandslaagte). French himself saw it as a triumph of the cavalry spirit rather than a charge with cold steel ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

French entered Kimberley at 6&amp;nbsp;pm on 15 February, and was entertained at the Sanatorium by [[Cecil Rhodes]], who soon persuaded him to relieve [[Robert Kekewich|Kekewich]], the military commander of the town. Holmes cites this as an evidence of French’s tendency to take against people based only on superficial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

French was congratulated by Roberts, and [[Queen Victoria]] praised the cavalry’s "brilliant success". For his success with the relief, French was promoted for distinguished service in the field on 21 February 1900, from substantive colonel to supernumerary [[Major-general (British Army)|major-general]], and to local [[Lieutenant-General (British Army)|lieutenant-general]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette | issue=27167 | date=20 February 1900 |page=1170 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although French was later criticised for attacking the Boers around Kimberley on 16 February, Roberts’ orders to pursue the retreating Cronje did not reach him owing to a cut telegraph line, and there is no evidence that Roberts made further efforts to contact him, although French [[heliograph]]ed to request orders.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paardeberg====
Orders to pursue Cronje were hand-delivered to French at 10&amp;nbsp;pm on 16 February. French had only 1,500 mounted men and 12 guns fit for duty after their recent exertions—one regiment recorded (17 February) that only 28 of its horses could "raise a trot"—but, setting out at 3&amp;nbsp;am on 17 February, he and Broadwood led an advanced guard on a forced march, twice as fast as Cronje’s force, to intercept them at 10&amp;nbsp;am as they tried to cross the Modder at Vendutie Drift (a distance of around 30 miles from Kimberley). Outnumbered three to one, and with another 2,000 Boers close by, French held his position long enough for the British infantry (6th and 9th Divisions) to catch up with Cronje’s army at Paardeberg.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 86, 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

French was too far away to interfere in the [[Battle of Paardeberg]], although he sent a message urging caution—Kitchener ignored this and launched a disastrous frontal assault (18 February). French spent the day holding off Boers who attempted to reinforce Cronje’s force.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 95–97&lt;/ref&gt; French also prevented the main Boer field army from escaping across the [[Modder River]] after the battle.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

====Poplar Grove====
Cronje at last surrendered his field army to Roberts on 27 February. On the morning of Klip Drift French had had 5,027 horses, but by 28 February exhaustion had reduced this number to 3,553. As Roberts prepared to advance on Bloemfontein, French was now (6 March) ordered to take his division and two Mounted Infantry Brigades and swing seventeen miles around the left flank of the Boer position at [[Battle of Poplar Grove|Poplar Grove]] on the Modder River, while Roberts’ main force prepared to attack them from the front. Although French now had 5,665 horses again, many of these were of poor quality and sick, and he was short of fodder (horses were entitled to 3&amp;nbsp;lb of fodder per day, less than half of what they were getting a month earlier). On the basis of incorrect information from Colonel Richardson, Director of Supplies, who had not realised that sick horses were also entitled to fodder, Roberts gave French a dressing-down in front of his brigadiers, for consuming too many supplies. This was probably a turning point in their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;

French led his men out of camp at 3&amp;nbsp;am on 7 March, amid confusion as Kelly-Kenny’s Division, which was supposed to follow his, had started an hour earlier owing to unclear orders. The moon had set and French had to halt between 5&amp;nbsp;am and 5.45&amp;nbsp;am to await daybreak. By 7&amp;nbsp;am he had reached Kalkfontein Dam, a march of 12 miles, and spent 45 minutes watering his horses. By 7.30am the Boers began to retreat from their position. Roberts later blamed French for failing to cut them off (and missing a chance to capture [[Paul Kruger|President Kruger]]). French argued that his horses were too weak to do more than trot, and that he was not strong enough as Kelly-Kenny’s men had not yet arrived. He concentrated his Division for a pursuit, but even then was beaten off by the Boer rearguard. The ''Official History'' supported French’s decision, although some felt that French was giving less than wholehearted co-operation after his unjustified public rebuke over the fodder issue. Holmes suggests that French carried out a plan in which he had no confidence because of Roberts' reputation for ruthlessness with unsatisfactory officers.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

French and Haig were sceptical about the riding abilities of Mounted Infantry, and felt that Roberts was wasting too many horses on them (Haig letter to his sister 16 March 1900) and that the cavalry had been "practically starving" since 11 February.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 85, 101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham 1979, pp. 374–75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bloemfontein]] fell on 13 March, and soon suffered an outbreak of typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In an implicit criticism of Roberts, French recorded (22 March 1900) that there "would be a grand opportunity for a great strategist at the head of affairs".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p84"/&gt; With Roberts’ main army immobilised by disease at Bloemfontein, de Wet was still active making raids around the British periphery. Roberts eventually (20 March) sent French with a single cavalry brigade and some guns and Mounted Infantry in a vain attempt to intercept Olivier’s column (numbering 6,000–7,000 men) at Thabanchu.&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham 1979, pp. 379–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p102-3"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 102–03&lt;/ref&gt; French made another raid to Karee Siding (29 March)—but until the middle of April he devoted most of his energies to inspecting the horses, many of them Argentinian, with which his division was being remounted.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p102-3"/&gt;

French was summoned to see Roberts (5 April 1900), who told him (5 April 1900) that the fighting at [[Battle of Poplar Grove|Poplar Grove]] proved that the future lay with Mounted Infantry. French wrote to Colonel Lonsdale Hale, former Professor at [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]], (12 April 1900) for speaking out for the idea of cavalry against the "chatter and cackle" of its opponents, quoting the opinion of a German officer that Mounted Infantry were too poor at riding to fight effectively.  French also clashed with [[Edward Hutton (British Army officer)|Edward Hutton]] (14 April) when he asked for French’s cavalry to be used to relieve his mounted infantry on outpost duty.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 102–03, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kroonstad====
On the march to Pretoria (early May 1900) French’s three brigades made up the left wing of Roberts’ main thrust. (Other thrusts were by Mahon and Hunter over the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] border, by Buller up from Natal and a semi-independent command under Hamilton, which might have been French’s had he not been out of favour.)  French lost another 184 of his still unacclimatised horses making— on Roberts’ orders —a forced march to the Vet River.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Botha was now making a stand along the [[Sand River (Free State)|River Zand]], in front of the Orange Free State’s temporary capital at [[Kroonstad]]. French was ordered to encircle Botha from the left, accompanied by Hutton’s Mounted Infantry, while Broadwood struck from the right.  Roberts over-ruled French’s wish to make a wide encirclement and ordered a shallower one—this lost the advantage of surprise, and Botha pulled his forces back so that French ran into strong resistance on 10 May.  Roberts now ordered French to pull back and make a deeper encirclement as he had originally proposed, with a view to cutting the railway behind Kroonstad.  However, French’s cavalry were now too tired, after an advance of forty miles, to achieve much, and Botha’s army escaped.  The ''Times History'' later praised French’s rapidity of movement but criticised him—unfairly in Holmes’ view—for failure to concentrate his forces.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 103–04&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transvaal====
Roberts halted in Kroonstad to repair the railway and refit between 12 and 22 May.  New horses arrived for French, but a third of them were unfit for action, and French and Hutton were only able to muster 2,330 effectives.  French and Hamilton were now sent to threaten Johannesburg from the left.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 104–05&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John French Vanity Fair 12 July 1900.JPG|right|thumb|French caricatured by GDG for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], July 1900]]

Roberts entered [[Johannesburg]] (31 May) and [[Pretoria]] (5 June), although without pressing Botha to a decisive battle in either case.  French correctly dismissed talk of victory as premature, and continued to spend much of his time inspecting remounts—the job of Director of Remounts at Stellenbosch had been given to an incompetent and manic depressive officer, who eventually shot himself.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; French played a key role at the victory over [[Louis Botha]] at [[Battle of Diamond Hill|Diamond Hill]] (11–12 June) in the north-east Transvaal.  French, leading one of his own brigades in the usual encircling movement, came under heavy fire—a medical major was shot at his side—but held his position despite Roberts’ permission to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-July French operated against de Wet’s guerrilla force around Pretoria, although he did not understand that this was an autonomous force, and advised Roberts that the best defence would be to continue to attack Botha’s main army. French was then recalled to take part in another attack on Botha’s army, but once again Roberts vetoed French’s proposal of a deeper encirclement (on the British right this time), allowing Botha’s army to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 106–08&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 1900 [[Reginald Pole-Carew (British Army officer)|Pole-Carew]], commander of 11th Division, refused to accept French’s orders.  French at first asked to be relieved of responsibility for Pole-Carew’s sector, but matters were patched up after what French described as a "somewhat stormy" meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barberton====
By August 1900 the Boer forces had been pushed into the northeast Transvaal.  French was holding a position beyond [[Middelburg]], maintaining moral ascendancy over the enemy by active probing and patrolling as he had around Colesberg earlier in the year.  Roberts’ plan was to push slowly eastward along the [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]] railway connecting Pretoria with the sea, while he ordered French to co-operate with Buller as he marched up from Natal.  French wrote (24 August) "We sadly want someone in Chief Command here". Roberts at first refused French permission to concentrate the Cavalry Division for an outflanking move towards [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]], an important Boer depot, and when he at last gave permission in late August Botha’s force had retreated too far to be encircled as French had intended.  Barberton is surrounded by 3,000 feet mountains, and French once again made a bold encircling move—first (9 September) south from the railway to Carolina, deceiving the Boer commandos that he intended to move southwest.  He then moved back, and personally led his 1st Cavalry Brigade up a bridle path through the mountains ready to attack Barberton from the west.  As soon as [[Henry Jenner Scobell|Scobell]], who had been sent around with two squadrons of the [[Royal Scots Greys|Greys]], heliographed that he had cut the railway, French led his men down into the town.  Scobell captured £10,000 in gold and notes, while French telegraphed to Roberts: "Have captured forty engines, seventy wagons of stores, eighty women all in good working order".  Boer sniping from the hills ceased after French threatened to withdraw his men and shell the town.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 108–10&lt;/ref&gt;

The war seemed over as Kruger left the country on 11 September 1900 (he sailed to the Netherlands from [[Mozambique|Portuguese]] [[Maputo|Lourenco Marques]] on 19 November 1900).&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p110-11"/&gt; French was promoted from supernumerary to substantive major-general on 9 October 1900, whilst continuing to hold the local rank of lieutenant-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27239|page=6416|date=19 October 1900|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under Kitchener===
====Johannesburg Area====
French’s colonials were sent home and replaced by regular Mounted Infantry. Roberts told French (31 October, 10 November) that the Cavalry Division was to be broken up, although he would retain "nominal command", and gave him command of [[Johannesburg]] Area, a triangle encompassing Johannesburg-Klerksdorp-Vereeninging.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p110-11"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November Roberts summoned French to discuss the question of cavalry armament.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p111"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 1900 [[Jan Smuts|Smuts]] and [[Koos de la Rey|de la Rey]] attacked a British force at [[Battle of Nooitgedacht|Nooitgedacht]]. On 17 December 1900 [[Pieter Hendrik Kritzinger|Kritzinger]] and Herzog invaded Cape Colony, hoping to stir up rebellion among the Cape Boers (who were legally British subjects).&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p110-11"/&gt; Although Kitchener had a paper strength of 200,000 men in early 1901, so many of these were tied down on garrison duty that French had only 22,000 men, of whom 13,000 were combatants, to fight 20,000 Boer guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham 1979, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1901, after three months campaigning, French’s eight columns had captured 1,332 Boers and 272,752 farm animals.&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham 1979, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; French was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27306 |date=19 April 1901 |page=2695 |nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his role in the conventional phases of the war (the award was dated 29 November 1900 and gazetted in April 1901, but French did not receive the decoration itself until an audience with King [[Edward VII]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 8 August 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36842| }}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p118"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cape Colony====
On 1 June 1901 Kitchener ordered French to take command in [[Cape Colony]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p112-4"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 112–14&lt;/ref&gt; He was ordered to use "''severity''" (italics in the original) against captured rebels—this was intended to complement lenient treatment for those who surrendered voluntarily. French (8 June) ordered the President of the Standing Court Martial to be ready to proceed "with the utmost rigour". [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Milner]] had already warned French at the time of the Colesberg operations (30 December 1899) not to treat every Cape Boer as a rebel unless it was proven so.  French, who had lost several friends during the war, believed that stern measures would help end matters more quickly.  On 8 July 1901 he gave short shrift for a deputation which sought clemency for some rebels sentenced to execution.  French even forced the inhabitants of Middelburg to watch one hanging, incurring a concerned inquiry from [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|St John Brodrick]] ([[Secretary of State for War]]), who was also vainly urging Kitchener to greater leniency.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p112-4"/&gt;

During this period of the war—conducting "drives" across the country for Boer guerrillas, and eventually dividing up the country with barbed wire and imprisoning Boer civilians in camps—French had to struggle with out-of-date information, and trying to maintain communications between British forces by telegraph, heliograph and dispatch rider.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 1, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Kritzinger was driven out of the Cape in mid-August 1901, and Harry Scobell captured Lotter’s commando (5 September 1901).  On 7 September Smuts defeated a squadron of Haig’s [[17th Lancers]] at [[Battle of Elands River (1901)|Elands River Poort]].  Gideon Scheepers was captured (11 October).&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p115"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relations with Kitchener====
French had a serious personality clash with the ascetic [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], worsened by both men’s obstinacy; French would later have a poor relationship with Kitchener during the First World War.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p84"/&gt; Although he had been unimpressed by his handling of [[Paardeberg]], he seems to have broadly welcomed his appointment as Commander-in-Chief, not least because he was not as opposed as Roberts to the "arme blanche". In August 1900 Kitchener praised French to the Duke of York (later [[George V|King George V]]) and wrote to Roberts that French was "quite first rate, and has the absolute confidence of all serving under him, as well as mine".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p111"/&gt;

Kitchener wrote to Roberts praising French for the capture of Lotter’s commando, but by 17 January 1902 he wrote to Roberts "French has not done much lately in the colony. I cannot make out why, the country is no doubt difficult but I certainly expected more." After meeting French at Nauuwport Kitchener recorded (14 February 1902) "he was quite cheerful and happy about progress made, though it appears to me slow". Ian Hamilton, now Kitchener’s chief of staff, wrote that French was "very much left to his own devices …he was one of the few men that Kitchener had trusted to do a job on his own".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 115–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener later wrote of French "his willingness to accept responsibility, and his bold and sanguine disposition have relieved me from many anxieties".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27459|page=4836|date=29 July 1902|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener wrote of him to Roberts: "French is the most thoroughly loyal, energetic soldier I have, and all under him are devoted to him—not because he is lenient, but because they admire his soldier-like qualities".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p119"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===The war ends===
Roberts (now [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]] in London) ordered French to convene a committee to report on cavalry tactics; French replied (15 September 1901) that he was consulting his regimental commanders, and accepted that cavalry should fight dismounted with firearms, but that they needed a new and better sword.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p155"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; French was appointed (23 October 1901) to command 1st Army Corps at Aldershot, in place of the disgraced Buller. French wrote to thank Roberts, to whose recommendation he guessed – correctly – that he owed the job, but also wrote to Buller, stressing that he had not been ''offered'' the position, but had been appointed to it by the King (i.e. suggesting that he had had little option but to accept).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

The report on cavalry tactics (8 November 1901) demanded an effective rifle for cavalry rather than the existing carbine, but only as a "secondary" weapon.  Roberts (10 November 1901) ordered cavalry to give up their steel weapons for the duration of the campaign, over the protests of French who argued that this was making the Boers tactically bolder.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p155"/&gt; In early November 1901 French, who was by now reliant on methodical operations and excellent Field Intelligence, was infuriated by Kitchener’s attempt to micromanage operations. In March French had expected the war to drag on until September 1902, but Kritzinger was captured in mid-November.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p115"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pakenham 1979, p. 526&lt;/ref&gt; French continued to lobby about cavalry tactics, agreeing (21 February 1902) with the Mounted Infantry expert Maj-Gen [[Edward Hutton (British Army officer)|Edward Hutton]] that it was "the bullet that kills" but that the important matter was "the moral power of cavalry".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p155-7"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 155–57&lt;/ref&gt;

The war ended at the start of June 1902, after over a month of negotiations. French was ordered to return home on the same ship as Lord Kitchener;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 116–17&lt;/ref&gt;
they returned to Southampton on 12 July 1902,&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p118"/&gt; and received an enthusiastic welcome with thousands of people lining the streets of London for their procession through the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Lord Kitchener′s return |day_of_week=Monday |date=14 July 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36819| }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the peace he was appointed a Knight Commander of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (KCMG) in recognition of his services in South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27490|page=6910|date=31 October 1902|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unusual award for a soldier. He also received honorary degrees from [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge Universities]] and the freedom of a number of cities and livery companies.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p118"/&gt;

In September 1902, French accompanied Lord Roberts and [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|St John Brodrick]], Secretary of State for War, on a visit to Germany to attend the German army maneuvers as guest of the Emperor Wilhelm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The German maneuvers|day_of_week=Friday |date=5 September 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36865| }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Edwardian period==
===Corps Commander, Aldershot===
French took office as Commander-in-Chief of [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|1st Army Corps]] at [[Aldershot Command]], from 15 September 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27477|page=6151|date=26 September 1902|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to permanent [[lieutenant general]] for distinguished service in the field on 31 October 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27490|page=6897|date=31 October 1902|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attracted the attention of [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] when he testified before the Elgin Commission.&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p59"&gt;Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Esher reported to [[Edward VII|the King]] (27 February 1903) that he regarded French as the outstanding soldier of his generation, both as a field commander but also as a thinker. However, [[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]] (Prime Minister) blocked French’s appointment to the [[Esher Report|Esher Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

French was proposed as a potential [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of Staff]] in 1903–04. Esher wrote "he has never failed" while [[John Arbuthnot Fisher|Admiral Fisher]]—who stressed French’s excellent record in South Africa, his skill as a judge of men, and his openness to army-navy operations—wrote "plump for French and efficiency", although with growing friction over war planning, Fisher hoped that French would be an ally in opposing Army plans for deploying an expeditionary force to Europe. French’s appointment was—to his relief, as he did not relish having to fight with [[H. O. Arnold-Forster|Arnold-Forster]] over his mooted reforms—vetoed by [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], who thought him too junior for the post.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 126–27&lt;/ref&gt; Esher pressed [[Neville Lyttelton]], who was appointed instead, to give French as free a hand as possible.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p124-5"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 124–25&lt;/ref&gt;

French had been insisting since January 1904 that, irrespective of what reforms the [[Secretary of State for War|War Secretaries]] Brodrick or Arnold-Forster were pushing through, I Corps should be the Army’s main strike force with at least one of its divisions kept up to strength for service overseas, and managed to force his view through the [[Army Council (1904)|Army Council]] in August 1904.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p124-5"/&gt; French may have privately shared the doubts which others had about his intellectual capacity, but [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] wrote of him that his grasp of strategy and tactics broadened, and, although naturally gregarious, he became more aloof and solitary as he prepared himself for high command.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904 French urged the adoption of the [[Ordnance QF 18-pounder|18 pounder field gun]] on Esher. He also recognised the importance of howitzers.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1904 Manoeuvres French commanded an "invasion force" which advanced inland from [[Clacton-on-Sea|Clacton]]—many horses and supplies were lost, which apparently persuaded French that an enemy would find it hard to invade Britain successfully.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p139"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1904 French won Fisher’s approval with a paper on the strategic importance of the Dardanelles.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p139"/&gt;

French threatened resignation unless his aide de camp Major Algy Lawson, who had not attended Staff College, was appointed Brigade-Major of the 1st Cavalry Brigade. He suspected a War Office plot led by the rising staff officers [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Henry Rawlinson]] and [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Henry Wilson]], whom at this stage he distrusted. Despite being advised by Esher that this was not a sufficiently serious matter to justify such obstinacy, French got his way (December 1904) by threatening to appeal to the King. He also got his way over a similar matter involving Esher’s son Lt Maurice Brett, who served as French’s ADC, and on this occasion did approach the King’s secretary (February 1905).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

French was given General Officer Commanding-in-Chief status at Aldershot on 1 June 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27822|page=5223|date=28 July 1905|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]] in 1905, possibly because of his willingness to consider amphibious operations including at various times, in the Baltic and on the Belgian Coast.  Philpott&lt;ref&gt;articles in "Journal of Strategic Studies" 12(1989) and 16(1993)&lt;/ref&gt; discusses French's significant influence on pre-war strategic planning.&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p56-7"&gt;Bond &amp; Cave 2009, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; He generally confined his advice to practical questions such as the difficulties of keeping horses at sea for long periods.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p139"/&gt; French had a poor regard for staff officers and had poor relations with the general staff.  At one meeting of the CID he became scarlet and speechless with rage while listening to Lyttelton proposing that Egypt could be defended by warships in the [[Suez Canal]].&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p135-6"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 135–36&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 1905 and 6 January 1906, as a result of the [[First Moroccan Crisis]], French was one of a four-man committee convened by Esher to discuss war planning: the options were purely naval operations, an amphibious landing in the Baltic, or a deployment of an expeditionary force to France.  At the second meeting French presented a plan for deployment to France or Belgium ten days after mobilisation, possibly mobilising on French territory to save time.&lt;ref&gt;On 12 January the committee discussed plans to deploy two corps, four cavalry brigades and two Mounted Infantry brigades to France. On 14 January, with the new Liberal Government [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|safely re-elected]], [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|the Prime Minister]] gave permission for the General Staff to conduct non-binding talks with France. At the final meeting on 19 January it was decided that despite France's preference for unified command, a British force should be "an independent body under the general control of the French commander-in-chief".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 139–41&lt;/ref&gt; Although French helped to draw up deployment plans as asked, it is not entirely clear from the surviving documents that he wholeheartedly supported such a commitment to France ("WF"—"With France"—as this scheme was known) until he was eventually persuaded by Henry Wilson, and he did not entirely rule out an amphibious landing in the Baltic.  He also maintained an interest in a possible deployment to Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

French generally had good relation with [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Haldane]], the new [[Secretary of State for War]], but lobbied him against cutting two Guards battalions (the Liberals had been elected on a platform of retrenchment).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1906 French told Major General [[James Grierson|Grierson]] (Director of Military Operations) that he was to be Commander-in-Chief of the BEF during the next war, with Grierson as his chief of staff. He had meetings with Grierson throughout March until the Moroccan crisis was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 138, 143&lt;/ref&gt; French told the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' (12 May 1906) that a force of trained volunteers would deter an enemy invasion.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p139"/&gt; In June 1906 French still believed that another war scare might come soon, and in July he attended French Army manoeuvres in Champagne, by which he was impressed, although he was less impressed by the Belgian Army. On this trip he was accused of giving unauthorised interviews to the French press, after uttering what Grierson called "a few platitudes" to the ''[[Le Figaro|Figaro]]'' correspondent.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p143"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Haldane confirmed to Esher (26 September 1906) that French was to be Commander-in-Chief of the BEF during the next war.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p138"&gt;Holmes 2004, p.138&lt;/ref&gt; He visited France unofficially in November 1906 in an attempt to improve his French, although he never became fluent in the language.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p143"/&gt; A Special Army Order of 1 January 1907 laid down that in the event of war Britain would send an Expeditionary force of six infantry and one cavalry division to assist the French.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; French was promoted to full general on 12 February 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27994 |supp=y|page=966|date=12 February 1907|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1907 he entertained General Victor Michel, French Commander-in-Chief designate, at Aldershot to observe British manoeuvres.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p144"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cavalry controversy===
French testified to the Elgin Commission that cavalry should be trained to shoot but that the sword and lance should remain their main weapons.  Hutton wrote to French (1 April 1903) that cavalry should retain some shock capacity but that the real issue was recruiting "professional" officers in place of the present rich and aristocratic ones. French strongly disagreed, although he remained on friendly terms with Hutton and recognised that the expense of being a cavalry officer deterred many able young men.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p155-7"/&gt; The Adjutant-General's memorandum (10 March 1903) recommended the retention of the sword—which Roberts had wanted replaced by an automatic pistol—but not the lance.  Roberts also chaired a conference on the topic six months later, at which Haig was the leading traditionalist. Haig's heavily traditional "Cavalry Training" appeared in 1904, leaning heavily on the 1898 Cavalry Drill Book which he had helped French to write, although with a "reforming" preface by Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a request from Arnold-Forster, French submitted a memorandum (7 March 1904) arguing that cavalry still needed to fight the old-fashioned way as a European War would begin with a "great cavalry battle".  He also sent a copy to [[Edward VII|the King]].  In response to Roberts’ claim that he wanted to give cavalry the ability to act independently, French wrote in the margin that the campaigns of early 1900 ''had'' seen cavalry acting independently, although he replied politely that their differences were not as great as Roberts seemed to think.  Roberts had the support of Kitchener (who thought cavalry should be able to seize and hold positions, but not to roam about the battlefield looking for enemy cavalry), but he was away as [[Commander-in-Chief, India]]. French was supported by [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] (Inspector-General of Cavalry), [[Francis Grenfell, 1st Baron Grenfell|Sir Francis Grenfell]] (who commented that he had not spoken to any junior officer who agreed with Roberts) and [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]]. In February 1905, after Roberts' removal as Commander-in-Chief, the Army Council authorised the publication of Haig’s "Cavalry Training" but without Roberts’ preface, although the lance was declared abolished as a weapon of war—a decision ignored by French, who allowed his lancer regiments at Aldershot to carry the lance in field training.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 158–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of the ''Cavalry Journal'' appeared in 1906, promoted by C.S. Goldman, an admirer of French. It was put on an official basis in 1911.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p160"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lieutenant General [[Friedrich von Bernhardi]]'s ''Cavalry in Future Wars'' was published in 1906, with a preface by French, repeating his arguments that cold steel gave the cavalry moral superiority, and that the next war would see an opening clash of cavalry. French also claimed that Russian cavalry in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] had come off worse as they were too willing to fight dismounted—this was the opposite of the truth.&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p54"&gt;Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt; The new edition of ''Cavalry Training'' in 1907 reaffirmed that cold steel was the main weapon of the cavalry.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p160"/&gt; However, at the end of the 1908 Manoeuvres French criticised cavalry’s poor dismounted work, and—to Haig’s annoyance—declared that the rifle was cavalry’s main weapon. He also noted that infantry lacked a doctrine for the final stages of their attack, as they closed with the enemy—something which was to prove a problem in the middle years of the Great War.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 162–64&lt;/ref&gt; The lance was formally reinstated in June 1909.  However, in his 1909 Inspection Report French again criticised cavalry’s poor dismounted work.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 160, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Although French believed that the "cavalry spirit" gave them an edge in action, his tendency to identify with his subordinates—in this case the cavalry, whose identity seemed under threat—and to take disagreements personally caused him to be seen as more of a reactionary than was in fact the case.  In the event, cavalry would fight successfully in 1914: the "cavalry spirit" helped them to perform well on the Retreat From [[Battle of Mons|Mons]], while they were still capable of fighting effectively on foot at [[First Battle of Ypres|First Ypres]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 154, 162, 164–65&lt;/ref&gt;

There was general agreement that the greater size of battlefields would increase the importance of cavalry. The publication of [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]]’ ''War and the Arme Blanche'' (1910) with a preface by Roberts went some way to reinstating the reformers’ case.  Childers argued that there had been only four real cavalry charges in South Africa, inflicting at most 100 casualties by cold steel, but acknowledged that French, "our ablest cavalry officer", disagreed with him.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 153–54, 162&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 1913 the Army Council decreed that Mounted Infantry would not be used in future wars and the two existing Mounted Infantry brigades were broken up.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspector-General of the Army===
After extensive lobbying by [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]], and with King Edward VII’s support, French was selected as Inspector-General of the Army in November 1907.&lt;ref name=heath132&gt;Heathcote, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 128–29&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment was announced on 21 December 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28092|page=8982|date=24 December 1907|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish MP [[Moreton Frewen]] demanded – apparently in vain – a Court of Inquiry into French's dismissal of his brother Stephen Frewen from command of the [[16th The Queen's Lancers|16th Lancers]] during the Boer War, pointing out to Haldane that French was "an adulterer convicted in a court of law", for which offence "[[William Ewart Gladstone|Haldane’s late chief]]" had "drum(med) [[Charles Stewart Parnell|his late chief]]" out of public life.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; French was also appointed a [[Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order]] in 1907.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

French openly opposed [[conscription]], thinking Roberts' demand for a conscript army to defend against German invasion "absurd".&lt;ref&gt;Esher journal, 24 November 1907&lt;/ref&gt;  He was generally supportive of the new [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], although he had some doubts about the effectiveness of Territorial Artillery.  In 1907–08 he sat on a CID committee to consider the risk of German invasion—it was decided to retain two divisions at home as a deterrent to invasion, until the Territorial Force was ready.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 131, 144&lt;/ref&gt; At the August 1908 manoeuvres, French's poor report ended the military career of [[Henry Jenner Scobell|Harry Scobell]], who commanded the Cavalry Division on the exercise, despite being well connected, a personal friend of French, and a successful commander from the South African campaigns.  French’s reports showed great interest in trenches, machine guns and artillery.  He also believed strongly that peacetime drill, both for infantry and for cavalry, was necessary to prepare men for combat discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp.129–30&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1908–09 French served on the "Military Needs of the Empire" sub-committee of the [[Committee of Imperial Defence|CID]], which reaffirmed the commitment to France in the event of war.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p144"/&gt; He was advanced to [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]] 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28263 |supp=y|page=4853|date=22 June 1909|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; French courted unpopularity with some infantry officers by urging a doubling in the size of infantry companies.  In the winter of 1909–10 he toured British troops in the Far East, and in the summer of 1910 he inspected the [[Canadian Army]], at the request of the Canadian Dominion administration.  He declined to express an opinion on the mooted introduction of conscription in Canada, replying that the existing system of voluntary recruitment had not been tested for long enough yet.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw the beginning of the feud between French and [[Horace Smith-Dorrien|Smith-Dorrien]], his successor at Aldershot with whom he had been on relatively cordial terms at the end of the Boer War. Smith-Dorrien annoyed French by insisting that cavalry improve their musketry, by abolishing the pickets which trawled the streets for drunken soldiers, by more than doubling the number of playing fields available to the men, by cutting down trees, and by building new and better barracks. By 1910 the feud was common knowledge throughout the Army. Smith-Dorrien, happily married to a young and pretty wife, also objected to French’s womanising.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 131–33&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John French, 1st Earl of Ypres.jpg|thumb|right|French in full ceremonial uniform as Aide-de-Camp to King George V in September 1911.]]
French was made an [[Aide-de-Camp General]] to [[George V|the King]] on 19 June 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28510|page=4934|date=4 July 1911|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Moroccan Crisis]] was occasion for French to push again for greater Army-Navy co-operation. [[Admiral Fisher]], recently retired as [[First Sea Lord]], wrote (20 August 1911) that French had been to see him "as the tool of [[Sir William Nicholson]]. I told him to go to Hell." On 23 August [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Henry Wilson]] carried a CID meeting with a lucid presentation of the Army’s plans for deployment to France; [[Arthur Wilson (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Wilson]]’s plans to land on the Baltic Coast were rejected. French spoke to the Navy Club that year on the need for co-operation between the two services.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p145"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The autumn 1911 manoeuvres were cancelled, supposedly because of shortage of water but in reality because of the war scare.  French accompanied Grierson and the French military attaché [[Victor Huguet]] to France for talks with [[Noël Édouard, vicomte de Curières de Castelnau|de Castelnau]], Assistant Chief of the French General Staff (Wilson—Director of Military Operations since August 1910—had already been over for talks in July). On the journey, French talked of how [[Charles W. H. Douglas|Douglas]] and [[Arthur Paget (British Army officer)|Paget]] would command armies under him in the event of war, with Grierson as chief of staff. Plans for British deployment were especially welcome as French war plans were in a state of flux, with [[Joseph Joffre|Joffre]] having been appointed commander-in-chief designate on 28 July.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; After his return from France in 1911 French inspected German cavalry manoeuvres in Mecklenburg, and was summoned from his bath to receive the [[Order of the Red Eagle]].  On presenting him with a signed photograph of himself [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|the Kaiser]] told him: "You may have seen just how long my sword is: you may find it just as sharp".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1912 French attended the annual staff conference at Staff College, and was impressed by the quality of the discussion. However, he lectured staff officers that they should not consider themselves the superiors of regimental officers, but that their job was to provide the commander with impartial advice and then endeavour to carry out his wishes.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p135-6"/&gt;

===Chief of the Imperial General Staff===
He became [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] ("CIGS"—professional head of the Army) on 15 March 1912 although he neither had staff experience nor had studied at Staff College.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; On his first day as CIGS (16 March 1912) he told his three directors ([[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]]—Director of Military Operations, [[Archibald Murray|Murray]]—Director of Military Training and [[Launcelot Kiggell|Kiggell]]—Director of Staff Duties) that he intended to get the Army ready for war. French was receptive to Wilson’s wishes to explore co-operation with Belgium (although in the end the Belgian Government refused to co-operate and remained strictly neutral until the outbreak of war).&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; French had initially been suspicious of Wilson as a Roberts protégé, but in 1906 had supported Wilson’s candidacy for Commandant of [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]]. By 1912 Wilson had become French’s most trusted adviser.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p145"/&gt; On 8 November 1912, with the [[First Balkan War]] causing another war scare, Wilson helped French draw up a list of key officers for the Expeditionary Force: Haig and Smith-Dorrien were to command "armies", Allenby the cavalry division, and Grierson was to be chief of staff.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p148"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1913 [[Charles à Court Repington|Repington]] wrote a series of articles in ''[[The Times]]'' demanding conscription for home defence. [[H.H. Asquith|The Prime Minister]] himself led the CID "Invasion Inquiry", on which French sat. The conclusions, which were not reached until early 1914, were that two divisions should be retained at home, reducing the size of the BEF. (French and Roberts had agreed with one another that one division would have sufficed.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p148"/&gt;)

In April 1913, French told Wilson that he expected to serve as CIGS (extending his term by two years) until 1918, and to be succeeded by Murray.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1913 King George V told [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|Seely]] that he was to make French a [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] in the next honours.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p138"/&gt; He received the promotion on 3 June 1913.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

French's efforts "to get the Army ready for war" were hampered by budgetary constraints, and he was unsuited by temperament or experience for the job. French caused controversy by passing over four generals for promotion in the autumn of 1913, and angered some infantry officers by forcing through the changes to infantry battalions so that they comprised four large companies commanded by majors rather than eight small companies commanded by captains. French lobbied Seely for an increase in pay and allowances for officers, to widen the social base from which officers were recruited—this was enacted from 1 January 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 136–38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1913 French, accompanied by Grierson and Wilson, again visited French manoeuvres in Champagne.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p149"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Army Manoeuvres of 1913|September 1913 Manoeuvres]] Repington wrote in ''The Times'' that French had found it difficult to defeat even a skeleton army.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p149"/&gt; Since 1904 French himself had to act as Director of the Annual Manoeuvres, so that although other officers had the chance to learn to handle divisions, he himself had little chance to learn to handle a force of ''several'' divisions. This lack of training may well have been factor in his poor performance in August 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The BEF senior officers (French, Haig, Wilson, Grierson and Paget who had replaced Smith-Dorrien by then) met to discuss strategy on 17 November 1913. In his diary Wilson praised "Johnnie French" for "hitting out" at the Royal Navy over their poor transport arrangements, but recorded his concerns at French's lack of intellect and hoped there would not be a war just yet.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p148"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2001, pp. 172–73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curragh incident===
====Plans for deployment====
With [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Irish Home Rule]] about to become law in 1914, the Cabinet were contemplating some form of military action against the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF) who wanted no part of it, and who were seen by many officers as loyal British subjects. In response to [[George V|the King]]'s request for his views (the King had also written to [[H.H. Asquith|the Prime Minister]]), French wrote (25 September 1913) that the army would obey "the absolute commands of the King", but he warned that some might think "that they were best serving their King and country either by refusing to march against the Ulstermen or by openly joining their ranks" although he stressed that he wanted to act firmly against dissidents within the army.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1913, in his memorandum "Position of the Army with Regard to the Situation in Ulster", French recommended that [[Wilfrid Spender|Captain Spender]], who was openly assisting the UVF, be cashiered "pour decourager les autres".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p169"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

With political negotiations deadlocked and intelligence reports that the Ulster Volunteers (now 100,000 strong) might be about to seize the ammunition at [[Carrickfergus Castle]], French only agreed to summon [[Arthur Paget (British Army officer)|Paget]] ([[Commander-in-Chief]], Ireland) to London to discuss planned troop movements when [[J.E.B. Seely|Seely]] ([[Secretary of State for War]]) repeatedly assured him of the accuracy of intelligence that UVF might march on Dublin.  French did not oppose the deployment of troops in principle but told Wilson that the government were "scattering troops all over Ulster as if it were a Pontypool coal strike".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 173–75&lt;/ref&gt;

At another meeting on 19 March French told Paget not to be "a bloody fool" when he said that he would "lead his Army to the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]]", although after the meeting he resisted lobbying from [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|Robertson]] and [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] to advise the Government that the Army could not be used against Ulster.  That evening French was summoned to an emergency meeting at 10 Downing Street (he was requested to come in via the garden, not the front door) with Asquith, Seely, [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] (First Lord of the Admiralty), [[Augustine Birrell|Birrell]] ([[Chief Secretary for Ireland]]) and Paget, where he was told that [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Carson]], who had stormed out of a Commons debate, was expected to declare a provisional government in Ulster.  French was persuaded by Asquith to send infantry to defend the artillery at [[Dundalk]], and by Seely that a unionist coup was imminent in Ulster.  No trace of Seely's intelligence survives.  Seely reassured French, who was worried about a possible European war, that "large mobile forces of the Regular Army" would not be sent to Ireland unless needed, but he was sure that Ulster would support Britain in that event.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 176–78&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peccant paragraphs====
The result was the [[Curragh incident]], in which [[Hubert Gough]] and other of Paget's officers threatened to resign rather than coerce Ulster.  French, advised by [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Haldane]] ([[Lord Chancellor]]) told the King (22 March) that Paget should not have asked officers about "hypothetical contingencies" and declared that he would resign unless Gough, who had confirmed that he would have obeyed a direct order to move against Ulster, was reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp.183–84&lt;/ref&gt;

French suggested to Seely that a written document from the [[Army Council (1904)|Army Council]] might help to convince Gough's officers.  The Cabinet text stated that the Army Council were satisfied that the incident had been a misunderstanding, and that it was "the duty of all soldiers to obey lawful commands", to which Seely added two paragraphs, stating that the Government had the right to use "the forces of the Crown" in Ireland or elsewhere, but had no intention of using force "to crush opposition to the Home Rule Bill".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 1848&lt;/ref&gt; Gough insisted on adding a further paragraph clarifying that the Army would not be used to enforce Home Rule "on Ulster'", to which French added in writing "This is how I read it. JF CIGS". He may have been acting in the belief that the matter needed to be resolved quickly after learning from Haig that afternoon that all the officers of Aldershot Command would resign if Gough was punished.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 188–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Asquith publicly repudiated the "peccant paragraphs" (25 March).  Wilson, who hoped to bring down the government, advised French to resign, as an officer could not be seen to break his word, even at the behest of politicians.  Asquith at first wanted French to stay on as he had been "so loyal and well-behaved", but then changed his mind despite French drawing up two statements with Haldane, claiming that he had been acting in accordance with Haldane's statement in the House of Lords on 23 March.  Seely also had to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 190–92&lt;/ref&gt; French resigned on 6 April 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28819|page=3002|date=7 April 1914|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Results====
French had been made to look naive and overly-friendly to the Liberal government.  Most officers were Conservative and Ulster Unionist sympathisers, but, with a few exceptions (Kitchener and Wilson's party sympathies were well known), took pride in their loyalty to the King and professed contempt for party politics.  French was thought by [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]] to be a "hot Liberal".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p167-9, 192-4"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 167–69, 192–94&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914, he was a personal friend of the Liberal ministers [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Jack Seely]]&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p59"/&gt; and was friendly to Seely when the minister's first wife died in childbirth in August 1913.  Meanwhile, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] wrote "French is a trump, and I love him".  After 1918 French became a Home Ruler, but at this stage he simply thought his duty to be ensuring that the Army obeyed the government's orders.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p167-9, 192-4"/&gt;

As far back as 20 April 1913, Wilson recorded his concerns that French's friendship with Seely and unexpected promotion to Field Marshal were bringing him too close to the Liberals.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p169"/&gt; Throughout the affair French resisted pressure from Wilson to warn the government that the Army would not move against Ulster,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 180–81&lt;/ref&gt; and he had an acrimonious telephone conversation (21 March) with Field Marshal [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Roberts]] in which he was told that he would share the blame if he collaborated with the Cabinet's "dastardly" attempt to coerce Ulster;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 181–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reid 2001, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; French for his part blamed Roberts for stirring up the Incident.&lt;ref name=heath132/&gt; [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]], who had written of French (22 March 1914) that he was "too much in the hands of the politicians", approved of his resignation, as did [[Howell Arthur Gwynne|H.A. Gwynne]], who throughout the crisis had pressed French to tell the Cabinet that the Army would not coerce Ulster, and [[Godfrey Locker-Lampson]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]].&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p192-4"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 192–94&lt;/ref&gt;

While sorting out some papers for his successor [[Charles W. H. Douglas|Charles Douglas]] French told Wilson (3 April) that Asquith had promised him command of the BEF in the event of war, although nobody realised how quickly this would come.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Margot Asquith wrote that he would soon be "coming back", suggesting that Asquith may have promised to appoint French Inspector-General. Churchill described him as "a broken-hearted man" when he joined the trial mobilisation of the fleet in mid-July.  French was still seen as a potential Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, although even in early August French himself was uncertain that he would be appointed.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p192-4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heath133&gt;Heathcote, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commander-in-Chief, BEF==
===1914: BEF goes to war===
====Mobilisation and deployment====
The "Precautionary Period" for British mobilisation began on 29 July, the day after Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. French was summoned by [[Charles W. H. Douglas|Sir Charles Douglas]] ([[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]]) and told (30 July) he would command the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF).&lt;ref name=lh/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp196-8"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 196–98&lt;/ref&gt; There was no other serious candidate for the position.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p203"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; He was first briefly re-appointed Inspector-General of the Army (1 August).&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28860|page=6072|date=4 August 1914|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir John spent much of 2 August in discussions with French Ambassador [[Paul Cambon]].&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp196-8"/&gt; British mobilisation began at 4&amp;nbsp;pm on 4 August.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp199-201"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 199–201&lt;/ref&gt; Until Germany invaded Belgium it was unclear whether Britain would join in the war, but she did so at midnight on 4 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-the-world-went-to-war-in-1914|title=How The World Went To War In 1914|author=Talarico, Jessica|publisher=Imperial War Museums|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French attended the War Council at 10 Downing Street (5 August), and there presented the War Office plans (drawn up by [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]]) to send the BEF to [[Maubeuge]], although he also suggested that as British mobilisation was lagging behind France's it might be safer to send the BEF to [[Amiens]] (also the view of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] and Lt.-General [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]]). French also suggested that the BEF might operate from [[Antwerp]] against the German right flank, similar to schemes which had been floated in 1905–06 and reflecting French's reluctant acceptance of the continental commitment.  This suggestion was dropped when Churchill said the Royal Navy could not guarantee safe passage.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp196-8"/&gt; Kitchener, believing the war would be long, decided at Cabinet (6 August) that the BEF would consist of only 4 infantry divisions (and 1 cavalry); French believing the war would be short, demanded 5 infantry divisions but was over-ruled at another War Council that afternoon. Embarkation began on 9 August.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp199-201"/&gt;

On 12 August, French, [[Archibald Murray|Murray]], Wilson and the French liaison officer Victor Huguet met at French's house at Lancaster Gate and agreed to concentrate at Maubeuge, and after another meeting with Kitchener (who had had an argument with Wilson on 9 August—given Wilson's influence over French this served to worsen relations between French and Kitchener), who still preferred to concentrate further back at Amiens, they left to obtain the Prime Minister's agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

French crossed to France on 14 August.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp199-201"/&gt; President [[Raymond Poincaré|Poincaré]], meeting French on 15 August, commented on his “quiet manner … not very military in appearance” and thought that one might mistake him for a plodding engineer rather than a dashing cavalry general.  French told Poincare that he would not be ready until 24 August, not 20 August as planned.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman 1962, p240&lt;/ref&gt; French also met [[Adolphe Messimy|Messimy]] (French War Minister) and [[Joseph Joffre|Joffre]] (16 August).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 205–06&lt;/ref&gt; Sir John's orders from Kitchener were to co-operate with the French but not to take orders from them, and given that the tiny BEF (about 100,000 men, half of them regulars and half reservists) was Britain's only army, to avoid undue losses and being exposed to "forward movements where large numbers of French troops are not engaged" until Kitchener had had a chance to discuss the matter with the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands 2006, pp. 275–76&lt;/ref&gt;

====Clash with Lanrezac====
[[Image:General Sir John French in Paris, Bain photograph.jpg|thumb|left|Field Marshal French (left) in Paris]]
The [[Siege of Liège]] ended when the last of the Belgian fortresses fell on 16 August and most of the remaining Belgian troops were soon [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|besieged in Antwerp]], opening Belgium to the German advance.  Previously ardent and bombastic, French became hesitant and cautious, giving different answers about the date when the BEF could be expected to begin operations in the field.&lt;ref name="Cassar 1985, p. 94"&gt;Cassar 1985, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuchman, p. 242-3"&gt;Tuchman, pp. 242–43&lt;/ref&gt;

At his meeting with Joffre (16 August) French had been advised to hurry up and join in Lanrezac's offensive, as he would not wait for him to catch up.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
French met General [[Charles Lanrezac]], commanding the [[Fifth Army (France)|French Fifth Army]] on his right, at Rethel (17 August)—they were met by Lanrezac's Chief of Staff Hely d'Oissel, with the words: "At last you’re here: it’s not a moment too soon.  If we are beaten we will owe it to you". They conferred in private despite the fact that Lanrezac spoke no English and Sir John could speak little French, Wilson being eventually called over to translate.  French asked whether the German advance forces spotted at Huy would cross the Meuse River (a reasonable question, as a westward crossing of the Meuse exposed the BEF to encirclement from the west)—his inability to pronounce the name "Huy" caused Lanrezac to exclaim in exasperation that the Germans had probably "come . . . to fish"; French understood the tone but not the meaning, and Wilson tactfully translated that the Germans would indeed cross the river.  French informed Lanrezac that his forces would not be ready until 24 August, three days later than promised.  The French cavalry under [[André Sordet]], which Sir John had previously asked Joffre in vain to be placed under his command, were further north trying to maintain contact with the Belgians.  Sir John, concerned that he had only four infantry divisions rather than the planned six, wanted to keep Allenby's cavalry division in reserve and refused Lanrezac's request that he lend it for reconnaissance in front of the French forces (Lanrezac misunderstood that French intended to use the British cavalry as mounted infantry).  French and Lanrezac came away from the meeting with a poor relationship.  At the time French wrote in his diary that Lanrezac was "a very capable soldier", although he claimed otherwise in his memoirs ''1914''.  Besides their mutual dislike he believed Lanrezac was about to take the offensive, whereas Lanrezac had in fact been forbidden by Joffre to fall back and wanted the BEF moved back further to clear roads for a possible French retreat.&lt;ref name="Cassar 1985, p. 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuchman, p. 242-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 208–11&lt;/ref&gt;

French's friend General [[James Grierson|Grierson]], GOC [[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II Corps]], had died suddenly on the train near Amiens and French returned to GHQ on 17 August, to find that Kitchener had appointed Lieutenant General [[Horace Smith-Dorrien|Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien]] to command, knowing that French disliked him, rather than [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Plumer]] (French's choice) or [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Hamilton]] (who asked for it).&lt;ref name="Tuchman, p. 242-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 208–09&lt;/ref&gt;

Spears arrived at GHQ (21 August) and reported to Wilson (French was out visiting [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]]) that Lanrezac did not want to leave his strong position (behind the angle of the Rivers Sambre and Meuse) and "had declaimed at length on the folly of attack". [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Holmes]] believes French was receiving very bad advice from Wilson at this time, in spite of good air and cavalry intelligence of strong German forces. French set out for Lanrezac's HQ (22 August) but by chance met Spears on the way, who told him that Lanrezac was in no position to attack after losses the previous day at the  [[Battle of Charleroi]], which Sir John did not quite believe and that Lanrezac was out at a forward command post.  Brushing aside Spears' arguments that another meeting with Lanrezac would help, French cancelled his journey and returned to GHQ; "relations with Lanrezac had broken down", writes Holmes, because Sir John saw no point in driving for hours, only to be insulted once again in a language he did not quite understand.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp212-5"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 212–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spears 1930, pp. 136–37&lt;/ref&gt;

French was then visited again over dinner by Spears, who warned him that the BEF was now {{convert|9|mi|km}} ahead of the main French line, with a gap of {{convert|5|mi|km}} between the British right and Lanzerac's left, exposing the BEF to potential encirclement. Spears was accompanied by [[George Macdonogh]], who had deduced from air reconnaissance that the BEF was facing three German corps, one of which was moving around the BEF left flank, (only three French territorial divisions were to the left of the BEF; Sordet's French cavalry corps was on its way to the British left but its horses were exhausted).  Sir John cancelled the planned advance. Also that evening a request arrived from Lanrezac, that the BEF attack the flank of the German forces which were attacking Fifth Army, although he also—contradicting himself—reported that the BEF was still in echelon behind his own left flank, which if true would have made it impossible for the BEF to do as he asked. French thought Lanrezac's request unrealistic but agreed to hold his current position for another 24 hours.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp212-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mons====
Despite the events of the previous evening, French had—perhaps under the influence of Henry Wilson—reverted to the belief that an advance might again be possible soon.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; French's and Smith-Dorrien's accounts differ about the conference at 5.30&amp;nbsp;am on 23 August. French's account in his memoirs ''1914'' stated that he had become doubtful of the advance and warned his officers to be ready to attack or retreat, which agrees largely with his own diary at the time, in which he wrote that he had warned Smith-Dorrien that the Mons position might not be tenable. When ''1914'' was published, Smith-Dorrien claimed that French had been "in excellent form" and had still been planning to advance. However, in his own memoirs Smith-Dorrien admitted that French had talked of either attacking or retreating, although he claimed that it had been he who had warned that the Mons position was untenable.  Edmonds in the "Official History" agreed that French had probably been prepared either to attack or to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 215–16&lt;/ref&gt;

French at first believed that the German attacks at [[Battle of Mons|Mons]] were merely trying to "feel" the British position and drove off to Valenciennes to inspect a French brigade. On his return he sent a letter to Lanrezac in which he talked of resuming the attack the following day.  Wilson had "calculated" that the BEF was faced only by one German corps and a cavalry division, and was allowed to draw up orders for an attack the next day. Although Macdonogh warned that the BEF was faced by at least two German corps, French did not cancel the planned advance until a message from Joffre (7&amp;nbsp;pm) warned that he was faced by at least three German corps, although he still ordered Smith-Dorrien to try to hold his ground. At midnight Spears arrived with the news, which disgusted Sir John, that Lanrezac was falling back, and the French [[Third Army (France)|Third]] and [[Fourth Army (France)|Fourth]] Armies were also falling back after being defeated at Virton and Neufchateau. Murray summoned the Corps Chiefs of Staff at around 1&amp;nbsp;am on 24 August and ordered them to retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 216–18&lt;/ref&gt; Even after Mons, French still thought that a deeper Allied thrust into Belgium would have disrupted the German advance.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp212-5"/&gt;

Von Kluck sent [[Georg von der Marwitz|von der Marwitz]]'s [[II Cavalry Corps (German Empire)|II Cavalry Corps]] (3 cavalry divisions) around the British west flank to prevent a British retreat on the Channel ports. Sir John French sent a message (24 August), with an unmistakable tone of pique, to Lanrezac, which Spears insisted on writing down, warning that the BEF might have to retreat southwest towards Amiens on its lines of communication, although it is unclear that this would actually have been practicable if the Germans had actually been moving in force around the British left flank.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sir John agreed to Joffre's request that the BEF, now numbering 5 divisions as it had been joined by the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Infantry Division]], would instead fall back on Cambrai if it had to, so that the BEF could still protect the French left flank. Joffre also sent a further two French reserve divisions to the British left flank, the beginning of the redeployment of French forces which would see [[Michel-Joseph Maunoury|Maunoury]]'s [[Sixth Army (France)|Sixth Army]] form around Amiens and then fight near Paris. French considered, but rejected, the option of sheltering the BEF in the fortified town of Maubeuge, partly out of instinct that the Germans were hoping to tempt him into allowing himself to be besieged there and partly because he remembered that Edward Hamley had likened [[François Achille Bazaine|Bazaine]] allowing himself to be [[Siege of Metz (1870)|besieged in Metz]] in 1870 to a shipwrecked man taking hold of the anchor.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 218–20&lt;/ref&gt; French himself issued no direct written orders between 11.15&amp;nbsp;pm on 21 August and 8.25&amp;nbsp;pm on 24 August; Terraine argued that this, along with his absence during the battle of Mons (although on the German side [[Alexander von Kluck|von Kluck]] also played little direct role in the battle), marks the point when he and GHQ began to disengage from active command of the BEF, leaving Smith-Dorrien and Haig in effective control of their corps.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, pp. 80, 101–02&lt;/ref&gt;

===1914: Retreat to the Marne===
====Le Cateau====
GHQ moved back from Le Cateau to St Quentin on 25 August.&lt;ref name="Terraine 1960, p125"&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; French had a long discussion with Murray and Wilson (25 August) as to whether, the BEF should stand and fight at Le Cateau, a position which had been chosen for ''both'' I and II Corps to hold after they had retreated on either side of the Forest of Mormal. II Corps had been harried by German forces as it retreated west of the forest and Wilson and Murray were concerned about the risk of encirclement from the left. Sir John did not agree but wanted to fall back as agreed with Joffre, and hoped that the BEF could pull out of the fight altogether and refit behind the River Oise. Besides concern for his men, he was also worried that he was exposing his small force to the risk of destruction which Kitchener had forbidden. Wilson issued orders to Smith-Dorrien to retreat from Le Cateau the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 220–22&lt;/ref&gt;

French was awakened at 2&amp;nbsp;am on 26 August with news that Haig's I Corps was under attack at Landrecies, and ordered Smith-Dorrien (3.50&amp;nbsp;am) to assist him.  Smith-Dorrien replied that he was "unable to move a man".  This angered French as he was, at that time, fond of Haig. French was woken from his sleep again at 5&amp;nbsp;am with the news that Smith-Dorrien had decided to stand and fight at [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]], as the Germans would otherwise be upon him before he had a chance to retreat. Insisting that the exhausted Murray not be woken, French telegraphed back that he still wanted Smith-Dorrien to "make every endeavour" to fall back but that he had "a free hand as to the method", which Smith-Dorrien took as permission to make a stand. French's diary and memoirs omit mention of this telegram.  Sir John also sent a message to Lanrezac at 5&amp;nbsp;am, asking him to assist Haig (on Smith-Dorrien's right), which he agreed to do, although in the event his help was not needed.  On waking properly, French ordered Wilson to telephone Smith-Dorrien and order him to break off as soon as possible. Wilson ended the conversation by saying "Good luck to you. Yours is the first cheerful voice I've heard in three days."&lt;ref name="Terraine 1960, p125"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 222–23&lt;/ref&gt;

French and his staff believed that the Cavalry Division had been completely destroyed at Le Cateau (it had in fact suffered no more than 15 casualties) and that 5th Division had lost nearly all its guns, destroying II Corps as a fighting unit (in fact units reassembled after the retreat).&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; French later (30 April 1915) told Haig that he should have had Smith-Dorrien court-martialled after Le Cateau.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 223–25&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs French later claimed that Smith-Dorrien had risked destruction of his corps and lost 14,000 men and 80 guns (actual losses of each were around half of this number).&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p223"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has also been argued that the vigorous defensive action at [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]] relieved the pressure and allowed the troops to re-organise, gather up their supplies, and make a fighting withdrawal.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

On the morning of 26 August, while the Battle of Le Cateau was in progress, Sir John had a hostile meeting with Joffre and Lanrezac at St Quentin.  This meeting, held at Joffre's insistence, was the second and last time Sir John met Lanrezac, who attended only reluctantly.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; He complained of Lanrezac's behaviour, to which Lanrezac "merely shrugged" and gave a vague and academic reply.  Joffre talked of his ''Instruction Generale No 2'' which talked of a new [[Sixth Army (France)|French Sixth Army]] forming around Amiens, but although this had been received by GHQ during the night French had not been shown it (Holmes blames Wilson, who had taken charge of the staff as Murray had had a complete collapse). French insisted that he must retreat further, although he agreed to press Kitchener to send the remaining British division bringing the BEF up to six infantry divisions, to France rather than to Belgium.  Joffre stayed for lunch (Lanrezac declined to do so), at which the atmosphere improved as he confessed that he too was dissatisfied with Lanzerac.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp.225–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman 1962, p351&lt;/ref&gt; Joffre was surprised at the "rather excited tone" in which Sir John criticised Lanrezac, unlike his calm demeanour of a few days' earlier, and came away deeply concerned at the obvious personal friction between French and Lanrezac, but also at Sir John's reluctance to stand and fight.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, pp. 130–31&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Retreat====
GHQ fell back to Noyon (26 August).  Huguet reported to Joffre (10.15&amp;nbsp;pm on 26 August) that the British had been defeated at [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]] and would need French protection to recover cohesion; he also reported that although the BEF's fighting spirit was undaunted, the British ''Government'' might order the BEF to retreat to Le Havre.  Colonel Brecard, another liaison officer attached to the British staff, reported that two out of the five British divisions were destroyed and that, in Wilson's view, the BEF would need a week to refit.  Sir John warned Huguet that there would be "bitterness and regret" in England over British losses, and Joffre, who had decided to order an attack by Fifth Army to take the pressure off the BEF, visited Sir John at Noyon on 27 August and gave him a message congratulating the BEF for its efforts protecting Fifth Army's flank.  In fact Smith-Dorrien's staff were making intense efforts to hold II Corps together, although at a meeting (held at 2&amp;nbsp;am on 27 August, as Smith-Dorrien had found GHQ's present location with great difficulty) French accused him of being overly optimistic.  GHQ moved back to Compiegne on 28 August, although Sir John was able to visit his troops on the march for the first time since 25 August, telling men who were resting on the ground of Joffre's message.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, pp. 146, 148–49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

French refused Haig permission to join in an attack by Lanrezac, who wrote of French's "bad humour and cowardice".  Even Spears felt Sir John was in the wrong here.  The BEF also did not join in Lanrezac's attack on German Second Army at [[Battle of St. Quentin (1914)|Guise]] (29 August).  Joffre, who had spent the morning with Lanrezac, was concerned by rumours that the BEF might retreat towards the Channel Ports.  He visited French in the afternoon, urging him to hold his place in the line promising that [[Battle of Gumbinnen|Russian successes]] would soon allow the Allies to attack.  However, French insisted that his forces needed 48 hours of absolute rest, and Murray, whom Joffre noticed had been tugging at French's tunic throughout this, then showed an intelligence report of the strength of the German forces facing the BEF.  After Joffre had departed in bad humour, French received an incorrect report that Fifth Army was falling back behind the Oise, and issued orders for the BEF to fall back to Rethondes-Soissons; when he received fresh reports that the French were holding their positions after all he replied that it was too late to cancel his orders.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 227–28&lt;/ref&gt; Sir John's opinion of Lanrezac was so low that he did not believe reports of his success at [[Battle of St. Quentin (1914)|Guise]] (29 August) until he had sent [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|Seely]] to interview the French corps commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, pp. 161, 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

The BEF was doing little fighting on 29 August and on 30 August had no contact with the enemy at all, and on that day [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]] ([[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]] and [[19th Light Brigade (United Kingdom)|19th Infantry Brigade]]) became operational under [[William Pulteney (British Army officer)|Pulteney]]. On 31 August the BEF engaged in only a few minor cavalry skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Losses had indeed been high by Boer War standards, and Sir John, believing them to be greater than they were, and that the Kaiser was making an especial effort to destroy the BEF, believed he was carrying out the "letter and spirit" of Kitchener's instructions to avoid undue loss without Cabinet authority.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p231"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meeting with Kitchener====
Spears later wrote of French's coolness and calmness on 30 August, although he also recorded that French no longer took much interest in matters unless they directly impinged on the BEF.&lt;ref name="Hastings 2013, p292"&gt;Hastings 2013, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless a few hours after a meeting with Joffre, Sir John telegraphed him that the BEF would have to leave the line entirely and retreat behind the Seine for up to ten days to refit, tracing supply from St Nazaire and moving the forward base to Le Mans rather than Amiens. Kitchener heard of these plans from the Inspector-General of Communications, and when he demanded an explanation (Sir John's previous messages had been optimistic) French sent a long telegram (31 August) saying he had told Joffre that the BEF was unable to remain in the front line and that he wanted the BEF to move back behind the Seine, and that would take eight days if done at a pace which would not fatigue the troops unduly. He  added (contradicting himself somewhat) that he would have preferred Joffre to resume the offensive, but that Joffre was giving the BEF's inability to join in as a reason for not doing so.  He thought that the French Army had "defective higher leading".&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, pp. 161, 164, 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p.229&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August Sir John received messages from Joffre and [[President Poincare]] (relayed via Bertie, the British Ambassador) asking him not to withdraw. Joffre pointed out that the Germans were already [[Battle of Tannenberg|shifting forces to the East]]. Kitchener demanded further details, and after showing French's previous message to the Cabinet telegraphed again warning that it was the manner and length of the retreat which concerned the Cabinet. Sir John then replied that the "shattered condition" of II Corps had reduced his offensive capability and that the BEF could not withstand an attack by so much as a single German corps. He wrote: "I do not see why I should again be called upon to run the risk of absolute disaster in order a second time to save (the French)." He also argued that the best solution would be for the French to counterattack and so "close the gap by uniting their inward flanks", although he agreed to halt at Nanteuil, which he expected the BEF to reach the following day, if the French halted their own retreat. Kitchener, authorised by a midnight meeting of whichever Cabinet Ministers could be found, left for France for a meeting on 1 September.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hastings 2013, p292"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

They met, together with [[René Viviani|Viviani]] (French Prime Minister) and [[Alexandre Millerand|Millerand]] (now French War Minister). Huguet recorded that Kitchener was "calm, balanced, reflective" while Sir John was "sour, impetuous, with congested face, sullen and ill-tempered". On [[Francis Bertie, 1st Viscount Bertie of Thame|Bertie]]'s advice Kitchener dropped his intention of inspecting the BEF. They moved to a separate room, and no independent account of the meeting exists. French admitted that Kitchener had taken exception to his tone, and that he had assured him that this was simply in his mind. In his diary Sir John wrote "we had rather a disagreeable time. I think K found he was making a mistake". In ''1914'' French later claimed that he had told Kitchener that although he valued his {{em|advice}} he would not tolerate any interference in his executive authority so long as he remained in command, and that they "finally came to an amicable understanding". Terraine dismisses as absurd Sir John's later claims that he resented being called away from GHQ (given that no battle was in progress, and that he had played little directing part in either of the two battles fought so far), and that an inspection of the BEF (by Kitchener, Britain's most celebrated soldier at the time) might have disheartened the men by the implied challenge to French's authority. Terraine suggests that Sir John was more anxious to prevent Kitchener from inspecting the BEF as he might have seen for himself that they were less "shattered" than he claimed, and that Haig and Smith-Dorrien might have criticised him if given a chance to speak privately to Kitchener. After the meeting Kitchener telegraphed the Cabinet that the BEF would remain in the line, although taking care not to be outflanked, and told French to consider this "an instruction". French had a friendly exchange of letters with Joffre.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 231–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, pp. 170, 172–73&lt;/ref&gt;

French had been particularly angry that Kitchener had arrived wearing his Field Marshal's uniform. This was how Kitchener normally dressed at the time, but French felt that Kitchener was implying that he was his military superior and not simply a cabinet member.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Tuchman argued that French was particularly conscious of this, as he was known for his own quirks of dress.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; At Asquith's behest Churchill attempted to act as mediator, exchanging letters with French (4 September), who replied that Kitchener was "a fine organiser but he never was and he never will be a Commander in the field". By the end of the year French thought that Kitchener had "gone mad" and his hostility had become common knowledge at GHQ and [[Grand Quartier Général (1914–1919)|GQG]]. In ''1914'' French claimed that Kitchener had come to Paris to try to stop him retreating, which was untrue—it was the manner of the retreat, without consultation with Britain's allies, which was the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 234–36&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September, while French and Kitchener were meeting, the British fought [[Action at Néry|a small engagement at Néry]]. The gap between I and II Corps was finally closed for the first time since 25 August, but GHQ had to be evacuated from Dammartin in a hurry under threat from German cavalry, [[Nevil Macready|General Macready]] being left behind in the confusion and [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|General Robertson]] having to hastily wrap up in newspaper a leg of mutton he had been about to eat.&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, pp. 175–76&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sir John agrees to fight====
French was pleased at Lanrezac's dismissal (3 September), thinking at first that he had been arrested, and his [[Military Secretary (United Kingdom)|Military Secretary]] reported to the King that "the fat pompous political general" had been sacked. [[Louis Franchet d'Espèrey|Franchet d'Esperey]], Lanzerac's successor, immediately sent a telegram to Sir John signed "Franchet d'Esperey [[Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]]" promising co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

On return to GHQ, now at Melun, from visits to troops, including a talk with Haig who agreed with him that the troops needed rest and replacements (4 Sep) he found his staff had agreed to two plans. Murray had been visited by Gallieni (Military Governor of Paris) and [[Michel-Joseph Maunoury|Maunoury]] ([[Sixth Army (France)|French Sixth Army]], and currently under [[Joseph Gallieni|Gallieni]]'s command) and had drawn up plans for an attack suggested by them.  Wilson, on Sir John's orders, had travelled to meet Franchet d'Esperey and had agreed to the plan which became the basis for Joffre's ''Instruction Generale No 6''.  Gallieni was still planning, with Joffre's initial agreement, to attack south, not north, of the Marne, so the result of Murray's orders was that the BEF should fall back another day's march, putting it 15 miles south of where Joffre wanted it to be for his new plan.  Sir John at first intended to study the situation before making up his mind.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 237–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, pp. 186–87&lt;/ref&gt;

Joffre sent a copy of his plan to GHQ and asked Millerand to lobby the British Government.  Hearing at last that Sir John was willing to co-operate, Joffre arrived for a meeting with French at (2&amp;nbsp;pm on 5 September).  According to Spears' account, he explained his plan (in French), ending by clasping his hands together tightly enough to hurt them and begging "''Monsieur le Maréchal, c'est la France qui vous supplie''" ("Field Marshal, France is begging you").  Sir John listened with tears rolling down his reddening cheeks and, unable to find the words in French, replied "Damn it, I can't explain.  Tell him that all that men can do our fellows will do".  When Murray protested that the BEF could not be ready as soon as Joffre hoped, Joffre replied that Sir John's word was good enough for him.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp238-9"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 238–39&lt;/ref&gt; Joffre and Gamelin recorded Joffre's words slightly differently in their memoirs, as: "''il y a que l'honneur de l'Angleterre''" ("the honour of England (sic) is at stake"),&lt;ref&gt;Hastings 2013, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; but Spears' account more closely matches the contemporary diaries of Wilson and Clive, and so is in Prete's view more likely to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;Prete 2009, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Although Joffre had dealt tactfully with Sir John (he later claimed in his memoirs that his visit to Melun had simply been to congratulate Sir John on his willingness to co-operate&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;), at a time when he sacked three of his own army commanders (including Lanrezac), ten corps commanders, and thirty-eight divisional commanders— Neillands writes that "one cannot help wonder" whether French would not have suffered the same fate had he reported directly to Joffre.&lt;ref&gt;Neillands 2006, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Joffre believed at the time that the BEF were technically under his orders and that French's uncooperativeness was because the British government were too weak to insist that he obey orders.  French was conscious that he was Joffre's senior in rank and had more combat experience.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp202-3"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 202–03&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marne and Aisne====
The BEF advanced to take part in the [[First Battle of the Marne]] on the morning of 6 September, Sir John's mood marred by a telegram from Kitchener urging him to co-operate with Joffre.  This was the result of Joffre's appeal to Millerand, and Joffre repaired the damage by praising the performance of French and the BEF to Kitchener.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp238-9"/&gt; The BEF began its advance from 20&amp;nbsp;km behind where Joffre had wanted it.  Franchet d’Esperey, to the right of the BEF, was repeatedly demanding a quicker advance, and at 3.30pm Sir John ordered Haig (I Corps, on the BEF right) to resume his advance, but by nightfall Haig was still 12&amp;nbsp;km away from his objective, having lost only 7 men killed and 44 wounded.  The BEF advanced further on 7 September. [[Lord Ernest Hamilton]] recorded that “in the strict sense there was no battle … the fighting … was desultory”. [[John Charteris|Charteris]], Haig’s intelligence adviser, thought the advance “absurdly slow” and noted that the cavalry moved ''behind'' the infantry.  When the BEF reached the Petit Morin on 8 September, Marwitz’s German cavalry broke off and retreated further, only for the BEF to halt because of a heavy thunderstorm.  Joffre urged that it was “essential” that the BEF advance further.  By 8 September, despite outnumbering the enemy by 10:1, the BEF had advanced just 40&amp;nbsp;km in three days.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig 2009, p252-4&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September Sir John, arriving on the spot in person, ordered I Corps to halt as soon as they had reached the main road, a mere 5 miles from the river (at midday Haig, who had halted for four hours after crossing the river after seeing aerial reconnaissance of German forces opposite him, probably Ilsemann’s [[5th Cavalry Division (German Empire)|5th German Cavalry Division]], not [[IX Corps (German Empire)|IX Corps]] baggage train as he believed, had just given orders to resume the advance). This prevented I Corps from taking Kraewel’s detachment from the east flank, which would have helped II Corps, which had halted after encountering a mixed brigade at Montreuil-sur-Lions, and was now fighting uphill through woods. On the left Pulteney’s engineers did not have enough pontoons to cross the Marne (70–90 metres wide), and by nightfall half of [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]]’s battalions crossed on a makeshift floating bridge. The cavalry ([[2nd Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|"Gough’s Command"]] on the left flank, [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby]]’s [[1st Cavalry Division (United Kingdom)|1st Cavalry Division]] on the right, each maintaining contact with the adjacent French forces) was in [[Hew Strachan]]’s words “entirely out of the equation”.  Sewell Tyng notes that the BEF had “exercised no effective intervention” in the battle and “remained no more than a threat which was never translated into decisive action”, although Herwig points out that the men were exhausted after the long retreat, that the French cavalry performed no better and yet the advance – into the gap between the German [[1st Army (German Empire)|First]] and [[2nd Army (German Empire)|Second]] Armies – had a decisive effect on the German commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig 2009, p.292-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senior 2012, p.301-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir John initially thought (14 September) that the enemy was only "making a determined stand" on the [[First Battle of the Aisne|Aisne]].  He urged the importance of entrenching wherever possible (23 September) and stressed (25 September) that heavy artillery would be necessary going forward.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 240–41&lt;/ref&gt;

===1914: Autumn battles===
====Race to the Sea====
After lobbying by Churchill, who was keen to bring the Channel Ports under British control, and by Wilson, French lobbied Joffre (27 September) for the BEF, which was less heavily gunned and more mobile than a similarly-sized French Army, to disengage and try to move around the Allied left flank, part of the outflanking movements known as the [[Race to the Sea]]. Joffre agreed in principle, although he had private doubts about having no French troops between the BEF and the sea and later came to believe that this move had, by using up scarce rail capacity for ten days, prevented him from reinforcing Lille and had allowed the Germans to capture it.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 241–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout September and October 1914 French warned Kitchener that his forces were running dangerously short of shells, at one point being rationed to 20 rounds per gun per day.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; French was impressed by the first 9.2-inch howitzers, but very conscious of German artillery superiority, and wrote to Kitchener (24 September) "[[Krupp]] is our most formidable enemy at present".  French took a keen interest in the development of mortars and grenades, although during his time as Commander-in-Chief more were produced at the BEF's own workshops than in the UK.  He also pressed the War Office for more machine guns, believing that a battalion needed at least six or seven (as opposed to two at the start of the war).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 256–58&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|opened fire on the Antwerp outer forts]] (28 September) and over the opposition of French and Joffre the [[7th Division (United Kingdom)|British 7th Division]] was earmarked for Antwerp (1 October) instead of for the BEF. [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]]'s force at Antwerp was not placed under Sir John's command until 9 October, but managed to escape to the southwest the following day.  French, who did not get on with Rawlinson, was once again suspicious that Kitchener was attempting to usurp operational control of the BEF.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 242–43&lt;/ref&gt;

After a temporary stay in Abbeville for five days, GHQ was established in St Omer (13 October) where it was to remain for the rest of French's tenure.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p.243&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to help shore up the Belgian line on his left French said (16 October 1914) "he would be d-----d if he would be dictated to by [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]] who had better mind his own business".&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp145-6"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp. 145–46&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Ypres====
French had thought in mid-October of establishing an "entrenched camp" large enough to hold the entire BEF around Boulogne, but was soon persuaded by Foch and Wilson to move around the German flank towards Roulers, rebuking Rawlinson, his command now numbered [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]], for failing to take Menin (18 October). The following day he ordered Rawlinson to move on Menin (SE of Ypres) and Haig's I Corps to move on Roulers (NE of Ypres), despite reports that there were at least 3 ½ German corps facing Haig. Sir John had believed the Germans were running out of men (19 Oct), but instead the BEF ran into German forces also trying to turn the Allied flank.  At a meeting on 21 October Joffre refused ("his face instantly became quite square") to lend him enough men to construct a fortified camp around Boulogne; Joffre instead ordered a French corps (under d'Urbal, whom French was pleased to find was "the old [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] type of beau sabreur") to the BEF's left, and French ordered the BEF to hold its positions.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 244–46&lt;/ref&gt;

French at first reported to Kitchener that the German attacks by [[4th Army (German Empire)|Fourth]] and [[6th Army (German Empire)|Sixth]] Armies were their "last card" and the BEF were holding them off.  He was unimpressed by Smith-Dorrien telling him (midnight on 25 October) that his Corps "might go during the night", although he did send reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 246–47&lt;/ref&gt; Generals [[George Macdonogh|Macdonogh]] and [[Percy Radcliffe (British Army officer)|Radcliffe]] later testified to the Official Historian [[James Edward Edmonds|Edmonds]] in the early 1920s that French "believed what he wished to believe" and "never could believe that the Germans were not at their last gasp".  He thought "everything was going splendidly" and "the Germans were exhausted" until warned of the arrival of German reinforcements, at which point he (allegedly) grew angry and banged his fist on the table shouting "How do you expect me to carry out my campaign if you carry on bringing up these blasted divisions?"&lt;ref name="Robbins 2005, p70"&gt;Robbins 2005, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich von Falkenhayn|Falkenhayn]] now ordered a new attack south of Ypres, between Gheluveld and Ploegsteert Wood, by "Army Group Fabeck".&lt;ref&gt;"Army Group" in this context means an ''ad hoc'' force roughly the size of an Army, not a group of Armies&lt;/ref&gt; IV Corps was broken up (27 October) and Rawlinson and his staff sent home to supervise the arrival of [[8th Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]].  French still expected to attack, turning the German western flank, on 29 October, and even after the Germans had pressed I Corps hard SE of Ypres that day (he later claimed in ''1914'' to have realised that the BEF could now do no more than hold its ground, but he in fact issued orders for the flanking attack to go ahead on 30 October).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 247–48&lt;/ref&gt; Sir John supervised the arrangement of reinforcements from Smith-Dorrien and Dubois' French corps to Haig's and Allenby's hard pressed forces at Ypres (30 October). Once again, the British planned to counterattack, but French was roused from his sleep (12.30&amp;nbsp;am on 31 October) by Foch, who warned him that his staff had spotted a gap in the British lines at Hollebeke Chateau; Foch advised him to "hammer away, keep on hammering" and promised to send a further 8 French battalions and 3 batteries.  Sir John spent the crisis day of 31 October visiting Allenby and Gough, and was with Haig when they learned that a single battalion of the Worcesters had retaken Gheluveld ("The Worcesters saved the Empire" French later wrote).  He then met Foch at the town hall at Ypres to warn him that he had no more reserves apart from "the sentries at his gate"—the next day (1 November) Haig's I Corps held its ground, with cooks, grooms and drivers pressed into the line, and aided by French counterattacks which drew off German reserves.  The line stabilised, although there was a final day of crisis on 11 November.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 249–53&lt;/ref&gt;

The fighting at [[First Battle of Ypres|Ypres]], the last before major trenching began, destroyed the last of the original BEF.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Since the outbreak of war the BEF had suffered 90,000 casualties, 58,000 of them in October and November, compared to an initial infantry strength (the first seven divisions) of 84,000.  Of those who had landed in August, an average of one officer and thirty men per battalion remained.  French was particularly disturbed at the lack of company commanders, and extremely reluctant to send trained officers and NCOs home to train the New Armies.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 253, 256&lt;/ref&gt;

====Possible dismissal====
Sir John was unable to get away during the Battle of Ypres to attend the Dunkirk conference (1 November) between Kitchener and Joffre, Foch and Millerand.  There Kitchener offered to replace French with [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Ian Hamilton]], but Joffre declined, saying this would be bad for BEF morale and he worked "well and cordially" with Sir John.  Foch told Wilson of this (5 November).  French sent Captain Freddy Guest to complain to the Prime Minister, who refused to believe it, and both Asquith and Churchill wrote French reassuring letters.  French went to see Foch (6 November) to thank him for his "comradeship and loyalty".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp253-6"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 253–56&lt;/ref&gt; This did not stop him writing to Kitchener (15 November) that "''au fond'', they are a low lot, and one always has to remember the class these French generals come from".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp202-3"/&gt; French talked of inciting [[Howell Arthur Gwynne|H.A. Gwynne]] to start a press campaign against Kitchener.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp. 139–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Over lunch (21 November) Haig noted that French looked unwell—French told him he thought he had had a heart attack and had been ordered to rest by his doctors.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp253-6"/&gt; [[George V of the United Kingdom|The King]] visited France (30 November&amp;nbsp;–5 December) and passed on his concerns that the Germans were about to invade Britain with 250,000 men, a rumour which French assumed to have been concocted by Kitchener.  French's aides made inquiries—apparently in vain—about an increase in "table money" (expenses for entertaining visiting dignitaries) on top of his official salary of £5,000 per annum.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 258–60&lt;/ref&gt;

====End of 1914====
In late November and early December the Germans [[10th Army (German Empire)|moved forces to the East]], and French [[Battle of Łódź (1914)|expected the Russians to defeat them soon]]. In December he offered limited assistance to French attacks, out of affection for Foch and fear that Joffre would otherwise complain to Kitchener, and despite his concerns that the ground on Smith-Dorrien's front was too wet.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp260-1"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 260–61&lt;/ref&gt; Foch said of French (8 December 1914) "How he likes to cry, this Baby".&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp145-6"/&gt;

The Foreign Office (9 December) formally asked the French government for the BEF to move to the coast where it could co-operate with the Royal Navy and the Belgian Army, but this was rejected by Millerand on Joffre's advice, and Foch regarded the plan "with the greatest contempt", although on a visit to GHQ (11 December) he found Sir John only mildly in favour. A German counterattack (20 December) mauled the [[I Corps (British India)|Indian Corps]], who could not handle the cold, so badly that they had to be pulled into reserve.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp260-1"/&gt;

French was still dissatisfied with [[Archibald Murray|Murray]]'s performance as BEF Chief of Staff, but Asquith and Kitchener (20 December) forbade him to replace Murray with Wilson.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp266-8"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 266–68&lt;/ref&gt; The BEF was split into Haig's [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] ([[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I]], [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV]] and [[I Corps (British India)|Indian Corps]]) and Smith-Dorrien's [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] ([[II Corps (United Kingdom)|II]] and [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]] and [[27th Division (United Kingdom)|27th Division]]), effective 25 December. Allenby's [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]] and [[Michael Rimington|Rimington]]'s [[Indian Cavalry Corps]] continued to report directly to French.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p. 265"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Chantilly Conference (27 December 1914) French agreed with Joffre that the British Cabinet was mad. They discussed the relative merits of shrapnel and high-explosive shell, and events on the Eastern Front. Joffre told Sir John of his plans for twin offensives at Arras and Rheims in 1915, the former offensive to be assisted by the BEF, and then a further thrust towards the Rhine from Verdun and Nancy. He agreed that the British could take over line up to the coast but only as further reinforcements arrived, which would not be until much later in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 253–56, 260–61, 268&lt;/ref&gt;

===1915: Neuve Chapelle===
====Deployment of the New Armies====
French had hoped to incorporate the Belgian Army into the BEF, but [[Albert I of Belgium|the King of the Belgians]] vetoed this (2 January). French instead demanded that the [[Kitchener's Army|New Armies]] be sent out as battalions and incorporated into existing units (perhaps with battalions combining to form regiments like in continental armies). All the senior commanders agreed that to have the New Armies fighting under their own inexperienced division and corps staff would be folly.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp262-5"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 262–65&lt;/ref&gt;

French was further irritated by an "incomprehensible" letter from Kitchener (2 January) stating that no more troops should remain on the Western Front than were necessary to hold the line, and seeking GHQ's views as to which other theatres British troops should be redeployed.  French replied that given sufficient resources he could break the German front, that to attack Turkey would be "to play the German game" and that he preferred an advance into Serbia via Salonika, or preferably an attack to clear the Belgian Coast, and that if Russia collapsed the government would have no choice but to send all available troops to France.  French also had Murray hand-deliver a copy of this letter to the Prime Minister, earning French a rebuke from Kitchener for not using the normal channels of communication.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp262-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Groot 1988, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

The War Council (7–8 January) discussed French's demand that 50 Territorial or New Army battalions be sent to France, but in the face of Kitchener's strong opposition it was agreed instead to examine the possibilities of other fronts. French, having sent Wilson and Murray on ahead to raise support, himself lobbied the War Council (13 January), informing them that he was stockpiling ammunition, expected only 5,000–8,000 casualties in his forthcoming offensive, and that the Germans were short of manpower and would have reached the end of their resources by November 1915.  Although he expected Joffre's offensives in 1915 to be successful, he "relied on the Russians to finish the business".  Kitchener agreed, but the War Council was then swayed by Churchill arguing for an attack on the Dardanelles, and it was agreed to send French only two Territorial Divisions by mid February.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp262-5"/&gt;

The mooted Flanders Offensive was then cancelled altogether after further lobbying of Kitchener by Joffre and Millerand, who visited England especially to demand that the BEF instead take over more French line.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p. 265"/&gt; Sir John agreed (15 January), as soon as he was reinforced, to relieve two French corps north of Ypres to allow Joffre to build up French reserves for his own offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was sent off sick for a month (24 January) and French demanded his resignation, despite Murray insisting that he only needed to take a few days off. Robertson replaced him.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp266-8"/&gt;

====Argument with Joffre====
Sir John believed (13 February) that the Russian withdrawals were "only a strategic move" designed to overextend the Germans. He ordered Haig to prepare for an attack at [[Battle of Aubers Ridge|Aubers Ridge]], rather than an attack by Smith-Dorrien at Messines-Wytschaete Ridge, as he had more confidence in both Haig and his troops than he had in Smith-Dorrien. GHQ then learned (16 February) that Joffre wanted [[Louis de Maud'huy|de Maud'huy]]'s [[Tenth Army (France)|French Tenth Army]] to attack at Vimy, with which attack Haig was ordered to co-ordinate his efforts.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp269-71"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 269–71&lt;/ref&gt;

At the War Council (9 February) French learned that the regular [[29th Division (United Kingdom)|29th Division]] was to be sent to Salonika rather than to France as he had been promised.  Joffre wrote a letter of complaint (19 February) that the BEF might not be carrying out Sir John's promise to take over more line; in reply French summoned the liaison officer Victor Huguet to complain of Joffre's claims that the British had ''demanded'' French participation in the offensive and that they had more men per mile of trench than the French did (much of the French front, as Sir John pointed out, required smaller garrisons as it was of less tactical importance or rougher terrain).&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp269-71"/&gt;

Sir John complained (21 February 1915) that Joffre "treated him like a corporal", although he thought the French "gloriously brave".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp202-3"/&gt; When he had calmed down he sent Robertson and Wilson to smooth things over with Joffre, writing that Joffre's rude letter had probably been written by "some upstart young French staff officer".  Even so  Joffre was angered by French's formal reply (23 February) and thought that he ought to be able to carry out the planned relief as he was receiving the [[46th (North Midland) Division|46th (Territorial) Division]].  Haig visited de Maud'huy (28 February) and learned that he would be lending only limited artillery support to the offensive.  Joffre told GHQ (7 March) that the offensive must be postponed.  Millerand wrote to Kitchener to complain, enclosing another letter of complaint from Joffre. Kitchener (3 March) forwarded both letters to Sir John, along with a letter of complaint of his own (which French described as "might be written by an old woman … silly trash").&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp269-71"/&gt; Joffre thought French (6 March 1915) a "liar" and "a bad comrade".&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp145-6"/&gt;

====Neuve Chapelle====
[[File:Mentioned in despatches.jpg|thumb|Official notice of "[[mentioned in dispatches]]" by French for a soldier in the [[Motor Machine Gun Service]] for gallantry at the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]]. Signed by Churchill who was [[Secretary of State for War]] in 1919 when the citation was issued.]]

French genuinely hoped for a breakthrough at [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle|Neuve Chapelle]] (10–12 March 1915) and personally briefed the cavalry commanders Allenby and Rimington beforehand, although, aware of the effect of modern firepower on cavalry, he cautioned Rimington against getting too close to the enemy. He believed that victory would prove to Kitchener that British efforts should be concentrated on the Western Front, and that it would be merely a prelude to a much larger Battle of Lille. French moved to a forward headquarters at [[Hazebrouck]] during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 272–74&lt;/ref&gt;

A renewed attack was planned for 22 March, but French was told by Lieutenant-General Maxwell (QuarterMaster General) that sufficient shell was available only for a bombardment half the intensity of Neuve Chapelle, and he was warned by du Cane of defective fuses causing guns to explode (14 March).  To some extent the shell shortage was an excuse, as French was also critical of planning errors in First Army's attack.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p.275&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener told Asquith (18 March) that French was "not really a scientific soldier; a good capable leader in the field, but without adequate equipment and expert knowledge for the huge task of commanding 450,000 men."&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p.291&lt;/ref&gt;

French's almost daily letters to his mistress in 1915 reveal his wish to see Kitchener sacked, his concern at lack of High Explosive shells, his ambivalent relations with the French (although sympathetic at the political interference which French generals suffered), his anger (shared with many other Western Front generals) at the way scarce men and shells were being sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], and his belief that the German advance into Russia in 1915 would ultimately fail; he hoped that Germany would sue for peace by the summer of 1915 or spring 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 278–80&lt;/ref&gt;

===1915: Aubers Ridge and Shells Scandal===
====Strategic and tactical debates====
Joffre once again (24 March) renewed negotiations for an Anglo-French offensive in Artois, and once again asked Sir John to relieve the two French corps north of Ypres. He agreed to do so by 20 April, prior to another attack by Haig's First Army. It was still unclear whether or when New Army divisions would be deployed to France.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

French was rebuked by the King for an interview with the [[Havas]] News Agency (24 March), in which he had warned that the war would be long ([[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Northcliffe]] warned him that this would encourage "slackers" at home).  French wrote to Northcliffe (25 March) thanking him for his view that efforts should be concentrated on the Western Front rather than dissipated to other fronts as Kitchener wanted. French gave an interview to ''The Times'' (27 March) calling for more ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 289–90&lt;/ref&gt;

French breakfasted with Kitchener (31 March) who told him that he and Joffre were "on ... trial" over the next five weeks, and that the Allied governments would reinforce other theatres unless they made "substantial advances" and "br[oke] the German line".  There were rumours in both British and French circles, probably baseless, that Kitchener coveted French's job for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; French also objected (2 April 1915) to rumours that Joffre was trying to put the BEF under Foch's command.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp145-6"/&gt;

A GHQ Memorandum (4 April) on the lessons of Neuve Chapelle emphasised registration of artillery.  The French had achieved better results at Vimy by a long and methodical bombardment. French and Kitchener discussed ammunition (14 April).&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp285-7, 293"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 285–87, 293&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1915 the BEF had grown to 900,000 men in 28 divisions.&lt;ref name=heath133/&gt;

====Second Ypres====
French continued to be dissatisfied at Smith-Dorrien's grip on his army and in March was concerned that the rate of sickness was running at three times the rate in Second Army as in First.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp283-4"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 283–84&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans [[Second Battle of Ypres|attacked]] (22 April) ground which Smith-Dorrien had recently taken over from the French, using poison gas, causing some French units to break on the British flank. Sir John spurred on Smith-Dorrien in costly counterattacks, but thought the French had made "a horrible mistake" and "Joffre … really deceived me" in holding the line so thinly.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p282-4"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 282–84&lt;/ref&gt; French was angry (26 April 1915) that French troops had broken under German gas attack, commenting that French troops had also failed to hold their positions in the retreat of 1914.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp145-6"/&gt; Smith-Dorrien suggested withdrawing to the so-called "GHQ Line". French privately agreed, but was angered that the suggestion came from Smith-Dorrien. Plumer was the given responsibility for the Ypres Salient (27 April).&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p282-4"/&gt; Smith-Dorrien was finally relieved of command of [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] (6 May).&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp283-4"/&gt;

====Aubers Ridge====
On 2 May French, who appears to have persuaded himself that a short sharp bombardment might work once again, assured Kitchener that "the ammunition will be all right", a declaration which Kitchener passed on to Asquith. This caused Asquith to claim in a public speech that there was no munitions shortage in the BEF.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp285-7, 293"/&gt;

The attack at [[Battle of Aubers Ridge|Aubers Ridge]], against stronger German positions, (9 May) failed. French watched the battle from a ruined church and attributed the failure to lack of HE shelling ("it's simple murder to send infantry against these powerfully fortified entrenchments until they've been heavily hammered" he wrote to his mistress). He returned to GHQ to find an order to send shells to Gallipoli, although after protest replacement shells were sent from the UK within days.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp285-7, 293"/&gt;

Fighting still continued at Ypres, and Sir John was under pressure from Joffre to renew the attack at Aubers Ridge. Although he would have preferred (10 May) to stand on the defensive until more High Explosive was available, he agreed to Joffre's pressure to take over more French line and renew the attack.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p293"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; Haig also (11 May) favoured a "long methodical bombardment".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p293"/&gt;

====Shells Scandal====
[[File:French and Asquith at British GHQ 1915.jpg|thumb|right|Sir John French, and the British prime minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], at BEF Headquarters in June 1915.]]
After Aubers Ridge [[Charles a Court Repington|Repington]] sent a telegram to ''The Times'' blaming lack of High Explosive shell, which despite being heavily censored by [[George Macdonogh|Macdonogh]] was printed after [[Brinsley Fitzgerald]] assured him Sir John would approve. French had, despite Repington's denial of his prior knowledge at the time, supplied Repington with information, and Fitzgerald and Freddy Guest were sent to London to show the same documents to Lloyd George and the Opposition leaders Bonar Law and Balfour. Repington's article appeared in ''The Times'' (14 May 1915). Kitchener wrote to French that day that Repington should not be allowed out with the Army, to which French replied that Repington was a personal friend and he (French) "really ha(d) no time to attend to these matters".&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 287–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener, reluctant to deploy the volunteer New Armies to the Western Front, wired French (16 May 1915) that he would send no more reinforcements to France until he was clear the German line could be broken,&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; although at the end of May he agreed to send two divisions to keep Joffre happy.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p293"/&gt; [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] wrote of French at this time to his uncle the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]]: “I don’t think he is particularly clever and he has an awful temper” (23 May 1915).&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman 1962, p197&lt;/ref&gt; Another offensive at [[Battle of Festubert|Festubert]] began on the night of 15–16 May and dragged on until 27 May. Some ground was gained (1,000 yards over a 3,000 front) and the Germans had to rush in reserves. French was still optimistic that with sufficient High Explosive a breakthrough for cavalry could be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Whigham|Whigham]] (BEF Sub-Chief of Staff) "was very sick as (at French's behest) he had to cancel &amp; then rewrite his orders" (Wilson Diary 27 May 1915).&lt;ref&gt;Robbins 2005, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shell Crisis of 1915|Shells Scandal]] contributed to the fall of the Liberal Government. Although French's involvement was widely rumoured, many, including the Prime Minister, refused to believe it. At the time [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] and others thought a clique of people were acting in what they believed to be French's interests; [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]] and [[William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne|Lord Selbourne]] suspected French's American friend George Moore.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker 2012, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; French later claimed in ''1914'' that he had leaked information to Repington to "destroy the apathy of a Government which had brought the Empire to the brink of disaster". By the time he wrote ''1914'' he had come to regard Asquith and Haig as responsible for his removal at the end of 1915, but at the time French was still on good terms with Asquith and wrote to him (20 May 1915, the day before the ''Daily Mail'' attacked Kitchener, and whilst Asquith was forming his new coalition government) urging him "as a friend" to sack Kitchener. Holmes believes French's object was to bring down Kitchener rather than the whole government.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 287, 291–92&lt;/ref&gt;

===1915: Loos and resignation===
====Planning Loos====
[[File:F.M. Sir John French, Commander in Chief, in France (Photo 24-309).jpg|thumb|right|French, photographed in August 1915]]
Joffre often wrote to Kitchener complaining about French.  [[Sidney Clive]] noted (6 June 1915) that meetings between French and Joffre could be counterproductive as "the former is irritable &amp; the latter silent" and that it was best if their staffs agreed on plans beforehand before putting them before the two generals.  French thought French War Minister [[Alexandre Millerand|Millerand]] "a damned socialist little cad" (7 June 1915).&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp145-6"/&gt;

Joffre planned once again for attacks by the BEF and [[Tenth Army (France)|French Tenth Army]], combined with [[Second Battle of Champagne|another French offensive in Champagne]].  Cavalry, and infantry in buses, were to be ready to exploit as far as Mons and Namur.  He wrote to GHQ (12 June) that the ground at Loos (where a British attack could unite with a French attack on Vimy Ridge) was "particularly favourable", although Haig reported (23 June) that the planned ground at Loos was unsuitable for an attack.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 295–97&lt;/ref&gt; French visited London (23 June) to talk to Kitchener, with Robertson, whose relations with French were breaking down, remaining behind.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p23"&gt;Woodward, 1998, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; At a conference at Chantilly (24 June) French and Joffre agreed that further attacks on the Western Front were needed (to do otherwise was "unfair to Russia, Serbia and Italy") and that they should ask their governments to send all available troops to France rather than other fronts.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp.294–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Asquith had a lengthy discussion (26 June) about the desirability of sacking French.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p298"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson thought him "ridiculously optimistic about the German state of collapse" and "convinced that the Boches are coming near the end of their reserves" (diary 28 June 1915)&lt;ref name="Robbins 2005, p70"/&gt; while [[Aylmer Haldane|General Haldane]] thought him "obstinate and unreasonable" (Haldane Diary 30 June 1915).&lt;ref name="Robbins 2005, p70"/&gt; After a "long talk" with Robertson (1 July) [[George V of the United Kingdom|the King]] became convinced that French should be removed.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp150-1, 153"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp. 150–51, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Margot Asquith warned French (2 July) that his aides Freddy Guest and Brinsley Fitzgerald (whom she thought "wonderfully unclever") were making trouble between himself and Kitchener.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchener also opposed a major British offensive (Calais Conference, 6 July).  Sir John expressed his concern that, although a successful attack was possible, his artillery had less than the 17 rounds per day which he deemed necessary. He was initially sceptical of Haig's reluctance to attack and inspected the ground himself (12 July).  Although he felt that the high ground already in British hands would provide good observation, he broadly concurred with Haig's analysis.  Robertson also opposed the attack.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp296-8"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 296–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Haig discovered (14 July) that the King had lost confidence in French, and discussed the matter with Kitchener.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p298"/&gt; Wilson noted that relations between French and Robertson were breaking down by the summer, and suspected (correctly) that Robertson was blackening French's reputation by sending home documents which French had refused to read or sign.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp150-1, 153"/&gt; French told [[Sidney Clive|Clive]] (20 July) to inform GQG that ammunition shortage only permitted "holding" attacks and then (25 July) announced that there would be no attack at all. However, after an unsatisfactory meeting with Foch the previous day, he wrote a personal letter to Joffre (28 July) leaving the decision in his hands, although he noted concerns in his diary that night that the French attack at Arras would not be ''decisive''. He also noted (diary, 29 July) that the French were annoyed at British strikes and failure to bring in conscription, and might make a separate peace if Britain did not pull her weight, and may also have agreed to the attack because he had learned that his own job was under threat.  Kitchener, who had changed his mind, eventually (19 August) ordered the attack to proceed.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp296-8"/&gt;

====Loos====
{{main|Battle of Loos}}
French went sick in September, Robertson acting as Commander-in-Chief BEF.&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p23-4"&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Both GHQ and First Army persuaded themselves that the Loos attack could succeed, perhaps as the use of gas, whose use by the Germans at [[Second Battle of Ypres|Second Ypres]] had been condemned by Sir John, would allow a decisive victory. Sir John decided to keep a strong reserve consisting of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]], the [[Indian Cavalry Corps]] and [[Richard Haking|Haking]]'s [[XI Corps (United Kingdom)|XI Corps]], which consisted of the [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]] and two New Army Divisions ([[21st Division (United Kingdom)|21st]] and [[24th Division (United Kingdom)|24th]]) just arrived in France.  French was privately doubtful that a breakthrough would be achieved and was concerned that in the event of failure the government would want to "change the bowler" (letters to Winifred 18 and 21 September).  Haig (and Foch) wanted the reserves close to hand to exploit a breakthrough on the first day; French agreed to deploy them closer to the front but still thought they should be committed on the second day (Haig wrote (diary 2 October) "It seems impossible to discuss military problems with an unreasoning brain of this kind").&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 300–02&lt;/ref&gt;

Wanting to be closer to the battle, French moved to a forward command post at Lilliers, less than 20 miles behind First Army's front.  He left Robertson and most of his staff behind at GHQ and had no direct telephone link to First Army.  Haig's infantry attacked at 6.30&amp;nbsp;am on 25 September and he sent an officer by car requesting release of the reserves at 7&amp;nbsp;am—he did not hear until 10.02&amp;nbsp;am that the divisions were moving up to the front.  French visited Haig between 11&amp;nbsp;–11.30 and agreed that Haig could have the reserve, but rather than using the telephone he drove to Haking's Headquarters and gave the order personally at 12.10&amp;nbsp;pm.  Haig then heard from Haking at 1.20&amp;nbsp;pm that the reserves were moving forward, but by the time the men, already exhausted from an overnight march in the rain, reached the front line through the chaos of the battlefield they were committed against strengthened German positions the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp.302–05&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Haig Joffre and French at the Front Gws joffrefrhaig 01.png|thumb|right|French, Joffre and Haig (left to right) visit the front line during 1915.]]
Joffre sent a letter of congratulation (26 September)—[[Sidney Clive|Clive]] sensed that Joffre did not really believe the British attack would succeed but wanted it kept going as a diversion from [[Second Battle of Champagne|Champagne]], although after complaints from Sir John that the [[French Tenth Army]] were not doing enough Foch ordered them to take over some line from the British around Loos.  Sir John was still keen for a concerted Anglo-French attack, telling Foch (28 September) that a gap could be "rushed" just north of Hill 70, although Foch felt that this would be difficult to co-ordinate and Haig told him that First Army was not in a position for further attacks at the moment.  Charteris wrote that "Sir John French is played out. The show is too big for him and he is despondent."&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp305-6"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 305–06&lt;/ref&gt; Even French's trusted secretary Edward Fitzgerald{{check|date=May 2016}} recorded (5 October 1915) that French's "sudden moods are weird and marvellous but we never now even have explanations".&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism after Loos====
Haig told [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Haldane]] (9 October) that French's handling of the reserves had lost the battle.  Kitchener demanded an explanation (11 October).&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp305-6"/&gt; Haig told [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]] (10 and 22 October 1915) he could no longer be loyal to French after Loos.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp153-4"&gt;Jeffery 2006, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt; Haig also wrote to GHQ (21 October) claiming that fresh forces could have pushed through with little opposition between 9&amp;nbsp;am and 11&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;

To French's annoyance the King arrived in France (21 October) to sample opinion for himself—French met him at Boulogne but was summoned to London for talks with Kitchener and the Dardanelles Committee.  [[Hubert Gough|Gough]] and [[Richard Haking|Haking]] visited the King after tea (24 October) and told him "everyone has lost confidence in the C-in-C" while over dinner that evening Haig told the King that French was "a source of great weakness to the Army, and no one had any confidence in him any more".&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp150-1, 153"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp307-9"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 307–09&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson, visiting London in early October, had discussed French's replacement with Murray (now CIGS) and the King.  After he returned to France and conferred with Haig, Haig recorded (diary 24 October) "I ha(ve) been more than loyal to French and did my best to stop all criticism of him or his methods … I ha(ve) come to the conclusion that it (i)s not fair to the Empire to retain French in command.  Moreover, none of my officers commanding corps had a high opinion of Sir John's military ability or military views; in fact ''they had no confidence in him''.  Robertson quite agreed and left me saying "he knew how to act, and would report to [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Stamfordham]]" ".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson thought (24 October) that French's "mind was never the same for two consecutive minutes" and that his ideas were "reckless and impossible" and that he had poor relations with Joffre.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 1998, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resignation====
French's friends in London reported that Asquith still wanted French to remain in office but Bonar Law was opposed; Wilson claimed that "cordial relations with the French" were Sir John's trump card and lobbied Carson in his favour. Walter Long reported that French's dismissal had never been openly discussed by the War Council, but [[Charles Edward Callwell|Charles Callwell]] recorded that Asquith, Grey and Lloyd George were overheard by the waiters discussing it in a railway restaurant car. French himself believed that Kitchener's departure on a tour of the Mediterranean would save him.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, pp307-9"/&gt;

GHQ suggested that according to Haking's own report the reserves had been held up by "avoidable delay" and pointed out the futility of "pushing reserves through a narrow gap". Haig denied that there had been any "avoidable delay" and Haking now changed his mind and sent a new report (27 October) blaming the slowness of his troops' march on their inexperience.  French's despatch was published (2 November) claiming that the reserves had been released at 9.30&amp;nbsp;am (the telephone log does show a call from GHQ at this time&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 p.400&lt;/ref&gt;).  Haig, who wrote to his wife that the despatch was "full of lies", demanded amendments and another interview between French and Haig ensued.  Even though [[John Charteris|Charteris]] doubted that the quicker arrival of the reserves would have made much difference, the dispute revolved around the deployment and release of the reserves, rather than why Haig had demanded their release into a battle he thought already lost.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp.309–10&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson told the King (27 October) that Haig should replace French.&lt;ref name="Jeffery 2006, pp153-4"/&gt; French's policies were attacked in the House of Lords (9 November) and again on 16 November when [[John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids|Lord St Davids]] complained of "the presence of ladies" at GHQ.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 306–07&lt;/ref&gt;

Haig sent copies of the relevant orders and a critique of GHQ's conduct of the battle to his wife, who showed them to Stamfordham (10 November) for the King to see. Robertson was working against French, telling Haig (15 November) that "the first thing is to get you in command". The Prime Minister discussed the matter with the King and Kitchener (both of whom thought French not up to the job, although Kitchener thought the time not right for a change), and, on 23 November, Haig. Asquith then asked [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] to convey to French in person the news that he must resign, but that he was being offered a peerage and the newly created job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces.  However, French insisted on seeing Asquith again (29 November) at which meeting Asquith told him that he must take the first step and that he was not being "recalled" (sacked).  French's official critique of Haig's performance at Loos finally reached the War Office on 1 December.  He wrote to Asquith (2 December) suggesting that Kitchener be removed to be replaced by a civilian Secretary of State to avoid friction with the new job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces, and writing that he would await Asquith's decision on this point.  He returned to France (3 December), but Asquith had been exchanging further letters with Stamfordham and they agreed that French must now be pressed to quit.  Walter Long telephoned French (4 December) passing on the Prime Minister's message that he ''must'' resign.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 310–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchener told [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] (4 December) that the government intended to appoint Robertson Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, but Haig was appointed instead.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward, 1998, p23-4"/&gt; French's resignation, recommending Robertson as successor, reached Asquith on the morning of 6 December.  It was announced in the press on 17 December and took effect at noon on 18 December.  French and Haig had an awkward handover meeting (Fitzgerald told Wigram that Haig "never for one moment unbent"), at which French requested that Winston Churchill be given command of a battalion (Haig had no objection).  French was cheered onto the boat home by an escort of 19th Hussars.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces==
===Home Defence===
French returned to England to be appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces|Commander-in-Chief of the British Home Forces]] in December 1915,&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; and in January 1916, he was created Viscount French of Ypres and of High Lake in the County of Roscommon.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Robertson prevented him having the same powers as the old [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces|Commander-in-Chief]] of the British Army or having a seat on the [[Army Council (1904)|Army Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 314–17. Holmes writes "War Council" but this may be a confusion with the "War Council" which discussed strategy between August 1914 and May 1915, or the "War Committee", a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite estimates that the Germans could land up to 170,000 men, French thought an invasion unlikely unless the Germans had first won on the Western Front, and favoured fighting on the coast rather than a strong central reserve. He was energetic about inspecting defences, and appealed to Asquith to obtain the services of [[Arthur Paget (British Army officer)|Arthur Paget]] and [[Bruce Hamilton (British Army officer)|Bruce Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004 p. 314-7"&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 314–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland and Easter Rising===
After discussions in February and March 1916 with [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretary]] [[Augustine Birrell]]—who did not believe press talk of an armed Irish uprising but wanted more troops as a deterrent—[[Lovick Friend|Friend]] ([[Commander-in-Chief]], Ireland) and [[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Wimborne]] (Lord Lieutenant) French said that he could spare only a single cavalry brigade as reinforcements, and later offered an extra reserve infantry brigade, although in the event Friend declined (7 April) to make formal application for the brigade to be sent. French thought little more could be done unless the government changed its assessment of the threat.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 321–22&lt;/ref&gt;

French's term of office saw the suppression in 1916 of the [[Easter Rising]], which briefly coincided with a German invasion scare.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/easter_uprising.htm|title=Easter Rising|publisher=History Learning Site|accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intelligence report on 21 April warned of collaboration between the Irish and the Germans, causing French to mutter "I don't believe a word of it". French received news of the insurrection at noon on 24 April 1916 (Easter Monday), and at once sent two infantry brigades to Ireland and put other formations on standby—the Admiralty warned that the [[High Seas Fleet|German fleet]] was out. Woken at 4&amp;nbsp;am on 25 April with the news that the Germans were shelling Lowestoft, French ordered the commanders of the two Home Defence Armies to prepare for action and ordered two divisions in the Midlands to be prepared to move to the coast. Later that day he was informed that [[Nevil Macready|Macready]] had been deputed to handle the War Office's side of the Irish uprising.  French rejected Kitchener's suggestion that he go to Ireland that very evening and take personal command, a decision with which the [[H.H. Asquith|Prime Minister]] concurred (despite their previous antagonism, French recorded that Kitchener "expressed no annoyance at my visit to the PM!"). The military authorities reported from Dublin that they had the situation well in hand.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 323–34&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 26 April, told that the government had decided to send out a new general to Ireland, French selected [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|Maxwell]] (who had been military governor of Pretoria) from a shortlist of two.  French had already told Asquith that he had ordered the [[60th (2/2nd London) Division|60th Division]] to be ready to move, but would not send it without the concurrence of the General Staff. On 27 April, French visited Robertson who agreed with him that to send more troops to Ireland would be "playing the German game". However, the next day after visits from [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Midleton]] (on instructions from Asquith) and [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Carson]] French agreed to send three extra battalions, as well as the cavalry brigade from Aldershot which Maxwell now requested. The rebellion was crushed by 29 April. On 3 May Asquith recorded his concerns that the shooting of rebels might antagonise Irish opinion, but French, despite having been advised by [[John Redmond]] that Sinn Féin had little support outside Dublin and that the Army should not use more than minimal force, passed on these concerns with the caveat that he would not interfere with Maxwell's actions.  In the opinion of one biographer French's views had not moved on since his hanging of the Cape Colony Boers, and he bears some responsibility for the shootings.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 324–25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animosity with Haig===
French became increasingly critical of Haig's Western Front Offensives.&lt;ref name=heath134&gt;Heathcote, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; One biographer writes that "French's office at Horse Guards became a clearing house for gossip from France". French was critical of the choice of Rawlinson to command the Somme and in August 1916 Robertson warned Haig that "Winston, French and various "degommed people" are trying to make mischief".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1916 Lloyd George (then War Secretary) sought French's advice about recent press criticism of British artillery and discipline, then sent him to France to sound out the opinion of the French generals about why the French had gained ground with fewer losses on the Somme. [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]] (C-in-C French Army Group North) refused to be drawn, although he confessed to Wilson that Haig's methods invited criticism, and Haig refused to meet him, sending an aide Lt-Col Alan Fletcher, telling him "I would not receive Viscount French in my house. I despise him too much personally for that, but he would receive every attention due to a British Field Marshal".  Haig and Robertson were both concerned that Lloyd George might appoint French CIGS in Robertson's place.  On 25 November 1916 the King summoned French to Buckingham Palace and warned him to stop criticising Haig. In January 1917 French refused an invitation from Derby to dine with Haig, but on 22 June, after pressure from the King, a meeting was arranged for French and Haig to bury the hatchet, at which, by Haig's account, French confessed that in his bitterness at being removed from command he had "said things then which he was ashamed of now". Haig, according to his own diary, congratulated him for "speaking out like a man" and they shook hands as they parted, but their rapprochement was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 327–30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air Defence===
French took on responsibility for air defence, although he agreed with Repington that it was "a damnosa hereditas". He was frequently lobbied by local groups for better air defences. In January 1917 anti-aircraft guns were reallocated to anti-submarine warfare.  After the [[German strategic bombing during World War I|Gotha raids]] in July 1917 French was able to make a fuss at the War Cabinet (Robertson complained he could not get a word in edgeways) and show letters he had written urging greater priority for air defence.  A War Cabinet sub-committee was set up, nominally chaired by the Prime Minister but effectively run by [[Jan Smuts|J. C. Smuts]], and French urged that air be treated as a separate department going forward (which eventually became the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]).  More guns and fighter squadrons were provided, and Brigadier [[Edward Ashmore (British Army officer)|E.B. Ashmore]] was appointed to command London's air defence, reporting to French.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 317–21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advice to War Cabinet===
In July 1917, French asked to advise the War Cabinet, fully aware that this was breaking the monopoly of advice on which Robertson insisted.  Lloyd George had French and Wilson to lunch in August, then on 11 October 1917, following the precedent of Asquith's War Council of August 1914, they were invited to the War Cabinet and invited to give their opinions (a note from Hankey asking French to submit his paper via the CIGS was apparently ignored).  French's paper criticised GHQ's [[John Charteris|inflated estimates]] of German casualties compared to [[George Macdonogh|War Office figures]], pointed out that there was no firm evidence that German losses were commensurate with Allied, and that any further Western Front Offensive "has become more of a "gamble" than anything else we have undertaken" and that any future plans and forecasts by Haig should be most carefully examined.  He recommended the "Petain solution" (i.e. standing mainly on the defensive on the Western Front until the Americans arrived in force) and urged the creation of an Allied [[Supreme War Council]].  Wilson, who was more amenable to Western front offensives, made some handwritten amendments to French's paper as well as submitting one of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 330–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Hankey met French and Wilson on 24 October and urged them to reconsider, concerned that if Robertson resigned the Conservatives might bring down the government. French refused, saying Haig was "always making the same mistake" and "we shall do no good until we break down the Haig-Robertson ring". Hankey thought that "there was envy, hatred and malice in the old boy's heart as he spoke". Haig regarded French's paper as "the outcome of a jealous and disappointed mind".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manpower crisis===
Although French was responsible for training, the demands of the Western Front left him very short of fit troops.  There were about 1.5 million troops in the UK, but many of these were in hospital, in training, too young (under 19), too old or medically unfit for combat. At the start of 1917 French had a defensive force of 470,000 men, of whom 232,459 (including ten infantry divisions) were "mobile" reserves and 237,894 on beach and anti-aircraft defence. By January 1918 the total had been reduced to 400,979, of whom 190,045 (eight divisions) were "mobile". In January 1918 Robertson favoured breaking up four divisions to send 50,000 reinforcements to France, leaving the remaining four divisions consisting mainly of "lads" under 19. There were around 16,000 "mobile" troops in Ireland, not counting the 62,000 "infantry performing a gendarme role" (in Terraine's description). There were around 600,000 Category "A" men in Britain, of whom in the event 372,000 were sent to France between January and November 1918 when the government were doing all they could to reinforce the BEF—by May 1918 even troops with medical grade of B1 were sent to France.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004 p. 314-7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, 1998, pp. 178–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1978, pp. 47–50&lt;/ref&gt;

French's reputation had recovered (by this time, writes Holmes, "the losses of Loos looked almost nostalgically trivial") and he had come to be regarded as one of the government's leading advisers.  In spring 1918 French wrote Lloyd George a long letter complaining of how Haig had intrigued against him in 1915, including criticising him to his subordinates, and how Haig and Robertson had (allegedly) conspired to gain military supremacy over the civil power.  French was pleased at the removal of Robertson and [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Derby]] early in 1918, and during the German Spring Offensive urged that Haig be sacked and replaced by Plumer.  In May 1918 he again suggested to Wilson (now CIGS) that Haig be appointed his successor as Commander-in-Chief Home Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp.328, 333–34, 337&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lord Lieutenant of Ireland==
===1918===
French noted that Irish divisions could no longer be kept up to strength by voluntary recruitment, and in March 1918, when the Cabinet planned to extend [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|conscription]] to Ireland, French claimed that "opinion was about evenly divided" on the issue, and thought it would remove "useless and idle youths—between 18 and … 25"—and would cause opposition but not "bloodshed".  In the event the threat of Irish conscription provoked great opposition, even from the Catholic Church, and contributed to the growth in support for Sinn Féin.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 326, 343&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd George intended to replace the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]]—normally something of a figurehead position, with real power exercised by the Chief Secretary—with three "Justices": [[James Campbell, 1st Baron Glenavy|James Campbell]], unionist [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]], [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Midleton]] and French himself. The three men met on 30 April 1918 and jointly demanded immediate conscription and martial law in Ireland. When Lloyd George refused, Campbell declined any further involvement and Lloyd George also dropped Midleton when the latter demanded the right to "advise on policy". French eventually accepted appointment as sole Lord Lieutenant in May 1918 on condition it was as a "Military Viceroy at the Head of a Quasi-Military Government".&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; French also arranged for [[Frederick Shaw (British Army officer)|Shaw]], his chief of staff at Horse Guards, to replace [[Bryan Mahon|Mahon]] as [[Commander-in-Chief]], Ireland and that Irish Command should become a separate command, rather than under Home Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 334–36&lt;/ref&gt;

French also set up an Executive Council and a Military Council to which senior officers of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] (RIC) and [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] (DMP) were sometimes invited.  He also set up an Advisory Council, with the support of the King, [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Haldane]] and Carson, which he hoped might contain representatives of all strands of Irish opinion.  But in practice its members were all well-connected wealthy men, Sinn Féin were not involved despite Haldane's hopes and the proposal angered the existing administrators at Dublin Castle.  The body provided useful advice on commercial and industrial questions, and advised that Home Rule could work as a [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|federation of separate assemblies in Belfast and Dublin]] (also French's view), but ceased to meet regularly after April 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 341–43&lt;/ref&gt;

French was convinced that the [[Sinn Féin]] leaders had little support amongst the majority of the Irish people. He wanted Home Rule to be implemented, provided the violence was stopped first. In July 1917 he had been pleased to be given a "vociferous" welcome by the women of Cork, but less so in Dublin and Galway. In 1917 he had bought a country house at Drumdoe in [[Frenchpark]], [[County Roscommon]], but in practice was seldom able to visit the place as the situation in Ireland deteriorated.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name=heath134/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 327, 338–41&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 17/18 May 1918 French had Sinn Féin leaders arrested and documents were seized, but even supporters like Repington and [[Nevil Macready|Macready]] were disappointed at the lack of clear evidence of [[German Plot (Ireland)|collaboration with the Germans]] and the flimsy legal grounds for the arrests, which caused endless legal wrangles. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] and [[Cathal Brugha]] escaped arrest and increased their own power in the vacuum created by the arrest of more moderate leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 340–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish Volunteers and Sinn Féin were proclaimed "dangerous organisations" in certain areas (3 July 1918), with meetings banned except under permit, and West Cork was declared a Special Military Area in late September. French obtained a cash bonus for Irish policemen, and pressed for them to receive decorations. He also came down hard on senior Irish police officers whom he thought useless, threatening resignation unless the Inspector-General of the RIC, Brigadier-General [[Joseph Aloysius Byrne|Joseph Byrne]], was removed.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 345–46&lt;/ref&gt;

French, who like many generals of his generation believed that the government owed a moral duty to those who had served, urged that a "[[Comrades of the Great War]] (Ireland)" be set up to prevent returning Irish war veterans joining the Sinn Féin-dominated "Soldiers' Federation"—he also recommended that soldiers be given cash and land grants, perhaps in "Soldiers' Colonies".  This plan was stymied by cash shortage and inter-departmental infighting.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 344–45&lt;/ref&gt;

===1919===
[[Image:John French, 1st Earl of Ypres00.jpg|thumb|John French, 1st Earl of Ypres c. 1919 by [[John Singer Sargent]]]]
French clashed with the Chief Secretary [[Edward Shortt]] over his insistence that he exercise executive authority in Dublin, and when Lloyd George formed a new government in January 1919 Shortt was replaced by the more pliable [[Ian Macpherson, 1st Baron Strathcarron|Ian Macpherson]].  French was appointed to the British Cabinet (now restored to normal size after the war had ended), but while in Ireland liaised with the Cabinet not through the Chief Secretary as would have been usual but through the Colonial Secretary, his friend [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;

French also secured the appointment of Sir [[James Macmahon]] as Under-Secretary at Dublin Castle. Macmahon was Roman Catholic, which caused Walter Long and to some extent French himself concerns that this would increase the power of the Hierarchy over Irish government.  In practice Macmahon was frozen out of decision-making by Macpherson while French was ill with pneumonia between February and April 1919, and despite warnings from French of administrative chaos at [[Dublin Castle administration|Dublin Castle]] it was not until 1920 that the highly able [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]] was appointed as Joint Under-Secretary with Macmahon.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp.346–49&lt;/ref&gt;

The shooting dead of two Catholic constables of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] in an ambush at [[Soloheadbeg]], [[County Tipperary]] (21 January 1919) caused French to call off tentative talks between Haldane and the recently elected [[First Dáil|Irish Dáil]] (Haldane blamed Walter Long who was opposed to the talks).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 348–49&lt;/ref&gt; 

French and Macpherson wanted Sinn Féin declared illegal and pressed for a free hand to deal with the militants, although the issue received little priority while Lloyd George was away at [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Versailles]] in the first half of 1919. Sinn Féin was declared illegal on 5 July 1919 after District Inspector Hunt was killed in broad daylight, in [[Thurles]] (23 June). By October 1919 French was urging the imposition of martial law. By December he was furious at the government's lack of support (like being asked to "fight with one arm tied up") and their insistence that the RIC buy army surplus vehicles (the Army was reducing dramatically in size after World War I) on the open market instead of simply being given them.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 350–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw was sceptical about the legality of martial law and thought it might be impractical in cities like Dublin and Cork. French was advised that 15 army battalions and 24 cycle units (half a battalion in size) were needed to keep order, but British strength did not reach these levels until the summer of 1920. In November 1919, Irish Command listed its minimum requirement as 25,000 "bayonet strength"—at the time there were just over 37,000 troops in Ireland, many of them non-combatants. Even in January 1920 only 34 battalions were available, rather than the 36 required.  This was symptomatic of the Army as a whole, which was trying to meet global commitments while demobilising. British military strength in Ireland reached 51 battalions during the martial law period early in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 344, 352–53, 357&lt;/ref&gt;

IRA intimidation caused traditional RIC sources of information to dry up. By late 1919, with French's approval, the RIC was recruiting in England: first the "[[Black and Tans]]", then the [[Auxiliary Division]] (ex army officers with the powers of police sergeants) from July 1920.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 352–53&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lord French Ambush (17069060140).jpg|thumbnail|left|A sergeant pointing out the bullet hole resulting from the IRA ambush, December 1919]]
French had been receiving death threats since January 1919, which he believed were a sign that government measures were having an effect. On 19 December 1919 an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] unit of 11 [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteers]], including [[Seán Treacy]], [[Seamus Robinson (Irish Republican)|Seamus Robinson]], [[Seán Hogan]], [[Paddy Daly]], [[Joe Leonard]], [[Martin Savage]], and [[Dan Breen]] (who later said that the threats were not based on "personal animosity") sought to ambush French as he returned from [[Ashtown railway station]] (he was returning by train from Drumdoe) to the Vice-Regal Lodge in [[Phoenix Park]], Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;''My Fight For Irish Freedom'', Dan Breen, Anvil, 1964; {{ISBN|0-947962-33-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage, Kehoe and Breen were interrupted by a RIC officer as they pushed a hay-cart halfway across the road blocking the path of French's car. He was dragged off the road after one of them lobbed a [[grenade]] at him, which did not go off but knocked him [[unconsciousness|unconscious]].&lt;ref name="Christmas week ambush"&gt;Wayne Sugg&lt;/ref&gt; When the convoy appeared minutes later, the IRA concentrated their attack on the second car on the basis of incorrect intelligence: French was actually in the first car. In the ensuing crossfire Breen was shot in the leg, and Savage was killed by a bullet in the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=No Fear!|work=TIME Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743678,00.html|accessdate=17 June 2007|date=9 May 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; French's own bodyguard was wounded, and he was saved in part by the quick thinking of his driver.  A grenade, which would almost certainly have killed him, exploded in the back seat of the second car.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 353–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabinet agreed that the Irish Government could impose martial law whenever it pleased—although in the event this did not happen for almost another year, by which time executive authority had been returned to London. Suspects could now be interned under [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914|DORA 14B]] on warrants signed by the Chief Secretary and French pressed Macpherson, who had been shocked by the attempted assassination, to intern as many as possible, although he advised against interning politicians like [[Arthur Griffith]] "simply for making seditious speeches".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004 p. 354"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final period===
Political support from London for internment wavered. French opposed the release of hunger strikers under the [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|"Cat and Mouse" Act]] and wanted them simply left to die, but eventually in April 1920, under pressure from London, the hunger strikers were released on parole.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004 p. 354"/&gt;

French lost a good deal of executive power as substantial control over Irish affairs was given back to a new Chief Secretary, [[Hamar Greenwood, 1st Viscount Greenwood|Hamar Greenwood]], in April 1920,&lt;ref name=heath134/&gt; with Macready as the new [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland|Commander-in-Chief]], not Robertson whom French did not want.  French again urged the introduction of martial law in Ireland and the use of Ulster Volunteers as peacekeepers in Southern Ireland.  Wilson and Macready expected French to be sacked in the spring of 1920.  Wilson wrote: "Poor little man he is so weak and pliable and then has such inconsequential gusts of illogical passion. He is an Imperialist, a Democrat, a Home Ruler all at the same time. Poor man", although Wilson also thought him "brave as a lion". [[H. A. L. Fisher]] thought French in July 1920 "a shadow of his former self and quite useless".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 355–58&lt;/ref&gt;

French had supported the use of armoured cars and aircraft in Ireland. Shaw had recommended one air squadron per province (i.e. four) in an "Entrenched Air Camp", but only one squadron was available and it was unclear exactly what they could do. By June 1920 the military situation had escalated considerably and French suggested that they should be permitted to strafe and bomb freely into areas from which civilians had been removed.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 351–52&lt;/ref&gt; 

French resigned as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on 30 April 1921 and was replaced by [[Edmund FitzAlan-Howard, 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent|Lord Edmund Talbot]], a Catholic.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Honorary positions==
French was president of [[The Ypres League]], a veterans' society for those who had served at the [[Ypres Salient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftermathww1.com/ypresl.asp |title=The Ypres League – Aftermath|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also colonel of the [[19th Hussars]] from 14 February 1902 (retaining this position when French persuaded Wilson to amalgamate them with the 15th to become the [[15th/19th The King's Royal Hussars]]&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004 p. 362-3"&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 362–63&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27415|page=1729|date=11 March 1902|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; colonel of the 1st Battalion, The [[Cambridgeshire Regiment]] from 22 April 1909&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28253|page=3875|date=21 May 1909|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and colonel-in-chief of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684–1922)|Royal Irish Regiment]] from 26 March 1913, succeeding [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Wolseley]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28733|page=4641|date=1 July 1913|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Irish Regiment was disbanded along with the four other Southern Irish regiments, in 1922.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004 p. 362-3"/&gt; He was Colonel of the [[Irish Guards]] from June 1916.&lt;ref name=heath134/&gt;

==Memoirs==
Stung by press attacks in February 1917 (a Smith-Dorrien interview in the ''Weekly Despatch''—"How the Old Army Died"— and a book ''The Retreat from Mons'' by Major Corbett-Smith—Smith-Dorrien had worked on the proofs), French published his memoirs ''1914'', ghosted by the journalist Lovat Fraser, in April and May 1919.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004 p. 359-61"&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 359–61&lt;/ref&gt; The unauthorised publication of the book technically laid him open to prosecution as he was holding office as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The King was angered, and [[Bonar Law]] warned French that the government could not defend him if the House of Commons demanded his resignation as Irish Viceroy. Smith-Dorrien as a serving officer was not permitted to reply. Haig, Asquith and [[Francis Bertie, 1st Viscount Bertie of Thame|Bertie]] complained of inaccuracies and it was attacked by [[John Fortescue (military historian)|Sir John Fortescue]] in the ''Quarterly Review'' as "one of the most unfortunate books ever written".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004 p. 359-61"/&gt; Smith-Dorrien, in a private written statement, called ''1914'' "mostly a work of fiction and a foolish one too".&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p223"/&gt;

French left an uncompleted autobiography, which was used by Gerald French in his 1931 life of his father.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 the ownership of French's war diaries was disputed following the bankruptcy of the 3rd Earl of Ypres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times|title=Ownership of war diaries 'in doubt' |date=29 March 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
French retired from the British Army in April 1921 and was elevated to the [[Earl of Ypres|Earldom of Ypres]] in June 1922.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Drumdoe was looted early in 1923, for which French received an apology and a promise of an armed guard for the place from [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]] [[Timothy Michael Healy|T.M. Healy]]. Despite a gift of £50,000 in 1916, and receiving field marshal's half pay, owning two properties in Ireland which he could not use left French again short of money, although he did not improve matters by staying often at the [[Hôtel de Crillon]] in Paris. He left £8,450 (net total) in his will.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

French lived at 94 Lancaster Gate, London, which provided a useful base for his amorous activities, on which he often embarked together with a wealthy American friend, George Moore. In August 1923 [[William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp|Lord Beauchamp]] offered him the honorary post of [[Captain of Deal Castle]], which gave him a home in Britain once again.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 336, 348, 363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
French died from cancer of the bladder at [[Deal Castle]] on 22 May 1925, aged 72.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; On 25 May, his body was taken by motor hearse from Deal to London for cremation at [[Golders Green Crematorium]]. The ashes then remained overnight in the Guard's Chapel at [[Wellington Barracks]] until the funeral service at [[Westminster Abbey]] in the evening of 26 May. After the service, French's remains were escorted by a military procession to [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] in which six battalions of infantry, one battery of artillery, eight squadrons of cavalry and a detachment from the Royal Navy were present. The burial at Ripple was conducted as a private service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45884475|title=The late Earl of Ypres|publisher=Barrier Miner|date=25 May 1925|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The procedure of burying ashes in an urn was still unfamiliar at the time, and his urn was transported in a coffin during the funeral ceremonies. Before the funeral, an estimated 7,000 people filed past his coffin during the first two hours it lay in state, many of them veterans of the retreat from Mons. Haig, Robertson, [[Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton|Hamilton]] and Smith-Dorrien (who had travelled from France to pay his respects to a man with whom he had clashed badly) were pall bearers at his funeral at Westminster Abbey—the first of a major First World War leader.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 365–67&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were buried at Ripple five days after his death.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Assessments==
===Contemporaries===
French was "a man about whom there were extremes of opinion, ranging from loyalty and affection to disgust". He had a hot temper and swings of mood, would address friends effusively as "dear old boy", and was a womaniser and often short of money. He wore an unusually long tunic which emphasised his relatively short stature. He was—at least during the Boer War—idolised by the public and during the First World War was loved by his men in a way that Douglas Haig never was.&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, p.52-3"&gt;Reid 2006, pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 1, 203&lt;/ref&gt; French was also an avid reader of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], from whose works he was able to recite long passages from memory.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p25"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions vary as to French's military abilities. [[Edward Spears]], then a subaltern liaising between French and Lanrezac, later wrote of the former: "You only had to look at him to see that he was a brave, determined man ... I learnt to love and to admire the man who never lost his head, and on whom danger had the effect it has on the wild boar: he would become morose, furious for a time, harsh, but he would face up and never shirk. He knew only one way of dealing with a difficulty, and that was to tackle it ... If he had once lost confidence in a man, justly or unjustly, that man could do no right in his eyes. He was as bad an enemy as he was a good friend ... once he had lost confidence in (Lanrezac) he ignored him and acted as if he and his Army did not exist." Spears also recorded that at a conference with Joffre on 30 August 1914 French, the back of his tunic wet with sweat from riding hard to reach the meeting, was "one of the coolest and calmest people at GHQ". This was at the time when he had decided that the BEF would have to retreat behind the Seine to refit.&lt;ref&gt;Spears 1930, pp. 73–74, 281&lt;/ref&gt;

French was severely criticised by those close to Haig, including General Sir [[Hubert Gough]], who thought him "an ignorant little fool" (in a letter of 29 January 1916. He was more charitable in his 1954 memoirs ''Soldiering On'' (p.&amp;nbsp;127)&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield and Todman 2004, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Duff Cooper]] in Haig's Official Biography. The Official Historian [[James Edward Edmonds|Edmonds]] called him "only 'un beau sabreur' of the old fashioned sort—a vain, ignorant and vindictive old man with an unsavoury society backing" and claimed that French once borrowed Sir Edward Hamley's ''Operations of War'' from the War Office library but could not understand it.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 3, 365–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, p.54"&gt;Reid 2006, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; His admiring biographer [[Cecil Chisholm]] (1914) claimed that as a young officer French had had a reputation as a reader of military books ([[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]], [[Karl von Schmidt|von Schmidt]]), a claim treated with some scepticism by Holmes, although Beckett uses it to cast doubt on Edmonds' "magnificently malicious" story, pointing out that he remembered enough of Hamley's doctrines not to take shelter in Maubeuge after the Battle of Mons, although Spears later wrote that had Hamley not employed such a penetrating metaphor it might not have lodged in French's mind.&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, pp. 101–02&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Nevil Macready|Macready]] (in 1919) thought French "one of the most lovable men I have ever met … one of the most loyal and true-hearted individuals you are ever likely to come across". Field Marshal [[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Chetwode]], reflecting on the hostility between Haig and his former patron French, wrote that "French was a man who loved life, laughter and women … a man who might have done big things in open warfare. He was a lucky general and inspired the greatest confidence in his troops" and that Haig was his opposite in most of these respects. Churchill (in ''Great Contemporaries'') wrote that French was "a natural soldier" who lacked Haig’s attention to detail and endurance, but who had "deeper military insight" and "would never have run the British army into the same long drawn-out slaughters". [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|Seely]] and [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] thought highly of him. Haldane thought he had "been a great Commander-in-Chief, a soldier of the first order, who held the Army as no other could". Lloyd George praised him as "a far bigger man" than Haig and regretted that he "had fallen by the daggers of his own colleagues", although perhaps as an ally against Haig in 1916–18.&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, p.54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern historians===
French was ridiculed as "a weak-willed man of medium height" by [[Alan Clark]] in the widely read ''The Donkeys'' (1961). His modern biographer Richard Holmes wrote that "he remains … a discredited man" but "history has dealt too harshly" with him. He argues that French was an emotional man who was deeply moved by casualties and identified too closely with his soldiers, even in August 1914. Holmes quotes with approval [[John Terraine]]'s verdict that French was the most distinguished English cavalry leader since [[Oliver Cromwell]],&lt;ref&gt;Terraine 1960, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that although he did not achieve victory, his personality inspired the BEF in 1914 (this was acknowledged at the time by Robertson and by Smith-Dorrien, who informed the King's adviser [[Clive Wigram, 1st Baron Wigram|Wigram]] (6 November 1914) that in situations where other men would have panicked "Sir John is unmoved and invariably does the right thing"). Holmes acknowledges that French's qualities were marred by his "undisciplined intellect and mercurial personality", but concludes by quoting Churchill's verdict that "French, in the sacred fire of leadership, was unsurpassed".&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 1, 276, 283–84, 365–67&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Bond]] described French as "a brave fighting general who proved out of his professional depths" in 1914–15.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Senior offers a critical view of French in 1914: although he was "essentially a generous and warm-hearted man" as seen in his pre-Marne meeting with Joffre, his "excitable temperament, uncertain judgement based on rumour and personal experience and his tendency to over-exaggerate problems did not suit him to be in command of the army. At best, his more questionable decisions led to a lack of support for his ally at critical moments in the campaign; at worst, they threatened to wreck Joffre’s carefully laid plans for the counteroffensive." Senior is critical of his vetoing — out of excessive concern to avoid BEF losses — of Haig’s orders to attack on 29 August, his decision to pull the BEF out of the line on 30 August, only a few hours after promising to assist Fifth Army by delaying his retreat, and his countermanding of Haig's order to advance on 9 September. He also criticises him for his lack of any realistic appraisal of the state of II Corps after Le Cateau,&lt;ref&gt;Senior (p. 336) argues that after Mons von Kluck seems to have thought the BEF a spent force; at Le Cateau II Corps fought bravely, but were saved largely by German lack of urgency, and thereafter by von Kluck’s inability to catch the BEF up, not least as he believed wrongly that the British were retreating towards the Channel Ports. He appears to have discounted them until 8 September.&lt;/ref&gt; and "lack of urgency" in advance at the Marne, and writes that French would not have cooperated without the "brutal" intervention of Lord Kitchener.&lt;ref&gt;Senior 2012, pp. 335–36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Hastings]] is even less kind, arguing that French used his instructions from Kitchener (to husband the strength of the BEF and to avoid major engagements without French participation unless given Cabinet authority) as an excuse for "pusillanimity".&lt;ref&gt;Hastings 2013, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; He criticises him for lack of "grip" and for "moral collapse" during the retreat after Le Cateau, and describes him as "a poltroon", although also pointing out that his failings were no worse than those of many French and German generals in that campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings 2013, pp. 223, 241, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]] argues that French had no consistency in his strategic ideas, as was shown at the War Council in August 1914 when he proposed deploying the BEF to Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 126, 139–42, 196–98&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Beckett does not wholly agree with Holmes, arguing that French was consistent in December 1914 – January 1915 in wanting to promote what he saw as Britain's strategic interests by deploying Territorial and New Army Divisions in an offensive along the Belgian Coast to seize Zeebrugge, although he also remarks that such plans were not unique to French, as they continued to find favour with Haig in 1916–17, and that French's hopes for amphibious landings in the Baltic or North Sea had little practicality at this stage.&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p56-7"/&gt;

In his memoirs ''1914'' French wrote "no previous experience ... had led me to anticipate a war of positions. All my thoughts … were concentrated upon a [[War of Movement|war of movement]]." Although French's memoirs are often unreliable this passage is confirmed by what he wrote to Lt-Gen Edward Hutton in December 1914 that the war had become "a [[siege]] ... on a gigantic scale". Ian Beckett argues that in this respect, and in his recognition of the importance of artillery as early as the Battle of the Aisne in September 1914, French's tactical views were "marginally more flexible" than those of Haig, who continued to nurse hopes of breakthrough and decisive victory until several years later.&lt;ref&gt;Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1875, French married Isabella Soundy,&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; the daughter of a tradesman. Subalterns of that era were not expected to marry and French's first marriage may well have been kept secret from his regiment: his regiment is recorded incorrectly on the marriage certificate as "12th Hussars", a regiment that did not exist at the time. They divorced in 1878 with Isabella as a co-respondent and said to have been paid off by French's wealthy brother-in-law, John Lydall.  The divorce could have ruined his career if widely known. Lydall had already paid off French's debts on a previous occasion, and later broke off relations with him when he attempted to borrow money again.  Later still, when French's name was seen on newspaper headlines (most likely during the Curragh incident), he was observed to stomp off down the street muttering "sorry fellow, Jack French".&lt;ref name=heath130/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

French married Eleanora Selby-Lowndes in 1880.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Eleanore, one of seven sisters known as the "Belles of Bletchley", was somewhat older than he was.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; His first son [[John French, 2nd Earl of Ypres|John Richard Lowndes]] was born in Northumberland in 1881. A daughter was accidentally suffocated by her nurse in 1882.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p29"/&gt; His second son Gerald was born in December 1883.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p30"/&gt; Neither Eleanore, nor his daughter Essex (born late 1886, died 1979), were ever aware of his first marriage.&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, p.52-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; French gave away his niece Georgina Whiteway (daughter of his sister Caroline) in 1903 when she married Fitzgerald Watt, French’s stockbroker. Watt became, in uniform, his ADC as Inspector-General, then Private Secretary when CIGS, then trusted aide in the First World War.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p16"&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

As Inspector-General in the Edwardian Period French appears to have been largely separated from his wife, but she appears to have still loved him, and her children sided with her. In 1905, French purchased 20 Park Mansions from Watt as a base in London. He met George Moore, a wealthy American, in about 1909 and in 1910 they took a large house together at 94 Lancaster Gate as a base for partying and womanising.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, pp. 133–35&lt;/ref&gt; Eleanore did not accompany him to Ireland (officially, as it was too dangerous). From 1922, French re-established relations with his son Gerald, who began writing to defend his father's reputation in the 1930s, and his last publication was "The French-Kitchener Dispute: A Last Word" in 1960. Gerald French died in 1970.&lt;ref name="Bond &amp; Cave 2009, p52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

French had six sisters.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p15"/&gt; One sister, Catherine Harley, by then a widow, led a group of British nurses on the [[Macedonian front|Salonika Front]] and was killed by shellfire at Monastir in March 1917.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p16"/&gt; Another sister was the [[suffragette]], anti-war campaigner and Irish nationalist [[Sinn Féin]] member [[Charlotte Despard]], a Catholic convert.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; During the [[Irish War of Independence]], while her brother the Lord Lieutenant was directing operations against Sinn Féin, Despard, together with [[Maud Gonne]] and others, was through the Women's Prisoners' Defence League supporting republican prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Wdespard.htm |title=Charlotte Despard|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in January 1915 French had an affair with Mrs Winifred Bennett, the wife of a British diplomat and former mistress of one of his own officers, Jack Annesley, who was killed near Ypres in November 1914.  French wrote to her almost daily, sometimes signing himself "Peter Pan" and on the eve of Neuve Chapelle he wrote to her "Tomorrow I shall go forward with my war cry of 'Winifred'".&lt;ref name=heath134/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004 pp. 278–80&lt;/ref&gt; She was tall and elegant, and the disparity in their heights caused great amusement.&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, p.53"/&gt;

==French in popular culture==
After the Colesberg Operations (early 1900) the following verse was published about him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;There's a general of 'orse which is French,
You've 'eard of 'im o' course, fightin' French,
'E's a daisy, e's a brick, and e's up to every trick,
And 'e moves amazin' quick, don't yer French?
'E's so tough and terse
'E don't want no bloomin' nurse
and 'E ain't had one reverse
Ave yer, French?&lt;ref name="Reid 2006, p.52-3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 2004, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Boer War, the press lionised him as "Uncle French" and "the shirt-sleeved general", writing of how he smoked a briar pipe and enjoyed being mistaken for a private soldier.&lt;ref name="Holmes 2004, p119"/&gt;

At the beginning of the First World War a supporter of French, Arthur Campbell Ainger, tried, with little success, to popularise a marching song in honour of French. The words read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Do you ken John French with his khaki suit
His belt and gaiters and stout brown boot
Along with his guns and his horse and his foot
On the road to Berlin in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;A C Ainger, ''Marching Songs for Soldiers Adapted to Well Known Tunes'', London, 1914, Jarrold and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Field Marshal French was played by [[Laurence Olivier]] in [[Richard Attenborough]]'s World War I satire film ''[[Oh! What A Lovely War]]'' (1969). Ian Beckett writes that French and [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Wilson]] are portrayed almost as "a comic duo" in the film. By this time, although [[John Terraine|Terraine]]'s ''Mons: Retreat to Victory'' (1960), Alan Clark's ''The Donkeys'' (1961), and A. J. Smithers' ''The Man Who Disobeyed'' (a 1970 biography of Smith-Dorrien) kept up some interest in French, he was already becoming a somewhat forgotten figure as popular interest from the 1960s onwards concentrated on the Battle of the Somme, inevitably focussing attention on Douglas Haig.&lt;ref&gt;Bond &amp; Cave 2009, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russian the word ''[[French (tunic)|french]]'' (френч), a type of four-pocketed military tunic, is named after John French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=french |script-title=ru:френч |title-link=French (tunic) |encyclopedia=Большой толковый словарь |via=gramota.ru |language=Russian |url=http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/?bts=x&amp;word=%D1%84%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%87 |quote=Военная куртка в талию с четырьмя накладными карманами и хлястиком сзади.

This Polish invention was shared with the British in 1939, and the enormous task of manufacturing two complete sets of the sheets was supervised by Jeffreys.]]
'''John Robert Fisher Jeffreys''' (25 January 1916 &amp;ndash; 13 January 1944)&lt;ref&gt;England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1944&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[mathematician]] and [[World War II]] [[Cryptanalysis|codebreaker]].

A [[research fellow]] at [[Downing College]], Cambridge,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Welchman, ''The Hut Six Story'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffreys joined the [[codebreaking]] efforts at [[Bletchley Park]] in September 1939 alongside fellow Cambridge mathematicians [[Gordon Welchman]], with whom he had previously worked closely, and [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Budiansky, ''Battle of Wits'', 2000, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; These three, together with [[Peter Twinn]] and working under [[Dilly Knox]], formed the research section working on the German [[Enigma machine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]], ''Seizing the Enigma'', 1991, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; and were housed in "The Cottage" at Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Budiansky]], ''Battle of Wits'', 2000, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffreys was put in charge of a small section manufacturing perforated sheets for use in the [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma]], a task which took over three months, completed on 7 January 1940.&lt;ref name="erskine06"&gt;Ralph Erskine, "The Poles Reveal their Secrets: Alastair Denniston's Account of the July 1939 Meeting at Pyry", pp. 294-305, ''Cryptologia'' 30(4), December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; One type were the [[Zygalski sheets]], known as ''Netz'' at Bletchley Park, a technique revealed to the British by Polish cryptologists. Another type, named "Jeffreys sheets", were different, and were a "catalogue of the effect of any two Enigma rotors and the reflector".&lt;ref name="erskine06"/&gt; Jeffreys's perforated sheets were used by Polish cryptologists in exile in France to make the first wartime decryption of an Enigma message on 17 January 1940.&lt;ref name="erskine01"&gt;Ralph Erskine, "Breaking Air Force and Army Enigma", p. 53 in ''Action this Day'', edited by Ralph Erskine and Michael Smith, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1940, a section called "[[Hut 6]]" &amp;mdash; named after the building in which it was initially housed &amp;mdash; was created to work on solving German Army and Air Force Enigma messages. Jeffreys was chosen to run the hut alongside Welchman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mavis Batey]], "Breaking Italian Naval Enigma" p. 100 in ''Action this Day'', edited by Ralph Erskine and Michael Smith, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffreys was in charge of "Sheet-Stacking and Machine Room activities", while Welchman handled "Registration, Intercept Control, Decoding, and relations with the intelligence people in Hut 3".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Welchman, ''The Hut Six Story'', p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1940,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Welchman, ''The Hut Six Story'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffreys took a vacation, but became ill and was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name="welchman-103"&gt;Gordon Welchman, ''The Hut Six Story'', p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; He died in January 1944.

Gordon Welchman later recalled:
:"''Jeffreys was very much liked at Bletchley Park. His death was a tragic loss to all of us. We felt deep sympathy for his fianceé, Pat Hempsted, who had been a member of his team from its beginnings in the Cottage. She was involved both in the initial punching of the sheets and in the testing of drops on which our early breaks depended.''"&lt;ref name="welchman-103"/&gt;

'''Jonathan Lerman''' (born 1987) is an [[United States|American]] [[autistic savant]] [[outsider artist]]. He was born in [[Queens]], NY, and currently resides in the upstate New York suburb of [[Vestal, New York|Vestal]].

He began to lapse into long silences at the age of two, and the next year he was diagnosed with [[autism]]. His [[IQ]] is purported to be 53. His artistic bent appeared at the age of 10 years in the form of charcoal-drawn faces—both people he knows and those he imagines. In 1999, he had his own solo exhibition at the [[KS Art]] [[Art gallery|gallery]] in [[New York City]].

He has had personal exhibitions, and has also exhibited his work alongside others. He was also the subject of the [[MTV]] television program [[True Life]] in the episode "True Life: I Have Autism"&lt;ref name="MTV.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/episodes/gnc82y/true-life-i-have-autism-season-12-ep-9|title=True Life: I Have Autism|last=|first=|date=2007-03-15|website=MTV.com|publisher=MTV|access-date=2016-12-18|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his life as an autistic savant.

{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
Aquino was born in [[Quezon City]], Philippines, to [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino]] and [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.]] who was, at the time, a [[Senate of the Philippines|senator]] of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] regime. The youngest of five children, her siblings are: Maria Elena "Ballsy" A.

When she was a baby, her father was arrested and jailed; her mother raised Aquino and her siblings.&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/11/09/15/watch-kris-to-host-lunch-for-apec-first-ladies |title=WATCH: Kris to host lunch for APEC first ladies |publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]] |date= |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m.manila.coconuts.co"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.manila.coconuts.co/2015/11/10/there-are-10-first-ladies-who-confirmed-kris-aquinos-lunch |title=There are 10 first ladies who confirmed to Kris Aquino’s lunch &amp;#124; Coconuts Manila |website=M.manila.coconuts.co |date=10 November 2015 |accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mb.com.ph"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/kris-as-apec-2015-first-lady/ |title=Kris as APEC 2015 First Lady &amp;#124; mb.com.ph &amp;#124; Philippine News |website=Mb.com.ph |date= |accessdate=12 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121182237/http://www.mb.com.ph/kris-as-apec-2015-first-lady/ |archivedate=21 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Philippine parliamentary election, 1978|1978 parliamentary elections]] when her jailed father was a candidate, the seven-year-old Aquino was a stand-in for him at campaign rallies. She was featured on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and on the cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]''. Aquino spent most of her elementary school days in the [[United States]], where the Aquino family was in exile. When she was 12 years old, [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|her father was assassinated]] on the tarmac of the [[Manila International Airport]]. Kris Aquino returned to the Philippines and attended rallies against the Marcos regime.

After the [[Philippine Revolution of 1986]], which removed President Marcos from power, the teenage Aquino began guesting stints on television dramas and comedies, as well as talk shows. She made her film debut with actor-comedian [[Rene Requiestas]] in ''[[Pido Dida: Sabay Tayo|Pido Dida]]'', which was a blockbuster hit. Aquino had a commercially steady career, and managed to score an acting nomination for ''The Fatima Buen Story''. She starred in a film based on a true-to-life murder, the [[Vizconde massacre]]. Its financial success, and numerous starring appearances in crime films of the same vein, earned her the nickname "Massacre Queen" by newspaper critics.

==Education==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2016}}
Aquino finished her elementary school education at the Poveda Learning Center (now [[Saint Pedro Poveda College]]) in [[Mandaluyong City]]. She went to high school at the [[Colegio San Agustin-Makati]], where she was classmates with [[Pinky Webb]] and [[Karen Davila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://ph.news.yahoo.com/colegio-san-agustin-holds-batch-88-homecoming-165726944.html | title= Colegio San Agustin holds Batch `88 homecoming | date= 4 August 2013 | work= Yahoo! Philippines | accessdate= 20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature.

==Career==

===Television===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
With her movie career slowing, Aquino shifted her sights to a television career as a talk show host and gossiper with the launching of the talk show ''[[The Kris Aquino Show|Kris]]''. It was produced by [[VIVA Entertainment|Viva Television]] on [[National Broadcasting Network|Channel 4]] (at that time named PTV, it was transferred to [[GMA Network]], which had a partnership with Viva, and after Viva's contract with PTV ended). It was on GMA Network's showbiz oriented talk show ''[[Startalk (Philippine TV series)|Startalk]]'', which she co-hosted with [[Boy Abunda]] and Lolit Solis, that her hosting skills attracted attention.

After GMA and Viva dropped her, she went back to [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]], where she was offered a contract and launched ''[[Today with Kris Aquino]]''. from 2002 to 2004, she hosted the talk show ''[[Morning Girls with Kris and Korina]]'', alongside known broadcast journalist [[Korina Sanchez]], which was intended to last for only two weeks, but went on for 16 months. In 2007, she officially left ''[[The Buzz (talk show)|The Buzz]]'' and ''[[Pilipinas, Game Ka Na Ba?]]'' after giving birth to her second son, James Bimby. She was replaced by [[Edu Manzano]] on ''Pilipinas, Game KNB?''. According to Aquino, she had to give up her hosting stint on the shows to devote more time to her live-in partners. She may not have wanted to return to ''The Buzz'' because she no longer wanted to work with former co-host [[Cristy Fermin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Buzz: Kris out, Ruffa in!|publisher=Philippine Star|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=80212|accessdate=3 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714124742/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=80212|archivedate=14 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the October 2008 issue of ''YES! Magazine'', Aquino was named the leading celebrity endorser, ranking number one among the 20 favorite celebrity endorsers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PEP EXCLUSIVE: Kris Aquino reveals where most of her endorsement fees this year went|date=29 September 2008|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/19335/PEP-EXCLUSIVE:-Kris-Aquino-reveals-where-most-of-her-endorsement-fees-this-year-went/3|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquino hosted the ''[[Kapamilya, Deal or No Deal|Philippine franchise]]'' of ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', which is part of ABS-CBN's primetime lineup. It ended its first season on 23 February 2007. The second season of the game show started on 11 June 2007. On 5 May 2008, she appeared on the US version as part of a ''Deal or No Deal'' "around the world" event which was hosted by [[Howie Mandel]] where an American contestant was taken to an international location, and played the game in that country, with the local models and host assisting Mandel. She hosts ''[[Boy &amp; Kris]]'', a morning talk show that replaced ''Homeboy,'' together with [[Boy Abunda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy Abunda confirms new show with Kris Aquino|date=14 June 2007|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/13626/Boy-Abunda-confirms-new-show-with-Kris-Aquino}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Be Bench'', a model search show together with [[Piolo Pascual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bench launches reality TV model search|date=21 July 2007|publisher=Manila Bulletin|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/archive_pages.php?url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/07/21/ENTR2007072198238.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kris Aquino and Piolo Pascual team up in "Be Bench"|date=29 July 2007|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal|url=http://www.pep.ph/articles/13263/Kris-Aquino-and-Piolo-Pascual-team-up-in-%E2%80%9CBe-Bench%E2%80%9D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nestor Torre, a critic of the entertainment industry in the Philippines, posted that Aquino took a lot of risks when she chose to give up her two former shows. He pointed out that giving up ''The Buzz'' and ''Pilipinas, Game KNB?'' deprived her of the major exposure that those two popular shows afforded her. He noted that it is much more difficult to launch new shows successfully than to resume hosting programs that are already popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New hosting options for Kris, who’s making a comeback|date=21 June 2007|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=72434|accessdate=3 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922230713/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=72434|archivedate=22 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She hosted another TV franchise, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (Philippine game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', which replaced ''[[Kapamilya, Deal or No Deal]]''. She said in an interview that she was a huge fan of the US version and was thrilled to bring the show back to her country. (''Wheel of Fortune'' had already had one 2001-2002 run in the Philippines, which was hosted by [[Rustom Padilla]] and Victoria Wonderheim.) She hosted ''Showbiz News Ngayon'' during its newest season. In October 2008, after former ''The Buzz'' co-host Cristy Fermin was suspended by ABS-CBN, the Kapamilya network asked Aquino to once again host the top-rated, showbiz-oriented talk show with Boy Abunda and Ruffa Gutierrez. After much controversy, Aquino hosted ''The Buzz'' again beginning on 26 October 2008.

She officially left ''Showbiz News Ngayon'' In 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kris bows out in June from ‘The Buzz’, ‘SNN’|date=20 May 2013|publisher=Inquirer.net|url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20100520-271122/Kris-bows-out-in-June-from-Buzz-SNN|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523095335/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20100520-271122/Kris-bows-out-in-June-from-Buzz-SNN|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Buzz'' In 2010, after being an on-and-off main host of the show for 10 years. The reason she gave for leaving the show was that she would be spending time with her family and sought to prevent any issues while her brother [[Benigno Aquino III]] was in office as president of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kris Aquino says goodbye to The Buzz|date=28 June 2013|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/26023/Kris-Aquino-says-goodbye-to--The-Buzz-}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kris Aquino bids goodbye to The Buzz|date=28 June 2013|publisher=abs-cbnNEWS.com|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/06/27/10/kris-aquino-bids-goodbye-buzz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite taking a leave for her family, she hosted ABS-CBN's new noontime variety show called ''[[Pilipinas Win Na Win]]'', but left after two months at the decision of the management. In late 2011, Aquino returned and hosted her new morning talk show titled ''Kris TV'' on ABS-CBN.&lt;ref name="leaving"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kris Aquino says she's leaving ABS-CBN|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2016/03/09/1561070/kris-aquino-says-leaving-abs-cbn|accessdate=9 March 2016|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first anniversary of the show, the management, and Aquino invited [[Francis Escudero|Chiz Escudero]] as co-host and special guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://abscbnpr.com/kris-teams-up-with-chiz-in-kris-tv/ | title= Kris teams up with Chiz in "Kris TV" | date= 30 June 2012 | work= ABS-CBN Social Media Newsroom | accessdate= 20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would later take a break from showbiz following a dispute with [[James Yap]], her ex-husband.&lt;ref name="leaving"/&gt;

On 8 March 2016, Aquino announced that she would be leaving ABS-CBN on 23 March, due to health issues and to spend more time with her family.&lt;ref name="leaving"/&gt;

===Film===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2016}}
Aquino got her start in film with the help of [[Regal Films]], one of the oldest film companies in the Philippines, appearing in  ''[[Pido Dida: Sabay Tayo]]''.  Her early film appearances include the Pido Dida series, in which she was paired with comedian [[Rene Requiestas]] and earned her first box office queen award.  She later shifted to roles in massacre films, including ''Vizconde Massacre'', ''Myrna Diones Story'', ''Elsa Castillo-Ang Katotohanan'', and ''Humanda Ka Mayor''.

She first drew praise for her acting in ''The Fatima Buen Story''. She eventually won a supporting actress award for the movie ''[[Mano Po]]'' (2002 Regal Films), in which she portrayed a weak-willed and submissive scion of a wealthy Filipino-Chinese clan. She appeared in the 2004 film  ''[[So Happy Together (film)|So... Happy Together]]''. The most commercially successful movies in her career include ''[[Feng Shui (2004 film)|Feng Shui]]'', a [[Star Cinema]] production that featured Chinese influences and omen. ''Feng Shui'', which was made during the wave of "Asian-style horror" flicks that spread throughout the continent after 2002's ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', made P137 million. It was the highest grossing Filipino movie of 2004, and the second most successful movie overall that year, next to ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', which earned more than P225 million. In 2006, ''Sukob'', another horror thriller, became the highest grossing Filipino film of all time surpassing ''[[Ang Tanging Ina]]'', ''[[Anak]]'', and ''Feng Shui''.

Aquino had her share of [[box office bomb]]s. Her 2003 movie with actor [[Robin Padilla]], ''You and Me Against the World'', was an outright box office flop. Made for P25,000,000 and released immediately after Aquino won acting awards for her performance in 2002's ''Mano Po'', ''You and Me Against the World'' made only P4,389,005. The film's producers lost an estimated P23,000,000, even accounting for home videos. Because ''You and Me Against the World'' failed to attract an audience, several movie theaters pulled the film and replaced it with another film. Some theaters reportedly did this on the movie's second day of play.

In June 2012, ''[[Kimmy Dora and the Temple of Kiyeme|Kimmy Dora]]'' Part 2 was finally showing in all theaters nationwide in the Philippines, produced by Star Cinema of ABS-CBN and directed by Bb. Joyce Bernal. Aquino portrayed a particular role in the movie sequence. Some parts of the movie were filmed in [[Seoul]], South Korea.

She is executive editor of a bimonthly magazine called ''K! The Kris Aquino Magazine''. In December 2009, Aquino showcased her home collection called ''K Everyday''. In partnership with [[ABS-CBN|ABS-CBN Licensing]], ''K Everyday'' features cooking, kitchen-wares, plastic, and stationery collections.&lt;ref name="Pep.ph"/&gt;

On 16 April 2017, she announced via her Instagram account that she will be starring in a "big Hollywood studio movie about to start filming."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/167081-kris-aquino-hollywood-movie-contract-los-angeles|title=Kris Aquino to sign Hollywood movie contract|work=Rappler|access-date=16 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movie turned out to be [[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|''Crazy Rich Asians'']], in which she played the role of Princess Intan.

==Personal life==
Aquino had a live-in relationship with married actor [[Phillip Salvador]], with whom she has a son named Joshua. In 2003, she dated comedian John Lemuel Garces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/38043/pep-special-report-a-kris-aquino-timeline-from-joey-marquez-to-james-yap?|title= PEP SPECIAL REPORT.

[[File:Voodoo - Search for the Spirit &amp; Voodoo - Truth and Fantasy.jpg|thumb|left|300px|US edition (left) and UK edition.]]
Rooted in the [[history of Haiti]], Laënnec Hurbon presents us [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] in this small but copiously illustrated book, entitled {{lang|fr|Les mystères du vaudou}} (lit. "The Mysteries of Vodou"; US edition – ''Voodoo: Search for the Spirit''; UK edition – ''Voodoo: Truth and Fantasy''), which Christiane Veauvy—a researcher at [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]—calls it "a great achievement", and "the iconography is of exceptional beauty", in her article dedicated to this book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/homso_0018-4306_1993_num_110_4_3350 |title=Laënnec Hurbon, ''Les mystères du Vaudou'', Paris, Gallimard, 1993, (Coll. « Découvertes. Religions ») [compte-rendu] |last=Veauvy |first=Christiane |date=1993 |website=[[Persée (web portal)|persee.fr]] |language=fr |access-date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After so many persecutions—those of the slave society, the Catholic Church, the racism, the horror sensations because of devils and [[Zombie#Haitian tradition|zombies]], also of Haitian authorities after the [[History of Haiti#Independence: The early years (1804–43)|independence]], even though Vodou has supported the freedom to slaves—after the drastic political exploitation by [[François Duvalier]], Vodou remains "one of the most inalienable cultural resources of [[Haitians|Haitian people]]". The book also suggests the complex role played by Vodou in the fall of Duvalier's dictatorship.

The plan of the work is dictated by this historico-political perspective, there are seven chapters: Ⅰ, "The Great Crossing"; Ⅱ, "Voodoo Hidden in the Hell of Slavery"; Ⅲ, "Campaigns Against Sorcery"; Ⅳ, "The Spirit of the 'Lwa'"; Ⅴ, "The Cult of the Dead"; Ⅵ, "'Manjé-Lwa', 'Dansé-Lwa': The Services"; Ⅶ, "An Astonishing Survival". The first three chapters trace the history of Vodou in Haiti from "the great crossing" to the time of the [[United States occupation of Haiti|American occupation]] (1915–1934) and the advent of Duvalier (chap. Ⅲ), going through the period when "Vodou hidden in the hell of slavery" (chap. Ⅱ). It is only then that Hurbon systematically exposes the beliefs and practices of Vodou as a system articulating a mythology, rituals and standards of behaviour (chaps. Ⅳ–Ⅵ).

The last chapter is devoted to the "astonishing survival" of Vodou. Hurbon addresses the issue of the establishment of Protestant sects that "by passing off all the ''[[Loa|lwa]]'' as evil or satanic forces, the message of the Protestant sects revives the fantasy of sorcery", and also questions whether "Voodoo has a tendency to draw its worshippers towards the past, placing them under the authority of tradition (symbolized by the dead, the ancestors, the ''lwa'') rather than more flexible rules, subject to modern rational thinking?" Whatever the case may be, Vodou is "a piece of worldwide cultural patrimony", and a civilisation "extending from Africa to the Americas". The following "Documents" section containing a compilation of excerpts which is divided into six parts: 1, The devil, voodoo and the missionaries; 2, The antisuperstitious campaigns; 3, How the ''lwa'' show themselves to humans; 4, For the rehabilitation of voodoo; 5, Voodoo in art; 6, People travel, so do spirits. These are followed by a glossary, chronology, further reading, list of illustrations and index. With this work, the reader can have a complete and excellent point about Vodou in its many dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/assr_0335-5985_1997_num_98_1_1107_t1_0078_0000_4 |title=Hurbon (Laënnec). ''Les Mystères du vaudou'' [compte-rendu] |last=Champion |first=Françoise |date=1997 |website=[[Persée (web portal)|persee.fr]] |language=fr |access-date=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is profusely illustrated with colour plates—drawings, photographs, Haitian paintings, etc.—so it could also serve indirectly as a study of [[Haitian Vodou art|Haitian Vodou iconography]]. It has been translated into American and British English, Korean, Russian and Spanish. Professor [[Patrick Bellegarde-Smith]] notes that the original French edition printed many of the black and white photographs in the "Documents" section on better paper than the English edition; and also the mistranslation of the term {{lang|fr|Vaudou}} by using ''Voodoo'' instead of ''Vodou''.&lt;ref name="Review" /&gt;

'''Leonora Sansay''' (December 11, 1773 – 1821) was an American novelist. She was the author of ''Secret History; or, The Horrors of [[Saint-Domingue|St. Domingo]], in a Series of Letters Written by a [[Lady]] at [[Cap-François|Cape Francois]] to [[Aaron Burr|Col. Burr]], late Vice-President of the United States, Principally During the Command of [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|General Rochambeau]]'' ([[Philadelphia]], 1808) and ''Laura'' (Philadelphia, 1809), and possibly three other novels: ''Zelica: The Creole'' (London, 1820); ''The Scarlet Handkerchief'' (London, 1823); and ''The Stranger in Mexico'' (not extant).

==Biography==
She was born '''Honora Davern''' in Philadelphia on December 11, 1773 to Rosa and William Davern, the latter of whom died at sea a few weeks after her birth, probably in January 1774. On Valentine's Day 1779, her mother married a Philadelphia innkeeper named William Hassel (sometimes Hassal); Sansay's stepfather maintained Hassal's [[Tavern]] (or The Half Moon — a generic [[Pub names|name for an English pub]]), which was located across from the State House ([[Independence Hall]]), where local politicians and members of Congress often met informally.

Rosa and William Hassel had two children of their own, Sansay's half-siblings, Mary (born November 12, 1781) and William (born December 24, 1784). Incidentally, it was Mary who has often been mistakenly credited with the authorship of ''Secret History'' and ''Laura'' (the mistake derives from the name of the author-character of ''Secret History,'' also named Mary). (For Leonora's and siblings' birth dates, Rosa &amp; Hassel's marriage, and other early biographical details, see Jennifer Van Bergen, ''Reconstructing Leonora Sansay''.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer van Bergen.[http://www.a-w-i-p.com/index.php/2010/01/03/reconstructing-leonora-sansay "Reconstructing Leonora Sansay - Another World Is Possible"], January 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;)

At some point in the mid- to late 1790s (she shows up in the Philadelphia City Directory for 1796 as "Eleonora Hassel, [[Gentlewoman]]"), Sansay met [[Aaron Burr]], who became her confidant and [[patron]]. (Sansay stated that she met him after the death of her fiancé, who had left a letter leaving her and their unborn child "to his protection."&lt;ref&gt;''Laura'' [Drexler, ed.] 216.&lt;/ref&gt; While there are scattered references in ''Secret History'' to Leonora's son, it is unknown what became of her child, if indeed she did have one.) Some scholars believe Burr and Sansay were lovers, but this is contested by Van Bergen. Burr continued to play an important role in Sansay's life until she disappeared from the historical record.

Leonora writes in ''Secret History'' that Burr convinced her to marry Louis Sansay (''St. Louis''), then a New York merchant having fled his [[plantation]] in [[Saint-Domingue]] (now [[Haïti]]), a French colony subject to a massive slave uprising that would ultimately end with the declaration of Haitian Independence in 1804. In early 1802, Louis Sansay made plans to return to Haiti to reclaim his property. He sent Leonora to visit Burr in Washington to obtain letters of recommendation and a passport for Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Sansay to Aaron Burr, March 22, 1802 (NY Hist. Society - NHi:2042.)&lt;/ref&gt; Corroborating the purpose of Leonora's visit, Burr also wrote to his cousin, [[Pierpont Edwards]]:

{{quote|Madame Sansay will sail with her husband for St. Domingo (I believe the [[Cap-Haïtien|Cape]]) in a few Days -- She is the Lady of whom you may have heard me speak under the Name of Leonora, married about two years ago to Mr. Sansay a reputable french Merch[an]t. formerly of that Island but for some Years past resident of N York - I pray you to give Made. S. a very Warm letter of introduction to General Rochambeau [the French Commander at Haiti] -- You may speak very highly of her talents, her acquirements and her accomplishments - She speaks &amp; writes french &amp; has more sense &amp; information than all the women to be found in St. Dom. -- Enclose the letter to her and direct as underneath -- leave open your letter to Rochambeaud &amp; pray let it be written and signed in a legible hand.&lt;ref&gt;Mary-Jo Kline, ''Political Correspondence &amp; Public Papers of AB'' 2:702.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Louis Sansay wrote Burr several letters during the time Leonora stayed in Washington with Burr. In these letters, Louis asked that, "considering the affection and the attachment that you always have attested for [Leonora]", Burr would "employ yourself for us ... to obtain for me at the expense of the French government my passage [to Haiti] and that of my wife, my daughter and of my two servants by making him see that I am without means."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Sansay to Aaron Burr, March 22, 1802 (NY Hist. Society - NHi:2042.)&lt;/ref&gt; Louis thanked Burr for "all the kindnesses that you were willing to show for her and for me" and informed Burr that he was taking Leonora with him to Haiti (despite the dangers there), that he hoped Burr would urge her to return to New York as soon as possible to set sail with Louis, "as it is impossible for me to be happy without her possession very near."&lt;ref&gt;Louis Sansay to Aaron Burr, March 29, 1802 (NY Hist. Society - NHi:2042.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Each subsequent letter after Louis' first one manifested increasing anxiety on his part about Leonora. Finally, on April 2, Louis wrote Burr with "horrible anxiety" about Leonora, saying it had been nine days and he had received only one letter from her, claiming he feared she was ill, but contradicting himself by charging her with "flightineses and fickleness" and claiming "I tremble that her intention is to abandon me." Declaring he would "sacrifice even my life rather than to see her in the possession of another," Louis begged Burr "to reassure my heart, which is broken with pain," "to urge her to come back as promptly as possible." Trying to convince Burr that he only had "her happiness and mine" at heart, Louis promised to bestow $12,000 dollars upon her (even though in his 3/22 letter, he had stated that "after all the misfortunes that I endured, sir, recently and my resources being almost exhausted") if Burr could manage to get her to go to Haiti with him.&lt;ref&gt;LS to AB, April 2, 1802, NHi:2042. Translations of Louis Sansay's letters from original French by Denis Olivier, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonora returned to Louis and the couple embarked for Haiti in late May or early June.&lt;ref&gt;See Mary-Jo Kline, ''Political Correspondence &amp; Public Papers of Aaron Burr,''(1983), 2:703n2.&lt;/ref&gt; From Haiti, Sansay continued corresponding with Burr; these letters form the basis for Sansay's first book, ''Secret History''. They describe the final days of French rule on the island.

After departing Haiti, Leonora and Louis lived for a time in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;See Matthew L. Davis, ''Memoirs of Aaron Burr,'' 2:326.&lt;/ref&gt; But when his "intolerable and groundless jealousy" grew to the point where "[i]n every man that approached me he saw a rival" and when he "came home [one night] in a transport of fury, dragged me from my bed, said it was his intention to destroy me, and swore that he would render me horrible by rubbing aqua-fortis [nitric acid] in my face," Leonora left him, escaping in the dark of night to a remote village 12 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Secret History'' (1808, 1971) pp.&amp;nbsp;186–90; (2007) [Drexler, ed.], pp.&amp;nbsp;138–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Sansay made her way to Jamaica and back to Philadelphia. She next played a part in [[Burr conspiracy|Burr's alleged 1806–07 conspiracy]], for which he was indicted (and acquitted) for high misdemeanor and treason in 1807. Sansay appears in a March 1, 1808 news item in ''The Richmond Enquirer'' under one of her pseudonyms, '''Madame D'Auvergne''', an apparent francisation of her birth name (Davern). (See Thomas Abernethy, ''Burr Conspiracy'' (1954), p.&amp;nbsp;270 - Robert T. Spence testified he had sailed from Philadelphia to [[New Orleans]] "with [[Eric Bollman|Bollman]], Alexander, and a Madame D'Auvergne, alias Nora Haskel"]. See also Davis, ''Private Journal of AB,'' Mrs. --- to Burr, 11-6-1808, 1:78-79 - "Just before I left New-Orleans I received a present of elegant medals from my friend in Mexico." Architect [[Benjamin Latrobe]] also noted Leonora's presence in New Orleans: Benjamin H. Latrobe, ''The Correspondence and Miscellaneous Papers of Benjamin Henry Latrobe,'' John C. Van Horne and Lee W. Formwalt, eds., Papers Of Benjamin Henry Latrobe Series, Series 4, 1805-1810. (New Haven, 1987), 2:259 - He wrote to Lewis DeMun in New Orleans: "If you see M. D'Avergne [sic], say every thing that the sincerest respect would prompt.")

After the Burr trial, Sansay returned again to Philadelphia and wrote and published ''Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo, in a Series of Letters Written by a Lady at Cape Francois to Col. Burr, late Vice-President of the United States, Principally During the Command of General Rochambeau''. The following year, Sansay's ''Laura'' appeared in print from the same press, Bradford &amp; Inskeep. She set up a flower manufacturing business with the help of [[Eric Bollman]].&lt;ref&gt;See "Mrs. L****** [Phila.] to Burr, July 29, 1812, in Matthew L. Davis, ed., ''Private Journal of Aaron Burr'' (1838, 1970) pp. 440-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
Sansay makes periodic appearances in Burr's correspondence, though the vast majority of these letters have been lost. Burr shared her letters with [[Jeremy Bentham]] while in exile in Europe after his acquittal.

Further references to Leonora may be found under the names "'''Clara'''" and "Mme. D'Auvergne" in Burr's "Private Journal" at: 1:30 [Eric Bollman to AB, 8-11-1808]; 1:78 [Mrs. --- to Burr &lt;Phila.&gt;, 11-6-1808](also in Drexler, pp.&amp;nbsp;231–32); 1:84-85 [Bollman to AB, 11-12/1808, corroborates Mrs. --- 11-6 letter]; 1:146 [Burr journal entry, 1-20-1809]; 1:149 [Burr journal entry, 2-1-1809; Davis footnote identifying Clara as "Madame D'Auvergne, but better known as Leonora Sansay, author of the Horrors of St. Domingo"]; 1:170 [AB to Jeremy Bentham, 1-23-1809]; 1:242 [Theodosia Burr Alston to AB, 5-31-1809]; 2:440-46 [Mrs. L****** to AB (Phila.), 7-29-1812 - refers to Bollman](also in Drexler, pp.&amp;nbsp;232–35).

More references are in M.L. Davis ''Memoirs of AB'': 2:175 [Mrs. ****** to AB, 2-9-1802 - 2 months before her departure for Haiti; not ascertained to be from LS]; 2:323 [AB to TBA, 7-10-1804 - letters of Clara sometimes "L" - shortly before Burr's duel]; 2:326 [AB to Joseph Alston, 7-10-1804, "Madame Sansay, too well known under the name of Leonora, has claims on my recollection."]. See also Charles Burdett, ''Margaret Moncrieffe: The First Love of Aaron Burr'' (1860), pp.&amp;nbsp;428–37, reprinted in Michael J. Drexler's edition of ''Secret History'' and ''Laura,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;223–31. And Mary-Jo Kline, ''Political Correspondence &amp; Public Papers of Aaron Burr'' (1983) 2:70, AB to Pierpont Edwards, 3-20-1802.

Interesting apochrypha: A [http://www.leonorasansay.com/uploads/2/4/5/4/24547507/inscription.jpg notation on the flyleaf] of an [http://www.leonorasansay.com/photos3.html original edition of ''Secret History''] (1808) in the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]], reads (partly accurate, partly inaccurate): "[T]his book was written by Miss Hassal[.] Her Father kept the Sign of ye 1/2 Moon opposite ye State House. -- She had a Sister who married one of ye Indian's [Creole?] on a Visit here in 1791. -- She went with them but I believe was never hea[r]d from after." [[Maxwell Struthers Burt]] wrote in ''Philadelphia: Holy Experiment'' (1947) that Sansay was "mysterious and will remain mysterious," adding "Discreet historians have abandoned her in despair on the principles that if you ignore something it won't bite you" (p.&amp;nbsp;236).

Two other novels may be attributed to Sansay: ''Zelica, the Creole'' (1820) and ''The Scarlet Handkerchief'' (1823). Both were published in London, but indicate that they were transmitted from America. The flyleaf for "Zelica, the Crole" advertises the author's other works as follows: "In the press, by the same author, The Scarlet Handkerchief, 3 vols. The Stranger in Mexico, 3 vols. Which, with Zelica, the Creole, now published, from a Series of Novels that have been transmitted to the Publisher from America" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librarycompany.org/gothic/images/10.7.jpg "Photocopy of flyleaf, Library Company of Philadelphia"]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise,  [http://www.leonorasansay.com/photos2.html "The Scarlet Handkerchief"] credits "An American, also the author of Zelica, the Creole" as its author. The third novel, ''A Stranger in Mexico'', is promoted, though no copies have been found.  It is unknown why or when Sansay traveled to England, but she appears to have died there.  Her interment on November 12, 1821 in the Parish of Newent, County of Gloucester is recorded in the Church of England Burials.

She used her influence to institute [[classical liberalism|liberal]] reforms. At the start of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], she was forced to flee. She proceeded to the United States via Switzerland, France and London, returning to her work as an entertainer and lecturer.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Lola Montez portrait by Josef Heigel before 1840.jpg|thumb|Lola Montez portrait by {{ill|Joseph Heigel|de}} before 1840]]
[[File:LolaMontes(Lithographie)).jpg|thumb|Lola Montez's lithographie]]

Lola's mother, Eliza(beth) Oliver was the child of Charles Silver Oliver, a former High Sheriff of Cork and member of [[Parliament of Ireland|Parliament]] for [[Kilmallock (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Kilmallock]] in County Limerick. Their residence was [[Castle Oliver]]. In December 1818, Ensign Edward Gilbert met Eliza Oliver when he arrived with the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers|25th Regiment]]. They were married on 29 April 1820, and Lola was born the following February, refuting persistent rumours that her mother was pregnant with her at the time of the wedding.&lt;ref name="sligo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lola Montez 1821-1861|url=http://www.sligotown.net/lola-montez.shtml?i=1|website=Sligo Town|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young family made their residence at King House in [[Boyle, County Roscommon|Boyle]], [[County Roscommon]], until early 1823, when they journeyed to [[Liverpool]], thence departing for [[British India|India]] on 14 March.&lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce |last=Seymour |title=Lola Montez, a Life |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780300063479 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=F4DCffNBbPMC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many other aspects of her life, discrepant reports of the birth of Eliza Gilbert have been published. For many years, it was accepted that she was born in the city of [[Limerick]], as she herself claimed, possibly on 23 June 1818; this year was graven on her headstone. However, when her baptismal certificate came to light in the late 1990s, it was established that Eliza Rosanna Gilbert was actually born in [[Grange, County Sligo|Grange]], [[County Sligo]], on 17 February 1821.&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;{{cite web |first=Anne |last=Roper |date=2006 |url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/hiddenhistory/hernamewaslola.html |title=Her name was Lola |website=RTÉ Television |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504132917/http://www.rte.ie/tv/hiddenhistory/hernamewaslola.html |archivedate=4 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was baptized at St Peter's Church in Liverpool on 16 February 1823, while her family was ''en route'' to her father's post in India.

Shortly after their arrival in India, Edward Gilbert died of [[cholera]].&lt;ref name="spartacus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lola Montez|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WWmontezL.htm|website=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother, who was now 19, married another officer, Lieutenant Patrick Craigie, the following year. Craigie quickly came to care for a young Eliza, but her spoiled and half-wild ways concerned him greatly.&lt;ref name="headstuff"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conliffe|first1=Ciaran|title=Lola Montez, the Spider Woman - Part 1 - Headstuff|url=https://www.headstuff.org/history/lola-montez-the-spider-woman-part-1/|website=Headstuff|accessdate=1 May 2018|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, it was agreed she would be sent back to Britain to attend school, staying with Craigie's father in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], Scotland, at first. But the "queer, wayward little Indian girl" rapidly became known as a mischief-maker.&lt;ref name="headstuff" /&gt; On one occasion, she stuck flowers into the wig of an elderly man during a church service; on another, she ran through the streets naked.&lt;ref name="another"&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Reynolds|first1=Shola|title=Meet Lola Montez: Dancer, Countess, Whip-Wielding Socialist|url=http://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/8694/meet-lola-montez-dancer-countess-whip-wielding-socialist|website=AnOther|accessdate=1 May 2018|language=en|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of ten, Eliza was moved on again – this time to [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], England. When her stepfather's older sister, Catherine Rae, set up a boarding school in [[Monkwearmouth]] with her husband, Eliza joined them to continue her education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/daily/Racy-life-of-our-Lola.1404162.jp|title=Racy Life of Our Lola|accessdate=30 March 2008 |publisher=Sunderland Echo|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="headstuff" /&gt;

Eliza's determination and temper were to become her trademarks. Her stay in Sunderland lasted only a year, as she was then transferred to a school in Camden Place (now [[Camden Crescent, Bath|Camden Crescent]]), Bath for a more sophisticated education.&lt;ref name="headstuff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raffael |first1=Michael |title=Bath Curiosities |date=2006 |publisher=Birlinn |isbn=978-1841585031 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, 16-year-old Eliza eloped with Lieutenant Thomas James, and they married.&lt;ref name="irishtimes1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Pádraig|title=An Irishman's Diary on the glamorous and dangerous  Lola Montez|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/an-irishman-s-diary-on-the-glamorous-and-dangerous-lola-montez-1.1867228|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=1 May 2018|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cannon|first1=Michael|title=Montez, Lola (1821–1861)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/montez-lola-4226|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple separated five years later, in [[Calcutta]], and she became a professional dancer under a stage name.&lt;ref name="irishtimes1" /&gt;

She had her London debut as "Lola Montez, the Spanish dancer" in June 1843, but she had been recognized as "Mrs. James". The resulting notoriety hampered her career in England and she departed for the continent, where she had success in Paris and Warsaw.&lt;ref name="irishtimes1" /&gt; At this time, she was almost certainly accepting favours from a few wealthy men, and was regarded by many as a courtesan.&lt;ref name="eireann"&gt;{{cite web|title=1861 – Death of Eliza Gilbert (Lola Montez).|url=https://stairnaheireann.net/2014/01/17/1821-birth-of-eliza-gilbert-lola-montez/|website=Stair na hÉireann/History of Ireland|accessdate=1 May 2018|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life as a courtesan===
[[File:Joseph Karl Stieler-Lola Montez1847.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Lola Montez (1847), painted by [[Joseph Karl Stieler]] for [[Ludwig I, King of Bavaria|Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and his ''[[Schönheitengalerie]]''&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:C Buchner - Lola Montez Guache 1847 (115).jpg|thumb|Lola Montez ([[Gouache]] by {{ill|Carl Buchner|de}}, 1847)]]

In 1844, Lola made a personally disappointing Parisian stage début as a dancer in [[Fromental Halévy]]'s opera, ''[[Le lazzarone]]''. She met and had an affair with [[Franz Liszt]], who introduced her to the circle of [[George Sand]]. After performing in various European capitals, she settled in Paris, where she was accepted in the rather Bohemian literary society of the time, being acquainted with [[Alexandre Dumas père]], with whom she was rumoured to have had a dalliance. In Paris she would meet Alexandre Dujarier, "owner of the newspaper with the highest circulation in France, and also the newspaper's drama critic."  Through their romance Montez revitalized her career as a dancer.  Later on, after the two had their first quarrel over Lola's attendance to a party, Dujarier would attend the party and then in a drunken state offend Jean-Bapiste Rosemond de Beauvallon.  Dujarier would be challenged to a duel by de Beauvallon and would be shot and killed.&lt;ref name="48LawsPower77"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Robert|title=The 48 Laws of Power|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2000|page=77|isbn=978-0-14-028019-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, she arrived in [[Munich]], where she was discovered by and became the mistress of [[Ludwig I, King of Bavaria|Ludwig I of Bavaria]].&lt;ref name="48LawsPower77"/&gt; The rumour was, at the time they met, Ludwig had asked her in public if her bosom was real, to which her response was to tear off enough of her garments to prove that it was.&lt;ref&gt;BBC - Woman's Hour - January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Morton, ''Lola Montez - Her Life and Conquests'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; She soon began to use her influence on the King and this, coupled with her arrogant manner and outbursts of temper, made her unpopular with the local population (particularly after documents were made public showing that she was hoping to become a naturalized Bavarian citizen and be elevated to nobility). Despite the opposition, Ludwig made her Countess of Landsfeld on his next birthday, 25 August 1847. Along with her title, he granted her a large annuity.&lt;ref name=amer&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Montez, Lola|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colliers&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Montez, Lola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than a year, she exercised great political power, which she directed in favor of [[liberalism]], against the conservatives and the [[Jesuits]].&lt;ref name="amer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colliers"/&gt; Her influence became so great that the [[ultramontane]] administration of [[Karl von Abel]] was dismissed because that minister objected to her being made Countess Landsfeld. The students of the university were divided in their sympathies, and conflicts arose shortly before the outbreak of the [[revolutions of 1848]], which led the King, at Lola's instigation, to close the university.&lt;ref name=amcyc&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Lola Montez}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1848, under pressure from a growing revolutionary movement, the university was re-opened, Ludwig abdicated, and Montez fled Bavaria, her career as a power behind the throne at an end.&lt;ref name="eireann" /&gt;&lt;ref name=amcyc/&gt; It seems likely that Ludwig's relationship with Montez contributed greatly to the fall from grace of the previously popular king.&lt;ref name="48LawsPower78"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greene| first=Robert|title=The 48 Laws of Power|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2000|page=78|isbn= 978-0-14-028019-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a sojourn in Switzerland, where she waited in vain for Ludwig to join her, she made one brief excursion to France and then removed to London in late 1848. There she met and quickly married George Trafford Heald, a young army [[Cornet (military rank)|cornet]] (cavalry officer) with a recent inheritance.&lt;ref name="48LawsPower78"/&gt; But the terms of her divorce from Thomas James did not permit either spouse's remarriage while the other was living, and the beleaguered newly-weds were forced to flee the country to escape a bigamy action brought by Heald's scandalized maiden aunt.&lt;ref name="48LawsPower78"/&gt; The Healds resided for a time in France and Spain, but within two years, the tempestuous relationship was in tatters, and George reportedly drowned.&lt;ref name = "Cannon1974" /&gt; In 1851 she set off to make a new start in the United States, where she was surprisingly successful at first in rehabilitating her image.&lt;ref name="Seymour"/&gt;

===United States===

[[File:Lola Montez Caricature Departure for America.jpg|thumb|A caricature by [[David Claypoole Johnston]] from the period showing Lola Montez leaving Europe for the United States.]]

From 1851 to 1853, she performed as a dancer and actress in the eastern United States, one of her offerings being a play called ''Lola Montez in Bavaria''.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt; In May 1853, she arrived at [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="48LawsPower78"/&gt; Her performances there created a sensation, but soon inspired a popular satire, ''Who's Got the Countess?''.&lt;ref name="Kamiya2014"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Patrick Hull, a local newspaperman, in July and moved to [[Grass Valley, California]], in August. Her marriage soon failed; a doctor named as {{Not a typo|co-respondent}} in the divorce suit brought against her was shortly after murdered.&lt;ref name="Cannon1974" /&gt;

Montez remained in Grass Valley at her little house for nearly two years.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Dill, Jr., ''Germany: A Modern History'' (University of Michigan: Ann Arbor, 1970) pp. 104 through 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The restored [[Home of Lola Montez]] went on to become [[California Historical Landmark]] No. 292.&lt;ref name="parksCAgov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/ListedResources/Detail/292|title=Home Of Lola Montez |accessdate=27 July 2008| website=parks.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montez served as an inspiration to another aspiring young entertainer, [[Lotta Crabtree]], to whom she provided dancing lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.standingstones.com/crabtree.html|title=Lotta Crabtree and Lola Montez|last=|first=|date=|website=Standing Stones|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lotta's parents ran a boarding house in Grass Valley, and Lotta soon attracted the attention of her neighbor Montez, who encouraged Lotta's enthusiasm for performance.

===Australia===
In June 1855, Montez departed for a tour of [[Australia]] to resume her career by entertaining miners at the gold [[diggings]] during the [[Victorian gold rush|gold-rush]] of the 1850s, arriving at Sydney on 16 August 1855.&lt;ref name="eireann" /&gt;

Historian [[Michael Cannon (historian)|Michael Cannon]] claims that "In September 1855 she performed her erotic Spider Dance at the Theatre Royal in [[Melbourne]], raising her skirts so high that the audience could see she wore no underclothing at all. Next day, the ''[[The Argus (Australia)|Argus]]'' thundered that her performance was 'utterly subversive to all ideas of public morality'. Respectable families ceased to attend the theatre, which began to show heavy losses."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cannon, ''Melbourne After the Gold Rush'', pp.313-4&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]] in April 1856, she was "rapturously encored" after her Spider Dance in front of 400 diggers (including members of the Municipal Council who had adjourned their meeting early to attend the performance), but drew the wrath of the audience by insulting them following some mild heckling.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour, Bruce, ''Lola Montez: a life'', Yale University Press, 1996, p.347&lt;/ref&gt;

She earned further notoriety in [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] when, after reading a bad review in ''The Ballarat Times'', she allegedly attacked the editor, [[Henry Seekamp]], with a whip.&lt;ref name="another" /&gt;&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt; The "Lola Montes Polka" (composed by [[Albert Denning]]) is rumored to have been inspired by this event;&lt;ref name="eireann" /&gt; however, the song was published in 1855 and the incident with Seekamp occurred months later in February 1856.&lt;ref name="eireann" /&gt;

She departed for San Francisco on 22 May 1856.&lt;ref name="eireann" /&gt; On the return voyage her manager was lost after going overboard.&lt;ref name="adb" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cannon1974" /&gt;

===Later life in the US===
Lola failed in attempts at a theatrical comeback in various American cities. 

She arranged in 1857 to deliver a series of moral lectures in Britain and America written by Rev. [[Charles Chauncey Burr]].&lt;ref name=Cannon1974&gt;{{Cite book

She spent her last days in rescue work among women.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt; In November 1859, the ''[[Philadelphia Press]]'' reported that Lola Montez was 

&lt;blockquote&gt;living very quietly up town, and doesn't have much to do with the world's people. Some of her old friends, the Bohemians, now and then drop in to have a little chat with her, and though she talks beautifully of her present feelings and way of life, she generally, by way of parenthesis, takes out her little tobacco pouch and makes a cigarette or two for self and friend, and then falls back upon old times with decided gusto and effect. But she doesn't tell anybody what she's going to do.&lt;ref&gt;Relayed in "Personal," ''New York Tribune'', 21 November 1859, p. 5, col. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By then she was showing the [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary effects of syphilis]] and her body began to waste away. She died at the age of 39  on 17 January 1861. She is buried in [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]], where her tombstone states: "Mrs. Eliza Gilbert / Died 17 January 1861".&lt;ref name=Cannon1974 /&gt;
&lt;!-- On 30 June 1860, she suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed for some time. In mid-December, she had recovered enough to walk with a slight limp and went out for a stroll in the cold weather. She contracted [[pneumonia]], lingering for nearly a month before dying one month short of her fortieth birthday. {{citation needed|reason=This whole line conflicts with the previous info, and it is unsourced}} --&gt;

'''Luis Farell Cubillas''' (September 27, 1902 – July 17, 1977)  was a [[Mexican Air Force]] combat pilot during the Revolution of the 1920s. He fought against [[Adolfo de la Huerta]], the [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] rebels, General Arnulfo R. Gomez, against the [[Cristeros]] and accomplished several bombing and strafing missions against the military coup headed by General José Gonzalo Escobar and the revolt by General Saturnino Cedillo. Farell retired from active service as a Division General while being Sub-Chief of the [[Mexican Air Force]].

==Early life==
Farell Cubillas was born in San Pedro de las Colonias, [[Coahuila]], [[Mexico]], being son of Consuelo Cubillas Gutiérrez – a native of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]], [[Spain]]- and the jeweler Enrique Farell Solá – a native of [[Lerida]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Luis Farell had 11 siblings, including the senior politician [[Arsenio Farell Cubillas]].

==Training==

Luis Farell attended school in [[Mexico City]] and in February 1911 at the age of 9 years and along with 30,000 spectators, Farell witnessed the aerial exhibition of the [[John Bevins Moisant|Moisant brothers]] with [[Blériot Aéronautique|Blériot]] airplanes carried out in the fields of Balbuena in Mexico City.  In 1920, at the age of 18 years, Farell graduated as accountant just after the military-political events that caused the fall of President [[Venustiano Carranza]]. This rebellion had three important leaders: General [[Alvaro Obregón]], General [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] and  [[Adolfo de la Huerta]].
In August 1920, the President [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] hired three famous veteran and foreign pilots of [[World War I]] with the purpose of training Mexican pilots in modern tactics and organizing a functional air force. The foreign instructors were the American [[Ralph O'Neill]],&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Ralph flying n Mexico, biography. ''Skyways'' magazine, 28/October/1993&lt;/ref&gt; the German [[Fritz Bieler]] and the French instructor [[Joe Ben Lievre]]. Ralph O'Neill was designated as Chief Instructor of the Military school of Aviation and under orders of General [[Gustavo Salinas]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyaviators.com/esaligus.htm Gustavo Salinas, an 'Early Bird' of aviation]&lt;/ref&gt; the Mexican instructors were [[Alberto Carranza]], [[Horacio Ruiz Gaviño]] and the [[Aldasoro brothers|brothers Juan Pablo Aldasoro and Eduardo Aldasoro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sedena.gob.mx/index.php?id_art=342 Mexican Air force's photo gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Mexican government announced recruitment of aviators for the new Mexican Air Force, Farell applied on July 12, 1920, and enrolled as a cadet on November 11, 1920. This was a time at which, given the shortage produced by the war in Europe, Mexico had only 18 airplanes: four ''Brown Special'' biplanes and some [[TNCA]] made in Mexico. O'Neill reported to General Calles that most of the fleet available (13 airplanes in good condition and 5 in disrepair) had to be replaced since they were obsolete and worn away. Therefore, Mexico acquired some English [[Avro 504K]] and [[Avro 504]]J airplanes, which later would be made in Mexico with the name ''Avro Anáhuac.'' In addition, in May 1920 Mexico acquired thirteen twin-engine bombers [[Farman F.50]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianeducation.org/scitech/impacto/graphic/aviation/postwwii.html  Mexico purchases Farman F.50 bombers, 1920. - Smithsonian Institution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Luis Farell graduated on April 24 of 1922 with the degree of Lieutenant and was initially assigned to the 'Observation and Bombing Squadron'. His lower scores were [[fencing]] and English language, while his higher scores were use of firearms and landings to the mark with obstructions.
On January 11, 1925, he was commissioned to become a [[flight instructor]] and on May 24, 1926, he travelled to the United States to undergo a special aeronautics course in the military school located in [[Brooks City-Base|Brooks Field]], Texas.

==Rebellion of Adolfo de la Huerta==
On  December 7 of 1923, ex-President [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] launched a military coup later called the ''delahuertista rebellion'' against the government of President [[Alvaro Obregón]].  The situation was extremely critical because along with de la Huerta, about sixty percent of the army revolted, including various high ranking Generals across Mexico.
Mexico quickly reequipped and reorganized the military aviation and, with the help of the United States, it received new combat airplanes consisting of several [[de Havilland DH-4B]] with Liberty motor, armed with [[Lewis Gun|Lewis]] and [[Vickers machine gun]]s and able to carry bombs.&lt;br /&gt;
During December 10–21 of 1923, Farell’s squadron made explorations and bombings on San Marcos, [[Aguascalientes]], [[San Carlos Fortress]] in [[Perote, Veracruz]] and [[Puente de Ixtla]], [[Morelos]].  Then, Farell attacked enemy convoys in [[Iguala]], Pachuca and intermediate locations in company of his friend Squadron Commander Roberto Fierro VIllalobos.

On December 11, 1923, the important city of [[Puebla]] was taken by enemy forces and, eleven days later on December 22,  and in company of pilot and artilleryman Lieutenant Guillermo Monroy, Farell bombed and machine-gunned the forts of Loreto, Guadalupe and San Juán, as well as enemy positions in the city of Puebla. He later moved on to attack rebels operating in the southern states of [[Tabasco]], [[Oaxaca]] and [[Chiapas]], where their engine failed and crashed in the dense jungle; fortunately, they were unharmed. In a lucky turn of events Farell and Monroy were rescued by [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] natives and brought to a nearby town.

In January 1924, Farell  began his duties in the north-western front against the Generals [[Enrique Estrada]] and [[Manuel Macario Diéguez]], who controlled most of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Jalisco]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Michoacán]] and [[Durango]] states. Luis Farell made explorations, strafing and bombings on enemy bases in the cities of [[Pénjamo]], [[Yuriria]] and [[Moroleón]] in the state of Guanajuato; and in Michoacán, he attacked positions in the cities of [[Morelia]], Panindícuaro and intermediate points of opportunity.
From January 14 to February 6, 1924, Luis Farell made several bombings and strafing as artilleryman of Colonel Ralph O'Neill on the state of [[Colima]].

On February 4 of 1924, Luis Farell was promoted to Squadron Commander of the ''First Squadron, Second Regiment'' and, on February 9, 1924, he took part in the critical battle of [[Battle of Ocotlán (1924)|Ocotlán]], in [[Jalisco]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Joaquín Amaro|Ocotlán Battle (1924)]]&lt;/ref&gt; a decisive and cruel battle in which Generals [[Joaquín Amaro]] and [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] lead 10,000 troops against the forces commanded by rebel General Salvador Alvarado. Since the [[Lerma River]] divided to the troops of both sides, the artillery and the Air Force were indispensable during the early hours of combat: At 07:00AM  Farell's squadron flew the first of two missions, bombing and strafing the enemy until ran out of ammunition. After raising an improvised bridge, the federal forces won the battle and took several prisoners.&lt;br /&gt;Three days later, the federal forces easily recovered the city of [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], where Estrada's headquarter was based, but he managed to escape to [[Cuba]], while and Diéguez escaped to the south, where he was arrested and executed.

On February 12, 1924, Farell mounted several attacks on the state of Colima, where was still some resistance. During the campaign in the northwest, Farell served under the orders of General Salinas, Colonel Ralph O’Neill,  Majors Rafael Montero Ramos, Rafael Ponce de León and Alfredo Lezama Álvarez. Some fellow fliers were men like Alfonso Cruz Rivera, Roberto Fierro Villalobos, Pablo Sidar, [[Emilio Carranza]], Eliseo Martín del Campo, Guillermo Monroy, Manuel Solís, Julián Nava Salinas, Francisco Espejel, Alberto Vieytez, Ricardo Díaz Gonzáles and Luís Rojas, among others.

For his valuable participation against the Adolfo de la Huerta coup, General [[Lázaro Cardenas]], who was present at his aerial attacks, promoted Luis Farell to the degree of Captain because of “special merits during battle”.

Predicting more insurrections, on January 11, 1925 Farell was assigned to take a [[flight instructor]] course and train new pilots.

During 1926 and 1927, Mexico found itself immersed in a wave of violent territorial, religious and military armed rebellions, which required the Mexican Air Force to quickly deploy its forces and provide air support wherever the federal army requested them.

==Cristero War==

[[File:3-farell-5-Manuel-Solis.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Alfredo Lezama Alvarez, Unknown pilot, Luis Farell; on the far right is Eliseo Martín del Campo. Mid-late 1920s.]] 
When President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] pushed for the creation of the ‘Mexican Apostolic Catholic Church’, independent of Rome, a conflict untied that, would unleash a widespread religious war known as the [[Cristero War]]. Luis Farell served in multiple missions in this war from 1926 to 1929 while flying combat missions mostly in the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Guanajuato]] and [[Michoacán]].

During this long conflict, Farell flew alongside his friends Alfonso Cruz Rivera, Roberto Fierro and other airmen.

==The Yaqui Campaign==
Between 1926 and 1927 and while under the command of brigadier General [[Antonio Rios Zertuche]], Major Roberto Fierro and Colonel Samuel Carlos Rojas,  Luis Farell completed several missions against the [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] Indian rebels in the state of [[Sonora]].&lt;ref name="destacados 2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archivohistorico2010.sedena.gob.mx/libros_dn18/Militares_Marinos/Militares%20y%20marinos%20destacados%20Web.pdf |format=PDF |title=Militares y Marinos Destacados.

It was during one of these missions that Emilio Carranza crashed and required of face reconstruction. During this campaign, Farell flew the airplanes [[de Havilland DH-4B]] # 2, 5, the [[Avro 504]] # 59, 61, 65, 77, the [[Douglas O-2|Douglas O-2C]] # 1, 3 and the ''Lincoln'' biplane # 5.&lt;br /&gt;
Several years after this campaign,  Farell expressed to his family the moral difficulties of having battled against these indigenous people, whom demanded by the force that previous territorial treaties were implemented.

==Rebellion by General Arnulfo Gomez==
[[File:Pilotos mexico 1924-1929.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Alfredo Lezama Alvarez, Unknown, Manuel Solís; the seventh is Roberto Fierro.]]  
In May 1927, while General Obregón seemed keen to impose the presidency for second time to General Calles, [[Arnulfo R. Gómez]] launched an armed rebellion against both Obregón and Calles, as reelection has always been unconstitutional in Mexico. His command posts were located in the cities of Puebla and Veracruz, where he brought about 2000 very well armed federal deserters.

Once the Mexican Air Force was revamped, Farell was assigned a squadron and, from October 6–11 he flew 7 consecutive missions in [[Veracruz]], helping the army defeat Arnulfo Gomez's forces. Wasting no time, Farell’s squadron was assigned to return west and renew attacks against the [[Cristeros]] in the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Guanajuato]] and [[Michoacán]], as the Cristeros' numbers had increased to an estimated 15,000.

==Rebellion by General José Gonzalo Escobar==

While Farell was flight-testing a new Mexican aircraft called ''Baja California-1'' on March 3 of 1929 a serious military coup took place, led by General [[José Gonzalo Escobar]] and heeded by various Generals. In these days, the air force's remaining airplanes consisted of worn and shot [[Bristol F.2 Fighter]], [[Bristol Boarhound]], [[de Havilland DH-4B]] and [[Douglas O-2|Douglas O-2C]], a force that was not suitable to defeat Escobar's power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laahs.com/artman/publish/article_12.shtml ''The Azcarate Corsair'', by Hector Davila Cornejo]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Los Corsarios Mexicanos'', by Héctor Dávila C.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the government of Mexico convinced the USA to promote the peace south of its border and quickly make available twelve new [[O2U Corsair|OU-2M Corsair]] with the 400&amp;nbsp;hp Wasp engine, nine [[Douglas O-2|Douglas O-2M]], four ''Stearman C3B'' and six [[Waco 10]]. Only two weeks after making the request, the USA government agreed and Farell and other pilots travelled to [[Brownsville, Texas]] and [[New York City]] to pick up the new aircraft.

It is recorded that Luis Farell flew a total of 52 combat hours over the states of [[Nuevo León]], [[Coahuila]], [[Durango]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], when he was wounded by a bullet. On March 19, 1929, while in company of Lieutenant Colonel Pablo Sidar, Roberto Fierro, Ismael Aduna, Luis Boyer, Arturo Jiménez Nieto, Antonio Cárdenas Rodríguez, Carlos Rovirosa, Rodolfo Torres Rico and Gustavo León, Luis Farell attacked enemy positions in Benavides, [[Coahuila]] and the following five days, from 20 - 25 of March, he bombed telegraph lines, bridges, locomotives and the railroad out of the city of Jiménez, Chihuahua in order to cut the enemy’s escape and communications.  Finally, on March 25, 1929  Farell’s squadron attacked Escobar’s operation centers in the cities of Escalon and Jiménez, and while making a low altitude strafing run with a WACO aircraft, he was shot in both legs.&lt;ref name=shot&gt;{{cite book | last = HAGEDORN | first = DAN | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Latin American Air Wars &amp; Aircraft: Conflict in the Skies of Central and South America | publisher = Hikoki Publications | date =  | location = United Kingdom | pages = 74 | url = http://www.hikokipublications.co.uk/downloads/Chap%20%201%20Mexican%20Revolution%20(Read-Only).pdf | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 1-902109-44-9 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The battle for the city of Jiménez was immediately reported by telegram to the President by the Lieutenant Colonel Rodolfo Tostado Loaiza, a ‘Head of Presidential Guard’ monitoring the campaign:&lt;ref&gt;[http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/publicaciones/publi_quepaso/rodolfol.htm Rodolfo Tostado Loaiza, biography (Spanish language)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation| March 25, 1929

I have the honor to communicate to you that our war planes launched an energetic military action against the traitors that are concentrated in the city of Jiménez, bombing and machine-gunning them successfully. The panic that took place among them was enormous. The traitors were in panic, in disorder and running in all directions; they even had to open the corral doors to allow some horses to escape. The airplanes flew so low that Captain Farell, who was artilleryman of Lieutenant Colonel Fierro, received a bullet wound in both legs. Tomorrow our airplanes will return again to punish the traitors.

Lieutenant Colonel Rodolfo Tostado Loaiza&lt;br /&gt;'Jefe del Estado Mayor Presidencial'.&lt;ref&gt;A certified copy of this telegram is annexed in Farell's military file.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A detailed report was made the following day and it reveals that in fact, Luis Farell piloted the airplane and the artilleryman was Captain Ismael Aduna.&lt;ref name=shot /&gt; Farell was able to return to his base and land safely. Once the bleeding was controlled, he was flown to the ''Hospital Francés'' in Mexico City, where Erasmo González Ancira, a military physician, reported that the projectile entered his left calf, fragmented 12&amp;nbsp;cm of the [[fibula]] bone and passed only 2&amp;nbsp;cm from the femoral artery of his right thigh.

Three days after Farell was shot, Escobar was defeated by General Calles in Jiménez City, where he took about 6000 prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;External links to the battle at Jiménez, Chihuahua on 1929:[http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=569] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117020817/http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=569 |date=2007-11-17 }}, {{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/chihuahua/hist.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527134656/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/chihuahua/hist.htm |archivedate=2007-05-27 |df= }}, {{cite web |url=http://www.sulross.edu/cbbs/jbbs14.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030013539/http://www.sulross.edu/cbbs/jbbs14.php |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rebellion was quite serious, since a third of the officials and nearly 30,000 soldiers rebelled; In two months, more than 2000 men were killed.

Because of his actions in battle, on April 5 of 1929, Farell he was promoted to Major for having flown hundreds of missions and for having engaged the enemy in battle at least 50 times.  In addition, the President appointed him to the [[Estado Mayor Presidencial]], a prominent Presidential Guard staff.

A few days after leaving the hospital, on June 21. 1929, Luis Farell got married to Miss Ana Samaniego Castillo, and on August 12, the President presented him with a [[Waco Aircraft Company|Waco]] [[Waco 10|model 10]] biplane.

==After the Revolution==

[[File:Farell2 WACO model 10.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Luis Farell taking friends on a joyride on his ''WACO-10'', a present from the President.]]

In 1932, Farell served in the First and Second Air Regiments flying the Chance-Vought [[O2U Corsair|Corsair O2U-2M]], [[O2U Corsair|Corsair O2U-4A]], [[Douglas O-2|Douglas O-2M]] and the ''Bristol Fighters''.  Then, Farell  was appointed as Chief of the Civil Aviation Department and proceeded to head a committee to upgrade civil aviation policies and procedures.

On January 1, 1934, the newly elected President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] again appointed him as 'Jefe del [[Estado Mayor Presidencial]]' and in November 1934, was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the Air Force.&lt;br /&gt;
During 1935, he was in charge of the Military Aeronautics Department and in 1936,  he was appointed as Director of the Military School of Aviation, a charge that he performed until October 1945.

In May 1938, the Governor of [[San Luis Potosi]],  General [[Saturnino Cedillo]], declared himself in rebellion against Cardenas’ government and, President Cárdenas travelled to San Luis Potosi to personally mount the campaign against the revolt.

Luis Farell and an old friend, Coronel Alfredo Lezama Álvarez, organized a mixed fleet of 17 aircraft and flew several missions, engaging the enemy assertively when spotted.  Cedillo quickly realized he had no chance in open fields against the air force and ran to the Huasteca hills, where his men dispersed abandoning him.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine. June 6, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this confrontation, Farell flew the new [[V-99M Corsair]]s which had the capacity to carry bombs and were equipped with the 550&amp;nbsp;hp Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340-T1H-1 Wasp engine and two Colt 0.30 machine guns, one fixed at the front and one for the artilleryman. He also flew the [[Fleet Model 1|Fleet 21-M]] biplanes.&lt;br /&gt;
Cedillo was shot by ground federal forces in 1939.

During [[World War II]], Mexico received a large number of aircraft to patrol the Gulf of Mexico coast against [[German submarines]] and Luis Farell coordinated the pilot training.&lt;ref&gt;Some aircraft types received by Mexico during WWII were: Vought-Sikorsky Kingfisher, North American AT-6, Douglas A-24B and Beech AT-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Farell also formed part in the officials' selection to comprise the Mexican [[Escuadron 201]] which saw action in [[Philippines]] during 1945.

Farell was promoted to colonel in January 1939 and to brigadier general in February 1944. In 1946, he was assigned to direct the Military Personnel Department. In 1955, Farell was awarded the "Cruz de Guerra" medal along with fellow pilots [[Gustavo León González]], [[Alfonso Cruz Rivera]] and [[David J. Borja Guajardo]].

In 1959, [[Guatemala]] President [[Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]] ordered his [[P-51 Mustang]]s to attack five Mexican fishing vessels in contested waters. Soon after that incident, Roberto Fierro and Luis Farell were appointed Chief and Sub-Chief of the Mexican Air Force, respectively. At this time, Mexico had no natural enemies and was dedicated to industrial growth, not to a military buildup. The conflict was resolved with diplomacy. Farell and Fierro concluded that the Mexican Air Force could not confront the powerful P-51 Mustang aircraft if required again, so they purchased a Canadian fleet of [[de Havilland Vampire|Vampire MK-3]] jets made available by the USA, and [[Lockheed T-33]] jets from the USA. Farell applied himself at establishing a system that would never leave Mexico in such vulnerable position again — a difficult task given the limited budget available.

Farell retired from active service in August 1965 with the rank of division general. He died in Mexico City on July 17, 1977, at age of 74. He left behind his wife Ana and four sons: Jaime, Guillermo, Bernardo and Luis.

'''Madge Gill''' (1882–1961), born '''Maude Ethel Eades''', was an [[England|English]] [[outsider art|outsider]] and [[visionary art]]ist.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madgegill.com/Biography|title=biography - Madge Gill|publisher=|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=petullo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petulloartcollection.org/the_collection/about_the_artists/artist.cfm?a_id=24|title=Madge Gill : Learn About The Artists : The Collection: The Anthony Petullo Collection of SELF-TAUGHT &amp; OUTSIDER ART|publisher=|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Born an [[illegitimate child]] in [[East Ham]], [[Essex]], (now [[Greater London]]), she spent much of her early years in seclusion and was placed in an [[orphanage]] at the age of 9, because her family couldn't stand the embarrassment. She was subsequently sent to [[Canada]], at 14 years old, along with other orphans, to work on a farm, where she stayed until she was 18 before moving back to East Ham to live with her aunt, who introduced her to [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] and [[astrology]]. During that time, she found work as a nurse at Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone. At the age of 25, she married her cousin, Thomas Edwin Gill, a stockbroker. Together they had three sons with their second, Reginald, dying of the [[Spanish flu]]. The following year she gave birth to a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] baby girl and almost died herself, contracting a serious illness that left her bedridden for several months and blind in her left eye.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

==Artistic works==

After recovering from her illness in 1920, Gill now thirty-eight, took a sudden and passionate interest in drawing, creating thousands of [[Mediumistic automatism|mediumistic]] works over the following 40 years, most done with ink in black and white. The works came in all sizes, from postcard-sized to huge sheets of fabric, some over {{convert|30|ft|m}} long. She claimed to be guided by a spirit she called "Myrninerest" (my inner rest) and often signed her works in this name. However, she experimented with a wide variety of media including [[knitting]], [[writing]], [[weaving]], and [[crochet]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cardinal|first1=Roger|title=Madge Gill: The Magic of Madge Gill|url=http://madgegill.com/Biography|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely prolific, she was capable of completing dozens of drawings in a single night. The figure of a young woman in intricate dress appeared thousands of times in her work, and is often thought to be a representation of herself or her lost daughter, and in general female subjects dominate her work. Her drawings are characterised by geometric chequered patterns and organic ornamentation, with the blank staring eyes of female faces and their flowing clothing interweaving into the surrounding complex patterns.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rawvision.com/books/outsider-art-sourcebook Outsider Art Sourcebook]'', ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, she exhibited one of her works at the Whitechapel Gallery. It was probably one of her largest works, measuring at 40 meters wide, covering an entire wall in the gallery. She continued to exhibit her work  each year at the Whitechapel Gallery up until 1947.

==Later years==

She rarely exhibited her work and never sold any pieces out of fear of angering  "Myrninerest". After her first son, Bob, died in 1958 she started drinking heavily and stopped drawing. Following her death in 1961, thousands of drawings were discovered in her home; the collection is owned by the [[London Borough of Newham]] and is in the care of the borough's Heritage and Archives Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newham.gov.uk/entertainmentandleisure/libraries/librarydetails/newhamarchivesandlocalstudieslibrary.htm Newham Archives and Local Studies Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been exhibited internationally at venues including The [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], USA (1992), Manor Park Museum, London (1999), The Whitechapel Gallery, London (2006), Slovak National Gallery, Bratislava (2007), Halle Saint Pierre ([[Musée d'Art Brut &amp; Art Singulier]]), Paris (2008, 2014), Kunsthalle Schirn, Frankfurt a.M. (2010), [[Collection de l'Art Brut]], Lausanne (2005, 2007).

==Exhibitions==

From October 5, 2013 to January 26, 2014, Gill's work was displayed at the Orleans house Gallery.

A major trilogy of exhibitions, showing over 600 of Gill's work, many previously unseen, took place at The Nunnery Gallery in London. It opened in May 2012 and lasted until January 2013.

Some of her drawings are on permanent view in [[The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art &amp; Natural History]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the viktor wynd museum of curiosities|url = http://www.thelasttuesdaysociety.org/museum-curiosities/viktor-wynd-museum/viktor-wynd-museum-curiosities-fine-art-natural-history-now-open/#.VhEZ24sk--I|website = www.thelasttuesdaysociety.org|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, whilst others are held by the [[London Borough of Newham Heritage Service]].

==Recognition==

[[File:Madge Gill nee Maud Eades (Waltham Forest Heritage).jpg|thumb|Waltham Forest Heritage commemorative plaque at 71 High Street, Walthamstow, London E17]]

Madge Gill, like many outsider artists, has continually been gaining fame since her death in 1961. Her work is part of the permanent collection at the [[Collection de l'Art Brut]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], one of the central venues for the exhibition and support of [[outsider art]].

In 2013, admirer [[David Tibet]], himself an outsider artist, published an antiquarian-style book solely devoted to her work, the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidtibet.com/collections/madge-gill/products/madge-gill-myrninerest-book-standard |title=MADGE GILL - Myrninerest book (Standard edition) |work=DavidTibet.com |publisher=David Tibet |accessdate=17 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022075455/http://www.davidtibet.com/collections/madge-gill/products/madge-gill-myrninerest-book-standard |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8th March 2018 a [[blue plaque]] commemorating Gill was erected at 71 High Street, [[Walthamstow]], where she was born in 1882 and lived until 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walthamforestecho.co.uk/meticulous-madge-gets-blue-plaque/|title=Meticulous Madge gets blue plaque|work=James Cracknell|publisher=Waltham Forest Echo|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michel Rolland''' (born December 24, 1947 in [[Libourne]], [[France]]) is a [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]]-based [[enology|oenologist]], with hundreds of clients across 13 countries and influencing wine style around the world. "It is his consultancies outside France that have set him apart from all but a handful of his countrymen." It is frequently addressed that his signature style, which he helps wineries achieve, is fruit-heavy and oak-influenced, a preference shared by influential critic [[Robert M. Parker, Jr.|Robert Parker]].

Rolland owns several properties in Bordeaux, including [[Château Bertineau Saint-Vincent]] in Lalande de Pomerol, [[Château Rolland-Maillet]] in [[Saint-Émilion AOC|Saint-Émilion]], [[Château Fontenil]] in [[Fronsac, Gironde|Fronsac]], and [[Château La Grande Clotte]] in [[Lussac-Saint-Émilion]] as well as joint venture partnerships with [[Bonne Nouvelle]] in [[South Africa]], [[Val de Flores]] in [[Argentina]], [[Rolland Galarreta]] in [[Spain]] and  [[Yacochuya]] ([[Salta]]) and [[Clos de los Siete]] in [[Argentina]]. &lt;!--dead link &lt;ref&gt; http://www.kbmpr.com/OL/OL_presskit.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Education and early career==
[[File:Michel Rolland's Vineyard of Château Le Bon Pasteur, Pomerol.jpg|left|thumb|Vineyards at the Rolland family estate of Château Le Bon Pasteur in Pomerol.]]
Born into a wine making family, Rolland grew up on the family's estate Château Le Bon Pasteur in [[Pomerol]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite news|last=Asimov|first=Eric, ''New York Times'' |title= Satan or Savior: Setting the Grape Standard |date=October 11, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/dining/11pour.html|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Rolland enrolled at Tour Blanche Viticultural and Oenology school in Bordeaux with his father's encouragement. Excelling in his studies, he was one of five student chosen by director Jean-Pierre Navarre to evaluate the program's quality against that of the prestigious [[Bordeaux Oenology Institute]]. Rolland later enrolled in the Institute, where he met his wife and fellow oenologist, Dany Rolland, and graduated as part of the class of 1972.

At the Institute, Michel Rolland studied under the tutelage of renowned oenologists Pierre Sudraud, Pascal Ribéreau-Gayon, Jean Ribéreau-Gayon, and [[Émile Peynaud]]. Rolland has said these men were a great influence upon him and considers them the "Fathers of Modern Oenology."

In 1973, Rolland and his wife bought into an oenology lab on the Right Bank of Bordeaux in the town of Libourne. They took over full control of the lab in 1976 and expanded it to include tasting rooms. By 2006 the Rolland's lab employed 8 full-time technicians, analyzing samples from nearly 800 wine estates in France each year.&lt;ref name=ws-mr&gt;Suckling, James, ''Wine Spectator'' "Top Gun", June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Rolland's two daughters, Stéphanie &amp; Marie, also work at the lab.

Michel Rolland's first clients included the Bordeaux Châteaux [[Château Troplong Mondot|Troplong Mondot]], [[Château Angélus|Angélus]], and [[Château Beau-Séjour Bécot|Beau-Séjour Bécot]]. An early setback was the loss of two [[Classification of Saint-Émilion wine|Saint-Émilion first growths]], [[Château Canon (Saint-Émilion)|Château Canon]] and [[Château La Gaffelière]], due to conflict in style with the owners and Rolland. According to Rolland, the loss "calmed him down" and brought him out of an awkward stage in his early career. Twenty years later, the two chateaux returned to be part of the more than 100 wineries who employ Michel Rolland as their consultant.

In his book ''Noble Rot: A Bordeaux Wine Revolution'', [[William Echikson]] writes that before Michel Rolland became consultant to [[Château Lascombes]], it "produced about 500,000 bottles of mediocre wine, about half of which was sold not as Lascombes itself, but as the inferior Chevalier de Lascombes." Today, Echikson contends, that even the Chevalier (the [[second wine]] of the estate) is better than the old full-fledged Lascombes.

==Media exposure==
[[File:L'indétronâble Michel Rolland.jpg|right|thumb|Michel Rolland's signature on a bottle of the [[Argentine wine]] Yacochuya which Rolland owns as part of a joint venture in [[Cafayate]].]]
Rolland features prominently in the critical 2004 documentary ''[[Mondovino]]'' by [[Jonathan Nossiter]] as an agent of [[Globalization of wine|wine globalization]]. In ''Mondovino'', Rolland is seen on several occasions advising his clients to [[Microoxygenation|microoxygenate]] their wines, including a scene at [[Château Le Gay]] in Bordeaux. Since the film, Rolland has said that he is "not a fan of microoxygenation. The film suggests I am. Some of my clients inquire about it. It can help in special conditions &amp;mdash; if the tannins are fierce or hard, micro-oxygenation can make them softer and rounder. In certain countries with certain terroir, like Chile or Argentina, I may use it." [[James Suckling]], formerly of ''[[Wine Spectator]]'',  notes in an article about Rolland that "He is not a proponent of micro-oxidation in wine-making as some suggest, and never has been".&lt;ref name=ws-mr/&gt;

Michel Rolland is also a wine making consultant for the Amphorae Winery in Israel (marketed as Makura in the United States) and has started signing his name to their premium Makura series. He visits Amphorae and their vineyards once a year and has his assistants throughout the year help implement his practices adopted by Amphorae's wine making team at the winery and in their vineyards.

Rolland is among the wine personalities [[satire|satirised]] next to Robert Parker in the 2010 [[Franco-Belgian comics|''bande dessinée'' comic book]], ''[[Robert Parker: Les Sept Pêchés capiteux]]''.&lt;ref name=deca-rp&gt;Kakaviatos, Panos, ''Decanter.com'' (October 12, 2010).

[http://thunevin.blogspot.com/2010/10/hilarious-duo.html Hilarious duo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
From his consulting work and media presence, Michel Rolland has influenced many aspects of both the [[French (wine)|French]] and [[global wine industry]]. Among the prominent [[wine personalities]] that have been influenced by Rolland is the [[Rhone wine]] producer [[Jean-Luc Colombo]].&lt;ref name="Spectator"&gt;E. Arnold ''"[http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Winemaker-Talk-Jean-Luc-Colombo_3541 Winemaker Talk: Jean-Luc Colombo]"'' ''Wine Spectator'' April 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Napa Valley vineyards under Rolland influence ==

'''Mochi''' ("Buffalo Calf"; c. 1841 – 1881) was a [[Southern Cheyenne]] woman of the ''Tse Tse Stus'' band and the wife of Chief Medicine Water. Mochi, then a 24-year-old, was a member of [[Black Kettle]]'s camp and was present on the morning of November 29, 1864, when [[John Chivington]] and over 650 troops of the [[First Colorado Cavalry]], [[Third Colorado Cavalry]] and a company of the [[1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Cavalry]] attacked Black Kettle's winter camp at [[Big Sandy Creek (Colorado)|Sand Creek]] on the plains of eastern [[Colorado Territory]] (referred to as the [[Sand Creek Massacre]]).

During the unprovoked attack, Mochi witnessed her mother being shot in the forehead and killed by a U.S. soldier who had entered their [[tipi]]. According to her account, he then attempted to rape her, prompting her to shoot and kill him with her grandfather's rifle. She then fled the camp with the other survivors trying to evade Chivington's men. After the massacre, she became a warrior and engaged in raiding and warfare for the next 11 years.&lt;ref name="StrangeOwl1998"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Four Great Rivers to Cross: Cheyenne History, Culture, and Traditions|isbn=978-1-56308-471-3|first=Patrick M. |last=Mendoza|year=1998|publisher=[[Libraries Unlimited]]|page=70|first2=Ann|last2=Strange Owl-Raben|first3=Nico|last3=Strange Owl|mode=cs2 |lastauthoramp=yes|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mochi fought alongside her husband in numerous battles and raids and was the only [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] woman to be incarcerated by the United States Army as a [[prisoner of war]].&lt;ref name="StrangeOwl1998" /&gt;

==Lone Tree massacre==
On August 24, 1874, in present day [[Meade County, Kansas]], Mochi, Medicine Water and the other members of their band were involved in the massacre of a surveying party led by Capt. Oliver Francis Short, who had fought in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Short, his 14-year-old son Truman, and four other members of the party were killed, with three of them being scalped.&lt;ref name=KHQ1932&gt;{{Cite journal|title=United States Surveyors Massacred by Indians|url=http://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-united-states-surveyors-massacred-by-indians/12546|first=F.C.|last=Montgomery|date=May 1932|work=Kansas Historical Quarterly|publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]]|pages=266–272|issue=3|volume=1|mode=cs2 |postscript=.|accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German family massacre==
On the morning of September 11, 1874, in [[Kansas]], Chief Medicine Water and his band, including Mochi, attacked John German and his family as they were breaking camp. The family had camped along the [[stagecoach]] route which followed the [[Smoky Hill River]] while en route to [[Fort Wallace]].

German, his wife Liddia (Cox), son Stephen Wise, and daughters Rebecca Jane, and Joanna Cleveland were killed and [[Scalping|scalped]], with Mochi killing Liddia with a [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] blow to the skull. After plundering the camp and setting fire to the wagon, the band took German's four youngest daughters captive.  They were Catherine Elizabeth, age seventeen; Sophia Louisa, twelve; Julia Arminda, seven; and Nancy Addie, five.

Julia and Addie were traded to Grey Beard's band and were liberated after an attack on his camp on November 8, 1874, by a column led by Lieut. [[Frank Baldwin]]. Catherine and Sophia were released in March when Chief Stone Calf and most of the Southern Cheyenne surrendered at [[Fort Leavenworth]], in Kansas.&lt;ref name=KHQ1932 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deadly Days in Kansas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMvjhiPBJzoC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=german+family+massacre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=438S23EJBR&amp;sig=9IgZY-68eyz16qAR2GFM6Z4E5nU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mH-wTYX1LoW4tgfyr9SFDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=german%20family%20massacre&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-87004-379-6|first=Wayne C.|last=Lee|year=1997|publisher=Caxton|location=Caldwell, ID|pages=59–63|mode=cs2 |postscript=.|accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Surrender of an Indian Tribe|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1875/02/27/82760086.pdf|date=February 27, 1875|work=[[The New York Times]]|mode=cs2 |postscript=.|accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fort Marion==
Mochi and her husband Medicine Water were among 35 Cheyenne singled out for incarceration in the east. They were among a larger contingent of Plains tribe members to be sent east; in addition to the Cheyenne there were 27 [[Kiowa]], 11 [[Comanche]], and 1 [[Caddo]]. Two of the Cheyenne died en route, including Grey Beard, who was thwarted in a suicide attempt only to be shot and killed trying to escape.

After being incarcerated at [[Fort Sill]] in [[Indian Territory]], they were taken in eight prison wagons to Fort Leavenworth and then loaded in a special train for the journey to [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. In St. Augustine, Mochi and the others were incarcerated in an old [[coquina]] stone fort built by the Spanish in the 17th century. The fort, originally named the [[Castillo de San Marcos]], was renamed Fort Marion by the Americans.

Mochi and the others would remain in captivity at the fort under the supervision of [[Richard Henry Pratt|Captain Richard Pratt]] until 1878. Upon her release she returned to Oklahoma and died in 1881, in what is present day [[Clinton, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War Dance at Fort Marion: Plains Indian War Prisoners|isbn=978-0-8061-3739-1|first=Brad D.|last=Lookingbill|year=2006|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|page=85|mode=cs2 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phoolan Devi''' (10 August 1963 &amp;ndash; 25 July 2001), popularly known as "Bandit Queen", was an Indian [[bandit]] and later a [[Member of Parliament]].

Born into a poor family in rural [[Uttar Pradesh]], Phoolan endured poverty as a child and had an unsuccessful marriage before taking to a life of crime. Having developed major differences with her parents and her husband alike, the teenage Phoolan sought escape by running away and joining a gang of bandits. She was the only woman in that gang, and her relationship with one gang member, coupled with other minor factors, caused a gunfight between gang members. Phoolan's lover was killed in that gunfight. The victorious rival faction, who were [[Rajput]]s, took Phoolan to their village of Behmai, confined her in a room, and took turns to rape her repeatedly over several days. After escaping (or being let off), Phoolan rejoined the remnants of her dead lover's faction, took another lover from among those men, and continued with banditry. A few months later, her new gang descended upon the village of Behmai to exact revenge for what she had suffered.&lt;ref name="Devi"&gt;{{cite book | title=I, Phoolan Devi | publisher=Warner Books | author=Devi, Phoolan | year=1996 | pages=384&amp;ndash;388 | isbn=0-7515-1964-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/sher-singh-rana-murderer-phoolan-devi-bandit-queen-life-sentence|title=Killer of Phoolan Devi, India's 'Bandit Queen', given life sentence|last=Press|first=Associated|date=2014-08-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as twenty-two [[Rajput]] men belonging to that village were lined up in a row and shot dead by Phoolan's gang. Her victims were men who were known to have previously repeatedly gang raped her.

Her act of revenge - the [[#Massacre_in_Behmai|Behmai massacre]] was potrayed by the press as an act of righteous rebellion. The respectful sobriquet 'Devi' was conferred upon her by the media and public at this point.&lt;ref name="gua_dead"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,527406,00.html | title = The queen is dead | work = The Guardian | date = 2001-07-26 | accessdate = 2011-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoolan evaded capture for two years after the Behmai massacre before she and her few surviving gang-members surrendered to the police in 1983. She was charged with 48 crimes, including multiple murders, plunder, arson and kidnapping for ransom.&lt;ref name="Phoolan Devi"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1335253/Phoolan-Devi.html | title=Phoolan Devi | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=July 26, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoolan spent the next eleven years in jail, as the various charges against her were tried in court. In 1994, the state government headed by [[Mulayam Singh Yadav]] of the [[Samajwadi Party]] summarily withdrew all charges against her, and Phoolan was released.&lt;ref name="Phoolan Devi"/&gt; She then stood for election to parliament as a candidate of the [[Samajwadi Party]] and was twice elected to the [[Lok Sabha]] as the member for [[Mirzapur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Mirzapur]]. In 2001, she was shot dead at the gates of her official bungalow (allotted to her as [[Member of Parliament|MP]]) in [[New Delhi]] by former rival bandits whose kinsmen had been slaughtered at Behmai by her gang. The 1994 film ''[[Bandit Queen]]'' (made around the time of her release from jail) is loosely based on her life until that point.

==Early life==
Phoolan was born into the [[Mallah]] (boatmen) [[caste]],&lt;ref name="goodbyemag_queen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodbyemag.com/jul01/devi.html |title=Phoolan Devi, India's Bandit Queen |accessdate=2006-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228081825/http://www.goodbyemag.com/jul01/devi.html |archivedate=28 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the small village of Ghura Ka Purwa (also spelled Gorha ka Purwa) in [[Jalaun District]], [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="Henry_Hindi_1994"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Hindi movie | author = Henry Scholberg | publisher = Indus ([[HarperCollins]] India) | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-81-7223-097-5 | page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the fourth and youngest child of Moola and her husband Devi Din Mallah.&lt;ref&gt;India today, Volume 26. Thomson Living Media India Ltd., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Only she and one older sister survived to adulthood.

Phoolan's family were very poor. The major asset owned by them was around one [[acre]] (0.4 hectare) of farmland with a large but very old [[neem|Neem tree]] on it.&lt;ref name="JanS_2011"&gt;{{cite book | title = Good Girls Don’t Make History | author = Jan Stradling | publisher = Pier | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-74266-623-5 | chapter = 12: Phoolan Devi - 'Bandit Queen', freedom fighter, politician }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Phoolan was eleven years old, her paternal grandparents passed away in quick succession and her father's elder brother became the head of the family. His son, Maya Din Mallah, proposed to cut down the Neem tree which occupied a largish patch of their one-acre farmland. He wanted to do this because the [[Neem]] tree was old and not very productive, and he wished to cultivate that patch of land with more profitable crops.&lt;ref name="John_Insurgents_2011"&gt;{{cite book | title = Insurgents, Raiders, and Bandits | author = John Arquilla | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781566638326 | pages = 245–251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoolan's father acknowledged that there was some sense to this act, and agreed to it with mild protest. However, the teenage Phoolan was incensed. She felt that since her father had no sons (only two daughters), her uncle and cousin were asserting sole claim on the family's farmland inherited from the paternal grandfather. She confronted her much older cousin, taunted him publicly, called him a thief and repeatedly and, over a period of several weeks, showered abused and taunts upon him. One of the things attested about Phoolan by nearly every source is the fact that she had a very foul tongue, and routinely used abuses which are never uttered by women in any strata of Indian society.&lt;ref name="JanS_2011"/&gt; Phoolan also attacked her cousin physically when he berated her for abusing him and making accusations against him. She then gathered a few village girls and staged a ''Dharna'' ([[sit-in]]) on the land, and did not budge even when the family elders tried to use force to drag them home. She was eventually beaten unconscious with a brick.&lt;ref name="Roy on Phoolan"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sawnet.org/books/writing/roy_bq1.html | title=The Great Indian Rape-Trick | date=1992-08-22 | accessdate=2015-12-11 | work=Sawnet news | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414182145/http://www.sawnet.org/books/writing/roy_bq1.html | archivedate=14 April 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months after this incident, Phoolan's family arranged for her to marry a man named Puttilal Mallah, who lived several hundred miles away and was three times her age.&lt;ref name="bbc_champion"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1456441.stm | title=Phoolan Devi: Champion of the poor | date=2001-07-25 | accessdate=2006-12-11 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suffered continuous beatings and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband and after several attempts at running away was returned to her family in 'disgrace'.

In retailiation for the public and private humiliations heaped on him, and in order to teach her a lesson, Maya Din went to the local cops and accused Phoolan of stealing small items belonging to him, including a gold ring and a wrist-watch. The cops, who belonged to nearby villages, knew Phoolan and her family well, and they did what the family wanted. They kept Phoolan in jail for three days, physically abused her, and then let her off with a warning to behave better in future and live quietly without quarreling with her family or with others.&lt;ref name="John_Insurgents_2011"/&gt; Phoolan never forgave her cousin for this incident.

After Phoolan was released from jail, her parents once again wanted to send her to her husband. They approached Phoolan's in-laws with the plea that she was now sixteen years of age and therefore old enough to begin cohabiting with her husband. They initially refused to take Phoolan back. However, they were themselves very poor, Phoolan's husband was now twenty-eight years old, and it would be very difficult to find another bride for him, especially with one wife still living. Divorce was simply out of the question in that society. After Phoolan's family offered generous gifts, they finally agreed to take her back. Phoolan's parents performed the ceremony of ''gauna'' (after which a married woman begins to cohabit with her husband), took Phoolan to her husband's house and left her there.

Within a few months, Phoolan, this time no longer a virgin, again returned to her parents. Shortly afterwards, her in-laws returned the gifts that Phoolan's parents had given them and sent word that under no circumstances would they accept Phoolan back again. This was in 1979 and Phoolan was only a few months past her sixteenth birthday. She later claimed in her autobiography that her husband was a man of "very bad character." A wife leaving her husband, or being abandoned by her husband, is a serious taboo in rural India, and Phoolan was marked as a social outcast.

==Life as a bandit==
The region where Phoolan lived ([[Bundelkhand]]) is even today extremely poor, arid and devoid of industry; most of the able-bodied men migrate to large cities in search of manual work. During the period in question, industry was depressed even in the large cities, and daily life was a grim engagement with subsistence farming in a dry region with poor soil. It was not unusual for young men to seek escape from fruitless labour in the fields by running away to the nearby ravines (the main geographical feature of the region), forming groups of bandits, and plundering their more prosperous neighbours in the villages or passing townspeople on the highways.

Shortly after her final sojourn in her husband's house, and in the same year (1979), Phoolan fell in with one such gang of [[dacoit]]s. How exactly this happened is unclear; some say that she was kidnapped by them because her "spirited temperament," estrangement from her own family and outspoken rejection of her husband had attracted the attention of the bandits, while others say that she "walked away from her life."&lt;ref name="John_Insurgents_2011"/&gt; In her autobiography, she merely says ''"kismet ko yehi manzoor tha"'' ("it was the dictate of fate") that she become part of a gang of bandits.

Whether it was kidnapping or her own folly, Phoolan had immediate cause for regret. The gang leader, Babu Gujjar, who was of the [[Gujjar]] caste, wanted to have sex with her. He playfully courted her for a few days, but when she would not yield, he attempted to rape her one night. At this juncture, Phoolan was saved from rape by Vikram Mallah, the second-in-command of the gang, who belonged to Phoolan's own Mallah caste. In the altercation connected to the rape attempt, Vikram Mallah killed Babu Gujjar. The next morning, he assumed leadership of the gang.

===Relationship with Vikram Mallah===
Undaunted by the fact that Vikram already had a wife and that she likewise had a husband, Phoolan and Vikram began [[cohabit]]ing together. A few weeks later, the gang attacked the village where Phoolan's husband lived. Phoolan herself dragged him out of his house and stabbed him in front of the villagers. The gang left him lying almost dead by the road, with a note warning older men not to marry young girls. The man survived, but carried a scar running down his abdomen for the rest of his life. Due to this incident, and because he legally remained Phoolan's husband, the man was never able to marry again. He lived his life as a recluse because most people in the village began avoiding his company out of fear of the bandits.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Phoolan learned how to use a rifle from Vikram, and participated in the gang's activities across [[Bundelkhand]], which straddles the border between Uttar Pradesh and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. These activities consisted of attacking and looting villages where upper-caste people lived, kidnapping relatively prosperous people for [[ransom]], and committing occasional highway robberies which targeted flashy cars. Phoolan was the only woman member of that gang of dacoits. After every crime, she would visit a [[Durga]] temple and thank the Goddess for her protection.&lt;ref name="goodbyemag_queen" /&gt; The gang's main hideouts were in the ravines of the [[Chambal River]].

Sometime later, Shri Ram and Lalla Ram, two upper-caste [[Rajput]] brothers who had been caught by the police, were released from jail and came back to the gang. They were outraged to hear of the murder of Babu Gujjar, their former leader, and held Phoolan responsible for inciting the act.&lt;ref name="John_Insurgents_2011"/&gt; They berated her for being a divisive wanton, and she answered them back with her characteristic foulness of tongue. Shri Ram then held her by the cuff of the neck and slapped her hard, and a scuffle ensued. Phoolan seized this opportunity to allege that Shri Ram had touched her breasts and molested her during the scuffle. As leader of the gang, Vikram Mallah berated Shri Ram for attacking a woman and made him apologise to Phoolan. Shri Ram and his brother smarted under this humiliation, which was exacerbated by the fact that Phoolan and Vikram both belonged to the Mallah caste of boatmen, much lower even that the Gujjar caste of milkmen and peasants to which Babu Gujjar had belonged, and vastly lower than the land-owning [[Rajput]] caste to which they themselves belonged.

Whenever the gang ransacked a village, Shri Ram and Lalla Ram would make it a point to beat and insult the Mallahs of that village. This displeased the Mallah members of the bandit gang, many of whom left the gang. On the other hand, around a dozen Rajputs joined the gang at the invitation of Shri Ram and Lalla Ram, and the balance of power gradually shifted in favour of the Rajput caste. Vikram Mallah then suggested that the gang be divided into two, one comprising mainly Rajputs and the other mainly Mallahs. Shri Ram and Lalla Ram refused this suggestion on the grounds that the gang had always included a mixture of castes during the days of Babu Gujjar and his predecessors, and there was no reason to change. Meanwhile, the other Mallahs were also not happy with Vikram Mallah. The fact that he alone had a woman cohabiting with him incited jealousy; some of the other Mallahs had bonds of kinship with Vikram's actual wife; and Phoolan's tongue did not endear her to anyone who interacted with her. A few days after the proposal for division had been floated, a quarrel ensued between Shri Ram and Vikram Mallah. Apparently, Shri Ram made a disdaining comment about Phoolan's morals, and Vikram responded with comments about Shri Ram's womenfolk. A gunfight ensued. Vikram and Phoolan, with not a single supporter, managed to escape in the dark. However, they were later tracked down and Vikram Mallah was shot dead. Phoolan was taken by the victorious faction to the Rajput-dominated village of Behmai, home to Shri Ram, Lalla Ram and several of the new Rajput recruits.&lt;ref name="goodbyemag_queen"/&gt;

According to legend, Vikram taught Phoolan, "If you are going to kill, kill twenty, not just one. For if you kill twenty, your fame will spread; if you kill only one, they will hang you as a murderess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India's bandit queen died as she once lived|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,168857,00.html|publisher=time.com|date=July 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detainment in Behmai===
Phoolan was locked up in a room in one of the houses in Behmai village. She was beaten and raped by several men over a period of three days.&lt;ref name="John_Insurgents_2011"/&gt; She then managed to escape, after three weeks of captivity, with the help of a low-caste villager of Behmai and two Mallah members from Vikram's gang, including Man Singh Mallah.

===A new gang===
Phoolan and Man Singh soon became lovers and joint leaders of a gang composed solely of Mallahs. The gang carried out a series of violent raids and robberies across Bundelkhand, usually (but not always) targeting upper-caste people. Some say that Phoolan targeted only the upper-caste people and shared the loot with the lower-caste people, but the Indian authorities claim this is a myth; there is no evidence of Phoolan or her partners in crime sharing money with anyone, whether low-caste or otherwise.&lt;ref name="bbc_champion" /&gt;

===Massacre in Behmai===
Seven months after her escape from Behmai, Phoolan returned to the village to seek revenge. On the evening of 14 February 1981, at a time when a wedding was in progress in the village, Phoolan and her gang marched into Behmai dressed as police officers. Phoolan demanded that her tormentors be produced, along with all the valuables in the village. However, most of the able-bodied men had gone to the city in search of manual work, and even after an exhaustive search, only two [[Rajput]] members of the former gang of bandits were found. These two men were not among those who had raped Phoolan; they were merely former members of Vikram Mallah's gang who belonged to the Rajput caste. Indeed, they were old comrades-in-arms of Phoolan, Vikram Mallah, Babulal Gujjar, Shri Ram and Lalla Ram.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Phoolan is said to have been frustrated that no actual culprit had been apprehended. Nevertheless, she had by this time developed a deep hatred for the entire caste of [[Rajput]]s, a few of whose members had protested the killing of Babulal Gujjar, then challenged the leadership of his murderer Vikram Mallah, deposed and killed Vikram Mallah and raped Phoolan herself over a period of weeks. Phoolan therefore ordered her gang members to line up each and every man belonging to the Rajput caste that they could lay their hands on in Behmai village. This included Rajputs who belonged to other villages and towns who had come to attend the wedding in the village.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The Rajput men were lined up and then, at Phoolan's order, they were shot dead by Phoolan and her gang members. Twenty-two Rajput men, were summarily killed. Later, Phoolan would try to absolve herself in court by claiming that she herself had not opened fire or killed a single person.&lt;ref name="goodbyemag_queen"/&gt;

The Behmai massacre provoked outrage across the country. [[V. P. Singh]], the then [[Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh]], resigned in the wake of the Behmai killings.&lt;ref name="tribune_samaj_honor"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A massive police manhunt was launched which however failed to locate Phoolan. It began to be said that the manhunt was not successful because Phoolan had the support of poor people in the region; stories on the [[Robin Hood]] model began circulating in the media. Phoolan began to be called the Bandit Queen, and she was glorified by sections of the Indian media&lt;ref name="bbc_champion"/&gt; as an intrepid and undaunted woman, the underdog struggling to survive in the world. The very flaws in her character and personality were interpreted as being manifestations of the suffering she had supposedly undergone at the hands of a feudal and patriarchal system. It was at this time that Phoolan, known until then by only one name, received the respectful sobriquet "Devi" from a reverent media and came to be known as "Phoolan Devi."{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Surrender and jail term===
Two years after the Behmai massacre, the police had still not captured Phoolan. The [[Indira Gandhi]] Government decided to negotiate a surrender. By this time, Phoolan was in poor health and most of her gang members were dead, some having died at the hands of the police, some others at the hands of rival gangs. In February 1983, she agreed to surrender to the authorities. However, she said that she didn't trust the [[Uttar Pradesh]] Police and insisted that she would only surrender to the [[Madhya Pradesh]] Police. She also insisted that she would lay down her arms only before the pictures of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and the Hindu goddess [[Durga]], not to the police.&lt;ref name="anuja_power"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~pm9k/gifs/ZoForth/Pholan/power.html
|title=Phoolan Power|author=Anuja Pande|accessdate=2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She laid down four further conditions:
# A promise that the [[death penalty]] would not be imposed on any member of her gang who surrenders
# The term for the other members of the gang should not exceed eight years.
# A plot of land to be given to her
# Her entire family should be escorted by the police to witness her surrender ceremony

An unarmed police chief met her at a ''rendezvous'' in the Chambal ravines. They traveled to [[Bhind]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]], where she laid down her rifle before the portraits of Gandhi and Goddess [[Durga]]. The onlookers included a crowd of around 10,000 people and 300 policemen, apart from the then chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, [[Arjun Singh]]. Other members of her gang also surrendered at the same time with her.

Phoolan was charged with as many as ''forty-eight'' crimes, including thirty charges of dacoity (banditry) and kidnapping. Her trial was delayed for eleven years, during which time she remained in prison as an undertrial. During this period, she was operated on for [[ovarian cyst]]s and underwent a [[hysterectomy]]. The doctor of the hospital reportedly joked that "We don't want Phoolan Devi breeding more Phoolan Devis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phoolan Devi|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1335253/Phoolan-Devi.html|accessdate=9 August 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=26 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was finally released on parole in 1994 after intercession by [[Vishambhar Prasad Nishad]], the leader of the [[Nishadha]] community (another name for the ''Mallah'' community of boatmen and fisherfolk). The Government of Uttar Pradesh, led by [[Mulayam Singh Yadav]], withdrew all cases against her. This move sent shock-waves across India and became a matter of public discussion and controversy.

===Marriage with Ummed Singh===

This time around Phoolan got married to Ummed Singh. Ummed Singh fought 2004 and 2009 election on Indian National Congress's ticket. In 2014 he contested election on Bahujan Samaj Party's ticket. Phoolan's sister Munni Devi later accused him of being involved in Phoolan's murder.&lt;ref&gt;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bandit-queens-sister-claims-sher-singh-wrongly-convicted-for-phoolans-murder/articleshow/64261756.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to Buddhism==
On 15 february 1995, Phoolan Devi and her husband Ummed Singh embraced [[Buddhism]] at the famous Buddhist site [[Deekshabhoomi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.akasamedia.com/women/phoolan.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member of Parliament==
In 1995, one year after her release, Phoolan was invited by Dr. Ramadoss (founder of Pattali Makkal Katchi) to participate in the conference about alcohol prohibition and women Pornography. This was her first conference after her release which began her Indian politics. However, Phoolan stood for election to the [11th Lok Sabha] from the [[Mirzapur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Mirzapur]] constituency in [Uttar Pradesh]. She contested the election as a member of the [[Samajwadi Party]] of [[Mulayam Singh Yadav]], whose government had withdrawn all cases against her and summarily released her from prison. She won the election and served as an MP during the term of the [[11th Lok Sabha]] (1996–98). She lost her seat in the [[Indian general election, 1998|1998 election]] but was re-elected in the [[Indian general election, 1999|1999 election]] and was the sitting member of parliament for [[Mirzapur]] when she was assassinated.

At 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Indian Standard Time|IST]] (08:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on 25 July 2001, Devi was shot dead by three masked gunmen outside of her Delhi bungalow. She was hit nine times on the head, chest, shoulder and right arm. Her personal security guard, Balinder Singh, was shot in his right chest and right arm, who returned fire with a 9-mm service pistol when the gunmen fled the scene in a [[Maruti 800]] car. They abandoned the car mid-way and boarded an auto rickshaw. The police recovered a [[Webley &amp; Scott#Webley &amp; Scott automatic pistols|Webley &amp; Scott pistol]] and an [[improvised firearm]], a [[IOF .32 Revolver]] from the spot, along with nine empty and 15 live rounds, from the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/2001/07/26/stories/01260001.htm|title=Phoolan Devi shot dead|accessdate=31 October 2018|work=The Hindu|date=26 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devi was taken to a nearby hospital but was declared dead. The prime suspect, [[Sher Singh Rana]], later surrendered to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile of Sher Singh Rana|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Profile-of-Sher-Singh-Rana/articleshow/1154821372.cms|accessdate=9 August 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=27 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rana allegedly claimed to have murdered Devi in revenge for the upper-caste men she gunned down in the Behmai massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1335484/Man-arrested-for-murder-of-Bandit-Queen.html|title=Man arrested for murder of 'Bandit Queen'|accessdate=9 August 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latest ruling, on 14 August 2014, the court sentenced Rana to life in prison and a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile of life sentences|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Life-sentence-to-Sher-Singh-Rana-for-killing-Phoolan-Devi/articleshow/40249822.cms|accessdate=14 August 2014|newspaper=Times of India|date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
In the immediate aftermath of the murder, the police were accused of incompetence in their handling of the case. It was alleged that a party worker picked up revolvers that had been dumped by the killers and hid them. Three other people staying in her house were accused of knowing about the revolvers. The revolvers then disappeared before the police could conduct forensic tests on them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Sher Singh Rana, the main accused, was convicted by Delhi court on August 8, 2014. However, the other ten accused were acquitted. Rana was convicted of the offences under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (common intention) under the IPC. The judge had fixed August 12, 2014, as the date for arguments and pronouncement of sentence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newskarnataka.com/india/Main-accused-in-Phoolan-Devis-killing-convicted/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystery surrounds Bandit Queen murder|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/jul/30/worlddispatch.lukeharding|accessdate=10 August 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, 2014 Rana was sentenced to a life term by a Delhi.&lt;ref name=toi4&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shakil|first1=Sana|title=Life sentence to Sher Singh Rana for killing Phoolan Devi|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Life-sentence-to-Sher-Singh-Rana-for-killing-Phoolan-Devi/articleshow/40249822.cms|accessdate=14 August 2014|work=The Times of India|date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movie and autobiography==
[[Shekhar Kapur]] made a movie ''[[Bandit Queen]]'' (1994) about Phoolan Devi's life up to her 1983 surrender, based on Mala Sen's 1993 book ''India's Bandit Queen: The True Story of Phoolan Devi''.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_Mala_201105"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/8546445/Mala-Sen.html | title = Obituaries: Mala Sen | work=The Telegraph | date = 2011-05-30 | accessdate = 2011-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Phoolan Devi is a heroine in the film, she fiercely disputed its accuracy and fought to get it banned in India. She even threatened to [[self-immolation|immolate]] herself outside a theater if the film were not withdrawn. Eventually, she withdrew her objections after the producer [[Channel 4]] paid her £40,000.&lt;ref name="Telegraph_Mala_201105"/&gt; The film brought her international recognition. Author-activist [[Arundhati Roy]] in her film review entitled, "The Great Indian Rape Trick", questioned the right to "restage the rape of a living woman without her permission", and charged Shekhar Kapur with exploiting Phoolan Devi and misrepresenting both her life and its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sawnet.org/books/writing/roy_bq1.html The Great Indian Rape-Trick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414182145/http://www.sawnet.org/books/writing/roy_bq1.html |date=14 April 2016 }} @ SAWNET -The South Asian Women's  NETwork, Retrieved 25 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 another low budget Bengali movie [[Phoolan Devi (1985 film)]] was released loosely based on Phoolan's life. This film was directed by Ashok Roy and starred by [[Suresh Oberoi]], [[Rita Bhaduri]] and [[Joy Banerjee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2325905/|title=Phoolan Devi (1985)|last=|first=|date=|website=imdb.com|access-date=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she was illiterate, Phoolan composed her autobiography entitled ''The Bandit Queen of India: An Indian Woman's Amazing Journey From Peasant to International Legend'', with the help of international authors Marie-Therese Cuny and Paul Rambali.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Bandit-Queen-India-Amazing-International/dp/1592286410/ The Bandit Queen of India: An Indian Woman's Amazing Journey from Peasant to International Legend] @ Amazon.com, Retrieved 25 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Paul Evans''' (born October 11, 1962) is an American author, best known for writing ''[[The Christmas Box]]'' and, more recently, the Michael Vey series.

==Biography==
Evans graduated from [[Cottonwood High School (Murray, Utah)|Cottonwood High School]] in Murray City, Utah. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree from the [[University of Utah]] in 1984.

While working as an advertising executive he wrote a Christmas story for his children. Unable to find a publisher or an agent, he self-published the work in 1993 as a paperback [[novella]] entitled ''The Christmas Box''. He distributed it to bookstores in his community. The book became a local bestseller, prompting Evans to publish the book in this region.

The next year ''The Christmas Box'' hit #2 on the [[New York Times bestseller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]], inciting an auction for the publishing rights among  the world's top publishing houses.  Evans signed a publishing deal with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], who paid him $4.2 million in an advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articleslatimes.com/2011/oct/13/local/la-me-margaret-burk-20111013|title=Margaret Tante Burk obituary: The co-founder of the Round Table West literary group was 93|last=Woo|first=Elaine|date=October 13, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released in [[hardcover]] in 1995, ''The Christmas Box'' became the first book to simultaneously reach the number-one position on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list for both paperback and hardcover editions. That same year, the book was made into a [[television movie]] of the same title, starring [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] and [[Maureen O'Hara]].

Evans has subsequently written 36 nationally best-selling books,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kutv.com/news/features/person-2-person/stories/vid_9.shtml|title=KUTV 2News "Person 2 Person: Richard Paul Evans"|date=June 14, 2013|work=KUTV 2News Utah|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including some for children, with conservative [[Christian]] themes and appealing to [[family values]]. His 1996 book ''Timepiece'' was made into a television movie featuring [[Naomi Watts]], [[James Earl Jones]], and [[Ellen Burstyn]], as were ''The Locket'' (1998), which starred [[Vanessa Redgrave]]; ''A Perfect Day'' (2006), which starred [[Rob Lowe]] and [[Christopher Lloyd]]; ''The Mistletoe Promise'' (2016), which starred [[Jaime King]] and [[Luke Macfarlane]]; and ''The Mistletoe Inn'' (2017), which starred [[Alicia Witt]] and [[David Alpay]].

During the spring of 1997, Evans founded Christmas Box House International, an organization devoted to building shelters and providing services for abused and neglected children. As of 2017, more than 35,000 children have been served by Christmas Box House facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://authors.simonandschuster.ca/Richard-Paul-Evans/706373|title=Richard Paul Evans|website=Simon &amp; Schuster|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans, a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], lives in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] with his wife Keri, five children, and one grandson.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

He founded the group "Tribe of Kyngs" to combat feelings of isolation among men and the belief that "masculinity is no longer valued". Initiation into the group includes a coronation ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tribe-of-kyngs-a-refuge-for-men-to-have-friends-connections_us_599729b6e4b03b5e472cef27|title=TRIBE OF KYNGS: A Refuge for Men to Have Friends, Connections, and Purpose|first=Benjamin P.|last=Hardy|date=18 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual harassment allegations ===

In 2018, it was revealed that Evans would not be invited back to FanX, a Salt Lake comic convention, due to allegations that he had kissed a female author on the cheek.

In an interview that aired Tuesday on KUTV-Channel 2 in Salt Lake City, Evans criticized some in the #metoo movement, stating, "These trends tend to swing too far the other way where innocent men are being caught up in, and we’re in a culture where it’s a war on men.” He told reporter Chris Jones that “there is a war on men" and that men are under attack, oppressed by a changing culture, victims of an extremist feminist agenda, adding, "There are books written that say, again, that men should be taken out, that they should account for no more than 10 percent of the population. Well, that makes men feel like Jews in Nazi Germany."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/05/23/utah-author-richard-paul-evans-accused-of-sexual-harassment-compares-the-plight-of-white-men-in-america-to-jews-in-nazi-germany/|title=Utah author Richard Paul Evans, accused of sexual harassment, apologizes for ‘stupid comparison’ between white men in America to ‘Jews in Nazi Germany’|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roberto V. Pesqueira Morales''' (1882 &amp;ndash; 1966) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] politician who was elected twice to the [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|Chamber of Deputies]] and was commissioned by President [[Venustiano Carranza]] to work as a confidential agent in the [[United States]] and secure [[diplomatic recognition]] to his regime.&lt;ref name="Barragan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barragán Rodríguez|first=Juan|title=Historia del ejército y de la revolución constitucionalista|publisher=Antigua Librería Robredo|location=Mexico City|year=1946| volume=1 |pages=135–140 |accessdate=2009-12-07 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesqueira was born in [[Arizpe, Sonora]]. His older brother, [[Ignacio L. Pesqueira|Ignacio]], went on to serve as [[Governor of Sonora]].&lt;ref name="Cumberland"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cumberland|first=Charles Curtis|title=Mexican Revolution: the Constitutionalist years|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, TX, USA|year=1972|series=Texas Pan American series|volume=4|isbn=9780292750005|oclc=123321124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D8YQd9hsne0C&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Roberto+V.+Pesqueira|accessdate=2009-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|72}} Roberto joined [[Francisco I. Madero]]'s Anti-Reelectionist Party in 1910 and was elected federal deputy representing the first district of Sonora in 1913,&lt;ref name="dict-sonora" /&gt; but refused to serve in the Chamber of Deputies after the consummation of [[Victoriano Huerta]]'s {{lang|fr|[[Decena trágica|coup d'état]]}} on 20 February 1913, and decided to join the revolutionary forces instead.&lt;ref name="Cumberland" /&gt;{{Rp|58}}

He was elected federal deputy once again in 1917 and acquired [[oil field]]s some years later. In February 1923 he wrote a letter to President [[Álvaro Obregón]], alerting him of some irregularities detected in his foreign competitors; in particular, the Huasteca Oil Company.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Linda B.|title=Oil, Banks, and Politics: The United States and Postrevolutionary Mexico|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin, TX, USA|year=1995|page=123|isbn=9780292731011|oclc=231655743|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9PIW33ecHvMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA123&amp;dq=Roberto+V.+Pesqueira|accessdate=2009-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slimane Azem''' (September 19, 1918 – January 31, 1983) was an [[Algerian people|Algerian]] singer and poet, born in [[Agouni Gueghrane]] (kabylie region),that composed hundreds of songs in more than 40 years of artistic life. A great connoisseur and admirer of the poet [[Si Mohand]], Slimane Azem included in his songs different [[Asefru|isefra]] (traditional poetry) by this author.

==Biography==
Slimane Azem was born September 19, 1918 at [[Agouni Gueghrane]], a small village located on the foothills of [[Djurdjura]]. Nothing predestined this son of a poor farmer to a musical career. A rather mediocre student, he had a passion for the [[La Fontaine's Fables]] that would later influence his writings and compositions. At the age of 11, he became a farm worker for a colonist in [[Staouéli]], a small resort near Algiers (the very beach were the French army landed in 1830). In 1937, he landed at [[Longwy]] as part of the [[Service du travail obligatoire]] and found work in a steel mill operation before being mobilized during the "[[Phoney War]]" in [[Issoudun]]. In 1940, he was discharged and went to Paris where he was hired as an assistant electrician in the [[Paris Métro]]. In 1942, Slimane was in Paris. The capital fascinated him and yet the work was hard. He was accustomed to life in the village in the great outdoors, but was now confined in tunnels and underground eight hours a day in the metro. Two years later, he underwent deportation by [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German troops]] in the [[Rhineland]] and remained there until its [[Rhineland Campaign|liberation]] in 1945, by the Americans.

Having received death threats during the [[independence of Algeria]], the singer was fled to France in 1962. He then became a legendary voice that Kabyles expatriates could only listen to on [[Radio Paris]] in his ''quart d'heure kabyle'' (fifteen minutes Kabyle daily) show. Azem was, in fact, banned from airing in his own country and his music circulated only clandestinely, his name could only be read in lowercase in brief, daily of his country. In 1970 he was awarded a gold disc along with the singer [[Noura]], imposing it as one of the best French sales. At the same time he became member of the [[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|SACEM]], the club of famous French stars. In Paris, he won a stewardship coffee in the [[15th arrondissement]]. He took the opportunity to interpret there his first compositions. Noticed and encouraged by Mohamed El Kamel, former member of Bachtarzi ensemble (named after [[Mahieddine Bachtarzi]]), he persevered in singing. Slimane finally recorded his first album with the song ''A muh muh has''. For all those Kabyles dealing with homesickness, his records were highly sought after at Madame Sauviat, the only record store that sold at that time albums of Maghrebi and Oriental artists. This woman, of [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]] origin, whose heirs now keep the shop on [[Boulevard de la Chapelle]], presented Slimane to the record company [[Pathé-Marconi]].

During the '70s, he made comic duets with the famous [[:fr:Noureddine Meziane|Cheikh Nouredine]] and sang ''Algérie, mon beau pays'' (Algeria, my beautiful country) and ''Carte de Résidence'' (Residence Card) in French. Over the recordings, Slimane Azem conquered a wide community audience through his lyrics parables where he staged animals and arises as a singer politically engaged. Then his inspiration declined.

He would later write a song in tribute to the [[Berber Spring]], ''Ɣef Teqbaylit yuli was'' (On Kabylia rises the day).

He never denied his peasant roots and spent much of his earnings in buying a farm in [[Moissac]] ([[Tarn-et-Garonne]]), where he spent six months a year cultivating his nostalgia in his fig and olive tree plantations. Slimane feared death in exile. It finally occurred a January 28, 1983 on his farm.

Since 2008, the city of Moissac decided to honor the old Berber singer giving a [[town square]] that bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Lagarrigue]],[http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2008/11/03/486184-Moissac-Pres-de-250-personnes-ont-honore-le-chanteur-Slimane-Azem.html Près de 250 personnes ont honoré le chanteur Slimane Azem], La Dépêche du Midi, 3 novembre 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, the city of Paris decided to honor him too with a square in the [[14th arrondissement]]. The plate was not visible however until 2014.

He was the brother of [[Ouali Azem]], [[National Assembly (France)|Member of Parliament]] from 1958 to 1962 under the [[French Fifth Republic]].

'''Sundari''' ({{lang-sa|सुन्दरी}} {{IAST|Sundarī}}) was a wandering [[ascetic]]. She is known as having been persuaded by her colleagues to help them denounce [[the Buddha]] due to their jealousy of his fame and honor. They instructed her to wander around [[Jetavana]] in close quarters to the Buddha and his disciples. She was later killed and her body was paraded in the streets. The evil ascetics falsely accused the Buddhist sangha for killing Sundari.

After seven days, the public became aware that the sangha was not responsible for Sundari's death. The Buddha's innocence restored, he proclaimed the importance of honesty and patience in the face of slander, as well as the retribution one reaps for dishonesty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20671">[[File:Arthur Drews.jpg|thumb|200px|right|alt=portrait photograph of Arthur Drews in profile|Arthur Drews]] 
'''''Die Leugnung der Geschichtlichkeit Jesu in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart''''' (English: '''''The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present''''') was a 1926 book in German by [[Arthur Drews]] on [[Christ myth theory]]. 
[[File:Albert Schweitzer 1952.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Albert Schweitzer, 1952 Nobel portrait, criticized the ''[[Life of Jesus|Lives of Jesus]]'' reconstructions]]

The book is a historical review of some 35 major deniers of Jesus historicity (radicals, mythicists) covering the period 1780 – 1926, and was meant to be Drews’s response to [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s ''[[Quest of the Historical Jesus]]'' of 1906. Drews’s book was in fact presented in the guise of ''"Quest of the non-Historicity of Jesus"'', with its own historical review of the key Jesus deniers.

As Schweitzer erected himself as the champion of "historicists", Drews stood up in opposition as the champion of 
"radicals" and "Jesus historicity deniers". They were later labelled "mythicists" by the media, a name never used by Drews, but popularized in the early 1940s by the British writers A.D. Howell Smith, in his book ''Jesus Not A Myth'' (1942) and [[Archibald Robertson (atheist)|Archibald Robertson]] in his book ''Jesus: Myth or History?'' (1946). This new label was convenient in opposing "mythicists" versus "historicists".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/jesusmythorhisto035413mbp/jesusmythorhisto035413mbp_djvu.txt Archibald Robertson, ''Jesus: Myth or History?'', 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== David Strauss and Bruno Bauer ==
Drews gives the most prominent place to [[David Strauss]], who reduced all the [[supernatural]] events of the New Testament stories to the role of [[myths]]; and to [[Bruno Bauer]], the first professional scholar who ''denied the historicity of Jesus'', argued the ''priority of Mark'' as ''inventor of the Gospel story'' and the ''fiction of Jesus's existence'', rejected all of Paul's epistles as ''non genuine'', and emphasized the input of Greco-Roman ideas (especially the ''[[Stoicism]]'' of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]) in the New Testament documents. Both Strauss and Bauer were forced to abandon University life at a young age.
[[File:Bruno Bauer.jpg|thumb|Bruno Bauer, German founder of the ''Christ Myth'' thesis]]

== The five major Jesus Deniers who influenced Drews's ''Christ Myth'' ==
Among those Jesus deniers, Arthur Drews was especially influenced by the following thinkers: 
* The German [[Bruno Bauer]] (1809–1882),&lt;ref name= "Bauer"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bauer/ "Bruno Bauer", by Douglas Moddach, 2009, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)'']&lt;/ref&gt; the original pioneer of the denial of Jesus Historicity. See whole [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/schweitzer/chapter11.html Ch. XI "The First Skeptical Life of Jesus"] dedicated to Bruno Bauer, in Albert Schweitzer's ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'' (1906).
* The German [[Albert Kalthoff]] (1850–1906):
::- ''Die Entstehung des Christentums – Neue Beiträge zum Christusproblem,'' (1904), transl. ''The Rise of Christianity'' (1907);
::- ''Was wissen wir von Jesus? Eine Abrechnung mit [[Wilhelm Bousset]]'' (1904) [''What do We Know of Jesus? A Settlement with Wilhelm Bousset''];
::- ''Modernes Christentum'' (1906) [''Modern Christendom''].
* The American [[William Benjamin Smith]] (1850–1934), fluent in English and German, and close to Kalthoff:
::- ''The Pre-Christian Jesus, Studies of Origins of Primitive Christianity'' (1906/1911);
::- ''Ecce Deus: Studies Of Primitive Christianity'', Introd. [[Paul Wilhelm Schmiedel]] (1912).
* The Scot [[J. M. Robertson]] (1856–1933):
::- ''Christianity and Mythology'' (1900–10);
::- ''A Short History of Christianity'' (1902);
::- ''Pagan Christs – Studies in Comparative Hierology'' (1903–1911).
* The Englishman [[Thomas Whittaker (metaphysician)|Thomas Whittaker]] (1856–1935): ''The Origins of Christianity'' (1904), declaring Jesus a myth.

== School of comparative history of religions ==

Space is dedicated to the major advocates of the ''School of (Comparative) History of Religions'',&lt;ref&gt;"[[History of religions]]"&lt;/ref&gt; flourishing in [[Germany]] (''Die Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'') and the [[United Kingdom]]. German orientalist [[Peter Jensen (Orientalist)|Peter Jensen]], an expert on Semitic Languages and Babylonian literature, in ''Das Gilgamesch-Epos in der Weltliteratur'', (Part I, 1906 &amp; Part II, 1928) [''The Epic of Gilgamesh in World Literature''],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/3251/1/GilgameshWhat'sNew.pdf Andrew George, ''What’s new in the Gilgamesh Epic?'', Un. of London]&lt;/ref&gt; had analyzed the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', and found parallels in all later [[Ancient Near East|ANE]] myths, including the Hebrew Tanakh, Moses and Isaiah,&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.westnet.com.au/gary-david-thompson/page9e.html Gary D. Thompson, "The Development, Heyday, and Demise of Panbabylonism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501141458/http://members.westnet.com.au/Gary-David-Thompson/page9e.html |date=2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus impacting on the authenticity of the Christian Gospels and destroyed the unique character of the Jesus story. [[Alfred Jeremias]] (1864–1935), another expert in [[Ancient Near East|ANE]] languages and mythology, had published ''The Epic of Gilgamesh'' (1891) and advocated ''[[panbabylonism]]'', the thesis that sees the Ancient Hebrew stories directly derived from Babylonian mythology. The English summary (by Klaus Schilling) of ''The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus'' describes Jeremias's views:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Jeremias] only admitted Chaldean origin of early Judaism, but couldn't deny that there was some sort of impact from old Babylon in the New Testament. The Babylonian-Chaldean worldview is about the most astralmythical and astrological worldview found in history of cultures; the terms 'astrological' and 'Chaldean' were used synonymously by many authors since Hellenic times. In this sense Jeremias continued the works of Volney and Dupuis... The Christian calendar tells the story of the astral redeemer king, the 12 apostles are akin to the zodiac, and the 4 Gospels are akin to the cardinal points of the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The Dutch Radical School ==
[[File:Van Manen.jpg|thumb|Willem Christiaan van Manen, Collection Leiden Un.]]
Drews was closely connected to what was called the school of Dutch “[[Radical Criticism]]”,&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Allan, [http://www.radikalkritik.de/A_forgotten_chapter.htm "A Forgotten Chapter: the Radicals"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717072449/http://www.radikalkritik.de/A_forgotten_chapter.htm |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which not only denied the existence of Jesus Christ, the authenticity of Paul's epistles,&lt;ref name="Dutch criticism"&gt;[http://depts.drew.edu/jhc/detering.html Hermann Detering, "The Dutch Radical Approach to the Pauline Epistles", 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="non-genuine"&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/content.htm#Summary Hermann Detering: ''Paulusbriefe ohne Paulus. Die Paulusbriefe in der holländischen Radikalkritik'' – "The Pauline Epistles Without Paul", 1992 (English abstract)]. The full German text ''Die Paulusbriefe in der Holländischen Radikalkritik'', 1992, 531 p. (''The Pauline Epistles in the Dutch Radical School'') not accessible online. The [http://www.radikalkritik.de/diss_inh.pdf Table of Contents] indicates a detailed examination of each member of the Dutch School. The extensive [http://www.radikalkritik.de/diss_inh.pdf Introduction, p. 1-17] is accessible.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the very historicity of Paul. Drews reviews the inputs from the key scholars:
* [[Allard Pierson]] (1831–1896): ''De Bergrede en andere synoptische Fragmenten'' (1878) [''The Sermon on the Mount and other Synoptic Fragments''], was epoch-making. It proved that the ''[[Sermon on the Mount]]'' is a post-70 product, a ''collection of aphorisms of Jewish wisdom'' placed into the mouth of the semi-god Jesus. Non-Christian witnesses are worthless, especially Tacitus. The ''Galatians epistle is not genuine'' (contrary to F.C. Baur and Tübingen School). Non-historicity of Jesus is affirmed. Pierson is recognized as the founder of the Dutch Radical School.
* [[Abraham Dirk Loman]] (1823–1897): ''Quaestiones Paulinae'' (1882–6) [''Questions on the Paulinae''] contends that not only Galatians, but ''all of Paul's Epistles are 2nd-century forgeries'' (following Bruno Bauer). No evidence of the Paulinae before Marcion, the epistles are Gnostic treatises. ''Jesus is a 2nd-century fiction''. "Some" Jesus may have existed, but buried and ''lost in the dark''. The Jesus of Christianity is an ideal symbol, a non-historical construction.
* Samuel Adrianus Naber (1828–1913): Christianity mixed Jewish and Roman-Hellenic thoughts. ''Greek myths have been fused with Isaiah''. Naber also supports the non-historicity of Jesus.
* [[Willem Christiaan van Manen]] (1842–1905): ''Paulus'' (1890–96). Agrees with Loman and Rudolf Steck that none of the epistles is genuine. [[Acts of the Apostles|''Acts'']] are ''dependent on Flavius Josephus'' and date from ca. 125–150. As an exception in the Dutch Radical School, does accept the historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref name="Van Manen"&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/nashville.htm "Willem C. Van Manen &amp; the Dutch Radicals", in ''Radikalkritik''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225035257/http://www.radikalkritik.de/nashville.htm |date=2007-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paulinism"&gt;[[s:Encyclopaedia Biblica/Passover-Paul#B.

Includes reviews of Acts, Romans, and 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rudolf Steck]]&lt;ref name="Van Manen"/&gt; (1842–1924): a Swiss scholar, an ally of the Dutch. In ''Der Galaterbrief nach seiner Echtheit untersucht nebst kritischen Bemerkungen zu den Paulinischen Hauptbriefen'' (1888) [''Inquiry into the Genuineness of the Galatians Epistle, and Critical Remarks on the Chief Paulines''], he branded ''all the Pauline epistles as fakes'',&lt;ref name="Dutch criticism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="non-genuine"/&gt; and supported Pierson and Naber.
* [[Gerard Bolland|G.J.P.J. Bolland]] (1854–1922): ''De Evangelische Jozua'' (1907) [''The Gospel of Joshua''] continued Bauer's concepts about Philo and his Logos, the Caesars, and earlier Jewish Gnosticism. Christianity is the result of ''syncretism between Hellenized Jews and Judeophile Greeks in Alexandria after 70'', with "Chrestos" (the good) becoming "Christus", i.e., Jesus. ''The original Jerusalem mother community is mere fiction''. Bolland also maintains the non-historicity of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egodeath.com/DeteringSummaryOfBolland.htm Hermann Detering, "G.J.P.J. Bolland", English Summary by Klaus Schilling]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gustaaf Adolf van den Bergh van Eysinga|G. A. van den Bergh van Eysinga]] (1874–1957): the last of the line to hold a professorship. His important writings came after 1926. Van Eysinga endorses the view that the epistles of Clement and [[Ignatius of Antioch]] are ''not genuine''. There is no evidence of the Paulinae before Marcion, ''all produced by the Marcion circle''. Paul does ''not sound Jewish'', (in opposition to Harnack). Paul's epistles are full of incongruities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/early_christianity.htm G.A. van Den Bergh van Eysinga, Early Christianity's Letters (1951)]&lt;/ref&gt; There's no evidence of the existence of Jesus the Messiah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/Whittaker.htm Thomas Whittaker, "Prof. G.A. van Den Bergh van Eysinga", (1934)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/vbve_survey.htm Klaus Schilling, "A survey: G.A. van den Bergh van Eysinga", (2003)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717072428/http://www.radikalkritik.de/vbve_survey.htm |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In 1930, van Eysinga dedicated an article to Arthur Drews, "Does Jesus Live, or Has He Only Lived?  A Study of the Doctrine of Historicity", commenting on Drews's 1926 book ''The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egodeath.com/eysingadoesjesuslive.htm G.A. van den Bergh van Eysinga, "Does Jesus Live, or Has He Only Lived?  A Study of the Doctrine of Historicity" (1930)] – English Summary by Klaus Schilling (2003), a commentary on Drews's "Denial of the Historicity of Jesus"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Van Eysinga expressed his conviction that the Jesus movement had started as a mystery cult in his article ''Das Christentum als MysterienReligion'' (1950, "Christianity as a Mystery Cult").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/Mysterien.htm G.A. van den Bergh van Eysinga, ''Das Christentum als MysterienReligion'' (1950, "Christianity as a Mystery Cult")]&lt;/ref&gt;

The attention to Drews and the Dutch School was revived by [[Hermann Detering]] and his Website, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070227183655/http://www.radikalkritik.de/in_engl.htm Radikalkritik]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/index.htm ''Radikalkritik'']&lt;/ref&gt; in German and English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/in_engl.htmage%20title%20or%20URL ''Radikalkritik'' – Articles, reviews and books in English]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews of other historicity deniers ==
[[File:Charles-François Dupuis.JPG|thumb|right|Charles-François Dupuis.]]
Drews gives credit to the two French pioneers, [[Charles-François Dupuis]] and [[Comte de Volney]], both imbued with an astral-mythical interpretation of Jesus and Christianity.

Drews does mention the broad impact of [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892), with his immensely popular Romanticist ''Vie de Jesus'' (1863, ''Life of Jesus''), in implanting serious doubts among the bourgeoisie. But Drews is less impressed by Renan as a scholar than Schweitzer was, who had devoted a full chapter (13) to the French "theology historian",&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Life of Jesus|Ernest Renan, ''Life of Jesus'', 1863]]&lt;/ref&gt; a space equal to that devoted to Bauer.

The prevailing term then was ''radicalism'', and Drews lends special attention to the adherents of Radicalism in Germany, the US, France, and England, and to a few other scholars, now less well remembered, but who made an insightful contribution in their time. Drews includes in his survey:
* [[:de:Hermann Reimarus|Hermann Reimarus]] (1694–1768), a teacher of Oriental languages in Hamburg, and whom Schweitzer enshrined as the original German skeptic of the divinity of Jesus in his 1906 ''Quest of the Historical Jesus – From Reimarus to Wrede.''
* [[Edwin Johnson (historian)|Edwin Johnson]] (1842–1901), and his ''Antiqua mater – A Study of Christian Origins'' (1887).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf Edwin Johnson, ''Antiqua mater – A Study of Christian Origins'', 1887, published anonymously] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911155951/http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf |date=2006-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An English radical theologian who identified the early Christians as the "Chrestiani", followers of a good ([[Chrestus]]) God who had expropriated the myth of [[Dionysus]] "Eleutherios" ("Dionysos the Emancipator"), to produce a self-sacrificing Godman. Johnson denounced the twelve apostles as complete fabrication.
* The Pole [[Andrzej Niemojewski]] (1864–1921, Warsaw), ''Gott Jesus im Lichte fremder und eigener Forschungen samt Darstellung der evangelischen Astralstoffe, Astralszenen, und Astralsysteme'', (1910), [''Research on the Gospels' astralmythic aspects of the Jesus God'']. He continues the line of Volney and Dupuis, by looking for parallels in astral mythology, but turns out to be "too confusing".
* [[Samuel Lublinski]] (1868–1910), ''Die Entstehung des Christentums aus der antiken Kultur'', (1910), [''Origins of Christendom from the Ancient culture''], and ''Das werdende Dogma vom Leben Jesu'' (1910), [''The Dogmatic Emergence of the Life of Jesus''], who saw Christianity arising from Gnosticism, a product of late Judaism shaped by the Hellenistic and Oriental mystery cults, with [[Essenes]] and the [[Therapeutae|Therapeuts]] as pioneering sects.
* Hermann Raschke, (1887–1970) ''Die Werkstatt des Markusevangelisten'' (1924), [''The Workshop of the Evangelist Mark''].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radikalkritik.de/Werkstatt.htm Hermann Raschke, "Historical and Metaphysical Christ", excerpt from ''The Workshop of the Evangelist Mark'' (1924), p. 26-30] (text in German)&lt;/ref&gt; A Lutheran minister, he claims that the Ancients didn't share in our modern historical consciousness, and made no absolute separation between historicity and mythic description. ''Everything was understood magically and speculatively.'' He stresses that [[Bar Kochba]] is the only authentic Messiah identified in the 1st and 2nd centuries, with [[Rabbi Akiva]] the "false prophet" who endorsed him. Marcion's Evangelikon looks more like Mark than Luke, against Harnack (Eysinga). The Pauline Savior is the ''Gnostic Redeemer''. Scholars like Harnack religiously follow [[Tertullian]] (assuming that only [[incarnation]]-in-the-flesh can guarantee [[Redemption (theology)|Redemption]] for mankind).
[[File:P S Krøyer 1900 - Georg Brandes - Skitse til maleri.jpg|thumb|250pz|Georg Brandes, a sketch for a painting by [[Peder Severin Krøyer|P.S. Krøyer]], 1900]]
* [[Emilio Bossi]] (1870–1920) (''Jesus Christ Never Existed'', 1904). Bossi was a radical lawyer/journalist ("Milesbo" being his pen-name). Jesus is a ''concoction from [[Tanakh]] and the mystery cults'', and Jesus's ethics are a patchwork from Philo and Seneca.
* [[Paul-Louis Couchoud]] (1879–1959), ''The Enigma of Jesus'' (1924), with an introduction by [[James Frazer]]. This is only the first step in his exegesis, as his important works appeared after 1926.
* [[Georg Brandes]] (1842–1927), an influential Danish critic, published late in life his ''Die Jesus Sage'' (1925), transl. ''The Jesus Myth''. Following Bruno Bauer, Brandes sees the order of NT writings as: Apocalypse of John, Paulinae, Gospels. Paul's Jesus is all celestial, and the Gospels are but an assemblage of [[midrash]] bits. Greco-Roman stoicism is a far superior kind of ethics to Jesus's morality.

With the Dane Georg Brandes, Drews ends his review in 1925, establishing the first historical list of the key radical/mythicists. This list has been brought up to date and expanded by later writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesusneverexisted.com/scholars.html "A History of 'Jesus Denial' "— "Demolishing the Historicity of Jesus", in ''Jesus Never Existed'', by Kenneth Humphreys]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drew's conclusions on denial of Jesus' historicity ==

In his final conclusions ("English summary" of the book, by Klaus Schilling), Drews emphasized that deniers (radicals, mythicists) ''do not form a movement'' (a so-called "denial party") trying to “unite” them against an entity called “Christianity”:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Drews describes the social consequences of a denial of historicity, and explains why so many theologians and secular researchers stick to historicity, though ''the ahistoricity of Jesus is scientifically as sure as'' that of Romulus and Remus, or the seven legendary kings of Rome. The consequences are generally underestimated.&lt;br/&gt;It is quite understandable that the ''denial party'' is unique only in that point [of the ''non-historicity'', ''Ahistorizität''], and otherwise offers ''a variety of diverging explanations'' [each denier has his own independent hypothesis]. The church has done everything for 2000 years to ''obscure and hide away the origins of Christianity'', so that there’s no way to get any further without speculative hypotheses.&lt;br/&gt;
It is obvious that no serious researcher could claim the historicity of Jesus, unless it were the savior of the dominating religion of the prevailing culture. So there’s ''nothing but Christian prejudice'' which keeps even secular researchers from admitting non-historicity... [emphasis added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8483">'''Tun Muhammad bin Tun Ahmad''', better known as '''Tun Sri Lanang''',&lt;ref name="Agus-Abdul Aziz"&gt;Agus, Abdul Aziz, ''Tokoh yang Kukoh, dalam Kesusasteraan Melayu Lama dan Baru, oleh Agus Salim: Dengan Sejarah Sastera'', pg 72&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Bendahara]] ([[Grand Vizier]]) of the royal Court of [[Johor Sultanate]] who lived between the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Agus-Abdul Aziz"/&gt; He served under two Sultans of Johor, namely; Sultan [[Ali Jalla Abdul Jalil Shah II]] (1570–1597) and Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah III (1597–1615) and also advisers to 3 Acheh sultans namely; [[Sultan Iskandar Muda]] (until 1636), [[Iskandar Thani|Sultan Iskandar Thani]] (1636–1641) and [[Taj ul-Alam|Sultana Tajul Alam Safiatuddin Shah]] (1641–1675). He had two honorific titles throughout his lifetime; as the Bendahara of Johor, ''Bendahara Paduka Raja Tun Mohamad'',&lt;ref&gt;The title Bendahara Paduka Raja being his honorific.&lt;/ref&gt; while he was given the title of ''Orang Kaya Dato' Bendahara Seri Paduka Tun Seberang'' after settling in Aceh.

==Early life and events in Johor==

Tun Sri Lanang was born in 1565 in Seluyut, Johore, and was descended from Tun Tahir, a brother of Bendahara [[Tun Mutahir of Malacca]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, ''Source of the Malacca Johore and Pahang Genealogies'', pg 148&lt;/ref&gt; There are not many records about his period as Bendehara in Johore. However, during the rule of Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah III, he shouldered a heavier burden on the affairs of the state as the Sultan is a weak ruler. He shared the responsibility with the Sultan's brother Raja Abdullah (later to become Sultan Abdullah Maayah Shah which reigns between 1615 to 1623).

During the period the Dutch were attacking the Portuguese for the port of Malacca. The Dutch signed a friendship treaty with the Johore Sultanate (in 1606) with Tun Sri Lanang as a representative. Tun Sri Lanang refused the Dutch request of helping the Dutch to blockade the port of Malacca preferring the Dutch do it themselves.

In 1612, at the request of Raja Abdullah to pen the ''[[Malay Annals]]'' to ensure " ... all the [[adat]], the rules and the ceremonies of the Malay [[Sultans]] and Rajas to be heard by our descendants and is made known all utterances so that it may benefit them". At this time, under the orders of Sultan Alauddin Riaayat Shah, Tun Sri Lanang oversaw the editorial and compilation process&lt;ref&gt;Safian, Johan, Mohd. Thani, Hawa, ''History of Modern Malay Literature'', pg 260 As a history teacher who is dedicated to his field, Shaharom Husain believes that a writer/compiler of the Sejarah Melayu is important and should be remembered and his deeds "respected" by the future generation. although Shaharom Husain agrees that Tun Seri Lanang is not the real author of Sejarah Melayu, he does not deny that the said personality is a "writer, historian and compiler of...&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Malay Annals]], better known as ''Sejarah Melayu'' in [[Malay language|Malay]].

In 1613, Acheh attacked Johor and in the battle of Batu Sawar. Johore was defeated and the Royal Family and Tun Sri Lanang was captured and brought to Aceh. The Bendaharaship was continued by his descendants. His notable descendants include Bendehara [[Tun Habib Abdul Majid]] and the [[Raja Temenggung of Muar]].&lt;ref&gt;Haji Buyong bin Adil, ''Sejarah Terengganu'', pg 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winstedt, ''A History of Johore'', pg 189, 194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life in Aceh==

After a brief "reeducation" in Aceh, the Johor Royal Family was returned to Johor. Tun Sri Lanang elected to stay in Acheh. He became advisor to the third Sultan of Acheh and was bestowed an Acheh honorific title. He was awarded a personal fief in Samalanga, [[Aceh]] in 1613 and held the title ''Uleebalang of Samalanga''. He died in 1659 in [[Samalanga]].&lt;ref name="Suzana page 89"&gt;(Tun) Suzana (Tun) Othman, ''Tun Seri Lanang, Sejarah dan Warisan Tokoh Melayu Tradisional'', page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Some of Tun Sri Lanang's descendants ruled as the Uleebalang of Samalanga until 1949, when Indonesia was formed in the same year. Many of his descendants were fervent nationalists including the female warrior Pocut Meuligo,&lt;ref&gt;(Tun) Suzana (Tun) Othman, ''Tun Seri Lanang, Sejarah dan Warisan Tokoh Melayu Tradisional'', pages 128-131&lt;/ref&gt; Teuku Muhammad Daud, Teuku Abdul Hamid Azwar and Teuku Hamzah Bendehara. Some of his descendants carry the "Bedahara" suffix to their names indicating their ancestry.

His legacy is not only the rewriting and compiling of the magnum opus "Sejarah Melayu" but also includes the strongly Islamic flavor of Samalanga. Samalanga is also known as "Kota Santri",&lt;ref name="Suzana page 89"/&gt; or "Town of Medrassas" is the centre of Islamic propagation in Acheh until today. Samalanga was also among the last town to fall to the Dutch during the time of the last Sultan of Acheh, Sultan Muhammad Daud Shah and also one of his strongholds.

'''Willis W. Harman''' (August 16, 1918 – January 30, 1997)&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal| title=Obituary: Willis Harman| work=[[The Futurist (magazine)|The Futurist]]| publisher=[[World Future Society]]| date=May–June 1997| volume=31| issue=3| page=59| issn=0016-3317}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American engineer, [[futurist]], and author associated with the [[human potential movement]]. He was convinced that late industrial civilization faced a period of major cultural crisis which called for a profound transformation of human consciousness. Over a career lasting some four decades, he worked to raise public awareness on the subject through his writings and to foster relevant research through the nonprofit research institute [[SRI International]], the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]] (IONS), and the [[World Business Academy]] (WBA). He served as president of IONS for two decades, and he was a cofounder of the WBA. His many books include volumes coauthored with the futurist [[Howard Rheingold]], who put forward similar views, and the mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]].

==Early life and education==
Willis W. Harman was born in [[Seattle, Washington]] on August 16, 1918. His father was a [[hydroelectric]] engineer and his mother was a music teacher.&lt;ref name=Cornish&gt;Cornish, Edward, ed. "Futurists and Their Ideas". In ''The study of the future: an introduction to the art and science of understanding and shaping tomorrow's world''. Transaction Publishers, 1977, pp. 157–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  He attended the [[Western Washington College of Education]] before moving on to graduate from the [[University of Washington]] in 1939 with a B.S. degree in [[electrical engineering]].&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt; 

After graduation, he worked for [[General Electric]] and then joined the Navy as an electrical officer.&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt; He was stationed on the [[USS Maryland (BB-46)]] but was ashore at his home near [[Pearl Harbor]] during the 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt; After the end of [[World War II]], Harman received his M.S. in physics and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name="Harman1"/&gt;

==Academic career==
Harman taught for several years at the [[University of Florida]] before joining the Stanford faculty in 1952 to teach physics and electrical engineering.&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harman1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=yoga/&gt;
 
In 1954, he attended a summer seminar on ethics, meditation, and the spiritual life that had a transformative effect on both his thinking and his career.&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harman2&gt;Harman, Willis. Untitled chapter in Frederick Franck, Janis Roze, and Richard Connolly, eds., ''What Does It Mean to Be Human?'', pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt; He later said of this experience that it "opened up vast areas I didn't even know were there. It completely changed my concept of what is important in education, and in time led to various activities in the field of humanistic psychology."&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt; 

Harman became convinced that Western culture was facing a spiritual and moral crisis stemming from the ravages of industrialism and its economic logic, which he came to call the "World Macroproblem".&lt;ref name=Gelder/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Gibson, Donald. ''Environmentalism: Ideology and Power'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; As Harman saw it, "If you look at the assumptions underlying our economic system – especially the ones regarding the prerogatives of ownership – and then you look at the goals we humans have about how we want to live our lives, there is no compatibility. The assumptions can never lead to the goals."&lt;ref name=Gelder/&gt; In his view, this crisis that called for development of both an "ecological ethic" and a "self-realization ethic".&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt; In short, society needed to transform its institutions to support the personal development of individual human beings within an environment of limited resources.&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gelder/&gt; Because Harman considered humans an integral part of the natural world, he saw individual self-realization and environmental sustainability as synergistic rather than contradictory paths forward.&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt; Harman also recognized the large (and often problematic) role that unconscious processes play in human culture and foresaw that work was needed to better understand how such processes might be harnessed in positive ways.&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt;

Harman incorporated his new perspective in a popular Stanford graduate seminar called "The Human Potential" that covered topics ranging from meditation to psychoactive drugs to parapsychology.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, Thomas B. ''Psychedelic Horizons'', n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, he was appointed a [[Regents of the University of California|regent of the University of California]] by then governor [[Jerry Brown]].&lt;ref name=sfgate1997&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Willis-W-Harman-3137957.php "Willis W. Harman"]. ''SFGate'', February 6, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yesmagazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/money-print-your-own/892| title=PFN News Spring 1997 — YES! Magazine| publisher=yesmagazine.org| accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a regent for ten years.&lt;ref name=sfgate1997/&gt;

==SRI International==
Harman eventually left Stanford to become a senior social scientist at [[SRI International]] and the director of SRI's Educational Policy Research Center.&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt; There he initiated a research program focused on solving the problems posed by uncontrolled industrial development.&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt; This work led to his 1976 book ''An Incomplete Guide to the Future'', with its vision of a transindustrial society.&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt; Unlike many futurists, Harman did not believe that the future was predictable simply by projecting current trends; consequently, a hallmark of his work is his ability to conceive ideas about the future that don't clearly stem from present tendencies.&lt;ref name=Cornish/&gt; 

At SRI, Harman recruited [[Alfred Matthew Hubbard]] to the Alternative Futures Project, one of the goals of which was to introduce business and thought leaders to [[LSD]].&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt;&lt;ref name="fargonebooks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fargonebooks.com/high.html| title=The Original Captain Trips| author=Todd and Lisa Fahey| publisher=fargonebooks.com|accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Institute of Noetic Sciences==
Harman was invited by astronaut [[Edgar Mitchell]] to join the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]] (IONS) in [[Sausalito]] in 1973, the year it was founded.&lt;ref name=yoga/&gt; He went on to serve as its president from 1978 until his death in 1997.&lt;ref name=yoga/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT1997/&gt; He described IONS' mission as bringing science and religion back together, though in ways that would require fundamental changes in both.&lt;ref name=yoga&gt;"Encouraging a 'Global Mind Change'". ''Yoga Journal'', Sept.-Oct. 1989, pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Harman was in charge of "Global Mind Change", then one of four major IONS programs.&lt;ref name=yoga/&gt; Besides supporting Harman's 1988 book of the same title, it sponsored citizen tours of the USSR and other activities.&lt;ref name=yoga/&gt;

==World Business Academy==
In 1987, Harman cofounded the [[World Business Academy]] with [[Rinaldo Brutoco]] and other businesspeople.&lt;ref name=wba&gt;Harman, Willis. [https://worldbusiness.org/why-a-world-business-academy/ "Why a World Business Academy?"]. World Business Academy website. Originally published 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The WBA grew out of his conviction that business would play a critical role in the period of profound social transformation that Harman foresaw.&lt;ref name="Harman1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Business of Business: Sharing Responsibility for a Positive Global Future| author1=Harman, W.W.| author2=Porter, M.| date=1997| publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers| isbn=9781576750186|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N8duPr8xowcC&amp;pg=PA273| page=273| accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wba/&gt; Its goal was to foster smoother change by helping business leaders assume new roles of social responsibility.&lt;ref name=wba/&gt;&lt;ref name="scottlondon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/harman.html| title=Business and Social Responsibility: An Interview with Willis Harman| publisher=scottlondon.com| accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and death==
In 1941, Harman married Charlene Reamer, who survived him. They had three daughters (Billie, Mary, and Susan) and a son, Dean.&lt;ref name=sfgate1997&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Willis-W-Harman-3137957.php "Willis W. Harman"]. ''SFGate'', February 6, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harman died of brain cancer.&lt;ref name=LAT1997&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1997-02-05/news/mn-25777_1_social-scientist "Willis W. Harman; Former UC Regent, Author, Social Scientist"]. ''Los Angeles Times'', February 5, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
:"A noetic science—a science of consciousness and the world of inner experience—is the most promising contemporary framework within which to carry on that fundamental moral inquiry which stable human societies have always had to place at the center of their concerns."&lt;ref name=white&gt;White, John. "Homo Noeticus". In John Weber, ed., ''An Illustrated Guide to The Lost Symbol'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Business has become, in this last half-century, the most powerful institution on the planet; it is critical that the dominant institution in any society take responsibility for the whole, as the church did in the days of the Holy Roman Empire. But business has not had such a tradition."&lt;ref name=wba/&gt;

:"The assumptions about economic progress seemed to work rather well during the time when you could equate material progress with general benefit. But that equation doesn’t work anymore. We now have a system that works to the benefit of the few and penalizes masses of people today and in the future."&lt;ref name=Gelder&gt;[http://www.context.org/iclib/ic41/harman/ " Transformation Of Business"]. An interview with Willis Harman by Sarah van Gelder. ''In Context'', no. 41, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"All the things that I had been taught all of my life were of value clearly were of no value at all. In a few instants they would be gone. But one thing is of value—and only one. [[Alan Watts]] called it 'the Supreme Identity'—the identification with the Divine."&lt;ref name=Harman2/&gt;
