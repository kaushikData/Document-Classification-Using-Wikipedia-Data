'''Argentina began a period of [[fiscal austerity]] in 2012''', dubbed "''Sintonía fina''" ({{lang-es|Fine tuning}}) by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavoz.com.ar/noticias/politica/cristina-apela-sintonia-fina-para-disimular-ajuste Cristina apela a la sintonía fina para disimular el ajuste] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/671vJbgNe?url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/noticias/politica/cristina-apela-sintonia-fina-para-disimular-ajuste |date=2012-04-19 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/ediciones/2012/3/edicion_660/contenidos/noticia_0020.html De la sintonía fina al ajuste desordenado] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/671vURY9B?url=http://www.perfil.com/ediciones/2012/3/edicion_660/contenidos/noticia_0020.html |date=2012-04-19 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included increases in several utility and public service rates, limits on wage raises, limits on imports, and a reorganization of state enterprises. 

==Rates and fares==
The administration of [[Néstor Kirchner]] and of his wife and successor, [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], had imposed [[price controls]] on utilities and public services, at levels cheaper than needed by service providers, since 2003. The state had provided [[subsidy|subsidies]] to the service providers, compensating their losses. Fiscal austerity policies enacted early in 2012 removed many of these subsidies, however, leading to huge rate and fare increases. The removal of subsidies in the case of utility rates was done initially on a case-by-case basis, and by inviting people to voluntarily forfeit the subsidies by filling out a form; several politicians and other famous people did so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2011/11/23/noticia_0028.html Cristina, el gabinete y algunos famosos ya renunciaron a los subsidios] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were then removed for wealthy neighborhoods, and while rates were maintained in lower income districts, the increases were eventually extended to most people. Several unions [[#Wages|requested wage raises]] in accordance to these increases and to high inflation generally; the rate and fare increases would cost up to 80% of the amount of the wage raises, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2011/11/20/noticia_0018.html La quita de subsidios licuará hasta el 80% del alza salarial a la clase media] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in rates - up to 300% - has no similar precedent in recent Argentine history, save for those enacted by Economy Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]] more than a decade before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2011/11/26/noticia_0027.html El tarifazo más lindo del mundo, obra maestra del relato kirchnerista] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wages==
Inflation rates published by independent sources are very high, although [[INDEC]], which is controlled by the presidency, publishes lower inflation rates. High inflation, in turn, has prompted [[trade unions in Argentina]] to request frequent wage increases. The National Government endorsed [[collective bargaining]] wage raise guidelines of 24% in 2010 and 25% in 2011.&lt;ref name=rosada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presidencia.gov.ar/informacion/actividad-oficial/25690-la-presidenta-anuncio-un-aumento-de-1762-para-los-jubilados-a-partir-de-marzo|title=La Presidenta anunció un aumento de 17,62% para los jubilados a partir de marzo|publisher=Presidencia de la Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average wage hike obtained by unions was 5% higher than these figures, however,&lt;ref name=rosada/&gt; and the administration's austerity guideline for 18% raises in 2012 was similarly flouted by subsequent collective bargaining agreements, which averaged nearly 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economia.iprofesional.com/notas/130355-Desde-la-UIA-anticipan-que-los-aumentos-de-salarios-rondaran-el-25|title=Desde la UIA anticipan que los aumentos de salarios rondarán el 25%|work=iProfesional}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugo Moyano]], head of the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labor]] (CGT), opposed the new, more moderate guidelines, and joined forces with a longtime rival, Restaurant Workers Union head [[Luis Barrionuevo]], to pursue requests for higher raises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambito.com/diario/noticia.asp?id=629016 Moyano y Barrionuevo aceitan pacto para elevar paritarias] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio Caló of the Steel and Metalworkers Union (UOM) and Sergio Palazzo of the Bank Employees Union did likewise, announcing sectoral [[strike action|strike]]s in May to seek a 25% increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambito.com/diario/noticia.asp?id=636209|title=UOM y Bancarios paran y se movilizan contra 22%|work=Ámbito Financiero}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Imports==
Seeking to reverse a decline in [[foreign exchange reserve]]s caused by the emergence of a negative [[current account balance]] in 2011, Commerce Secretary [[Guillermo Moreno]] enacted [[Capital controls|measures]] to prevent the purchase of [[U.S. dollar]]s and to curtail imports. Several sectors of the Argentine economy, such as [[reseller]]s and [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] that work with imported items, were harmed by these policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cira.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3108%3Aimportaciones-con-trabas-y-sustitucion&amp;catid=103%3Anoticias-otros-medios&amp;lang=es Importaciones con trabas y sustitución ] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno stipulated that importers export at least as much as they import, and several firms were threatened with [[expropriation]] upon failure to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1449674-moreno-exigio-a-las-empresas-que-compensen-importaciones Moreno exigió a las empresas que compensen importaciones] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He organized a system, independent of the [[Buenos Aires Customs|National Customs]], to personally oversee the requests for imports; more than half of import requests filed under the new system were denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cira.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3107%3Amoreno-ahora-aprueba-solo-la-mitad-de-los-permisos-para-importar&amp;catid=103%3Anoticias-otros-medios&amp;lang=es Moreno ahora aprueba sólo la mitad de los permisos para importar] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action generated diplomatic tension and commercial disputes with [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]], and [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieco.clarin.com/economia/Peru-Chile-Colombia-Mexico-Argentina_0_667133327.html Por las trabas, Perú, Chile, Colombia y México demandarían a la Argentina] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State enterprises==
The [[Buenos Aires Metro]] had been subsidized as well; instead of removing these subsidies directly as was done with other services, however, the National Government proposed the subways' transfer to the [[City of Buenos Aires]]. Mayor [[Mauricio Macri]] initially accepted, but further differences arose. The National Government intended to transfer the subways without the subsidized budget needed to operate them, and the city had already passed a municipal budget for 2012 which did not consider these added costs. The [[2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster]] generated concern about the conditions of railways and subways, moreover. The city administration considered that without the transfer of subsidies the city's economy would be harmed, and that the administration's conditions regarding these were an imposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciudad1.com/Notas-19185-El-Subte-que-hace-ruido El Subte que hace ruido] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729211011/http://www.ciudad1.com/Notas-19185-El-Subte-que-hace-ruido |date=2012-07-29 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Government sent a bill to [[Argentine National Congress|Congress]] to approve the transfer, and Macri did similarly with the [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|City Legislature]]; both must approve the transfer to confirm it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laprensa.com.ar/389088-Vidal-insiste-en-que-el-traspaso-del-subte-debe-estar-ratificado-por-la-Legislatura.note.aspx Vidal insiste en que el traspaso del subte debe estar ratificado por la Legislatura] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Currency Exchange Rate==
Changes related to the 2012 fiscal austerity measures, as well as the government's April 2012 seizure of the country's largest oil-and-gas corporation, [[YPF]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Repsol sues Argentina over YPF seizure|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/99d1ead0-9e9d-11e1-9cc8-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=19 June 2015|work=Financial Times|date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; also had a pronounced effect on currency trading for both institutions as well as individuals wanting to buy or sell pesos. Following the tightening of foreign export controls and import restrictions, in early 2012 a widening gulf emerged between the official peso-dollar exchange rate and the blue-chip swap rate, indicating a much weaker sentiment on the value of the peso relative to the U.S. dollar than the official exchange rate suggested. For tourists and local residents wanting to exchange dollars for pesos (or vice versa), it meant an active black market centered around [[Florida Street]], where the peso could be traded for a lower value than the official exchange rate, which sees almost daily intervention from Argentina's central bank designed to slow its perceived weakening relative to the dollar. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304868004577377953225550394 Argentina's Peso Problem]&lt;/ref&gt; 2012's reforms, instead of having the intended effect of holding down interest rates and spurring economic recovery, ended up causing an immediate and sustained [[Capital flight|flight of capital]] from the traditional banking system into a robust underground economy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-26/pesos-go-underground-as-dollar-ban-backfires-argentina-credit.html Pesos Go Underground as Dollar Ban Backfires]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|right|Border changes in central and eastern Europe, 1938-48. The Albanian Subversion aimed to move Albania from the communist bloc to the Western side.]]

The '''Albanian Subversion''' ({{Lang-sq|Përmbysja e Shqipërisë}}) is one of the earliest and most notable failures of the Western [[Covert operation|covert]] paramilitary operations in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] and the [[United States|American]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] launched a joint subversive operation, using as agents [[Albanians|Albanian]] expatriates. Other anti-communist Albanians and many nationalists worked as agents for [[Greece|Greek]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] intelligence services, some supported by the UK and U.S. secret services. A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], and, later, other spies tipped off the missions to [[Moscow]], which in turn relayed the information to Albania. Consequently, many of the agents were caught, put on trial, and either shot or condemned to long prison terms at [[Penal labour|hard labor]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Albanian subversion cost the lives of at least 300 men and for a long time was one of the most carefully concealed secrets of the [[Cold War]]. In 2006, some 2,300 pages of documents laying out major parts of the Albania Project under its two major cryptonyms, BGFIEND and OBOPUS, were declassified by a U.S. government interagency working group acting under the terms of the [[Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group|Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act]]. These documents are available at the [[College Park (Maryland)|National Archives in College Park, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;Within Record Group 263. A user's guide is available to assist researchers in locating the documents.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The reason behind the operation in Albania was that [[Albania]] was separated from the Eastern Bloc by [[Yugoslavia]], which had split with the Soviet Union in June 1948. Albania was also the poorest [[Europe]]an nation, and was home to about one million people, many still divided along semi-feudal and (especially in remote areas) tribal lines. There were three major religious groups and two distinct classes: those people who owned land and claimed feudal privileges and those who did not. The landowners, only about 1% of the population, held 95% of the cultivated land as well as the principal ruling posts in the country's central and southern regions.

During [[World War II]], the Albanian society was split into several amorphous groups: nationalists, communists, [[Balli Kombetar|royalists]], traditionalists - the latter both tribal and feudal in nature. It was the Communist-led [[National Liberation Front (Albania)|National Liberation Front]] that emerged victorious, mainly due to the ideological discipline instilled in their troops, but also because they were the only force which had consistently fought the Italians and Germans; many nationalists and the royalists had collaborated with Italian or German occupiers during the war.

However, Albania was in an unenviable position after World War II. [[Greece]] hungered for Albanian lands it claimed, while Yugoslavia wanted Albania merged into a Balkan confederation. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] recognized neither [[King Zog]] nor a republican government-in-exile, nor did they ever raise the question of Albania or its borders at major wartime conferences. No reliable statistics on Albania's wartime losses exist, but the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] reported about 30,000 Albanian dead from the war, 200 destroyed villages, 18,000 destroyed houses, and about 100,000 people made homeless, numbers whose significance is further compounded by the relatively small population of Albania: approximately 1,000,000 in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldwar-2.net/casualties/world-war-2-casualties-index.htm | title=the Casualties Section | accessdate=July 27, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134810/http://www.worldwar-2.net/casualties/world-war-2-casualties-index.htm| archivedate= 24 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian official statistics claim somewhat higher losses.

==Operational plans==
{{Covert United States involvement in regime change}}
In this post-war chaos of 1949 the allies decided to launch their operation. The plan called for parachute drops of royalists into the [[Mat District|Mati]] region in Central Albania. The region was traditionally known as a bastion of Albanian traditionalism and moreover praised for their loyalty to [[King Zog]], himself an offspring of one of the regional clans. The original plan was that, if [[United Kingdom|Britain]] could parachute in enough well-trained agents, they could organize a massive popular revolt, which the allies would supply by air drops. In time, this revolt would spill out a [[civil war]]. The trouble that this would cause the Soviet politics was considered by the British to be worth the risk, and if it did succeed, then it could be the starting point of a chain reaction of popular revolutions throughout the [[Eastern Bloc]]. The project appeared so appealing that the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS) had no hesitation in putting in into operation. It was run in detail by an agent who had come into SIS and [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE). The chief of SIS, [[Stewart Menzies]], was not enthusiastic about the paramilitary operation but saw it as a way to appease the former SOE “stinks and bangs people.”

In addition, the British wanted the [[United States]] to finance the operation and to provide bases. Senior British intelligence officer [[William Goodenough Hayter|William Hayter]], who chaired the Joint Intelligence Committee ([[Joint Intelligence Center|JIC]]), came to [[Washington, D.C.]] in March with a group of Secret Intelligence Service members and [[Foreign Office]] staff that included [[Gladwyn Jebb]], [[Earl Jellicoe]], and [[Peter Dwyer]] of SIS and a [[Balkans]] specialist. Joined by SIS Washington liaison [[Kim Philby|Harold Adrian 'Kim' Philby]], they met with [[Rob Joyce|Robert Joyce]] of the [[US State Department]]’s [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy and Planning Staff]] (PPS) and [[Frank Wisner]], who was the head of the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] (OPC), and other U.S. intelligence officials such as James McCargar and [[Franklin Lindsay]]. McCargar was assigned to liaise with Philby on joint operational matters.  Unbeknownst to the SIS and CIA, though, Philby was a [[Communism|communist]], and [[espionage|spy]] for [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet foreign intelligence]].

There was no scarcity of anti-communist Albanians and the recruiters promptly found them in the Displaced Persons camps in [[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Turkey]]. The manpower recruitment for what the British codenamed [[VALUABLE Project]] and the Americans [[FIEND]], consisted of 40% from the [[Balli Kombëtar]] (BK) National Front, an organization formed during World War II on a nationalist program committed to creating a [[Greater Albania]]; 40% from the monarchist movement, known as [[Legaliteti]]; and the rest from other Albanian factions.

== Valuable Project/Fiend  ==
{{see also|"Free Albania" National Committee}}

A dozen Albanian [[emigré]]s were recruited and taken to [[Libya]] to train for a pilot project that would become known as Operation Valuable (It is not clear exactly when MI6 assigned the VALUABLE cryptonym to the Albanian effort). The SIS, with U.S. Army Col. 'Ace' Miller as a liaison, trained these men in the use of weapons, codes and radio, the techniques of subversion and sabotage. They were dropped into the mountains of [[Mat District|Mati]] throughout 1947, but failed to impress the inhabitants of the region into a larger revolt. The operation dragged on until 1949. There were sabotage attempts on the [[Kucova]] [[oilfields]] and the [[copper]] mines in [[Rubik, Albania|Rubik]] but no real success in raising a revolt. Then, the US government weighing up the political situation, decided to lend a hand. In September 1949, British foreign secretary [[Ernest Bevin]] went to Washington, D.C. to discuss Operation Valuable with US government officials. The CIA released a report that concluded that “a purely internal Albanian uprising at this time is not indicated, and, if undertaken, would have little chance of success.” The CIA asserted that the [[Enver Hoxha]] regime had a 65,000 man regular army and a security force of 15,000. There were intelligence reports that there were 1,500 Soviet “advisers” and 4,000 “technicians” in Albania helping to train the [[Albanian Army]].

British and U.S. naval officials were concerned that the USSR was building a [[submarine base]] at the [[Karaburun Peninsula, Albania|Karaburun Peninsula]] near the port of [[Vlora]]. On September 6, 1949, when [[NATO]] met for the first time in Washington, Bevin proposed that “a counter-revolution” be launched in Albania. US Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] was in agreement. NATO, established as a defensive military alliance for Western Europe and North America, was now committed to launching offensive covert operations against a sovereign nation in the [[Balkans]]. The U.S. and UK, joining with their weak allies, Italy and Greece, agreed to support the overthrow of the Hoxha regime in Albania and to eliminate Soviet influence in the [[Mediterranean]] region. Bevin wanted to place King Zog on the throne as the leader of Albania once Hoxha was overthrown.

This time a better class of [[commando]] was sought so an approach was made to King Zog in exile in [[Cairo]] to recommend men for the job. But British negotiator Neil 'Billy' McLean and American representatives Robert Miner and Robert Low were unable to bring Zog in because no one would name him head of a provisional government in exile. In August 1949, an announcement was made in Paris that Albanian political exiles had formed a multiparty committee to foment anticommunist rebellion in the homeland; actually the [["Free Albania" National Committee]] was created by American diplomatic and intelligence officials for political cover to a covert paramilitary project, with British concurrence. The British made the first organizational move, hiring on as chief trainer Major [[David Smiley]], deputy commander of a [[cavalry]] ([[tank]]) regiment stationed in Germany. Already agreed with McLean and his cohort, Julian Amery, to supply 30 Albanian emigres as recruits for the operation to penetrate Albania were leaders of the Balli Kombetar, an exile political group whose key policy was to replace the Albanian Communist regime with a non-royalist government.

[[File:Malta - Rabat - Fort Bingemma 06 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Fort Binġemma]], where Albanian recruits were trained.]]
In July 1949, the first group of 30 Albanian recruits, some veterans of World War II guerrilla and civil wars, were recruited by Balli Kombetar leaders and transported by British special operations personnel to [[Fort Binġemma]], on the British island colony of Malta.  Labeled as "The Pixies" by the [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]], the Pixies spent two months training as radio operators, intelligence gatherers, and more sophisticated guerrillas than they had been as members of cetas (guerrilla bands) during World War II. On September 26, 1949, nine Pixies boarded a British Navy trawler which sailed north; three days later, a Greek style fishing boat, known as a caique and named "Stormie Seas', sailed from Malta.

With a stop at an Italian port, the two vessels sailed October 3, rendezvoused at a point in the Adriatic Sea, and transferred the Albanians to the caique. Hours later that same night, the Pixies landed on the Albanian coast, some south of Vlora, which was the former territory of the Balli Kombetar, others further north. This was the start of Operation Valuable. Albanian government security forces soon interdicted one of the two groups into which the commandos had split. The Communists killed three members of the first group, and a fourth man with the second group. The first three deaths and disappearance of a fourth man to join his family wiped out one group, while the surviving four from the first 1949 covert landing exfiltrated south to [[Greece]].

For two years after this landing, small groups of British-trained Albanians left every so often from training camps in [[Malta]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Germany]]. Most of the entire series of operations was a disaster, with Albanian security forces interdicting many of the insurgents. Occasionally, the Albanian authorities would report on “large but unsuccessful infiltrations of enemies of the people” in several regions of the country. It must also be pointed out that some British, Italian, and Greek agents infiltrated Albania two, three and four times each, a pattern that followed Albanian exiles who worked as intelligence gatherers for the Italian Navy. Some American agents, originally trained by Italian or Greek officials, also infiltrated by air, sea, or afoot on more than two occasions, to gather intelligence rather than take part in political or paramilitary operations.

The last infiltration took place a few weeks before [[Easter]] 1952. In a desperate effort to discover what was going on Captain Shehu himself, with [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]] Branica and radio operator Tahir Prenci, were guided by veteran gendarme and guerrilla fighter Hamit Matjani and three armed guards to the Mati region northeast of Tirana, the region once home to Albania's ex-King Zog. Albanian security forces [[militia]] were waiting for them at their rendezvous point, a house owned by Shehu’s cousin, a known supporter of Zog. The militia forced Shehu’s operator to transmit an all clear signal to his base in Cyprus. The operator had been schooled to deal with such situations  by using a fail-safe drill which involved broadcasting in a way that warned it was being sent under duress and therefore should be disregarded. But the militia seemed to know the drill. The all clear signal went out and, nearly a year later, four more top agents, including Matjani himself, parachuted into an ambush at Shen Gjergj (Saint George), near the town of [[Elbasan]]. The Albanian army was waiting in a big circle, guns cocked, and the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] landed in the middle of it. No one surrendered. Those not killed were tried in April 1954.

In the 2009 RTÉ (Irish) television programme [http://www.rte.ie/tv/whodoyouthinkyouare/outlines_index.html "Who Do You Think You Are?"] British Colonel Charles Davison's wife Maeve Davison ( née de Burgh - mother of [[Chris de Burgh]]) reveals that Davison was posted to Malta in the early 1950s.  When asked what the posting involved, Maeve replies "He was offered a posting in Malta. It was officially Army work but in fact it was intelligence work. He was training agents to be put into Albania. And he was teaching them how to... blow things up and generally cause lots of destruction."
 
Mrs. Davison wrote a letter on 21 May 1952 telling the Army that Col Davison was no longer interested in a job he had been inquiring about because he had already left for another posting.  The letter is contained in Davison's official war records and was shown on the programme. The location of the posting is not stated in the letter but when questioned about where it was, Maeve Davison confirms it was Malta. Maeve Davison says she joined her husband in Malta and acted as a cypher clerk - encoding and decoding messages about the operations and forwarding them to London. Her letter and comments on the programme indicate the British operation did not cease but continued on Malta in 1952 and later under Colonel Charles Davison.

==Aftermath==
{{see also|Company 4000}}
Shehu, Sufa, Matjani and others were put on trial, which found all guilty as charged. Shehu, Sula and the royal guards were to be shot, Matjani to be hanged.  Many of the local inhabitants who were suspected of having helped the guerrillas, were jailed or forcibly located elsewhere in Albania. Whatever remained of the anticommunist resistance was virtually erased.

Those guerrillas who survived had no doubt they were betrayed: “Police were always waiting when a boat came ashore. How could they know where the boats would come unless a traitor would have told them? Also, people who had been our friends when we left Albania were often no longer our friends when we went back.”

Up to 300 agents and civilians who helped them were likely killed during the operation. [[Abaz Ermenji]], co-founder of Balli Kombetar (BK) stated: “Our ‘allies’ wanted to make use of Albania as a guinea-pig, without caring about the human losses, for an absurd enterprise that was condemned to failure.”  [[Halil Nerguti]] stated: “We were used as an experiment. We were a small part of a big game, pawns that could be sacrificed.” There is no question that the CIA and MI6 used the operation as a small-scale exercise in regime change. The stakes were small. Failure would not be noticed. [[John H. Richardson (CIA)|John H. Richardson Sr]], Director of the CIA's South-East Division, terminated Operation Fiend. By 1954, [[Company 4000]]'s 120 members focused on guarding a [[United States Air Force]] chemical weapons dump south of [[Munich]]; CIA training facilities outside [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]] shut down, as did a CIA base on a Greek island. Over time, the remaining Albanians were resettled in the US, UK, and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.

During the summer of 1993, one of the ex-American agents, Shaqir Kabashi, an ethnic Albanian from Kosovo, traveled to Albania in hopes of finding skeletonized remains of his brother. He believed the sibling had been shot to death during a 1951 covert operation for the U.S. OPC.  The story Kabashi had been told by an Albanian newly emigrated to the U.S. was that remains of CIA agents were buried on a hillside near the city of Fier. Using a good amount of his own retirement money, Kabashi recruited a gang of men from a nearby village, who dug several pits in a hillside meadow. Human remains were found in one pit, Kabashi later told a Reuters stringer. Firmly persuaded he had his brother's remains, Shaqir had most of the skeletons buried in a courtyard of a newarby mosque. He carried a few samples of bones on his flight back to the U.S.  But despite suggestions that he seek U.S. Government aid in getting DNA analysis, Shaqir died in November 1997 without confirming he had found his late brother.

==History==
AFTAH was formed as a part-time enterprise in 1996 to oppose the "radical [[homosexual agenda]]." It was reorganized in 2006 by [[Peter LaBarbera]].&lt;ref name="AFTAH-About"/&gt; It was a [[501(c)3]] United States tax-exempt organization until stripped of that designation in 2010, following years of failing to file the appropriate paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harmon |first=Andrew |url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/08/01/IRS_Revokes_Antigay_Groups_Tax_Exempt_Status/ |title=IRS Revokes Antigay Group's Tax Exempt Status |publisher=The Advocate |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02 |df=mdy }}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFTAH's tax exempt status was reinstated in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=LaBarbera |first=Peter |url=http://americansfortruth.com/2012/10/10/irs-reinstates-americans-for-truth-about-homoseality-as-501c3-tax-exempt-organization/ |title=IRS Reinstates Americans For Truth About Homosexuality as 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Organization |publisher=Americans For Truth About Homosexuality |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131223072025/http://americansfortruth.com/2012/10/10/irs-reinstates-americans-for-truth-about-homoseality-as-501c3-tax-exempt-organization/# |archive-date=December 23, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but again revoked in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/revokeSearch.do?ein1=541829289&amp;names=&amp;city=&amp;state=All...&amp;zipCode=&amp;country=US&amp;exemptTypeCode=al&amp;postDateFrom=&amp;postDateTo=&amp;dispatchMethod=searchRevocation&amp;submitName=Search&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
In 1997, LaBarbera, then an editor for the [[Family Research Council]],  criticized [[US President]] [[Bill Clinton]] for supporting the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] (ENDA) stating: "He's out there using his presidential power to boost the gay lobby. I think there is an increasing acceptance [of homosexuality], but the majority of Americans are put off by the kind of homosexual advocacy they are seeing."&lt;ref name=Thurman&gt;{{cite news|last=Thurman|first=Skip|title=Clinton to Openly Advocate Gay Rights|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1997/1107/110797.us.us.4.html|accessdate=September 9, 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=November 7, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, AFTAH filed a lawsuit in [[US Federal Court]] against a [[Naperville, Illinois]], [[Holiday Inn]] Select, because of the cancellation of a banquet the AFTAH planned to hold October 6, 2007, at the hotel. The hotel cancelled the AFTAH event after learning that it would likely draw protests from the Chicago-based [[Gay Liberation Network]].&lt;ref name=Cichon&gt;{{cite news|last=Cichon|first=Kathy|title=Christian group sues Naperville hotel|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-12AC7BC0A1812600.html|accessdate=September 9, 2012|newspaper=The Herald News|date=August 31, 2009|location=Joliet, IL}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, LaBarbera, while speaking at the [[Christian Heritage Academy#Reclaim Oklahoma for Christ Conferences|Reclaiming Oklahoma for Christ Conference]], called for a government study of the dangers of homosexual sex.&lt;ref name="Witkowski"&gt;{{cite news|last=Witkowski|first=D'Anne|title=Creep of the Week: Peter LaBarbera|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2045888441.html|accessdate=September 9, 2012|newspaper=Between the Lines|date=July 30, 2009}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

In 2010, AFTAH was designated as an anti-gay hate group by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) for spreading "hateful propaganda", and claiming that [[homosexuality]] can be "cured".&lt;ref name="Dininny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruz"/&gt;

'''Antifaschistische Aktion''' ({{IPA-de|ˌantifaˈʃɪstɪʃə ʔakˈtsi̯oːn|lang}}), abbreviated as '''[[Antifa movements|Antifa]]''' ({{IPA-de|ˈantifaː|lang}}), is an  [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] network in [[Germany]].

==History==
[[File:Antifa_Her_zu_uns.svg|thumb|"Come to us" Poster of Antifaschistische Aktion (1932)]][[File:MayDay2014AntifaschistischeAktionDemonstration.jpg|thumb|A demonstration by Antifaschistische Aktion on [[May Day]] 2014 in Berlin; [[Bereitschaftspolizei]] are in the foreground.]]

===1930s===
The first German movement to call itself ''Antifaschistische Aktion'' was proclaimed by the German Communist Party ([[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]]) in their newspaper ''[[Rote Fahne]]'' in 1932 and held its first rally in Berlin on 10 July 1932, then capital of the [[Weimar Republic]].{{cn|date=August 2017}} Its two-flag logo, designed by [[Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists]] members [[Max Keilson]] and [[Max Gebhard]], remains a widely used symbol of militant anti-fascism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Loren Balhorn [https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/antifascist-movements-hitler-nazis-kpd-spd-germany-cold-war The Lost History of Antifa]" ''Jacobin'' May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 1920s and early 1930s saw rising tensions between Nazis and leftists. [[Berlin]] in particular was the site of regular and often very violent clashes between the two groups. There were several Nazi and anti-Nazi paramilitary groups. On the anti-Nazi side, these included the [[SPD|Social Democrat]]-dominated [[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold]] (formed in 1924), the [[KPD|Communist]] paramilitary and propaganda organisation [[Roter Frontkämpferbund]] (Red Front Fighters League or RFB, formed in 1924) and the Communist [[Kampfbund gegen den Faschismus]] (Fighting-Alliance against Fascism, formed in 1930).&lt;ref&gt;Eve Rosenhaft, ''Beating the Fascists?: The German Communists and Political Violence 1929-1933'', Cambridge University Press, 25 Aug 1983, pp.3-4&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1931, the local ''Roter Massenselbstschutz'' (Red Mass Self-Defence, RMSS) units were formed by Kampfbund members as autonomous and loosely organised structures under the leadership of, but outside the formal organisation of, the KPD, as part of the party's [[united front]] policy to work with other working class groups to defeat fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Rosenhaft, ''Beating the Fascists?: The German Communists and Political Violence 1929-1933'', Cambridge University Press, 25 Aug 1983, p.96-7&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1932, the Roter Frontkämpferbund had been banned and, following a skirmish between Nazi and Communist members in the parliament,{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Antifaschistische Aktion was formed as a broad-based alliance in which Social Democrats, Communists and others could fight legal repression and engage in self-defence against Nazi paramilitaries.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Rosenhaft, ''Beating the Fascists?: The German Communists and Political Violence 1929-1933'', Cambridge University Press, 25 Aug 1983, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; 

The RMSS units were absorbed into Antifaschistische Aktion, forming the nuclei of the latter's "Unity Committees", organised on a micro-local basis, e.g. in apartment buildings, factories or allotments.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Rosenhaft, ''Beating the Fascists?: The German Communists and Political Violence 1929-1933'', Cambridge University Press, 25 Aug 1983, p.97-8&lt;/ref&gt; 

As well as fighting fascists, the RMSS and Antifaschistische Aktion used their militant approach to develop a comprehensive network of self-defence for communities targeted by the nazis, for example in "tenant protection" (Mieterschutz), action against evictions.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Rosenhaft, ''Beating the Fascists?: The German Communists and Political Violence 1929-1933'', Cambridge University Press, 25 Aug 1983, p.54, 98&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the RMSS units had minimal formal membership, but in the second half of 1932, local executive boards were created to co-ordinate the activities of the KPD, Kampfbund, RMSS and (now illegal) RFB, with the RMSS given a more distinct and almost paramilitary defence role, often co-operating on an ad hoc basis with the Reichsbanner.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Rosenhaft, ''Beating the Fascists?: The German Communists and Political Violence 1929-1933'', Cambridge University Press, 25 Aug 1983, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the forced dissolution in the wake of the [[Machtergreifung]] in 1933, the movement went underground.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===After Hitler===
Groups called "Antifaschistische Ausschüsse", "Antifaschistische Kommittees" or "Antifaschistische Aktion", all typically abbreviated to [[Post-WWII anti-fascism|Antifa]], spontaneously re-emerged in Germany in 1944, mainly involving veterans of pre-war [[KPD]], [[Communist Party of Germany (Opposition)|KPO]] and [[SPD]] politics,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OGVYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22antifa%22&amp;dq=%22antifa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRvL-B2O_VAhUjKMAKHVY9B7AQ6AEITjAJ Betrayal: our occupation of Germany]'' Beacon Service Co., 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RfkqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22antifa%22&amp;dq=%22antifa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRvL-B2O_VAhUjKMAKHVY9B7AQ6AEINDAD Information Bulletin], Office of Military Government Control Office, Germany (Territory under Allied occupation, U.S. Zone).

In the French, British, and American zones, Antifas began to recede by the late summer of 1945, marginalized by Allied bans on political organization and by re-emerging divisions within the movement between Communists and others, while in East Germany the Antifa groups were absorbed into the new Stalinist state.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; On 11 July 1945, the Soviets permitted the formation of the "United Front of the Antifascist-Democratic Parties", which included representatives from the "communist KPD, the Social Democratic SPD, the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP)".&lt;ref name="Vogt2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogt|first=Timothy R.|title=Denazification in Soviet-occupied Germany: Brandenburg, 1945-1948|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|language=English|isbn=9780674003408|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Since the 1980s====
Contemporary Antifa in Germany "has no practical historical connection to the movement from which it takes its name, but is instead a product of West Germany's squatter scene and autonomist movement in the 1980s".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Many new Antifa groups formed from the late 1980s onwards. One of the biggest antifascist campaigns in Germany in recent years was the, ultimately successful, effort to [[The nazi marches and counter-mobilization in Dresden|block the annual Nazi-rallies]] in the east German city of Dresden in Saxony, which had grown into "Europe's biggest gathering of Nazis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/regional/dresden/einschraenkungen-in-der-innenstadt-demo-samstag-in-dresden-nazi-aufmaersche-und-linke-treffen-aufeinander_id_6631107.html|title=Demo-Samstag in Dresden: Nazi-Aufmärsche und Linke treffen aufeinander|first=|last=Focus-Online|publisher=Focus-Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, the Antifa in Dresden campaigned on the occasion of the anniversary of the reunification of Germany on 3 October for "turning Unity celebrations into a disaster" („Einheitsfeierlichkeiten zum Desaster machen“), to protest this display of new German nationalism, whilst explicitly not ruling out the use of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnn.de/Dresden/Polizeiticker/Polizeiticker-Dresden/Initiativen-wollen-Dresdner-Einheitsfeierlichkeiten-zum-Desaster-machen|title=Protest gegen Einheitsfeier – Initiativen wollen Dresdner „Einheitsfeierlichkeiten zum Desaster machen“ – DNN - Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten|first=|last=DNN-Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Constitution sceau.jpg|thumb|right|The Constitution of the Fifth Republic of France (1958)]]
'''Article 49 of the French Constitution''' is an article of the [[French Constitution]], the fundamental law of the [[French Fifth Republic]]. It sets out the political responsibility of the [[Government_of_France|government]] (the executive power) before the [[French parliament|parliament]] (legislative power). It is part of Title V: "On the relations between the parliament and the government" (articles 34 to 51).  

The article, which comprises four paragraphs, is designed to prevent ministerial crises like those that occurred in France under the [[Fourth French Republic|Fourth Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;In 12 years (1946–1958), France went through 22 different governments—an average duration of six months per government—and 375 days of ministerial crises.&lt;/ref&gt; Its best-known provision is the third paragraph (article 49.3), which allow the government to force passage of a bill without a vote unless the parliament votes a [[motion of no confidence]] to veto the government ("commitment of responsibility").

==Text of article 49==

===Official===
:'''(1)''' ''Le Premier Ministre, après délibération du Conseil des Ministres, engage devant l'Assemblée Nationale la responsabilité du Gouvernement sur son programme ou éventuellement sur une déclaration de politique générale.''

:'''(2)''' ''L' Assemblée Nationale met en cause la responsabilité du Gouvernement par le vote d'une motion de censure. Une telle motion n'est recevable que si elle est signée par un dixième au moins des membres de l'Assemblée Nationale. Le vote ne peut avoir lieu que quarante-huit heures après son dépôt. Seuls sont recensés les votes favorables à la motion de censure qui ne peut être adoptée qu'à la majorité des membres composant l'Assemblée. Sauf dans le cas prévu à l'alinéa ci-dessous, un député ne peut être signataire de plus de trois motions de censure au cours d'une même session ordinaire et de plus d'une au cours d'une même session extraordinaire.''

:'''(3)''' ''Le Premier Ministre peut, après délibération du Conseil des Ministres, engager la responsabilité du Gouvernement devant l'Assemblée Nationale sur le vote d'un projet de loi de finances ou de financement de la sécurité sociale. Dans ce cas, ce projet est considéré comme adopté, sauf si une motion de censure, déposée dans les vingt-quatre heures qui suivent, est votée dans les conditions prévues à l'alinéa précédent. Le Premier ministre peut, en outre, recourir à cette procédure pour un autre projet ou une proposition de loi par session.''

:'''(4)''' ''Le Premier Ministre a la faculté de demander au Sénat l'approbation d'une déclaration de politique générale.''

===Translation===
:'''(1)''' The prime minister, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, may commit the Government's responsibility before the National Assembly with regard to its program or, should the occasion arise, to a statement of general policy.
:'''(2)''' The National Assembly may challenge the responsibility of the government by passing a motion of censure. Such a motion shall be admissible only if signed by at least one tenth of the members of the National Assembly. The vote may not take place until forty-eight hours after the motion has been tabled; the only votes counted shall be those in favor of the motion of censure, which may be adopted only by a majority of the membership of the assembly. Deputies may not introduce three such motion in the course of the same ordinary session or more than one in the case of an extraordinary session, except in the case provided for in the following paragraph.''
:'''(3)''' The prime minister may, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, commit the government's responsibility to the National Assembly on the passing of a bill concerning financial matters or social security financing. In this case, the bill shall be regarded as passed unless a motion of censure, tabled within the succeeding twenty-four hours, is passed under the conditions laid down in the previous paragraph. The Prime Minister may also have recourse to this procedure for another purpose or item of proposed legislation within the session.
:'''(4)''' The prime minister may ask the Senate to approve a general policy statement.

===Modifications of 1 March 2009===
The Constitutional Law adopted on 21 July 2008 amended article 49 of the Constitution. The new text came into force on 1 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/ta/ta0-14.asp Texte de la loi constitutionnelle] sur le site de l'Assemblée nationale. Voir en particulier les articles 24 et 46 de la loi.&lt;/ref&gt; Before that date, the prime minister could use the procedure of paragraph 3 without any limit on all draft bills; since then, it can be used at most once per session, except for draft bills on public finances or the funding of [[Social Security in France|Social Security]] (annual budget laws).

According to a report by the National Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/rapports/r0892.asp Rapport n°392] fait au nom de la commission des lois sur le projet de loi constitutionnelle de modernisation des institutions de la Ve République, par le député Jean-Luc Warsmann, commentaire de l'article 23 du projet de loi,&lt;/ref&gt; section 3 may be implemented both during a regular session or a special session. In case of change of prime minister during the same session, the second will have this option even if the first has already used it. In addition, it may be used on several successive readings of the same text.

==Speeches==

===Michel Debré's speech before the Council of State===
On 27 August 1958 [[Michel Debré]], then the Minister of Justice and one of the principal drafters of the Constitution, introduced the draft before the General Assembly of the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]]. Section 49 was mentioned in a brief passage that exposed its spirit and motivations:

{{quote|"The difficult process of a motion of no confidence should temper the defect that is familiar to us and has been for too long. The motion of confidence is the weapon of the government, and it alone. Deputies can use only the motion of no confidence, and this is surrounded by conditions which are disputed only by those who do not want to remember. Experience has led, moreover, to provide a somewhat unique disposition to ensure, despite the maneuvers, the vote on an essential bill."&lt;ref name="discoursCE"&gt;translated from a citation in Maus, ''Les grands textes'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Charles de Gaulle's 31 January 1964 press conference===
During his press conference on 31 January 1964, General de Gaulle returned to the topic of the functioning of the institutions. His reading gave the president of the republic a primacy that goes well beyond the letter of the constitution, but which is often consistent with the practice. He addressed, among other topics, the issue of the motion of no confidence:

{{quote|"[...] the sovereign people, by electing the president, invests him with its confidence. In that post lie the core of things and the great part of the changes made. As a result, the government, appointed by the head of state and whose members, moreover, cannot be members of parliament, is no longer at all, vis-à-vis the parliament, what it was at the time when it proceeded only from the combinations of groups. Also, the relationship between the ministry and the parliament, such as they are governed by the Constitution, call for a motion of no confidence only under conditions that give this break an extraordinary seriousness. In this extreme case, the president, who has the responsibility to ensure the continuity of the state, also has the means to do so, because he may resort to the nation to make it the judge of the dispute via new elections, or a referendum, or both. So, there is still a Democratic way out."&lt;ref name="conf64"&gt;Translated from the text available at [http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/cohabitation/de-gaulle-1964.shtml le site de la documentation française] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126072910/http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/cohabitation/de-gaulle-1964.shtml |date=November 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Motion of confidence (49.1)==
The first paragraph allows the prime minister to commit the responsibility of his government before the National Assembly by putting forward a motion of confidence. As stated in article 50, a negative vote (with a simple majority, in contrast to the two following paragraphs, which protect the executive to a greater extent) leads to a resignation of the government. Its meaning is sometimes imprecise, and therefore its interpretation is disputed, particularly concerning the obligatory or optional character of this commitment. In practice it is viewed as optional, and the presidential post retains a clear supremacy. Thus, the motion of confidence is an arm at the disposition of the government alone. The political benefit which it can obtain remains limited: even if the motion of confidence is still an important parliamentary tradition that can sometimes bring it advantages in its relation with the parliament as well as with the public opinion, a government not supported by a majority can abandon it without great inconvenience.

===Debated interpretation===
The word ''engage'' (to commit, or to "make [something] an issue") in Section 49.1 is particularly subject to controversy. It can be interpreted as an obligation, typical of parliamentary regimes, or simply an option, a privilege of the [[separation of powers]] and the prerogatives of the president. Two other elements are subject to discussion but are of much less consequence: deliberation in the Cabinet (''Conseil des ministres'') and the distinction between a "program" and a "declaration of general policy".

Parliamentary regimes customarily induct the prime minister or the government by the parliament or by the lower chamber of the parliament. For example, the [[Constitution of Italy]] states that "The government has to appear before each chamber no later than ten days after its appointment to get a vote of confidence" (94.3).&lt;ref&gt;[http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/it00000_.html http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/it00000_.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] provides for the election of the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor]] by the [[Bundestag]] (the lower house of the German parliament).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/parliament/function/legal/germanbasiclaw.pdf http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/parliament/function/legal/germanbasiclaw.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227112926/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/parliament/function/legal/germanbasiclaw.pdf |date=February 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Constitution of 1946|Constitution of the Fourth Republic of France]] also stated that "the president of the Cabinet and the ministers cannot be nominated until after the president of the cabinet has been invested with the confidence of the assembly" (article 45),&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_de_la_France_%28IVe_République%29 http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_de_la_France_%28IVe_République%29]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of the Third Republic was identical. It is usual in French law for the simple present indicative to connote a requirement and not a simple option: "engage" means "must commit" and not "may commit". The word ''éventuellement'' ("possibly") in the declaration of general policy and the phrase ''peut engager'' ("may commit") in section 3 reinforce the obligatory nature of the commitment to a program, which lacks this phrasing.

Nevertheless, the government exists by the order of its nomination through the president of the Republic (article 8), without reference to a possible investiture by the assembly. Article 20 makes clear, by referring to articles 49 and 50, that the president is responsible before the parliament, but the constitution does not attach conditions to any of his powers regarding his "commitment of responsibility", and even when it is required, no deadline is fixed to limit the obligation, which in reality is comes down to a moral decision. The interpretation of the clause as being optional is also that which Michel Debré made in front of the Conseil d'État,&lt;ref name="discoursCE" /&gt; even before the adoption of the constitution: "the weapon of the government and of it alone". But in his first speech of general policy, he said on this topic that "the text does not say explicitly that he must do it, but the spirit of the Constitution is clear."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Debré, general policy speech of January 16, 1959, cited in [[#GrandsTextes|Maus]], p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; This difficulty with regards to the connotation of the indicative mood is not the only semantic issue affecting the Constitution; one could bring up the debate of 1960 about article 29, "Parliament shall convene in extraordinary session, at the request of the prime minister or of the majority of the members of the National Assembly, to consider a specific agenda."&lt;ref&gt;De Gaulle refused to summon the extraordinary session by considering that article 29 gave him the option, and not the obligation, to do it. See his March 18, 1960 letter to the president of the National Assembly [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], quoted in [[#GrandsTextes|Maus]], p. 176, 177, as well as in [[#Chevallier|Chevallier, Carcassonne, Duhamel]], p. 60 et 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and the quarrel in 1986 about article 13: "The president of the republic shall sign the ordinances..."&lt;ref&gt;In a period of "cohabitation" (when the president and the prime minister do not belong to the same party), François Mitterrand refused to sign some ordinances (decrees provided for in article 38 by which the prime minister, authorized by the parliament, may intervene in a domain relating normally to the law). In contrast to article 10 which fixes a period of fifteen days for the promulgation of laws, unanimously considered as an obligation of the president, article 13 does not set a deadline. See the televised interview of the president on July 14, 1986 and the prime minister's televised address on July 16, 1986, quoted in [[#GrandsTextes|Maus]], p 191 à 193, as well as in [[#Chevallier|Chevallier, Carcassonne, Duhamel]], p 335 à 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

The text mentions the requirement of deliberation in the Cabinet, and the doctrine was questioned to find out if the term implied the agreement of the Cabinet or simply discussion, which would in that case leave the decision to the prime minister alone. The ''gouvernements'' have always spoken of authorization or of the agreement of the Cabinet. This phrasing has the additional advantage of solidifying the optional interpretation of the commitment of responsibility, since the prime minister could hardly be required to commit the responsibility of the government and prevented from doing it without the agreement of the Cabinet. The [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] validated the commitment of the responsibility of the government (in section 3) by the phrasing "to the extent that the Cabinet had deliberated [...] the commitment of responsility"&lt;ref&gt;{{fr-icon}}[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1989/89268dc.htm Décision du 29 décembre 1989, Loi de finance pour 1990, 89-268], au ''considérant'' 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  without mentioning authorization. Since the ''gouvernements'' of the Fifth Republic had always been strongly united and superior to those of prior coalitions' ''gouvernements'', the question of a possible disagreement between the prime minister and the Cabinet remains theoretical. In any case, this deliberation does not give the president, especially in a period of "cohabitation", the power to prevent the commitment of his responsibility, except in the improbable case of a refusal to enter the question on the agenda of the Cabinet.

Lastly, there is the distinction between a "program" and a "declaration of general policy". If the former can be understood as a catalogue of the principal arrangements that the government hopes to make, probably as soon as it is established, in the logic of the investiture, and the latter as an explanation of its reasoning and of its intentions in a precise domain which would take—or to which the government would want to give—a particular importance, the distinction has no practical consequence. Certain prime ministers have used the expression "declaration of general policy" while they were speaking for the first time before the assembly. The Constitutional Council remarked incidentally that article 49 "tends to confer an analogous meaning" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1977/7672dc.htm Décision du 12 janvier 1977, Loi autorisant le Gouvernement à modifier par ordonnances les circonscriptions pour l'élection des membres de la chambre des députés du territoire Français des Afars et des Issas, 76-72DC, at the third "considering"]&lt;/ref&gt; to the two terms.

===A "presidential" pattern===
De Gaulle in his [[The Bayeux speeches#Second Bayeux speech|Second Bayeux Speech]] (''deuxième discours de Bayeux'' of 1946, when he explained his views on political institutions) did not want a ''parliamentary'' system, at least not in the [[monistic]] sense which had prevailed since the end of the 19th century: "It goes without saying that the parliament, which is composed of two chambers and which exercises legislative power, cannot be the source of executive power."&lt;ref name="Bayeux"&gt;[http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=56&amp;page=6 Charles de Gaulle, discours de Bayeux, 16 juin 1946] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123222157/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=56&amp;page=6 |date=November 23, 2008 }}, the Charles de Gaulle Foundation web site, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; As an important concession, however, which averted a strictly presidential regime, the head of state must "reconcile the general interest regarding the choice of the people with an orientation that is free from the parliament."&lt;ref name="Bayeux" /&gt; The first governments of the Fifth Republic, those that set the precedent for later governments, committed their responsibility in front of the assembly after their appointment. They did this, however, always emphasizing that they proceeded from the president of the Republic and not the parliament, and that it was not an investiture. But after the presidential election of December 1965, Prime Minister [[Georges Pompidou]], who became, once again, the head of a third government, waited for the opening of the common session of the parliament in April to present his program, making a simple declaration followed by a debate without a vote, and thus without a commitment of responsibility, although he had a solid parliamentary majority. Then, he stated that he wanted to create a precedent establishing the optional character of this commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Pompidou, Discours à l'Assemblée Nationale du 13 avril 1966. Qtd. in [[#GrandsTextes|Maus]], p 222.&lt;/ref&gt; After the general election of 1967, his fourth government had diminished to a narrow and uncertain majority, and he used the same solution.

[[François Mitterrand]] attacked the assembly, saying: {{quote|"The simple language and the grammar [...] demonstrate in the clearest way that the prime minister has to commit the responsibility of his government to his program, and that this obligation, so decided, imposes itself upon him in a strict way."}} Pompidou challenged the opposition to censure his government. The interruption of this practice persisted after the [[Dissolution of parliament|parliamentary dissolution]] of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] even when the governments had found a crushing and disciplined majority in the parliament, showing that the practice is considered as optional (some commitments of responsibility did occur, but not immediately after the nomination of the governments). The practice was renewed in 1974 and afterwards was followed sporadically. It disappeared again between 1988 and 1993 when the socialist governments, whose support did not reach a majority in the parliament, no longer could resort to the vote of confidence except on a single specific occasion: while France was engaged in the Gulf War, Prime Minister [[Michel Rocard]] obtained very wide support in the assembly, but stated that: {{quote|"[...] those who voted in favor would not be presumed to support the general policy of the government in any way."&lt;ref&gt;Michel Rocard, Discours de politique générale du 16 janvier 1990, à l'Assemblée nationale. [[#Chevallier|Chevallier, Carcassonne, Duhamel]], p 390.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Lacking a guaranteed majority, it is preferable for the government to wait for a motion of no confidence described in part 2, the adoption of which is more difficult than a simple refusal of confidence. One category of government did, however, systematically require the confidence of, and almost investiture by, the Assembly upon coming into office: [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] governments. Those derive politically, if not legally, from the Assembly rather than from the President and must have its support; the regime thus functions in a more clearly parliamentary fashion.

===A limited tool in the hands of the prime minister===
When introducing the motion of confidence in the National Assembly, the prime minister generally takes the opportunity to make an important political statement. This parliamentary ritual gives the motion some formality, which will be widely commented on by the media. For many years, it was the best format for making political policy speeches, that is, before the television interview appeared in its various forms offering alternatives. The speech is a mark of courtesy and deference to parliament. It allows the new prime minister to put forward his positions and pledge the soundness of his government. The refusal to make commitments is seen as an admission of the majority's weakness. Apart from the prime minister's nomination, the motion of confidence allows the government to deliver a new declaration on matters and events that may imposed themselves or on which the government wishes to give importance.

On the other hand, under the Fifth Republic, it no longer possible, as under the previous Republic or regimes, to attach motions of confidence to votes of law to force the assembly to vote on the combined motion and the law. Under former practices, the government could link its continuance to the adoption of the legal texts. The Fifth Republic provides for a much more powerful weapon with the paragraph 3 (see below).

The motion of confidence can also help the government in its relations with its majority in parliament. Voting on the motion can assure MPs worried about the unpopularity of their party if there is a clear victory in the National Assembly. It also can help rally MPs to stand-up to the opposition, and possibly force a critical coalition partner to renew its membership in the majority, as occurred with the [[Rassemblement pour la République|RPR]] between 1976 and 1981 or the [[Parti communiste français|Communist Party]] between 1981 and 1986. However, the impact of the motion is often limited and does not often change the popularity of the government and its majority unless the prime minister delivers a highly successful speech. As for the reluctant coalition partner, it may vote to support the motion while expressing reservations and criticisms. In this regard, these reluctant MPs will become more bound by their vote since the text of the motion focuses on specific points, rather than on their general support of the government's policy, however, this does not prevent them from rejecting certain laws.

Lastly, the approval of the motion by the assembly does not strengthen the ability of the prime minister to stand-up to the president of the republic. Prime Minister [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] requested and received the confidence of the assembly on 24 May 1972, while clearly reaffirming that the government took its legitimacy from the president of the republic, who may at any time put an end to its functions. (In reality, the president appoints the government, but the government can be withdrawn only on presentation of the resignation of the prime minister). President [[Georges Pompidou]] had given his agreement to this commitment, noting that it was the prime minister's prerogative. (Some time later, he said: "I was not in favor of that and that was known.") Five weeks later, he asked for and obtained the resignation of Chaban-Delmas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chevallier|Chevallier, Carcassonne, Duhamel]], p. 194 à 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vote of no confidence (49.2)==
A vote of no confidence (''censure'') is a means for the National Assembly, on its own initiative, to force the government to resign. The vote's application and action by the parliament, in this regard, is an essential characteristic of any parliamentary system. De Gaulle, when inaugurated as prime minister under the Fourth Republic, promised he would include this procedure in the reform of the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Le gouvernement doit être reponsable devant le Parlement", Charles de Gaulle, inauguration speech at the National Assembly, 1 June 1958. Quoted by Monin, p. 3 to 5&lt;/ref&gt; It was actually imposed by the Constitutional Law of 3 June 1958.

In the constitution, the government's responsibility is framed by devices that allow it to streamline the parliamentarian system to promote stability of government. However, it is difficult to ascribe actual stability of the governments with these technical measures. The strength is due to two other factors. First, if a vote of non-confidence is approved by the National Assembly, the government, instead of resigning, is likely to ask the president to dissolve the assembly to stop it from voting. On the other hand, the Fifth Republic has been characterized by the appearance of stable political parties and reliable electoral coalitions able to effectively support the government. All these elements have reduced no confidence votes by parliamentarians. To date, censure has passed only once.

===A decisive element for the nature of the regime===
This possibility, even unused, of the National Assembly to bring down the government has a deep impact on the workings of the institutions.
Without it, the French constitution would clearly define a presidential system, albeit with strong powers endowed to the executive branch by the constitution. For even without a majority in the National Assembly, the president would still be able to nominate a government to suit himself and thus hold all theirs powers

La possibilité pour l'Assemblée nationale de renverser le gouvernement, quand bien même elle n'est pas utilisée, a une influence profonde sur le fonctionnement des institutions. En effet, en son absence, le régime serait clairement de type présidentiel, avec de surcroît un exécutif particulièrement bien armé par la constitution. Dépourvu de majorité à l'Assemblée, le président de la République pourrait nommer quand même un gouvernement qui lui est favorable et disposer ainsi de tous ses pouvoirs soumis à contreseing ([[article 19 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 19]]), notamment celui de nomination ([[article 13 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 13]]), alors que le gouvernement aurait le pouvoir réglementaire ([[article 37 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 37]]), et les moyens considérables que lui offre la constitution dans ses relations avec le parlement (l'essentiel du titre V). À supposer qu'il ait en plus le soutien du Sénat, il pourrait bloquer toute initiative de l'Assemblée nationale qui n'a pas son accord ; à défaut, la gêner considérablement. Resterait l'impossibilité pour lui de faire voter les lois qu'il souhaite, et surtout la nécessité de parvenir tous les ans à un compromis avec l'Assemblée pour voter le budget. Il serait cependant beaucoup mieux armé face au parlement que ne l'est le président aux États-unis, archétype du [[régime présidentiel]].

Au contraire, par la menace de la motion de censure, la présence à l'Assemblée nationale d'une majorité hostile conduit le président de la République à nommer un gouvernement issu de cette majorité (« compatible », dit le discours de Bayeux), mode de fonctionnement des institutions nommé cohabitation depuis qu'il s'est produit pour la première fois  en 1986 à l'issue des élections législatives. C'est alors ce gouvernement qui dispose de l'essentiel du pouvoir exécutif, et il peut s'appuyer sur sa majorité à l'Assemblée. L'article 49.2 impose donc la cohérence entre le gouvernement et la majorité parlementaire (pour autant qu'une telle majorité existe), caractéristique du régime parlementaire moderne, même si le chef de l'État y dispose de pouvoirs beaucoup plus étendus que dans les autres régimes européens.

===A well supervised implementation===
L'alinéa 2 s'attache, avec  les moyens classiques du [[parlementarisme rationalisé]], à rendre difficile tant le dépôt de la motion de censure que son adoption. Le but recherché est d'éviter l'instabilité gouvernementale et ainsi, « Qu'il existe un gouvernement qui soit fait pour gouverner, à qui on en laisse le temps et la possibilité » comme le dit de Gaulle dans son [[discours du 4 septembre 1958 Place de la République]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=64&amp;page=4 |title=Charles de Gaulle, discours Place de la République le 4 septembre 1958 |work=le site de la fondation Charles de Gaulle |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025190542/http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=64&amp;page=4 |archivedate=2007-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le dépôt est limité en imposant pour chaque motion de censure la signature d'un dixième au moins des députés, chacun ne pouvant en signer que trois pendant la session ordinaire de l'[[article 28 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 28]]  (avant la réforme constitutionnelle de 1995 sur la session unique, une seule motion pour chacune des deux sessions ordinaires de l'année), une par session extraordinaire de l'[[article 29 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 29]]. La portée de cette restriction est faible, l'opposition n'épuisant en général pas le nombre de motions autorisées. Sa conséquence la plus visible est s'il y a plusieurs oppositions, que les composantes les plus faibles (par example, le groupe du Front national entre 1986 et 1988) ne peuvent déposer de motion, faute d'atteindre la barre des 10% ; motion qui n'aurait eu de toutes façons guère de chances d'être adoptée.

L'article s'attache aussi à compliquer l'adoption de la motion. Tout d'abord, un délai de quarante-huit heures doit s'écouler entre le dépôt de la motion et son vote. Lorsque le scrutin risque d'être serré, ces quarante-huit heures peuvent être mise à profit par le gouvernement pour convaincre quelques indécis de ne pas la voter. La constitution empêche ainsi le système de l'interpellation qui avait cours sous la III&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République, lorsqu'un seul député pouvait « interpeller » le gouvernement, et la Chambre voter après débat un texte qui, lorsqu'il était défavorable au gouvernement, entraînait son départ. La {{IVe}} République prévoyait déjà un jour franc entre le dépôt de la motion et son vote.&lt;ref&gt;[[#IVe|Constitution de la {{IVe}} République]], article 50&lt;/ref&gt;
Ensuite, en imposant un vote en faveur de la motion par la majorité des membres de l'Assemblée. Ce qui signifie que pour être adoptée, plus de la moitié des députés en fonction (on ne compte pas les éventuels sièges vacants, précise le règlement de l'Assemblée) doivent voter pour la motion. Le système ne laisse pas la place à l'abstention : un député peut voter la motion, ou ne pas la voter, auquel cas il est réputé ne pas souhaiter le renversement du gouvernement. On dit d'ailleurs qu'une motion qu'elle n'est pas adoptée, signifiant par là qu'elle n'a pas atteint la majorité, et non qu'elle est rejetée, ce qui voudrait dire qu'une majorité s'est déclarée contre  ; or, seuls votent les partisans de la motion. Ce mécanisme, lors d'un scrutin serré, peut assurer la survie du gouvernement. La motion ayant échoué avec la marge la plus étroite visait la politique agricole du gouvernement  de [[Pierre Bérégovoy]] en juin 1992. Il n'a manqué que trois voix à son adoption. La procédure de la IV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République était similaire, avec une nuance : si les partisans de la censure devait atteindre, comme aujourd'hui, la majorité absolue des députés, tous les députés prenaient part au vote, si bien qu'on pouvait distinguer les partisans du gouvernement des abstentionnistes ; bien que rien ne soit changé pour l'adoption de la motion, le vote pouvait affaiblir le gouvernement en mettant en évidence le peu de soutien don't il bénéficiait.

Ces précautions sont encore renforcées par le caractère exclusif de l'article 49 quant à la mise en cause de la responsabilité du gouvernement. Le Conseil constitutionnel censure toute tentative, dans les lois organiques ou les règlements des assemblées, qui ouvrirait au  parlement ou à une assemblée la possibilité d'un vote marquant sa défiance au gouvernement, fut-ce sans effet contraignant, en dehors de l'article 49.&lt;ref&gt;Voir notamment {{Cite web |url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/1989/89268dc.htm |title=Décision des 17, 18, et 24 juin 1959, Règlement de l'Assemblée nationale, 59-2 DC |work=le site du Conseil constitutionnel}}, au sujet des articles 81-1 et 4, 82, 86-3 et 4, 92-6, 98-6 et 134 : dans la mesure où de telles propositions tendraient à orienter ou à contrôler l'action gouvernementale, leur pratique serait contraire aux dispositions de la Constitution qui, dans son article 20, en confiant au Gouvernement la détermination et la conduite de la politique de la Nation, ne prévoit la mise en cause de la responsabilité gouvernementale que dans les conditions et suivant les procédures fixées par ses articles 49 et 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Ces diverses techniques de rationalisation se sont montrées efficaces pour ceux des gouvernements de la V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République qui n'ont disposé que d'une majorité faible pour les soutenir. Cependant les mêmes techniques ou presque déjà présente dans la constitution de la IV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République avaient totalement manqué leur but. La plupart cependant n'ont pas été formellement renversés, mais se sont retirés faute d'obtenir le soutien qu'ils estimaient nécessaire, ou encore à la suite de désaccords graves entre ministres. Ces deux causes ont disparu.

===A conflict of legitimacy===
Les gouvernements des deux républiques précédentes (tout au moins après la chute de [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon|Mac-Mahon]]) devaient toute leur légitimité au parlement, le président de la République ne faisant guère que les proposer aux assemblées, auxquelles il devait d'ailleurs lui aussi sa fonction. Un soutien trop faible du parlement, même sans que la censure soit votée, les conduisait souvent à démissionner. Le président de la V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République a sa légitimité propre et considère, hors période de cohabitation, que le gouvernement est le sien et est responsible devant lui, ce qui mène souvent à faire un parallèle entre la V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République et les régimes parlementaires dualistes de la première moitié du XIX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle. La responsabilité devant le parlement subsiste, mais le gouvernement peut s'estimer légitime tant qu'il n'est pas renversé dans les formes. Si la censure est votée, elle peut s'interpréter comme un conflit entre les légitimités, toutes deux fondées sur l'élection, du président de la République et de l'Assemblée, conflit qui, explique de Gaulle,&lt;ref name="conf64" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=donne à cette rupture un caractère d'extraordinaire gravité}}.&lt;/ref&gt; L'assemblée ne doit plus alors renverser le gouvernement qu'en raison d'un désaccord majeur, et le président de la République pour faire trancher le conflit de légitimité « peut recourir à la nation », en prononçant la dissolution de l'Assemblée nationale ([[article 12 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 12]]). Il s'agit d'un de ses pouvoirs propres, il n'y a aucune condition que de pure forme à sa mise en œuvre, et il a été effectivement utilisé la seule fois où la censure a été votée. La constitution veille d'ailleurs à interdire la censure lorsque la dissolution n'est pas possible, pendant la vacance ou l'empêchement de la présidence ([[article 7 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 7]]). La possibilité, voire la probabilité de cette dissolution peut avoir une forte valeur dissuasive sur l'Assemblée, beaucoup de députés risquant d'y perdre leur siège.

===The majority restraint===
En laissant à part les aspects dualistes propre à la V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République, qui peuvent eux aussi contribuer à expliquer la solidité des gouvernements face à l'Assemblée, on a souvent remarqué les limites de la rationalisation ''technique'' du parlementarisme, celle qui repose sur l'introduction dans la constitution de mesures entravant le vote des motions de censures. Les premiers examples de rationalisation technique, qu'on trouve dans les constitutions rédigées à l'issue de la Première Guerre mondiale, notamment celle de la [[République de Weimar]], elle aussi dotée d'un chef de l'État fort, ont totalement échoué, comme elles ont échoué sous la IV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République, ou encore dans la République italienne. En revanche, le parlementarisme britannique, totalement dépourvu de telles mesures, montre une grande stabilité. Cette stabilité est souvent attribuée au [[bipartisme]], notamment par Michel Debré dans son discours au Conseil d'État&lt;ref name="discoursCE" /&gt; ou encore par [[René Capitant]], un des inspirateurs du régime, tous deux admirateurs du système britannique, fondé sur le scrutin majoritaire à un tour et le bipartisme. Bien que Michel Debré ait jugé sa transposition impossible en France, le scrutin majoritaire à deux tours, introduit en 1958 a abouti à des effets proches, avec des coalitions formées avant le scrutin et demeurant stables après. Lors qu'il ne relève que de la loi ordinaire ([[article 34 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 34]]), ce mode de scrutin contribue sans doute plus à la stabilité du gouvernement que le détail de l'article 49. On peut remarquer de même l'effet du changement de mode de scrutin en Italie en 1993, en l'absence de réforme majeure de la constitution, qui reste d'un strict parlementarisme moniste, d'ailleurs assez proche de celle de la IV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République. Cependant, le mode de scrutin ne garantit pas toujours l'existence de majorité, comme le montre l'example anglais dans les années 1920, ou encore la composition de l'Assemblée nationale entre 1988 et 1993.

===The censure of 5 October 1962===
The censure was passed only once under the Fifth Republic, during the 4 October 1962 meeting (in reality on the morning of 5 October). The motion was filed on October 2, after General de Gaulle had announced on 30 September a referendum (in accordance to Article 11 of the Constitution) to organize the election of the President of the Republic by direct suffrage. The circumstances of that vote are quite specific, it occurred at the end of the Algerian crisis, which affected the first years of the Fifth Republic, a kind of transitional phase in its history. The vote took place during the first legislature of the Fifth Republic, and put an ends to it. The parliamentary elections of 1958 had not resulted in a clear majority, but the president and the Debré government could work with the assembly without a secured majority, because the priority was to resolve the Algerian crisis. In the summer of 1962, the crisis ended, and many of the deputies wished to revert to a more parliamentarian regime. De Gaulle, requesting the resignation of Prime Minister Debré, and appointing Georges Pompidou, a non-parliamentaryare, seemed not to go in this direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chevallier|Chevallier, Carcassonne, Duhamel]], chap. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The motion was passed easily, the Gaullist party UNR being the only major group not to vote it. De Gaulle was moving on 5 October and received on 6 October Pompidou announcing his resignation, as Article 50 forces him to do. De Gaulle took note of the resignation without formally accepting it, and requested the Government to remain in office, and announced the dissolution of the National Assembly on 9 October. De Gaulle won very easily the 28 October referendum and the parliamentary elections on 18 and 25 November. With this last vote, the left recovered from the 1958 elections in which there had been no alliance between socialists and communists. Conversely, centrist parties, popular and independent Republicans are defeated at the benefit of the UNR, which monopolized the rightist votes. That election, consequence of censorship of 5 October, put in place the polarization of political life in France. Pompidou's new government was appointed after the elections.

The announcement of the referendum, which was preceded by few rumors in the summer, caused considerable excitement. The universal suffrage elections were to change the balance of powers, and would turn the election of the President of the Republic into a plebiscite, reviving the painful memory of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte and General Boulanger. However it was the procedure which was under attack, because De Gaulle choose to revise the constitution with the Article 11 and not with the Article 89 which requires the consent of parliament. Most parliamentarians believe that the procedure is unconstitutional. This was also the opinion of most experts, by the State Council whose opinion was published in the press after a leak, by the Constitutional Council whose advice remains confidential, and by most of the entourage of the president, even the Prime Minister. The motion was clearly directed against the President of the Republic. La plupart de ses pouvoirs sont soumis à contreseing, ce qui dans la tradition parlementaire, justifie son irresponsabilité, le ministre qui contresigne endosse l'acte. L'article 11 échappe au contreseing, cependant on ne peut parler de pouvoir propre, l'initiative devant venir soit du gouvernement, soit du parlement. En l'espèce, elle est venue, bien que ce soit de pure forme, du gouvernement, ce qui permet la mise en jeu de sa responsabilité. Le texte de la motion ne laisse cependant aucun doute quant à sa cible, le gouvernement n'étant mentionné qu'à sa fin : « L'Assemblée nationale [...], Considérant qu'en écartant le vote par les deux chambres le Président de la République viole la Constitution dont il est le gardien ; Considérant qu'il ouvre ainsi une brèche par laquelle un aventurier pourrait passer un jour, pour renverser la République et supprimer les libertés ; Considérant que le Président n'a pu agir que sur la proposition du Gouvernement ; Censure le Gouvernement conformément à l'article 49, alinéa 2, de la Constitution. »&lt;ref&gt;Cité par [[#GrandsTextes|Maus]], p 225&lt;/ref&gt; Sa rédaction n'est pas loin de suggérer l'usage de l'[[Titre IX - La Haute Cour de Justice (Constitution de la cinquième République française)|article 68]], la mise en accusation du président de la République pour haute trahison, plutôt que la censure du gouvernement.

==Commitment of responsibility on a bill (49.3)==
The clause 3 allows the government to impose the adoption of a text by the assembly, immediately and without a vote, that the assembly cannot oppose without toppling the government through a motion of no confidence (clause 2). This is one of the most known clauses of the Constitution, often cited as a mere number, "article 49.3"&lt;ref&gt;On note aussi fréquemment 49-3 avec un tiret. Cette forme est normalement réservée non aux alinéas mais aux articles intercalaires de la constitution, des articles à part entière qui ne faisaient pas parti de la constitution à l'origine et ont été insérés par des réformes constitutionnelles à leur place logique dans la constitution. Ainsi, l'article sur les lois de financement de la sécurité sociale, introduit en 1996 est-il le 47-1, suivant immédiatement le 47 sur les lois de finances. Il n'y a cependant pas d'article 49-3, et la notation ne crée donc pas d'ambiguïté&lt;/ref&gt; or even "the forty-nine three." This clause reveals a reversal of the relationship between governments and parliaments in the 20th century in favor of the former: the executive power is no longer subordinated to the legislative one and must be able to adopt laws in accordance to its policy. Various solutions have been implemented to ensure the ability of the government to pass laws. With article 49.3, the governments of the Fifth Republic are stronger than ever. The article allows the government to compel the majority if reluctant to adopt a text, and also to accelerate the legislative process, and in particular to end any obstruction from the opposition.

===Primacy of the executive power===
&lt;!-- L'[[article 20 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 20]] dispose que ''le gouvernement détermine et conduit la politique de la nation''. Cette conception s'éloigne beaucoup de la définition habituelle d'un pouvoir exécutif chargé de l'exécution des lois. Déterminer et conduire la politique de la nation implique au contraire d'en être le principal auteur, ce que la constitution consacre à l'[[article 48 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 48]], en contraignant les assemblées à débattre en priorité des projets de loi du gouvernement. Sans que le texte constitutionnel soit toujours aussi favorable au gouvernement qu'en France, cette pratique se retrouve dans la plupart des pays européen, où au moins les quatre cinquièmes des lois sont d'origine gouvernementale, et même au États-Unis, bien que l'exécutif n'y dispose constitutionnellement d'aucune initiative en matière législative. Le rôle du gouvernement s'étend ainsi bien au delà du simple pouvoir de faire exécuter les lois, qui le voudrait subordonné au pouvoir législatif. Au contraire, c'est le parlement qui voit son rôle ramené à la validation des projets du gouvernement, au point qu'on parle de chambre d'enregistrement. Il conserve cependant la faculté de les amender ou de s'y opposer. Mais un gouvernement serait gravement affaibli par le rejet d'un projet important, au point qu'on pourrait y lire la censure de sa politique.
 --&gt;
===Motion of confidence in a parliamentary system===
&lt;!-- Le mécanisme traditionnel de la question de confiance (distinct de celui, plus limité, qui subsiste dans l'alinéa 1 sous la V&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République) force le parlement à assumer le blocage de la politique du gouvernement et la quasi censure qu'implique le rejet d'un projet. Il peut consister simplement pour le gouvernement à annoncer qu'il démissionnera si son projet n'est pas adopté. Un gouvernement peut le faire informellement, en l'absence de toutes dispositions organisant cet engagement. C'était le cas par example sous la III&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République. L'opération peut aussi être encadrée par la constitution, en général dans un sens favorable au gouvernement. En Allemagne, l'article 68 de la [[Loi fondamentale de la République fédérale d'Allemagne|Loi fondamentale]] prévoit que si la motion de confiance, qui peut inclure l'adoption d'un texte, n'est pas adoptée à la majorité absolue, le Chancelier peut demander au Président fédéral la dissolution du ''Bundestag'' ou la proclamation de l'''état de nécessité législative'', qui permet pendant une durée limitée d'adopter les lois avec l'accord de la seule chambre haute, le ''Bundesrat''. Le président est libre d'accepter ou non ces demandes. Dans tous les cas, cette non adoption ne contraint pas le gouvernement à la démission. Celle-ci ne peut être obtenue que si le ''Bundestag'' vote à la majorité absolue une motion de censure qui désigne en même temps le nouveau chancelier (motion de censure dite ''[[Motion de censure constructive|constructive]]'', à l'article 67).
 --&gt;
===Motion of confidence under the Fourth Republic and the origins of article 49.3===
&lt;!-- La question de confiance avait été la cause de la chute de nombreux gouvernements sous la III&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République. L'une des raisons était que la question était parfois posée en séance par un ministre, sans l'accord préalable de l'ensemble du gouvernement et donc de la coalition qu'il représentait. Les autres partenaires de la coalition pouvaient refuser de se voir ainsi forcer la main, et le gouvernement tombait. Sous la IV&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; République, la procédure de la question de confiance est organisée par la constitution, déjà à l'article 49. C'est une prérogative du seul président du Conseil, après délibération du Conseil des ministres. Elle prévoit de plus que le gouvernement ne sera renversé que si la motion est rejetée par la majorité des membres de l'Assemblée. Cette dernière disposition, qui se veut protectrice du gouvernement, sera en fait dévastatrice. Le règlement de l'Assemblée nationale prévoit de son coté qu'un texte joint à la question de confiance est adopté dans les conditions normales, c'est-à-dire si la motion recueille une majorité simple des voix. Dès lors, il suffit aux députés de veiller, par un grand nombre d'abstentions, à ce que la motion soit rejeté par une majorité simple, mais pas une majorité absolue. Le texte n'est pas adopté, et le gouvernement est mis en minorité. Pour autant, à cause du grand nombre d'abstentions, le rejet de la motion n'atteint pas la majorité absolue, et le gouvernement n'est pas constitutionnellement renversé. Privé du soutien de l'Assemblée, don't il tient sa légitimité, et empêché de mettre en œuvre son programme, il n'en est pas moins, politiquement sinon juridiquement, acculé à la démission. L'Assemblée évite par ce mécanisme dit de ''majorité calibrée'' le risque d'une dissolution, que la constitution conditionne au renversement d'un gouvernement dans les formes.

Dans la constitution de 1946, cette disposition est de celles qui contribuent le plus à l'instabilité gouvernementale et à l'absence de politique claire dans un contexte particulièrement difficile, marquée jusqu'en 1954 par la guerre d'Indochine et ensuite par celle d'Algérie. Le régime est en crise. Si un large accord existe sur la nécessité de réformer les institutions, aucun projet ne se concrétise. Le dernier et l'un des plus radical est celui du gouvernement de [[Félix Gaillard]], présenté à l'Assemblée nationale le 16 janvier 1958. Il comporte notamment une réécriture complète de l'article 49. La nouveauté principale est qu'il n'y aurait plus de vote sur la motion de confiance, mais uniquement sur une ou des motions de censure éventuellement déposées pour y répondre. Faute d'adoption d'une de ces motions de censure, le texte du gouvernement est adopté. Le projet Gaillard s'inspire de plus de la motion de censure constructive à l'allemande, en imposant que la motion de censure contienne un contre-projet et « suggère » le nom d'un nouveau président du Conseil. Il veut ainsi éviter qu'un gouvernement soit renversé par une opposition divisée et incapable de s'accorder sur une autre politique. L'Assemblée nationale en adopte en première lecture une version affaiblie. Là où le projet Gaillard prévoyait que les députés voteraient simplement sur la censure, il doivent maintenant choisir, sans possibilité d'abstention, entre confiance et censure. La version de l'Assemblée oblige donc ceux qui ne souhaitent pas renverser le gouvernement à voter son texte, même s'il le désapprouvent ou ne souhaitent pas l'assumer. Le projet initial leur permettait de rester passif, simplement en ne votant pas la censure. De graves revers diplomatiques liés à la situation en Algérie entraînent la chute du gouvernement Gaillard le 15 avril avant que la constitution ait pu être réformée. Après une longue crise ministérielle et un bref intermède de Pierre Pflimlin à la présidence du Conseil, de Gaulle est investi le 1&lt;sup&gt;er&lt;/sup&gt; juin, et son gouvernement est habilité à rédiger une nouvelle constitution.
 --&gt;
===Adoption of 49.3 in 1958===
&lt;!-- Au comité interministériel, qui pour l'essentiel rédige la nouvelle constitution, c'est [[Pierre Pflimlin]] ministre d'État, qui impose la reprise du projet Gaillard, en particulier l'adoption sans vote des projets sur lesquels le gouvernement engage sa responsabilité, seule une motion de censure pouvant s'y opposer. Michel Debré juge la proposition peu convenable, et défend un système complexe, fondé d'une part sur des engagements de responsabilité (au sens de l'alinéa 1) fréquents et obligatoires, d'autre part sur la distinction entre un domaine de compétence exclusive du parlement et un autre où le gouvernement pourra prendre des mesures par décret (distinction plus souple que celle qu'établissent les articles [[article 34 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|34]] et [[article 37 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|37]]). Moyennant ces conditions, il pensait que le domaine exclusif du parlement ne contenait pas de sujet sur lequel un projet aurait pu être urgent, et qu'il n'y avait donc pas lieu d'avoir une procédure si brutale. De Gaulle souhaitait pour sa part que le président de la République puisse soumettre à référendum tout projet de loi rejeté par le parlement. Ce souhait est inacceptable pour les ministres d'État, attachés à un gouvernement strictement représentatif et pour lesquels le référendum rappelle surtout les plébiscites des Bonaparte ; ils ne veulent pas voir l'appel au peuple utilisé pour abaisser le parlement et s'affranchir de son contrôle. Le recours au référendum sera donc très limité dans l'[[article 11 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 11]]. Pflimlin et son parti, le MRP imposent leur solution : au comité consultatif de la constitution, instance composée majoritairement de parlementaire et qui examine le projet du gouvernement, [[Pierre-Henri Teitgen]] subordonne le vote du parti au référendum à l'adoption de l'article. En dépit de l'opposition de [[Paul Reynaud]], ardent défenseur des prérogatives du parlement et qui préside le comité consultatif et de celle de [[Michel Debré]], de Gaulle, très soucieux de voir la constitution largement adoptée et qui voit de plus que ses idées sur le référendum ne pourront être acceptées, se rallie à l'article. Disparaissent par contre les éléments du projet Gaillard qui feraient procéder le gouvernement du parlement, à savoir la désignation du successeur par une motion de censure constructive et la référence à l'investiture : le projet Gaillard justifiait l'adoption du texte en faisant constater faute de censure, la confiance accordée à l'investiture n'a pas été retirée. De Gaulle ne veut pas d'un gouvernement nommé ou investi par le parlement.
 --&gt;
===Procedure===
&lt;!-- La mise en œuvre de l'article se fait en trois temps. D'abord, la délibération du Conseil des ministres, dans les mêmes conditions que pour l'alinéa premier. Ensuite l'engagement de responsabilité proprement dit, par le Premier ministre, en séance à l'Assemblée nationale. Éventuellement, le dépôt d'une motion de censure, à peine facilité par rapport à l'alinéa deux et son vote. Faute du dépôt de cette motion, ou si elle n'est pas adoptée, le texte est réputé adopté par l'Assemblée.

La délibération en Conseil des ministres se fait dans les mêmes conditions que pour l'alinéa premier, et on peut discuter de même la distinction entre simple délibération et autorisation (voir ''supra.''). Si hors période de cohabitation, le président de la République, chef réel de l'exécutif, peut avoir informellement une grande part dans la décision de recourir au 49.3, il ne s'y est jamais opposé en période de cohabitation, ce qu'il ne pourrait faire qu'en refusant que la délibération soit inscrite à l'ordre du jour du Conseil des ministres. L'usage du 49.3 est une prérogative strictement gouvernementale. Notamment, juste après son refus de signer des ordonnances en 1986, refus don't la constitutionnalité a été vivement discutée, François Mitterrand a laissé le Conseil des ministres autoriser Jacques Chirac à engager la responsabilité du gouvernement sur un projet de loi reprenant les mêmes dispositions.

Après la délibération du Conseil, le premier Ministre est libre, en séance à l'Assemblée nationale, d'engager la responsabilité du gouvernement au moment qu'il juge opportun, et seulement s'il le juge opportun. Il doit le faire en personne. Il peut le faire dès la présentation du texte, écartant tout débat. Plus fréquemment, il laisse le débat s'engager et éventuellement le texte être amendé. Le règlement de l'Assemblée nationale permet au gouvernement de demander la réserve d'un amendement, c’est-à-dire d'en repousser la discussion à plus tard (article 95). Si l'engagement de responsabilité a lieu entre temps, cette discussion n'a pas lieu. Le gouvernement peut ainsi écarter les amendements qu'il ne souhaite pas, mais pourrait avoir la faveur de l'Assemblée et aussi ceux qui sont déposés dans un but dilatoire. Lorsque la responsabilité est effectivement engagée, il n'est pas possible de revenir sur les dispositions adoptées auparavant. Le texte sur lequel l'engagement a lieu peut par contre reprendre des dispositions repoussées. Il peut aussi contenir des amendements par rapport au projet initial, qu'il s'agisse d'amendements du gouvernement ou d'amendements d'origine parlementaire que le gouvernement choisit de retenir. L'engagement de responsabilité peut aussi ne porter que sur une partie du texte, auquel cas la discussion se poursuit normalement sur les articles restants.

Une fois la responsabilité engagée sur un texte, le débat a son sujet est définitivement clos. Un délai de vingt-quatre heures est ouvert pour le dépôt d'une motion de censure. L'unique différence entre cette motion de censure dite « provoquée » et la motion de censure « spontanée » de l'alinéa 2 est que cette motion provoquée n'est pas prise en compte dans la limite fixée au nombre de motions qu'un député peut signer au cours d'une session. Les autres dispositions de l'alinéa 2, signature par un dixième des membres de l'Assemblée, délai avant le vote et adoption a la majorité absolue des membres de l'Assemblée s'appliquent.

Le plus souvent, une motion de censure est déposée en réponse à l'usage de l'article 49.3 par le gouvernement. Son adoption entraînerait le rejet du texte et la démission du gouvernement. Cela ne s'est jamais produit et le 49.3 s'est montré d'une efficacité totale pour les gouvernements. Il ne s'agit cependant que de faire adopter le texte par l'Assemblée, pas par le parlement dans son ensemble. La navette entre les deux assemblées prévue par l'[[article 45 de la Constitution de la cinquième République française|article 45]] a lieu normalement. Il est arrivé fréquemment que le gouvernement engage plusieurs fois sa responsabilité sur le même texte, d'abord en première lecture, puis sur le texte de la commission mixte paritaire qui tente de concilier les versions adoptées par l'Assemblée et par le Sénat, enfin lors de la dernière lecture qui permet à l'Assemblée — il s'agit ici plutôt du gouvernement — de passer outre à l'opposition éventuelle du Sénat. Le nombre d'engagement peut être encore plus élevé pour un projet de loi de finance don't la première partie consacrée aux recettes et à l'équilibre général doit être adoptée avant la discussion du détail des crédits, ce qui peut donner lieu, pour une seule lecture, à deux engagements de responsabilité. L'article 49.3 a ainsi été utilisé cinq fois en tout pour faire adopter le budget de 1990.

===History of 49.3===
The procedure of section 49.3 has been used 82 times since 1958 by prime ministers.

===49.3 in practice===
Section 49.3 was conceived at a time when the parliament was often subject to divisions into numerous and undisciplined parties. This situation disappeared after the legislative elections of 1962. The new arrangement is more efficient, in that the legislators will prefer not to vote to force the resignation of the government even if they oppose the law in question, because they fear a form of political suicide in the eyes of the voters.

Various reasons can cause the section to come into play:

* when a need arises to accelerate a debate which is dragging on too long in relation to the necessities of the government calendar or when the opposition is trying to block the debate process by multiplying indefinitely amendment proposals, when the government enjoys a real majority and there is no surprise possible. The government includes the amendments which it considers most serious and important and begins the procedure of 49.3.
* when part of the governing party opposes a law, preventing it from being voted. Resorting to the section 49.3 enables the government to test the inner opposition, forcing it either to ally the opposition to the government or to accept the law. [[Raymond Barre]] has used this procedure in such a situation eight times between 1976 and 1981 to fight against the permanent oppression from [[Jacques Chirac]]'s RPR deputies, who each time accepted the enforcement of the law instead of allying to [[François Mitterrand]]'s PS deputies;
* when the government is only supported by a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] in the National Assembly (that is it has the support of the largest group in the Assembly, but less than an overall majority). [[Michel Rocard]] used 28 times the procedure to make his texts passed, because he was permanently torn apart between the PC, the center-right UDC (separated from the UDF), and deputies faithful to President François Mitterrand. [[Édith Cresson]], who succeeded him, used it eight times, even if she benefited from a larger support from mitterrandist deputies.

'''Attornment''' (from French ''tourner'', "to turn"), in English real [[property law]], is the acknowledgment of a new lord by the tenant on the [[alienation (property law)|alienation]] of land. Under the [[feudal]] system, the relations of [[landlord]] and tenant were to a certain extent reciprocal. So it was considered unreasonable to the tenant to subject him to a new lord without his own approval, and it thus came about that alienation could not take place without the consent of the tenant. Attornment was also extended to all cases of [[lessee]]s for life or for years. The necessity for attornment was abolished by an act of 1705.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Attornment|volume=2|page=887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mortgage]]s, an attornment clause is a clause whereby the mortgagor attorns tenant to the mortgagee, thus giving the mortgagee the right to [[Distraint|distrain]], as an additional security.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
 
As used in modern legal transactions, the term ''attornment'' refers to an acknowledgment of the existence of the relationship of landlord and tenant.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; A tenant often has the duty under the tenant's lease, particularly in commercial leases, to provide an attornment upon request, and is required by a creditor or potential buyer of property from the landlord to establish the nature of existing [[encumbrance]]s on and income streams flowing from a property, as an element of the [[due diligence]] process associated with the transaction. Frequently, a tenant must declare the existence of any outstanding disputes with the landlord at the time the attornment is executed and waives any dispute not declared at that time.

A request for an attornment from a tenant which is refused can be used by a landlord as a basis for establishing grounds for [[eviction]] on the grounds of insecurity that the lease will be honored, or the existence of an actual [[case or controversy]] suitable for resolution in a [[declaratory judgment]] action.

Attornment in commercial real estate is generally used in the context of a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement (SNDA), which protects both the tenant and the lender in the event the landlord defaults on its commercial lending obligations.  The lease remains in full force and effect.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">'''Information security''' has emerged as a significant concern for banks, mobile phone companies and other businesses that use [[call center]]s or [[business process outsourcing]], or '''BPO'''. There have been instances of theft of personal data reported from call centers.

Britain's [[Financial Services Authority]] examined standards in India in April 2005 and the [[Banking Code Standards Board]] audited eight India-based call centres in 2006, handling more than a million calls per month from the UK. the examinations did not extend to Africa-based call centres staffed by workers of Indian origin.

The BCSB report stated that "Customer data is subject to the same level of security as in the UK. High risk and more complex processes are subject to higher levels of scrutiny than similar activities onshore." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/money/2006/oct/07bpo.htm Outsourcing thriving in Britain despite India bash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

India's [[NASSCOM]] has said that they take breach in security extremely seriously and will assist the police in their probe.

==Common countermeasures==

There are three identifiable types of illicit activities concerning fraud emanating from call centers:
# Crooks who pretend to be legitimate call centres.
# Hackers who gain access to call centre information through illegal means
# Call centre agents who illegally misuse the information they have access to in call centres.
# 3rd and 4th party software implementation, allowing for "back-doors" to be entered remotely, sometimes under the "credentials" of security.
While items '''1''' and '''2''' are mostly subject to police action, call centres can use internal procedures to minimise risk. Such mitigation measures include but are not limited to:

# Creating a paperless environment, preventing employees from writing down and removing information by ensuring that all work processes are done on the computer, without having to record anything on forms or notes.
# Prohibiting the use of cellphones and cameras on the floor.
# Prohibiting paper, pens and digital recording devices from being brought onto the floor.
# Preventing internet access for employees on the floor.
# Limiting functionality and access of personal computers or terminals used by call center agents (for example, disabling USB ports). Companies may also use data loss prevention software to block attempts to download, copy, or transmit sensitive electronic data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csoonline.com/article/356064 Call Center Security How: to Protect Employees and Customers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borax''', also known as '''sodium borate''', '''sodium tetraborate''', or '''disodium tetraborate''', is an important [[boron]] [[chemical substance|compound]], a [[mineral]], and a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[boric acid]]. Powdered  borax is white, consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve in water. A number of closely related minerals or chemical compounds that differ in their [[Water of crystallization|crystal water]] content are referred to as ''borax'', but the word is usually used to refer to the [[wikt:decahydrate|decahydrate]].&lt;ref name="crc97"/&gt; Commercially sold borax is partially dehydrated.

Borax is a component of many [[detergent]]s, [[cosmetics]], and [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] glazes. It is used to make [[buffer solution]]s in [[biochemistry]], as a [[fire retardant]], as an [[Fungicide|anti-fungal]] compound, in the manufacture of [[glass wool|fiberglass]], as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in [[metallurgy]], neutron-capture shields for radioactive sources, a texturing agent in cooking, as a [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] for other boron compounds, and along with its inverse, boric acid, is useful as an [[insecticide]].

In [[Artisanal mining|artisanal]] [[gold mining]], the [[borax method]] is sometimes used as a substitute for toxic mercury in the [[gold extraction]] process. Borax was reportedly used by gold miners in parts of the [[Philippines]] in the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/newsletter/march-april-filipino-gold-miner-reveals-borax-secret-pakistan-s-pollution-problem.html#topic1 |title=March 2012 ipad ewaste Filipino Borax, Pakistans Pollution, Artisanal Gold Mining |website=Blacksmithinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013010249/http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/newsletter/march-april-filipino-gold-miner-reveals-borax-secret-pakistan-s-pollution-problem.html#topic1 |archive-date=2016-10-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borax was first discovered in dry lake beds in [[Tibet]] and was imported via the [[Silk Road]] to the Arabian Peninsula in the 8th century AD.&lt;ref name=amoz/&gt; Borax first came into common use in the late 19th century when [[Francis Marion Smith]]'s [[Pacific Coast Borax Company]] began to market and popularize a large variety of applications under the [[20 Mule Team Borax]] [[trademark]], named for [[Twenty-mule team|the method]] by which borax was originally hauled out of the [[Death Valley National Park|California and Nevada deserts]] in large enough quantities to make it cheap and commonly available.&lt;ref&gt;"American Borax Production" Scientific American September 22, 1877&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, G.

[[File:Tetraborate-xtal-3D-balls.png|160px|thumb|The structure of the anion [B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; in borax]]

The term ''borax'' is often used for a number of closely related minerals or chemical compounds that differ in their [[Water of crystallization|crystal water]] content:
* anhydrous sodium tetraborate, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
* sodium tetraborate pentahydrate, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;·5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
* sodium tetraborate decahydrate, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;·10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Borax is generally described as Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;·10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. However, it is better formulated as Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]·8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, since borax contains the [B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ion. In this structure, there are two four-coordinate boron atoms (two BO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra) and two three-coordinate boron atoms (two BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; triangles).

Borax is also easily converted to [[boric acid]] and other [[borate]]s, which have many applications. Its reaction with hydrochloric acid to form boric acid is:

: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;·10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 HCl → 4 H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NaCl + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The "decahydrate" is sufficiently stable to find use as a [[primary standard]] for acid base [[titrimetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{VogelQuantitative}} p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

When borax is added to a flame, it produces a [[yellow]] [[green]] color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencecompany.com/sci-exper/flamecolors.htm |title=Creating Flame Colors |last=Staff |publisher=The Science Company |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borax is not used for this purpose in [[fireworks]] due to the overwhelming yellow color of sodium. Boric acid is used to color [[methanol]] flames a transparent green.

Borax is very soluble in ethylene glycol, moderately soluble in diethylene glycol and methanol, slightly soluble in acetone.&lt;ref name="boraxpdf"&gt;https://www.borax.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pds-borates-boraxdecahydrate-us.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is poorly soluble in cold water, but its solubility increases significantly with temperature.&lt;ref name="boraxpdf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/inorganic/BORAX%20DECAHYDRATE.htm | title=BORAX DECAHYDRATE (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The English word ''borax'' is Latinized:  the [[Middle English]] form was ''boras'', from [[Old French]] ''boras, bourras''. That may have been from medieval Latin ''baurach'' (another English spelling), ''borac(-/um/em), borax'', along with Spanish ''borrax'' (&gt; ''borraj'') and Italian ''borrace'', in the 9th century. Another name for borax is '''tincal''', from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name=amoz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2588|title=Borax ( Na2B4O7. 10H2O ) – Sodium Borate – Occurrence, Discovery and Applications|work=Amoz.com|date=2004-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''tincal'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|ŋ|k|əl}} "tinkle", or ''tincar'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ɪ|ŋ|k|ər}} "tinker", refers to crude borax, before it is purified, as mined from lake deposits in Tibet, Persia, and other parts of Asia.  The word was adopted in the 17th century from Malay ''tingkal'' and from Urdu/Persian/Arabic {{script|Arab|تنکار}} ''tinkār/tankār''; thus the two forms in English.  These all appear to be related to the Sanskrit टांकण ''ṭānkaṇa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|tincal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural sources ==
[[File:Borax ball.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Borax "cottonball"]]
Borax occurs naturally in [[evaporite]] deposits produced by the repeated evaporation of [[seasonal lake]]s. The most commercially important deposits are found in: [[Turkey]]; [[Boron, California]]; and [[Searles Lake]], [[California]]. Also, borax has been found at many other locations in the [[Southwestern United States]], the [[Atacama desert]] in [[Chile]], newly discovered deposits in [[Bolivia]], and in [[Tibet]] and [[Romania]]. Borax can also be produced synthetically from other boron compounds.

Naturally occurring borax (known by the trade name Rasorite–46 in the United States and many other countries) is refined by a process of [[Recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wizniak|first=Jaime|date=July 2005|title=Borax, Boric Acid, and Boron – From exotic to commodity|journal=Indian Journal of Chemical Technology|volume=12|issue=4|issn=0975-0991|url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/8663/1/IJCT%2012(4)%20488-500.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Borax.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Borax-based [[laundry detergent]]]]

=== Household products ===
Borax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products,&lt;ref&gt;{{HPD|136}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the "[[20 Mule Team Borax]]" laundry booster, "[[Boraxo]]" powdered hand soap, and some [[tooth bleaching]] formulas.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{Cite book| author = Hammond, C. R.|title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 81st edition| publisher =CRC press| isbn = 978-0-8493-0485-9| year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== pH buffer ===
Borate ions (commonly supplied as boric acid) are used in biochemical and chemical laboratories to make buffers, e.g. for [[polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]] of DNA and RNA, such as [[TBE buffer]] (borate buffered tris-hydroxymethylaminomethonium)&lt;ref&gt;Peacock AC, Dingman CW. Resolution of multiple ribonucleic acid species by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Biochemistry (1967) volume 6(6):1818-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson S. Shotgun DNA sequencing using cloned DNase I-generated fragments. Nucleic Acids Research (1981) Volume 9(13): 3015-3027&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nucleic Acid Electrophoresis, D. Tietz, ed., Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|3-540-63959-4}} (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; or the newer SB buffer or [[BBS buffer]] (borate buffered saline) in coating procedures. Borate buffers (usually at pH 8) are also used as preferential equilibration solution in [[dimethyl pimelimidate]] (DMP) based crosslinking reactions.

===Co-complexing agent===
Borax as a source of [[borate]] has been used to take advantage of the co-complexing ability of borate with other agents in water to form complex ions with various substances. Borate and a suitable [[polymer]] bed are used to [[chromatograph]] non-[[glycosylated]] [[hemoglobin]] differentially from glycosylated hemoglobin (chiefly [[HbA1c]]), which is an indicator of long term [[hyperglycemia]] in [[diabetes mellitus]].

===Water-softening agent===
Borax alone does not have a high affinity for the ''[[Hard_water#Sources_of_hardness|hardness cations]]'', although it has been used for water-softening. Its chemical equation for ''[[water softening|water-softening]]'' is given below:
: [[calcium|Ca]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt; (aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[boron|B]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;7 (aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → [[calcium|Ca]][[boron|B]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;7 (s)&lt;/sub&gt;↓ + 2 [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt; (aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
: [[magnesium|Mg]]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt; (aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[boron|B]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;7 (aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → [[magnesium|Mg]][[boron|B]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;7 (s)&lt;/sub&gt;↓ + 2 [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt; (aq)&lt;/sub&gt;
The [[sodium]] ions introduced do not make water ‘hard’. This method is suitable for removing both temporary and permanent types of hardness.

=== Flux ===
A mixture of borax and [[ammonium chloride]] is used as a [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] when [[welding]] [[iron]] and [[steel]]. It lowers the melting point of the unwanted [[iron oxide]] ([[Mill scale|scale]]), allowing it to run off. Borax is also used mixed with water as a flux when [[soldering]] [[jewelry]] [[metal]]s such as [[gold]] or [[silver]], where it allows the molten [[solder]] to [[Wetting|wet]] the metal and flow evenly into the joint. Borax is also a good flux for "pre-tinning" [[tungsten]] with zinc — making the tungsten soft-solderable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first = J.G. |last = Dodd |doi = 10.1119/1.1972398 |journal = Am. J. Phys. |volume = 34 |issue = 10 |pages = xvi |year = 1966 |title = Soft soldering to tungsten wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borax is often used as a flux for [[forge welding]].

=== Small-scale gold mining ===
[[File:Borax wagons.jpg|thumb|Old steam tractor and borax wagons, [[Death Valley National Park]] ]]
Borax is replacing mercury as the preferred method for extracting gold in small-scale mining facilities. The method is called the [[borax method]] and is used in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geus.dk/program-areas/common/int_ssm_fact_sheet_07.pdf |title=The borax method |work=Borax replacing mercury in small-scale mining |publisher=The Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) |accessdate=2008-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206111423/http://www.geus.dk/program-areas/common/int_ssm_fact_sheet_07.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flubber===
{{main|Flubber (material)}}
A rubbery polymer sometimes called [[Slime (toy)|Slime]], [[Flubber (material)|Flubber]], 'gluep' or 'glurch' (or erroneously called [[Silly Putty]], which is based on silicone polymers), can be made by [[cross-link]]ing [[polyvinyl alcohol]] with borax. Making flubber from [[polyvinyl acetate]]-based [[glue]]s, such as [[Elmer's Products, Inc.|Elmer's Glue]], and borax is a common elementary-science demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parratore|first=Phil |title=Wacky Science: A Cookbook for Elementary Teachers|publisher=Kendall Hunt|location=Dubuque, IA|page=26|isbn=978-0-7872-2741-8|year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistryactivities/ss/slimerecipe.htm |title=Slime Recipe - How to Make Borax and White Glue Slime |website=Chemistry.about.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food additive ===
Borax, given the [[E number]] ''E285'', is used as a [[food additive]] in some countries, but is banned in some countries, like the U.S., and [[Thailand]]. As a consequence, certain foods, such as [[caviar]], produced for sale in the US contain higher levels of [[salt]] to assist preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hanscon.ch/caviar_website/glossary.htm |title=Caviar glossary |work=The Caviar Guide a gourmet review of caviars &amp; fish roe |publisher=Hanson Ltd, Geneva, Switzerland |accessdate=2008-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208100622/http://www.hanscon.ch/caviar_website/glossary.htm |archivedate=2008-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its use as a cooking ingredient is to add a firm rubbery texture to the food, or as a preservative. In Asian cooking it is mostly used for its texturing properties. In [[China]], borax ({{zh|c=硼砂|p=péng shā}} or {{zh|c=月石|p=yuè shí}}) was found to have been added to some Chinese foods like hand-pulled noodles ''[[lamian]]'' and some [[rice noodle]]s like [[shahe fen]], [[kway teow]], and [[chee cheong fun]] recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/279712 |title=Chinese Ingredients: Borax Powder, Mushroom Extract - Chowhound |website=Chowhound.chow.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Indonesia]] it is a common, but forbidden, additive to such foods as noodles, [[bakso]] (meatballs), and steamed rice. The country's Directorate of Consumer Protection warns of the risk of [[liver cancer]] with high consumption over a period of 5–10 years.&lt;ref name=IndonesiaDCP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pkditjenpdn.depdag.go.id/English/index.php?page=infodtl&amp;InfoID=8&amp;dtl=1 |title=Watch Out For The Food We Consume |year=2006 |publisher=Directorate of Consumer Protection, Jakarta, Indonesia |accessdate=2009-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228204459/http://pkditjenpdn.depdag.go.id/English/index.php?page=infodtl&amp;InfoID=8&amp;dtl=1 |archivedate=December 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
Borax, sodium tetraborate decahydrate, according to one study, is not acutely toxic.&lt;ref name="pesticideinfo1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pesticideinfo.org/Detail_Chemical.jsp?Rec_Id=PC34355 |title=Borax - toxicity, ecological toxicity and regulatory information |website=Pesticideinfo.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its {{LD50}} (median lethal dose) score is tested at 2.66 g/kg in rats,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.prosarcorp.com/files_F/doc_0027/32C37.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that a significant dose of the chemical is needed to cause severe symptoms or death. The lethal dose is not necessarily the same for humans. On pesticide information websites it is listed as a non-lethal compound and of no hazardous concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_Chemical.jsp?Rec_Id=PC34355 |title=Borax - toxicity, ecological toxicity and regulatory information |website=Pesticideinfo.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borax has been in use as an insecticide in the United States with various restrictions since 1946.  All restrictions were removed in February 1986 due to the low toxicity of borax, as reported in two EPA documents relating to boric acid and borax.&lt;ref name="epa factsheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/REDs/factsheets/0024fact.pdf |title=Pesticide Reregistration Status &amp;#124; Pesticides &amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="borax cleared"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/cleared_reviews/csr_PC-011103_25-Apr-93_002.pdf |title=Pesticides &amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date=2015-08-20 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::''EPA has determined that, because they are of low toxicity and occur naturally, boric acid and its sodium salts should be exempted from the requirement of a tolerance (maximum residue limit) for all raw agricultural commodities.''&lt;ref name="epa factsheet" /&gt;

Although it cited inconclusive data, a re-evaluation in 2006 by the EPA still found that "There were no signs of toxicity observed during the study and no evidence of cytotoxicity to the target organ."&lt;ref name="regulations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2005-0062-0004 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503044719/http://www.regulations.gov/ |archivedate=2015-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the reevaluation, a study of toxicity due to overexposure was checked and the findings were that "The residential handler inhalation risks due to boric acid and its sodium salts as active ingredients are not a risk concern and do not exceed the level of concern..." but that there could be some risk of irritation to children inhaling it if used as a powder for cleaning rugs.  
   
Sodium tetraborate decahydrate has no known [[hazard issue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquasolutions.org/download/msds/SYN023.pdf |format=PDF |title=Safety Data Sheet : acc. to OSHA HCS |website=Aquasolutions.org|accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2016}}

Conditions defined as "over-exposure" to borax dust can cause respiratory irritation, while no skin irritation is known to exist due to borax. Ingestion may cause gastrointestinal distress including [[nausea]], persistent vomiting, abdominal pain, and [[diarrhea]]. Effects on the vascular system and [[human brain]] include headaches and lethargy, but are less frequent. "In severe poisonings, a beefy red skin rash affecting palms, soles, buttocks and scrotum has been described. With severe poisoning, [[erythematous]] and [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliative]] rash, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and renal failure."&lt;ref name="pesticideinfo1"/&gt;

A draft risk assessment released by [[Health Canada]] in July 2016 has found that overexposure to boric acid has the potential to cause developmental and reproductive health effects. Since people are already exposed to boric acid naturally through their diets and water, Health Canada advised that exposure from other sources should be reduced as much as possible, especially for children and pregnant women. The concern is not with any one product, but rather multiple exposures from a variety of sources. With this in mind, the department also announced that registrations for certain pesticides that contain boric acid, which are commonly used in homes, will have their registrations cancelled and be phased out of the marketplace. As well, new, more protective label directions are being introduced for other boric acid pesticides that continue to be registered in Canada (for example, enclosed bait stations and spot treatments using gel formulations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2016/59514a-eng.php |title=Information Update - Health Canada advises Canadians to avoid homemade craft and pesticide recipes using boric acid - Recalls &amp; alerts - Healthy Canadians Website |website=Healthycanadians.gc.ca |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible carcinogen===
The Indonesian Directorate of Consumer Protection warns of the risk of [[liver cancer]] with high consumption of borax over a period of 5–10 years.&lt;ref name=IndonesiaDCP/&gt;

===Risk to fertility and pregnancy===
Borax was added to the [[Substance of very high concern|Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC)]] candidate list on 16 December 2010. The SVHC candidate list is part of the [[European Union|EU]] Regulations on the [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] 2006 (REACH), and the addition was based on the revised classification of borax as ''toxic for reproduction'' category 1B under the [[CLP Regulation]]s. Substances and mixtures imported into the EU which contain borax are now required to be labelled with the warnings "May damage fertility" and "May damage the unborn child".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110725113454/http://echa.europa.eu/doc/candidate_list/svhc_supdoc_disodium_tetraborate_anhydrous_publication.pdf Member state committee draft support document for identification of disodium tetraborate, anhydrous as a substance of very high concern because of its CMR properties].

The '''Democratic Army of Greece''' ({{lang-el|Δημοκρατικός Στρατός Ελλάδας}}, '''DSE''' (ΔΣΕ)), was the army founded by the [[Communist Party of Greece]] during the [[Greek Civil War]], 1946–1949. At its height, it had a strength of around 50,000 men and women.

The DSE was backed up by the [[Popular Civil Guard]] (Λαϊκή Πολιτοφυλακή, ΛΠ), the Communist Party's security police force.

==History==
After the liberation of [[Greece]] from the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]], the ''[[Dekemvriana]]'' and the [[Varkiza Agreement]] (in which [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]], the main Partisan Army in Greece, agreed to a disarmament), the persecution of [[Left-wing politics|left wing]] citizens, [[communist]]s and officials of [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]], started. There were 166 different [[anti-communist]] groups, such as those of Sourlas and Kalabalikis in [[Thessaly]], and Papadopoulos in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]. Archives of D.S. National Solidarity indicate that by 31 March 1946, nationwide, 1,289 suspected communists had been killed, 6,671 had been wounded, 84,931 had been arrested, 165 been raped, and the property of 18,767 was looted.  Imprisoned suspected communists numbered in excess of 30,000. Those responsible for the murders, according to the DSE, were collaborationist groups, national guards, rural police, and members of the British armed forces.

Under these circumstances, the persecuted [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] that were still free, started to form guerrilla groups named [[Groups of Persecuted Fighters]].&lt;ref&gt;Δοκίμιο Ιστορίας του ΚΚΕ, ΚΕ ΚΚΕ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ο Εμφύλιος Πόλεμος στην Πελοπόνησσο, Α. Καμαρινού&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1946 cells of these groups had been established throughout Greece. The official start of the armed struggle came with the attack on the [[Greek Gendarmerie]] station at [[Litochoro]] by around 35 guerrillas on 31 March 1946, an [[Greek legislative election, 1946|election]] day. 12 Gendarmes were killed, and this attack is generally considered the start of the Civil War.

[[File:Gde.svg|thumbnail|320px|Organization and military bases of the "Democratic Army", as well as entry routes to Greece (legend in Greek)]]
The [[Communist Party of Greece]] led the armed struggle, through the General Partisan Command, which was created on 28 October 1946, and headed by [[Markos Vafiadis]].  Order number 19 of the General Command, issued on 27 December 1946, renamed the guerilla groups to the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE). The relevant order&lt;ref&gt;Daily Orders General Command, DSE, 28 December 1946&lt;/ref&gt; included the following comment regarding the DSE: "It is the national people’s revolutionary army of the new Democratic Greece and fights with gun in hand for our National independence and for People's Democracy."

In 1947, KKE and the Democratic Army formed the "Provisional Democratic Government" ("Mountain Government") under the premiership of Markos Vafiadis. After this, KKE turned illegal.

As well as issues regarding the war effort, the Provisional Government had to deal with issues regarding the "People's Law" in the territories controlled by the DSE. These had to do with the judicial, financial, and political systems. As the Provisional Government was based on political forces which aimed to establish a socialist state, its decisions were driven by this political agenda. The self-determination of national minorities living in Greece was one priority. The Provisional Government and the KKE intended to establish a [[People's Republic]] of Greece in which all nationalities would work together in a Socialist state.&lt;ref&gt;Study on the History of KKE.&lt;/ref&gt; An article written by [[Nikos Zachariadis]] expressed the KKE's strategy after the envisioned victory of the Democratic Army of Greece regarding what was then known as the "Macedonian Issue": "The Macedonian people will acquire an independent, united state with a coequal position within the family of free peoples’ republics within the Balkans, within the family of Peoples’ Republics to which the Greek people will belong. The Macedonian people are today fighting for this independent united state with a coequal position and is helping the DSE with all its soul...."&lt;ref&gt;''Δημοκρατικός Στρατός'' magazine, edited by Ριζοσπάστης, 1996, vol. I, pp. 408-412.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy of self-determination for Macedonia within a People's Republic was reiterated during the 5th KKE Central Committee meeting held in January 1949, which declared that the "[[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] people participating in the liberation struggle would find their full national re-establishment as they want giving their blood for this acquisition... Macedonian Communists should pay great attentions to foreign chauvinist and counteractive elements that want to break the unity between the Greek and Macedonian people. This will only serve the monarcho-fascists and [[British imperialism]]...."&lt;ref&gt;KKE, ''Official Documents'', vol. 6, pp. 356, 338.&lt;/ref&gt;  This statement can be explained due to the large number of Slavomacedonian fighters (~ 60%) amongst the DSE fighters.

The Provisional Government never achieved international recognition. During the first two years, from 1946 to the beginning of 1948, it managed to control large rural areas but no major town. At the same time, the Hellenic Army, advised by the British up to 1947 and afterwards by US military delegation led by General [[James Van Fleet]], [[United States Army|US Army]], established the Greek government's position in the rest of the country as well as internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Δοκίμιο Ιστορίας του ΚΚΕ&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fatal blow in early 1948, when DSE's III Brigade numbering 20,000 men and women was completely wiped out, DSE lost support in southern Greece as well as the political and economic control of a huge area. That was the beginning of the end of the [[Greek Civil War]]. At the same time, the efforts of the HQ of DSE to capture and hold a major town in the North such as [[Konitsa]] or [[Florina]] led to catastrophic defeat of the partisan army, which never recovered. On the other hand, the DSE did manage to achieve some military victories in 1948 and early 1949, in the battles of [[Karpenisi]], [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]], and [[Karditsa]].  At the same time, DSE had a huge problem regarding reserves. Most of the men and women capable and willing to join its ranks were imprisoned or unable to reach areas controlled by DSE.

One of the biggest battles of the three year Greek Civil War took place in the [[Grammos]] mountains in 1948. The operation took place after the Hellenic Army had secured the [[Peloponnese]], where it managed to defeat the DSE's III Division, numbering 20,000 fighters. In the battle of Grammos, forces of the Hellenic Army, with the codename Operation Koronis, deployed 70,000 troops, while the DSE had 12,000 fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Boatswain and Colin Nicholson: A Traveller's History of Greece, The Windrush Press, Gloucestershire, 1989, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; The battle lasted from 16 June until 21 August 1948. On that day, DSE forces, after hard fight, retreated into Albanian territory and reformed towards [[Vitsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shrader|first=Charles R.|title=The withered vine : logistics and the communist insurgency in Greece, 1945-1949|year=1999|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-275-96544-0|pages=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vu2i13Yq60QC&amp;pg=PA70 |edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The maneuver from Grammos to Vitsi is considered one of the most important tactical actions of DSE during the war, from a military point of view.

Towards the end of August 1949, the Hellenic Army, under the leadership of [[Alexander Papagos]], deployed 180,000 troops, and achieved the defeat of the DSE army of about 7,000 fighters on the Grammos-Vitsi front.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  After this defeat, the DSE fighters crossed the border into [[Albania]] and scattered to camps all over the newly founded so-called [[Socialist Republic]]s, with the main body of the fighters camped in [[Taskent]], the capital of [[Uzbekistan]] in the [[USSR]].

The post-Civil War era left a country in ruins. Many of the nation's youth were either killed on the battlefield, imprisoned or became political refugees. The political situation was quite unstable for most of the next two decades &amp;ndash; the decisive factor leading to the [[Greek military junta of 1967&amp;ndash;1974]]. The ghost of the Civil War haunted Greece for many years after. In 1981, when the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) party came to power in Greece following a long period of right-wing dominance, the political refugees of the DSE were finally given permission to return to their homeland ([[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Slavomacedonians]] excluded) by the new Interior Minister, [[George Gennimatas]]. Markos Vafiadis also returned to Greece and supported the PASOK government, and was elected a Member of Parliament for PASOK.

In 1989, the Greek Parliament voted unanimously a law that declared the three-year war of 1946&amp;ndash;1949 as formally having been the "Greek Civil War" and accepted the former "Communist Bandits" as "Fighters of DSE", giving some of them privileges of [[pension]].

==The Oath of the DSE fighter==
The following text was the oath that DSE members must swear and abide by.  During enrolment, the member would swear:

I, a child of the Greek people and a DSE fighter, swear to battle with gun in hand, to shed my blood, and give even my life to banish from the soil of my motherland every last foreign occupier.  To banish every trace of fascism.  To secure and defend the national independence and territorial integrity of my motherland.  To secure and defend democracy, honour, work, fortune, and progress of my people.

I swear to be a good, brave and disciplined soldier, to carry out all the orders of my superiors, to observe all regulations, and not betray any secrets of the DSE.

I swear to be a good example to the people, to encourage popular unity and reconciliation, and to avoid any action that reduces and dishonours me, as a person and as a fighter.

My ideal is a free and strong democratic Greece and the progress and prosperity of the people.  And in the service of my ideal I offer my gun and my life.

If I ever prove to be a liar, and with bad intent violate my oath, let the vengeful hand of the nation, and the hate and scorn of the people, fall upon me implacably.

The '''Democratic Socialist Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido Democrático Socialista}}) was a [[political party]] in [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==History==
The party first contested national elections in 2004, when it ran in the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|parliamentary elections]] that year. It received 2% of the vote, but failed to win a seat. In the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2008|2008 elections]] its vote share fell to 0.4% and it remained without representation in the [[National People's Assembly (Guinea-Bissau)|National People's Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/gw.html Elections in Guinea-Bissau] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7143">'''Dutch Women's Council''' ({{lang-nl|Nederlandse Vrouwen Raad (NVR)}}) was founded in 1898 as an [[umbrella organization]] to unite women's groups across the country in their struggles for economic, legal, political, and social rights. Initially their focus was not political, but expanded to encompass [[women's suffrage]]. After more than one hundred years of operation, the council continues to strive for women's equality.

==History==
Soon after the National Exhibition of Women's Labor [[:nl:|Nationale Tentoonstelling van Vrouwenarbeid 1898|(nl)]] was held, the board members of the exhibition decided that an umbrella organization called the National Women's Council of the Netherlands ({{lang-nl|Nationale Vrouwenraad van Nederland}}) would be beneficial for uniting women in the improvement of their legal, political and socio-economic status in the country.{{sfn|Grever|Waaldijk|2004|p=38}} On 29 October 1898 the organization was founded{{sfn|Nederlandse Vrouwen Raad|2013}} with the first chairman designated as [[Mariane van Hogendorp]] and was affiliated with the [[International Council of Women]].{{sfn|de Vries|2015}}{{sfn|Leydesdorff|2009}}

The NVR membership was neither tied to political ideology or religious affiliation, which meant that debate on various points of view were welcomed, but also at times made members uncomfortable as their particular customs or practices had to be set aside for the advancement of the whole group.{{sfn|Grever|Waaldijk|2004|p=37}}{{sfn|Leydesdorff|2009}} The council had a requirement that all affiliated associations, companies, or organizations have at least one woman who was a member of their governing board. To ensure that no single organization could dominate the other members, the bylaws specified that all decisions had to be unanimous. It was also hoped that such a rule would cause the women to discuss and eliminate issues which were divisive.{{sfn|''De Nationale Vrouwenraad''|1911|p=4}}

Among the issues the Council focused upon initially were equal education for girls and boys, the inclusion of women in employment opportunities, health and sanitation legislation, illegitimacy, loss of women's autonomy upon marriage,{{sfn|''De Nationale Vrouwenraad''|1911|pp=5-6}} prostitution, alcoholism, and other social ills.{{sfn|''De Nationale Vrouwenraad''|1911|p=7}} Initially, [[women's suffrage]] was not an area in which the women focused; however, increasing involvement of several members like [[Aletta Jacobs]] with international suffragists like [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], led the NVT to begin pressing for political rights.{{sfn|Grever|1994|pp=65-66}}

==Modern organization==
In 1972 the National Women's Council was reorganized to become the Dutch Women's Council and throughout the 1980s a corporate structure was adopted changing focus to a more economic focus. By the end of the 1980s, the organization faced a crisis because the Ministry of Welfare, Public Health and Culture saw no need to channel funds into an umbrella organization with such broad reach. That decision in turn, led to a split in the organization in 1992, with one branch retaining the name Dutch Women's Council and the other new organization, Arachne Women's Advice Bureau for Government Policy, being developed to evaluate women's policy issues. Social Participation and Rights of Women remain the goals of the organization, which has approximately 50 affiliated organizations.{{sfn|Nederlandse Vrouwen Raad|2013}} The organization's archival materials are located at the [[Atria Institute on gender equality and women's history]].{{sfn|Atria|1998}}

'''Economic stagnation''' is a prolonged period of slow [[economic growth]] (traditionally measured in terms of the [[GDP]] growth), usually accompanied by high unemployment. Under some definitions, "slow" means significantly slower than potential growth as estimated by [[macroeconomics|macroeconomists]], even though the growth rate may be nominally higher than in other countries not experiencing economic stagnation.

==Secular stagnation theory==
{{Main|Secular stagnation theory}}
{{Details|Alvin Hansen#Stagnation}}

The term "secular stagnation" was originally coined by [[Alvin Hansen]] in 1938 to "describe what he feared was the fate of the American economy following the Great Depression of the early 1930s: a check to economic progress as investment opportunities were stunted by the closing of the frontier and the collapse of immigration".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/08/secular-stagnation|title = Secular stagnation: Fad or fact?|last = W.|first = P.|date = 16 August 2014|work = The Economist|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/us-secular-stagnation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Warnings similar to secular stagnation theory have been issued after all deep recessions, but they usually turned out to be wrong because they underestimated the potential of existing technologies.&lt;ref name="Pagano and Sbracia"&gt;Pagano and Sbracia (2014) [http://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/qef/2014-0231/QEF-231.pdf "The secular stagnation hypothesis: a review of the debate and some insights."] Bank of Italy ''Questioni di Economia e Finanza'' occasional paper series number QEF-231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secular stagnation refers to "a condition of negligible or no economic growth in a market-based economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=secular-stagnation|title = Definition of secular stagnation|date = |accessdate = 9 October 2014|website = Financial Times|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term ''secular'' is used in contrast to ''cyclical'' or ''short-term'', and suggests a change of fundamental dynamics which would play out only in its own time. [[Alan Sweezy]] described the difference: &lt;blockquote&gt;"But, whereas business-cycle theory treats depression as a temporary, though recurring, phenomenon, the theory of secular stagnation brings out the possibility that depression may become the normal condition of the economy." &lt;ref name="Harris 1943"&gt;

==Stagnation in the United States==
{{Details|Economic history of the United States}}

===Historical periods of stagnation in the United States===
*The years following the [[Panic of 1873]], known as the [[Long Depression]], were followed by periods of stagnation intermixed with surges of growth until steadier growth resumed around 1896. The period was characterized by business bankruptcies, low interest rates and [[deflation]]. According to [[David Ames Wells]] (1891) the economic problems were the result of rapid changes in technology, such as railroads, steam-powered ocean ships, steel displacing iron and the [[telegraph]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

See: [[Long Depression]]

*The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and the rest of the period lasting until [[World War II]]. ''Post War Economic Problems'', Harris (1943) was written with the expectation that the stagnation would continue after the war ended.  See: [[Causes of the Great Depression]]

====19th century====
The U.S. economy of the early 19th century was primarily agricultural and suffered from labor shortages.&lt;ref&gt;

Capital was so scarce before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] that private investors supplied only a fraction of the money to build railroads, despite the large economic advantage railroads offered.

As new territories were opened and federal land sales conducted, land had to be cleared and new homesteads established. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants came to the United States every year and found jobs digging canals and building railroads. Because there was little mechanization, almost all work was done by hand or with horses, mules and oxen until the last two decades of the 19th century.&lt;ref name = "Hunter 1991"&gt;

The decade of the 1880s saw great growth in railroads and the steel and machinery industries. Purchase of structures and equipment increased 500% from the previous decade. Labor productivity rose 26.5% and GDP nearly doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The workweek during most of the 19th century was over 60 hours, being higher in the first half of the century, with twelve-hour work days common. There were numerous strikes and other labor movements for a ten-hour day.

The tight labor market was a factor in productivity gains allowing workers to maintain or increase their nominal wages during the secular deflation that caused real wages to rise in the late 19th century. Labor did suffer temporary setbacks, such as when railroads cut wages during the Long Depression of the mid-1870s; however, this resulted in strikes throughout the nation.

====End of stagnation in the U.S. after the Great Depression====
{{Details|Post–World War II economic expansion}}
Construction of structures, residential, commercial and industrial, fell off dramatically during the depression, but housing was well on its way to recovering by the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="Field 2011"&gt;

The depression years were the period of the highest [[total factor productivity]] growth in the United States, primarily to the building of roads and bridges, abandonment of unneeded railroad track and reduction in railroad employment, expansion of electric utilities and improvements wholesale and retail distribution.&lt;ref name="Field 2011"/&gt; This helped the United States, which escaped the devastation of World War II, to quickly convert back to peacetime production.

The war created pent up demand for many items as factories that once produced automobiles and other machinery converted to production of tanks, guns, military vehicles and supplies. Tires had been rationed due to shortages of natural rubber; however, the U.S. government built [[synthetic rubber]] plants. The U.S. government also built [[Synthonia|synthetic ammonia]] plants, aluminum smelters, [[aviation fuel]] refineries and aircraft engine factories during the war.&lt;ref name="Field 2011"/&gt; After the war commercial aviation, plastics and synthetic rubber would become major industries and synthetic ammonia was used for fertilizer. The end of armaments production free up hundreds of thousands of [[machine tool]]s, which were made available for other industries. They were needed in the rapidly growing aircraft manufacturing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The memory of war created a need for preparedness in the United States. This resulted in constant spending for defense programs, creating what President Eisenhower called the [[military-industrial complex]].

U.S. birth rates began to recover by the time of World War II, and turned into the [[baby boom#United States|baby boom]] of the postwar decades. A building boom commenced in the years following the war. Suburbs began a rapid expansion and automobile ownership increased.&lt;ref name="Field 2011"/&gt;

High-yielding crops and chemical fertilizers dramatically increased [[crop yield]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and greatly lowered the cost of food, giving consumers more [[discretionary income]]. Railroad locomotives switched from steam to [[Diesel engine|diesel]] power, with a large increase in [[fuel efficiency]]. Most importantly, cheap food essentially eliminated [[malnutrition]] in countries like the United States and much of Europe.

Many trends that began before the war continued: 
*The use of electricity grew steadily as prices continued to fall, although at slower rate than in the early decades. More people purchased washing machines, dryers, [[refrigerator]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and other appliances. [[Air conditioning]] became increasingly prevalent in households and businesses. See:[[Diffusion of innovations#Diffusion data]]
*Infrastructures: The highway system continued to expand.&lt;ref name="Field 2011"/&gt; Construction of the [[interstate highway system]] started in the late 1950s. The pipeline network continued to expand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bts.gov/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_01.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad track mileage continued its decline.
*Better roads and increased investment in the distribution system of trucks, warehouses and [[material handling equipment|material-handling equipment]], such as [[forklift trucks]] continued to reduce the cost of goods.
*Mechanization of agriculture increased dramatically, especially the use of [[combine harvester]]s. Tractor sales peaked in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Stagflation===
The period following the [[1973 oil crisis]] was characterized by [[stagflation]], the combination of low economic and productivity growth and high inflation. The period was also characterized by high interest rates, which is not entirely consistent with secular stagnation. Stronger economic growth resumed and inflation declined during the 1980s.

Although productivity never returned to peak levels, it did enjoy a revival with the growth of the computer and communications industries in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Field 2004"&gt;{{Cite web

The U.S. economy experienced structural changes following the stagflation. Steel consumption peaked in 1973, both on an absolute and per-capita basis, and never returned to previous levels.&lt;ref&gt;

Health care expenditures rose to over 17% of the economy.

A recent book titled ''The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick and Will (Eventually) Feel better'' by [[Tyler Cowen]] is one of the latest of several stagnation books written in recent decades. ''Turning Point'' by [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]] and ''The Evolution of Progress'' by C. Owen Paepke were earlier books that predicted the stagnation.

===Stagnation and the financial explosion: the 1980s===
A prescient analysis of stagnation and what is now called financialization was provided in the 1980s by [[Harry Magdoff]] and [[Paul Sweezy]], coeditors of the independent socialist journal ''[[Monthly Review]]''. Magdoff was a former economic advisor to Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] in Roosevelt’s [[New Deal]] administration, while Sweezy was a former Harvard economics professor. In their 1987 book, ''Stagnation and the Financial Explosion'', they argued, based on Keynes, Hansen, [[Michał Kalecki]], and Marx, and marshaling extensive empirical data, that, contrary to the usual way of thinking, stagnation or slow growth was the norm for mature, monopolistic (or oligopolistic) economies, while rapid growth was the exception.&lt;ref name="Magdoff &amp; Sweezy 1987"&gt;

Private accumulation had a strong tendency to weak growth and high levels of excess capacity and unemployment/underemployment, which could, however, be countered in part by such exogenous factors as state spending (military and civilian), epoch-making technological innovations (for example, the automobile in its expansionary period), and the growth of finance. In the 1980s and 1990s Magdoff and Sweezy argued that a financial explosion of long duration was lifting the economy, but this would eventually compound the contradictions of the system, producing ever bigger speculative bubbles, and leading eventually to a resumption of overt stagnation.

===Post-2008 period===

Secular stagnation was dusted off by [[Hans-Werner Sinn]] in a 2009 article &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/forget-inflation Hans-Werner Sin, Forget Inflation, February 26, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; dismissing the threat of inflation, and became popular again when [[Larry Summers]] invoked the term and concept during a 2013 speech at the IMF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://larrysummers.com/imf-fourteenth-annual-research-conference-in-honor-of-stanley-fischer/|title = IMF Fourteenth Annual Research Conference in Honor of Stanley Fischer|last = |first = |date = 8 November 2013|work = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''[[The Economist]]'' criticizes secular stagnation as "a baggy concept, arguably too capacious for its own good".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Warnings similar to secular stagnation theory have been issued after all deep recessions, but they all turned out to be wrong because they underestimated the potential of existing technologies.&lt;ref name="Pagano and Sbracia" /&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]], writing in 2014, clarified that it refers to "the claim that underlying changes in the economy, such as slowing growth in the working-age population, have made episodes like the past five years in Europe and the United States, and the last 20 years in Japan, likely to happen often. That is, we will often find ourselves facing persistent shortfalls of demand, which can’t be overcome even with near-zero interest rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/secular-stagnation-the-book/|title = Secular Stagnation: The Book|last = Krugman|first = Paul|date = 15 August 2014|work = New York Times|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; At its root is "the problem of building consumer demand at a time when people are less motivated to spend".&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.npr.org/2014/09/09/347017555/is-the-economy-suffering-from-secular-stagnation|title = Is The Economy Suffering From Secular Stagnation?|last = Inskeep|first = Steve|date = 9 September 2014|work = NPR|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory is that the boost in growth by the internet and technological advancement in computers of the [[new economy]] does not measure up to the boost caused by the [[great inventions]] of the past. An example of such a great invention is the [[assembly line]] production method of [[Fordism]]. The general form of the argument has been the subject of papers by Robert J. Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Secular stagnation has also been linked to the rise of the digital economy. [[Carl Benedikt Frey]], for example, has suggested that digital technologies are much less capital-absorbing, creating only little new investment demand relative to other revolutionary technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another is that the damage done by the [[Great Recession]] was so long-lasting and permanent, so many workers will never get jobs again, that we really can't recover.&lt;ref name="Summers" /&gt;

A third is that there is a "persistent and disturbing reluctance of businesses to invest and consumers to spend", perhaps in part because so much of the recent gains have gone to the people at the top, and they tend to save more of their money than people—ordinary working people who can't afford to do that.&lt;ref name="Summers" /&gt;

And a fourth is that advanced economies are just simply paying the price for years of inadequate investment in infrastructure and education, the basic ingredients of growth.&lt;ref name="Summers" /&gt;

===World since 2008===

Economists have asked whether the low economic growth rate in the developed world leading up to and following the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2007–2008 was due to secular stagnation. Paul Krugman wrote in September 2013: "[T]here is a case for believing that the problem of maintaining adequate aggregate demand is going to be very persistent – that we may face something like the 'secular stagnation' many economists feared after World War II." Krugman wrote that fiscal policy stimulus and higher inflation (to achieve a negative real rate of interest necessary to achieve full employment) may be potential solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/bubbles-regulation-and-secular-stagnation/?_r=0 Paul Krugman-Bubbles, Regulation and Secular Stagnation-September 25, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larry Summers]] presented his view during November 2013 that secular (long-term) stagnation may be a reason that U.S. growth is insufficient to reach full employment: "Suppose then that the short term real interest rate that was consistent with full employment [i.e., the "natural rate"] had fallen to negative two or negative three percent. Even with artificial stimulus to demand you wouldn't see any excess demand. Even with a resumption in normal credit conditions you would have a lot of difficulty getting back to full employment."&lt;ref name="pieria.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.pieria.co.uk/articles/secular_stagnation_and_post-scarcity Marco Nappollini- Pieria.com-Secular Stagnation and Post Scarcity-November 19, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/secular-stagnation-coalmines-bubbles-and-larry-summers/ Paul Krugman-Conscience of a Liberal Blog-Secular Stagnation, Coalmines, Bubbles, and Larry Summers-November 16, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert J. Gordon]] wrote in August 2012: "Even if innovation were to continue into the future at the rate of the two decades before 2007, the U.S. faces six headwinds that are in the process of dragging long-term growth to half or less of the 1.9 percent annual rate experienced between 1860 and 2007. These include demography, education, inequality, globalization, energy/environment, and the overhang of consumer and government debt. A provocative 'exercise in subtraction' suggests that future growth in consumption per capita for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution could fall below 0.5 percent per year for an extended period of decades".&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/economics/gordon/is%20us%20economic%20growth%20over.pdf Robert J.

      <comment>I deleted reference to some countries experiencing food shortages. The reference was to an unrelated article from fox news regarding government enforced food rationing. If this is included as a criticism of Food Sovereignty, then it should be included in "Criticism of food Sovereignty" and the causal links clearly drawn. It was added here with no clear logical link. The referenced article, if anything, demonstrated government control of food systems - in opposition to Food Sovereignty concepts</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25928">"'''Food sovereignty'''", a term coined by members of [[Via Campesina]] in 1996,&lt;ref name=FoodFirst&gt;"Global Small-Scale Farmers' Movement Developing New Trade Regimes", [[Food First]] ''News &amp; Views'', Volume 28, Number 97 Spring/Summer 2005, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that the people who produce, distribute, and consume food should control the mechanisms and policies of [[food production]] and distribution, rather than the corporations and market institutions they believe have come to dominate the global food system. It also encompasses the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. The phrase "culturally appropriate" signifies that the food that is available and accessible for the population should fit with the cultural background of the people consuming it.

== History ==

The history of food sovereignty as a movement is relatively young. However, there are a number of key movements and countries that have made significant steps towards making an alternative food system a reality.

=== Global gatherings ===

At the Forum for Food Sovereignty in [[Sélingué]], [[Mali]], 27 February 2007, about 500 delegates from more than 80 countries adopted the "Declaration of [[Nyéléni]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyeleni.org/spip.php?article290 Declaration of Nyéléni] (text), Nyéléni 2007 - Forum for Food Sovereignty. Accessed online 19 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which says in  part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and [[sustainable]] methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It puts those who produce, distribute and consume food at the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and corporations. It defends the interests and inclusion of the next generation. It offers a strategy to resist and dismantle the current corporate trade and food regime, and directions for food, farming, pastoral and fisheries systems determined by local producers. Food sovereignty prioritises local and national economies and markets and empowers peasant and family farmer-driven agriculture, artisanal fishing, pastoralist-led grazing, and food production, distribution and consumption based on environmental, social and economic sustainability.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In April 2008 the [[International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development]] (IAASTD), an intergovernmental panel under the sponsorship of the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Bank]], adopted the following definition: "Food sovereignty is defined as the right of peoples and sovereign states to democratically determine their own agricultural and food policies."&lt;ref&gt;International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), [http://www.agassessment.org/docs/Global_SDM_060608_English.htm Global Summary for Decision Makers] Accessed online 23 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Becoming part of government policy ===

In September 2008, [[Ecuador]] became the first country to enshrine food sovereignty in its constitution. As of late 2008, a law is in the draft stages that is expected to expand upon this constitutional provision by banning [[genetically modified organism]]s, protecting many areas of the country from extraction of non-renewable resources, and to discourage [[monoculture]]. The law as drafted will also protect [[biodiversity]] as collective [[intellectual property]] and recognize the [[Rights of Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;Karla Peña, "Opening the Door to Food Sovereignty in Ecuador, ''Food First News &amp; Views'' (Institute for Food and Development Policy), Winter 2008, Volume 30, Number 111, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then another five countries have integrated food sovereignty into their national constitutions or laws. These countries are [[Venezuela]], [[Mali]], [[Bolivia]], [[Nepal]] and [[Senegal]]; and most recently Egypt (2014 Constitution). &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Wittman, Annette Desmarais &amp; Nettie Wiebe "Food Sovereignty - Reconnecting Food, Nature and Community" (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Food sovereignty in Europe ===

In 2011 more than 400 people from 34 European countries met from the 16th to 21 August in [[Krems (Lower Austria)|Krems]], Austria, to plan the development of a European movement for food sovereignty. The meeting included people from the Atlantic to the Urals and Caucasus, as well as from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. These people included international representatives from diverse social movements and civil society organisations.

By coming together they aimed to build on the foundations of the [[Mali forum]] in 2007. The objectives were to strengthen local involvement; build a sense of common purpose and understanding; create a joint agenda for action; celebrate the struggle for food sovereignty in Europe; and inspire and motivate people and organisations to work together.

The forum, which was organised on the principles of [[participation (decision making)|participation]] and [[consensus decision making]], used methods to avoid [[institution]]alised prejudices that are inherent in society (such as [[gender]], [[Ageing|age]], [[language]], [[Employment|occupation]]). It did this by making a concerted effort to allow for all sections of society to be included in the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globaljustice.org.uk/blog/2011/aug/19/towards-democratic-inclusive-participatory-and-fun-structure-all-events-explanation|title=Towards a democratic, inclusive, participatory and fun structure in all events: An explanation of the Nyeleni structure|last=Iles|first=Dan|date=19 August 2011 |website=globaljustice.org.uk|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forum allowed producers and activists from projects across Europe to share skills, coordinate actions and discuss perspectives. The forum culminated in the [[Nyéléni]] declaration.&lt;"Nyeleni Europe declaration"&gt;[http://nyelenieurope.net/publications/nyeleni-europe-declaration-2011]

Since 2011 Europe-wide gatherings and actions have continued, including the [[Good Food March]], where citizens, youth and farmers came together to call for a greener and fairer agricultural policy in Europe, as well as democratic reform of Europe’s Common Agricultural Policy.

== Food sovereignty versus food security ==

Food sovereignty was born in response to campaigners' disillusion with [[food security]], the dominant global discourse on food provisioning and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beuchelt|first=Tina D|last2=Virchow|first2=Detlef|date=2012|title=Food sovereignty or the human right to adequate food: which concept serves better as international development policy for global hunger and poverty reduction?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-012-9355-0|journal=Agriculture and Human Values|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=259–273|doi=10.1007/s10460-012-9355-0|issn=0889-048X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter emphasises access to adequate nutrition for all, which may be provided by food from one's own country or from global imports. In the name of efficiency and enhanced productivity, it has therefore served to promote what has been termed the "corporate food regime":&lt;ref name=McMichael2009/&gt; large-scale, industrialised [[corporate farming]] based on specialised production, [[Land reform|land concentration]] and [[trade liberalisation]].  Food security’s inattention to the political economy of the corporate food regime blinds it to the adverse effects of that regime, notably the widespread dispossession of small producers and global [[Environmental degradation|ecological degradation]].

[[Haiti]] can be seen as a case study. [[Human migration|Migration]] from the [[rural|countryside]] to [[cities]] has reflected a transition from [[subsistence agriculture]] to [[factory]] labor. Farmers were forced to make this move because of heavy imports of "Miami rice", with which their natively-grown [[rice]] could not compete in the [[Local food|local market]]. By 2008, Haiti was importing 80 percent of its rice, leaving them extremely vulnerable to price and supply fluctuations. When the price of rice did triple in 2008, many Haitians could not afford to buy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leonard|first=Annie|title=The Story of Stuff|year=2010|publisher=Free Press|isbn=9781439125663|pages=137–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in [[Food First]]'s ''Backgrounder'', fall 2003, Peter Rosset argues that "food sovereignty goes beyond the concept of ''food security''... [Food security] means that... [everyone] must have the certainty of having enough to eat each day[,] ... but says nothing about where that food comes from or how it is produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rosset|first=Peter |date=1 October 2003 |title=Food Sovereignty Global Rallying Cry of Farmer Movements |url=https://foodfirst.org/publication/food-sovereignty-global-rallying-cry-of-farmer-movements/|magazine=Food First Backgrounder |volume=9|issue=4|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food sovereignty includes support for smallholders and for collectively owned farms, fisheries, etc., rather than industrializing these sectors in a minimally regulated global economy. In another publication, Food First describes "food sovereignty" as "a platform for rural revitalization at a global level based on [[wikt:equal|equitable]] distribution of farmland and water, farmer control over [[seed saving|seeds]], and productive small-scale farms supplying consumers with healthy, locally grown food."&lt;ref name=FoodFirst /&gt;

[[Food Justice|Food justice]] is a similar concept, but its discourses focuses more on race and class inequities and their relation to food, whereas food sovereignty refers more so to agency over food production systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clendenning|first=Jessica|last2=Dressler|first2=Wolfram H.|last3=Richards|first3=Carol|date=2016-03-01|title=Food justice or food sovereignty?

=== Criticisms of the Green Revolution ===

The [[Green Revolution]] is upheld by some proponents of food security as a success story in increasing crop yields and combating world hunger. However, many in the food sovereignty movement are critical of the green revolution and accuse those who advocate it as following too much of a [[Western culture]] [[technocratic]] program that is out of touch with the needs of majority of small producers and [[peasants]].

The ‘green revolution’ refers to developments in [[plant breeding]] between the 1960s and 1980s that improved yields from major [[cereal]] crops, particularly [[wheat]] and [[rice]], and other staple crops. The main focus was on the research, development and transfer of agricultural technology, such as [[hybrid seeds]] and [[fertilisers]], through massive private and public investment that went into transforming agriculture in a number of countries, starting in [[Mexico]] and [[India]].

While the green revolution may have produced more food, [[world hunger]] continues because it did not address the problems of [[Access (economics)|access]].&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth International (2005) Nature: poor people’s wealth - the importance of natural resources in poverty eradication. Amsterdam: FOEI&lt;/ref&gt; Food sovereignty advocates argue that the green revolution failed to alter the highly concentrated distribution of [[economic power]], and if anything, exacerbated it – particularly access to land and [[purchasing power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timmermann|first=Cristian|last2=Félix|first2=Georges F.|last3=Tittonell|first3=Pablo|date=2018|title=Food sovereignty and consumer sovereignty: Two antagonistic goals?|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21683565.2017.1359807|journal=Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=274–298|doi=10.1080/21683565.2017.1359807|issn=2168-3565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics argue that globally the green revolution caused vast environmental destruction though the increased use of herbicides which caused dramatic loss in biodiversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There was also a loss of [[traditional knowledge]] as farmers relied more heavily of biotechnological inputs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Green Revolution|green revolution]] favored wealthy, large scale farmers and forced many smaller, poorer farmers into debt.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alteri|first=Miguel|year=2009|title=Agroecology, Small Farms, and Food Sovereignty|url=|journal=ProQuest|volume=102-113.|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these views are supported by the [[World Bank]]- and UN-sponsored [[IAASTD]] report.&lt;ref&gt;Greenpeace (2008) The World Agriculture Report 2008: Results and Recommendations. Amsterdam: Greenpeace&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Practical Action (2010) Securing Future Food: a summary of the IAASTD findings and their implementation... or not ! Rugby: Practical Action.&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on technology paid no regard to who controlled that technology and ignored the knowledge of the people who were expected to adopt it. Results included significant [[biodiversity loss]] due to the mass adoption of hybrid seeds and [[soil erosion]]{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

The adoption of [[genetically modified]] (GMOs) cropping by the government of [[Western Australia]] in 2010 and the subsequent failure of crop segregation has led to the contamination of at least one organic farm by [[Monsanto]]'s [[Genetic modification|GM]] [[canola]].&lt;ref name=gmcanola&gt;Paull, John (2015) [https://www.academia.edu/13681599/The_threat_of_genetically_modified_organisms_GMOs_to_organic_agriculture_A_case_study_update The threat of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to organic agriculture: A case study update], Agriculture &amp; Food, 3: 56-63.&lt;/ref&gt; The organic certification of the [[certified organic]] farm of Steve and Sue Marsh was withdrawn in 2010 due to [[Genetic modification|GM]] [[contamination]].&lt;ref name="gmcanola"/&gt; A court case in the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] for [[nuisance]] and [[negligence]] failed to achieve any relief or protection for the organic farm.&lt;ref name="gmcanola"/&gt; However, the [[organic certification]] of the Marsh farm was reinstated in 2013.&lt;ref name="gmcanola"/&gt;

== Academic perspectives ==

=== Food Regime theory ===

It is in its capacity as a [[social movement]] that [[Food regimes|food regime]] analysts are interested in food sovereignty.  With its [[Marxist]] influences, food regime theorists are interested in how moments of crisis within a particular food regime are expressive of the [[dialectical]] tension that animates movement between such configurations (i.e., periods of transition).  According to leading theorist Philip McMichael, food regimes are always characterised by contradictory forces.  Consolidation of a regime does not so much resolve as it does contain, or else strategically accommodate, these tensions; meanwhile, their intensification, often via the mobilisations of social movements, often signals a period of transition.

According to McMichael, a "world agriculture" under the WTO [[Agreement on Agriculture]] ("food from nowhere") represents one pole of the "central contradiction" of the present regime.  He is interested in the food sovereignty movement’s potential to escalate the tension between this and its opposing pole, the [[agroecology]]-based [[localism (politics)|localism]] ("food from somewhere") advocated by various [[grassroots]] food movements.&lt;ref name=McMichael2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMichael|first=Philip|title=A food regime genealogy|journal=[[Journal of Peasant Studies]]|date=January 2009|volume=36|issue=1|pages=139–169| doi=10.1080/03066150902820354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offering slightly different conclusions, recent work by Harriet Friedmann suggests that "food from somewhere" is already being co-opted under an emergent "corporate-environmental" regime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedmann|first=Harriet|title=From colonialism to green capitalism: social movements and the emergence of food regimes|journal=New directions in the sociology of global development.|year=2005|volume=11|series=Research in rural sociology and development|pages=229–67|editor1-first=F.H|editor1-last=Buttel|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (cf.

Some scholars argue that the Food Sovereignty movement follows wrong baseline assumptions (small-scale farming is not necessarily a freely chosen life-style and farmers in least developed and highly developed countries do not face the same challenges). The Food Sovereignty movement may be right about the mistakes of [[neoliberal]] economic ideology, but it is silent about the fact that many [[famine]]s actually occurred under socialist and communist regimes that pursued the goal of food self-sufficiency (cf. Aerni 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aerni|first=Philipp|year=2011|title=Food Sovereignty and its Discontents|journal=ATDF Journal|volume=8|issue=1/2|pages=23–39}}[http://www.atdforum.org/spip.php?article454].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Political-jurisdictional model ====

There is a lack of consensus within the food sovereignty movement regarding the political or [[jurisdictional]] community at which its calls for [[democratisation]] and renewed "agrarian citizenship" (cf. Wittman 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wittman|first=Hannah|title=Reworking the metabolic rift: Via Campesina, agrarian citizenship, and food sovereignty|journal=[[Journal of Peasant Studies]]|year=2009|volume=36|issue=4|pages=805–826|doi=10.1080/03066150903353991}}&lt;/ref&gt; are directed.  In public statements, the food sovereignty movement urges for strong [[Sovereignty|sovereign powers]] for both national governments and local communities (in the vein of the [[Indigenous rights|indigenous rights movement]], [[Natural resource management#Community based natural resource management|Community-Based Natural Resource Management]] (CBNRM) and the like) (elsewhere it has also appealed to global [[civil society]] to act as a check against abuses by national and supranational governing bodies).

Those who take a radically critical view on state sovereignty would argue against the possibility that national sovereignty can be reconciled with that of local communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Mick|title=Against ecological sovereignty: Agamben, politics and globalisation|journal=Environmental politics|year=2009|volume=18|issue=1|pages=99–116|doi=10.1080/09644010802624843}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also the debate about multiculturalism and indigenous autonomy in Mexico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aida Hernandez|first=J|title=Indigenous law and identity politics in Mexico: indigenous men's and women's struggles for a multicultural nation|journal=PoLAR|date=May 2002|volume=25|issue=1|pages=90–109|doi=10.1525/pol.2002.25.1.90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stolle-McAllister|first=J|title=What does democracy look like?: local movements challenge the Mexican transition|journal=Latin American Perspectives|year=2005|volume=32|issue=15|pages=15–35|doi=10.1177/0094582x05278141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilbert|first=Sarah|title=For whom the nation? Internationalization, Zapatismo, and the struggle over Mexican modernity|journal=Antipode|year=1997|volume=29|issue=2|pages=115–148|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00039}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).  On the other hand, [[Raj Patel]] is more favourable towards this prospect: for Patel, an adapted version of [[Seyla Benhabib]]’s [[Kantian]]-inspired cosmopolitan [[federalism]] – involving multiple, layered geographies of democratic attachment and jurisdiction – could offer a promising vehicle for the realisation of food sovereignty on a large scale.  Patel’s important proviso here is that a stronger version of Benhabib’s accompanying principle of [[moral universalism]] is also pursued.  By Patel’s assessment, the food sovereignty movement is showing promising signs of moving towards the radical egalitarianism and democratic [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] that such a model entails.

==== Crisis of the peasantry? ====

In its strong reassertion of rural and peasant identities and forms of social reproduction, the food sovereignty movement has been read as a sharp challenge to modernist narratives of inexorable [[urbanisation]], [[Industrial agriculture|industrialisation of agriculture]] and de-peasantisation.  However, as part of ongoing debates over the contemporary relevance of the "agrarian question" in classical Marxism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haroon Akram-Lodhi|first=A|title=Peasants and globalization: political economy, rural transformation and the agrarian question|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|author2=Kay, C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Araghi|first=Farshad|title=Global depeasantisation, 1945-1990|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|year=1995|volume=36|issue=2|pages=337–368|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1995.tb00443.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Bernstein is critical of these largely celebratory accounts.  Specifically, levels Bernstein, such analyses tend to present the agrarian population as a unified, singular and world-historical social category.  Therefore, they fail to account, in any more than a gestural manner, for:
* this population’s vast internal social differentiation (North/South, gender and class positionalities);
* the conservative, cultural survivalist tendencies of a movement that has emerged as part of a backlash against the perceived homogenising forces of [[globalisation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=Henry|title=Agrarian questions from transition to globalization|journal=Peasants and globalization: political economy, rural transformation and the agrarian question|year=2009|editor1-first=Haroon Akram-Lodhi|editor1-last=A|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Boyer discusses whether food sovereignty is a counter or anti-development narrative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyer|first=Jefferson|title=Food security, food sovereignty, and local challenges for agrarian movements: the Honduras case|journal=[[Journal of Peasant Studies]]|year=2010|volume=37|issue=2|pages=319–351|doi=10.1080/03066151003594997}}&lt;/ref&gt; )
In so doing, these accounts cannot escape a certain [[Populism#Styles and methods#Agrarian|agrarian populism]] (or [[agrarianism]]) according to Bernstein (for a response to Bernstein, see McMichael (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMichael|first=Philip|title=Food sovereignty, social reproduction and the agrarian question|journal=Peasants and globalization: political economy, rural transformation and the agrarian question.|year=2009|pages=288–312|editor1-first=Haroon Akram-Lodhi|editor1-last=A|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Home price protection is an agreement that pays the homeowner if a particular home price index declines in value over a period of time after the protection is purchased. The protection is for a new or existing homeowner that wishes to protect the value of their home from future market declines.

== Scholarly research ==
In 1999, [[Robert J. Shiller]] and [[Alan N. Weiss]] published an overview of the idea. Two similar programs had been tried in Illinois by municipalities: a 1978 [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] plan, which had never had a claim as of 1999, and a broader program covering the city of Chicago passed by voter referendum in 1987 and implemented in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Shiller RJ, Weiss AN. (1999). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007779229387 Home equity insurance]. ''The Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics''. [https://korora.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p10a/p1007.pdf Free full-text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another program was initiated 2002 as several scholars at Yale University&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://icf.som.yale.edu/home_equity.shtml | title=Yale University Home Equity Protection study |work=Yale School of Management | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507035251/http://icf.som.yale.edu/home_equity.shtml | archivedate=2008-05-07 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; worked in conjunction with a program in Syracuse, NY, which was developed with the intent of increasing home ownership in neighborhoods on the verge of collapse that were marred by ever declining home prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2002/08/28/0829whynot.html |title=Price Protect Your Home |date=2002-08-29 |work=[[Forbes.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syracuse non-profit program, called Home Headquarters, was sponsored by the Syracuse Neighborhood Initiative, and a homeowner could protect the value of their home for a one-time fee of 1.5% of the home's value. In many cases, a local organization would pay the fee for the homeowner if they agreed to live in the home for 3 years. Similar programs were developed in other municipalities to encourage home ownership in specific areas that were considered to be at risk of losing home value due to increased rental conversions and other factors.

On December 4, 2008 at the height of the real estate crisis Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested that what the real estate market needed to recover was a hedge to restore confidence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Hedging==
Any protection contract is essentially providing a hedge to the owner against declining home prices. The provider (protection seller) of the contract will generally have a significant reserve in place and will also hedge their risk using housing futures from the CBOE [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] &amp; CME [[Chicago Board of Trade]] and other real estate short strategies to help mitigate losses.  Some providers utilize reinsurance from A rated carriers to provide more durable secondary risk protection.

==Payouts==
Losses are generally measured by a nationally recognized [[house price index]] such as [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight]] (OFHEO), [[Radar Logic]], [[First American Core Logic]], or the S&amp;P [[Case-Shiller index]].

==Differences from insurance==
Most home equity protection products are not insurance and do not require an insurable interest from the buyer of protection, however some providers offer an insurance version of the product.

==Swaps==
There are some similarities with [[Swap (finance)|swaps]], particularly [[total return swap]] and [[credit default swap]]s.

== Vendors ==
Companies offering the product include EquityLock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Preserving Hope for Homeowners: EquityLock Extends a Lifeline for Real Estate|url = http://rismedia.com/2011-12-08/preserving-hope-for-homeowners-equitylock-extends-a-lifeline-for-real-estate/|website = rismedia.com|access-date = 2016-01-17|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alternatively, it is possible to hedge the risk of a housing price decline using Case-Shiller Futures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Buying A Home In Today's Market: Reduce Your Risk Exposure|url = https://homeecblog.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/buying-a-home-in-todays-market/|website = HomeEconomics|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hedging the Value of a Home with S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Futures|url = http://cleanenergywonk.com/2010/08/30/hedging-the-value-of-a-home-with-spcase-shiller-futures/|website = Clean Energy Wonk|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waiting periods are required in many of the programs to prevent the owner of the home price protection agreement from [[gaming the system]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The protection generally covers all sales to unrelated parties including short sales but will not cover foreclosures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The '''Institute of the Czech Language''' ({{lang-cs|Ústav pro jazyk český}}, ''ÚJČ'') is a scientific institution dedicated to the study of the [[Czech language]]. It is one of the institutes of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]]. Its headquarters are in [[Prague]] and it has a branch in [[Brno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Information|url=http://www.ujc.cas.cz/index.html|work=Institute of the Czech Language|publisher=Ústav pro jazyk český AV ČR|accessdate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Czech Republic, the institute is widely accepted as the regulatory body of the Czech language. Its recommendations on [[Standard language|standard]] [[Czech language|Czech]] ({{lang|cs|spisovná čeština}}) are viewed as binding by the educational system, newspapers and others, although this has no legal basis.

The institute's rich publishing activity has two main branches, firstly scientific monographies, magazines ({{lang|cs|Naše řeč}}, {{lang|cs|Slovo a slovesnost}}) and articles, that could be viewed as conversation between [[Czech studies|bohemists]] themselves, discussing matters of the Czech language. Secondly, what could be considered output of these discussions, is a consistent set of rules on vocabulary, grammar and orthography. Of the recommendations published most weight carry those, to which the institute itself assigns "[[Codification (linguistics)|codification]] status":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O slovnících|url=http://lexiko.ujc.cas.cz/index.php?page=3|work=LEXIKO|publisher=Ústav pro jazyk český AV ČR|accessdate=24 December 2012|date=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; monolingual dictionaries of the Czech language, ''Slovník spisovného jazyka českého'' and ''Slovník spisovné češtiny pro školu a veřejnost'', and the grammar manual ''Pravidla českého pravopisu''. The recommendations published in new editions of these are usually subsequently accepted by a ministry of education to be used in schools. The publication of new editions has often been a source of heated debate and national controversy, as recently as 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vašíčková|first=Eva|title=GLOSA: Po prudkých bojích jazykovědců potichu přijdou změny|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/glosa-po-prudkych-bojich-jazykovedcu-potichu-prijdou-zmeny-pl0-/domaci.aspx?c=A110804_104418_domaci_brd|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=iDNES.cz|date=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach of the institute is decidedly [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]], in that it leaves uncodified all [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] other than standard, such as [[common Czech]] spoken by many Czechs.&lt;ref&gt;For context, see e.g. [[List of language regulators#cite note-1|note]] quoted in [[List of language regulators]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was created in 1946, by transformation of the former Office for the Czech Lexicon ({{lang|cs|Kancelář Slovníku jazyka českého}}), founded in 1911 by the former Czech Academy of Sciences and Arts. In 1953 it became a part of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and became a public research institution in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of the Czech Language of the ASCR, v. v. i.|url=http://www.avcr.cz/o_avcr/struktura/pracoviste/humanitni/UJC.html|work=Academy of Sciences of the Czech republic|publisher=Centre of Administration and Operations of the ASCR|accessdate=24 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420204330/http://avcr.cz/o_avcr/struktura/pracoviste/humanitni/UJC.html|archivedate=20 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been unsuccessful attempts to enshrine the position of the Czech language and its minders in legislation, akin to the [[Language law of Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psp.cz/sqw/historie.sqw?o=4&amp;T=485 Sněmovní tisk 485 - Novela z. Ústava České republiky]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Keep Left''''' was a pamphlet published in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1947 by the ''[[New Statesman]]'' that was written by [[Michael Foot]], [[Richard Crossman]] and [[Ian Mikardo]]. It advocated a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] "third force" foreign policy, a socialist Europe acting independently from either the [[United States]] or the [[Soviet Union]], against the pro-American foreign policy of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|foreign secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]]. ''Keep Left'' was a key statement of the Labour left's dissent from the [[1945-51 Labour government]].

'''Klara air raid shelter''' ({{lang-sv|Klara skyddsrum}}), also known as the '''Klara bunker''', is one of [[Stockholm]]'s major civil [[air raid shelter]]s, with an area of 6,650 m². The shelter is designed for civilians and members of government, and is located in central Stockholm. The shelter was built during the [[Cold War]], in the 1960s, as central Stockholm was being reformed during the "[[Redevelopment of Norrmalm]]". Klara shelter is named after the nearby [[Klara Church]].

The air raid shelter complex is designed to protect large parts of the government and civilian population of the city in the case of a military attack on Stockholm. The facility is still shelter-rated, and additionally provides 296 parking spaces, primarily for long-term parking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insyn.stockholm.se/insynTransFrame.aspx?id=19&amp;nodeid=342816 |title=Överföring av garage från fastighetsnämnden till Stockholms Stads Parkerings AB.

The basic design of the complex is a two-story oval, situated below [[Sergels torg]] (Sergel's Square), [[Klara Church]], and adjacent areas, with multiple entrances. The shelter can accommodate 8,000 people in time of war or other danger. The machine room includes five large generators. In the case of failure of the civil power grid, these units could generate enough energy to power and light the entire complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=103&amp;artikel=1857515 |title=Brist på skyddsrum i Stockholms län |trans-title=Lack of shelters in Stockholm County |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |date=28 January 2008 |access-date=29 March 2016 |language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; If war had broken out between the 1960s-1980s, two thirds of the Parliament and Government members would have been housed in a separate part of Klara shelters, while the third would be sent to a rock shelter elsewhere.

The shelter has several entrances and escape routes. Beside the entrance to the building, a ramp provides vehicle access to the parking area, from which the shelter can be reached through an understated access door (see photo, right). Partway down the stairs (which are removable) leading from [[Drottninggatan]] to the "plate" in Sergel's Square, there is another entrance. Additional entrances are from the old subway entrance next to Klara Church, which has been converted to lead straight down to the shelter, from [[T-Centralen]] (the T-Centre Metro station), from the parking garages around the [[Klara (Stockholm)|Klara district]], and from the [[Kungsträdgården metro station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://altsthlm.wikispaces.com/Klara+skyddsrum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202081021/http://altsthlm.wikispaces.com/Klara+skyddsrum |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-02 |title=Klara skyddsrum |publisher=Wikispaces |language=sv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large parts of the shelter are used in peacetime as parking garages, for example Vattugaraget at Vattugatan.

Access is via staircases about 10 meters wide, currently blocked by removable walls and protected by 70-ton steel doors. To keep the air temperature bearable during protection operations (15,000 people producing a lot of heat), there is a large [[air conditioning]] plant.

This is a list of [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Community|communities]] representing any society or portion thereof founded by anarchists that functions according to anarchist philosophy and principles. Anarchists have been involved in a wide variety of community experiments since the 19th century. There are numerous instances in which a community organizes itself along philosophically anarchist lines to promote [[List of anarchist movements by region|regional anarchist movements]], [[counter-economics]] and [[counterculture]]s. These have included [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] founded by anarchists as [[social experiment]]s and community oriented projects, such as [[collective]] organizations and [[cooperative]] businesses. There are also several instances of [[mass society]] "[[anarchy|anarchies]]" that have come about from explicitly anarchist [[revolution]]s, including the [[Free Territory]] of Ukraine&lt;ref name="Skirda" /&gt; and the [[Shinmin Prefecture|Shinmin autonomous region]] in Manchuria.&lt;ref name="Shinmin" /&gt; As well as these countries : Switzerland Norway Germany Israel America and turkey

===1903===

* Magician and inventor [[Nevil Maskelyne (magician)|Nevil Maskelyne]] disrupts [[John Ambrose Fleming]]'s public demonstration of [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s purportedly secure [[wireless telegraphy]] technology, sending insulting [[Morse code]] messages through the auditorium's projector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marks |first=Paul |title=Dot-dash-diss: The gentleman hacker's 1903 lulz |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228440-700-dot-dash-diss-the-gentleman-hackers-1903-lulz/ |accessdate=January 11, 2012 |newspaper=New Scientist |date=December 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1930s==

===1932===
* Polish cryptologists [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Henryk Zygalski]] and [[Jerzy Różycki]] broke the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma machine]] code.

===1939===
* [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]] and [[Harold Keen]] worked together to develop the [[Bombe]] (on the basis of Rejewski's works on [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]]). The [[Enigma machine]]'s use of a reliably small key space makes it vulnerable to brute force.

==1940s==
===1943===
* [[René Carmille]], [[comptroller]] general of the Vichy [[French Army]], hacked the [[punched card]] system used by the Nazis to locate Jews.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis |first=Amanda |url=http://theinstitute.ieee.org/technology-focus/technology-history/a-history-of-hacking |title=A History of Hacking - IEEE - The Institute |website=Theinstitute.ieee.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* William D. Mathews from [[MIT]] found a vulnerability in a '''[[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]]''' running on an [[IBM 7094]]. The standard text editor on the system was designed to be used by one user at a time, working in one directory, and so created a temporary file with a constant name for all instantiations of the editor.

===1967===

* The first known incidence of network penetration hacking took place when members of a computer club at a suburban Chicago area high school were provided access to IBM's [[APL (programming language)|APL]] network. In the Fall of 1967, IBM (through [[Science Research Associates]]) approached [[Evanston Township High School]] with the offer of four [[IBM 2741|2741 Selectric teletypewriter]] based terminals with dial-up modem connectivity to an experimental computer system which implemented an early version of the APL programming language.  The APL network system was structured in Workspaces which were assigned to various clients using the system. Working independently, the students quickly learned the language and the system. They were free to explore the system, often using existing code available in public Workspaces as models for their own creations. Eventually, curiosity drove the students to explore the system's wider context. This first informal network penetration effort was later acknowledged as helping harden the security of one of the first publicly accessible networks:   “Science Research Associates undertook to write a full APL system for the [[IBM 1500]]. They modeled their system after [[APL\360|APL/360]], which had by that time been developed and seen substantial use inside of IBM, using code borrowed from MAT/1500 where possible. In their documentation they acknowledge their gratitude to “a number of high school students for their compulsion to bomb the system.” 30 This was an early example of a kind of sportive, but very effective, debugging that was often repeated in the evolution of APL systems.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falkoff|first=A.

The '''Azerbaijan Ministry of National Security''' ('''MNS''', [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: Milli Təhlukəsizlik Nazirliyi) was an [[intelligence agency]] within the [[cabinet of Azerbaijan]]. The MNS was a central executive authority that carried out the competencies designated to it by the legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan in the field of obtaining and analyzing information about foreign affairs, [[corporation]]s, individuals. The MNS also carried out intelligence, [[Counterintelligence|counter-intelligence]], protection of state secrets, revealing, preventing, precluding and detection of crimes. On 14 December 2015, President [[Ilham Aliyev]] signed a decree dissolving the ministry and creating a National Security Service with domestic duties and a foreign intelligence service.

==History==
Ministry of National Security of [[Azerbaijan]] was established on the material-technical and personnel basis of the Soviet [[KGB|Committee of State Security]] (KGB) on November 1, 1991. Within a short period of time, representatives of other nationalities had left the Ministry and Azerbaijan, the process of staffing Ministry only by the national specialists had begun. Not only the name and the personnel of the security body had changed, but primary change the Ministry faced was its mission and duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mns.gov.az/historymns_en.html The history of the security bodies of Azerbaijan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830072006/http://www.mns.gov.az/historymns_en.html |date=2009-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
The Ministry was guided by the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the laws of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the decrees of President, the decisions and decrees of the Cabinet of Ministers, the international treaties of which Azerbaijan was a part, its statute, and other normative-legal acts of the MNS.

The MNS headquarters were in the following cities:
*[[Baku]]
*[[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]
*[[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]]

==Current MNS cases==
* In 2008, the MNS arrested a dozen of [[Al-Qaeda]] members who were involved in terrorist attack on Abu Bakr Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.az/news/society/53421.html “Forest brothers” group accused in terrorist attack on Abu Bakr Mosque go on trial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cacianalyst.org/?q=node/4944/print Azerbaijan security officers arrest 18 suspects in Baku mosque explosion]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign ties==
The MNS has ties to several [[foreign intelligence]] agencies including [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]], [[Mossad]] and others.&lt;ref name="info"&gt;[http://www.agentura.ru/dossier/azer/ Спецслужбы Азербайджана] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225130726/http://www.agentura.ru/dossier/azer/ |date=2010-02-25 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minnie M. Kenny''' (1929–August 17, 2005) was a [[cryptanalyst]], educator and equal opportunity activist who worked at the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). She served as Deputy Commandant at the [[National Cryptologic School]] and was responsible for creating scholarships for NSA employees. The recipient of numerous awards, including the Meritorious and the Exceptional Civilian Service Awards, the presidential Meritorious Executive Award and Distinguished Service Award of the CIA, Kenny was inducted into the [[NSA Hall of Honor|Cryptologic Hall of Honor]] in 2009.

==Biography==
Minnie McNeal was born in 1929 in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Roelofsma|2005}} After graduating from the [[Philadelphia High School for Girls]], she worked for the Philadelphia Commerce Department and the [[United States Census Bureau]] in [[Washington, D. C.]], before being hired in 1951 to work at [[Arlington Hall]] for the [[United States Army Security Agency|Army Security Agency]]. She was part of the first group of [[African Americans]] who were allowed to work upstairs in the Operations Division, out of the basement, and was assigned to the 'U' Street School for training.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}} After her training and the change of the organization from military footing to the [[National Security Agency]] in 1952, McNeal was assigned as a communications clerk to the ALLO (All Other (non-Soviet)) linguistics unit.{{sfn|National Security Agency|1/2009}} She was particularly well known for her expertise in cryptanalysis, language and traffic analysis and worked with an elite "think tank" at NSA, to develop programs for [[cryptanalysis]] and language, serving as chair of the agency's Language Panel.{{sfn|National Security Agency|12/2009}} In 1972, McNeal married Herbert Cornelius Kenny, one of the singers of [[The Ink Spots]], with whom she had a daughter Daphne.{{sfn|''The Washington Post''|1992}}

In 1973, Kenny became the founding editor of NSA's Group B journal ''Dragon Seeds'' and pressed for each cryptanalyst to have their own personal computer as a necessary tool.{{sfn|Kenny|1978|p=11}} From 1975 to 1981, she served in the Office of Techniques and Standards of the NSA, as the chief of the language and linguistics.{{sfn|Stokes|1993}} In 1980, she was the recipient of the Meritorious Civilian Service Award.{{sfn|National Security Agency|1/2009}} Beginning in 1982,{{sfn|Stokes|1993}} Kenny served as Deputy Commandant at the National Cryptologic School,{{sfn|National Security Agency|12/2009}} and worked with traditional Black colleges and universities to increase diversity.{{sfn|Roelofsma|2005}} She introduced computer assisted teaching techniques and founded the Computer Assisted Learning and Instruction Consortium (CALICO) to bring professional language teachers and those who use language together in an international association.{{sfn|Stokes|1993}} In 1984, Kenny was awarded a second civilian honor, the Exceptional Civilian Service Award by the NSA and both presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] awarded her with the Meritorious Executive Award. After a decade working to improve the school, Kenny served on the Department of Defense Congressional Task Force on Women, Minorities, and the Handicapped in Science and Technology and as the NSA Director for Equal Employment Opportunity, before her 1993 retirement. She was a recipient of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s Distinguished Service Award.{{sfn|National Security Agency|1/2009}}

Kenny then served as a Congressional Fellow on the staff of Congressman [[Louis Stokes]] and worked on the drafting of the Underground Railroad Act{{sfn|Roelofsma|2005}} of 1997, which was designed to preserve and protect the history of significant buildings associated with the [[Underground Railroad|historic organization]].{{sfn|Larkin|1997}}

Kenny died August 17, 2005, in [[Columbia, Maryland]], and was buried at St. John's Cemetery in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]].{{sfn|''The Baltimore Sun''|2005}} Posthumously, in 2009, she was inducted into the [[NSA Hall of Honor|Cryptologic Hall of Honor]].

'''Missing Middle Housing''' consists of multi-unit housing types such as [[duplex (building)|duplexes]], fourplexes, [[bungalow court]]s, and mansion apartments that are not bigger than a large house, that are integrated throughout most walkable pre-1940s [[neighborhoods]], often integrated into blocks with primarily single-family homes, and that provide diverse [[housing]] choices and generate enough density to support transit and locally-serving commercial amenities. Although many of these are a common feature in pre-war building stocks, these housing types have become much less common (hence the “missing”). The term was coined by architect and urban planner Daniel Parolek, Principal and Founder of Opticos Design, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parolek|first1=Daniel|title=Missing Middle Housing: Responding to the Demand for Walkable Urban Living|url=http://www.smartgrowth.org/nationalconversation/compendium/12_Parolek_Missing_Middle_Housing_020713.pdf|website=www.smartgrowth.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310015016/http://www.smartgrowth.org/nationalconversation/compendium/12_Parolek_Missing_Middle_Housing_020713.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The [[AARP|American Association for Retired Persons]] recently released a new report, which showed that more and more, Americans want to “age in place,” and need easy access to services and amenities available in walkable, urban, transit-oriented communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aging U.S. Population Boosts Demand for Missing Middle Housing|url=http://opticosdesign.com/growing-missing-middle-housing-demand-among-u-s-aging-population/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millennials have also been shown to drive less, and seek housing choices in walkable neighborhoods close to transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toppo|first1=Greg|title=Rocking the walking: Millennials drive new urban spaces|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/17/walkable-urban-places-findings/10623587/|website=USA Today|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of automobile miles traveled increased each year between 1946 and 2004; today Americans drive less than 2004, and no more per person than in 1996. The decline in driving is most striking among young people aged 16 to 34, who drove 23% fewer miles on average in 2009 than their age group did in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Patrick J.|title=U.S. Temporary Housing Trend: Millennials and the "Walkable Urban Neighborhood|url=http://www.bristolglobal.com/u-s-temporary-housing-trend-millennials-and-the-walkable-urban-neighborhood/|website=Bristol Global|accessdate=June 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120095859/http://www.bristolglobal.com/u-s-temporary-housing-trend-millennials-and-the-walkable-urban-neighborhood/#|archive-date=2014-11-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Millennials prefer amenity rich housing choices. These amenities are within walking distance,” presented Howard Ways of the Redevelopment Authority of Prince George's County in Washington D.C. “They prefer smaller units with open floor plans and are not interested in yard work at all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yung|first1=John|title=APA14: Demographic Preferences Shifting in Favor of Walkable, Urban Communities|url=http://www.urbancincy.com/2014/04/apa14-demographic-preferences-shifting-in-favor-of-walkable-urban-communities/|website=UrbanCincy|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“There’s a convergence of the demand created by Baby Boomers who are moving back, not just into city centers but into surrounding single-family neighborhoods, and the Millennials who want walkable urban living. The demand is just going to continue to grow," said Dan Parolek in an article on the National Association of Realtors website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Gieson|first1=John|title=Mid-Range Density|url=http://www.realtor.org/articles/mid-range-density|website=National Association of Realtors|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; “I find in my development work my primary buyers are empty nester Boomers who are selling the big house, the big lot, the kids are grown and gone, and they’re looking for more lifestyle freedom,” said Linda of The Cottage Company in the same article.

==Characteristics==
{{empty-section|date=May 2015}}

==Benefits==

Missing Middle Housing offers greater choice in housing types that still blend into existing single family neighborhoods, unlike mid-rise apartment buildings. They are typically more affordable than a [[Single-family detached home|single-family home]] because they are smaller and share communal parking and lawns. These building types typically have a residential unit density in the range of 16 to 30 units per acre but are often perceived as being less dense because they are smaller in scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agnew|first1=Spencer|title=CNU 21: Missing Middle Housing|url=http://blogs.stthomas.edu/realestate/2013/06/11/cnu-21-missing-middle-housing/|website=University of St. Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of The Cottage Company's cottage court developments are looking for a detached housing option that is smaller in size and requires less maintenance than a single-family home. The cottage court concept meets that need by grouping several small detached houses around shared lawns and parking. Residents get the benefit of their own detached home, and association fees take care of the lawn and parking maintenance. The most prevalent demographic groups in The Cottage Company's cottage court housing tend to be single women, empty nesters, and young professional couples.

Pursuing these housing types can also offer a financial benefit to developers. In a recent blog post, Daniel Parolek writes that a small infill builder in Norman, OK, recently made the decision to renovate an existing fourplex rather than turning it into a duplex. "He told me that if he had renovated the building into a duplex like he had planned before talking to me, he was expecting to get $600/month per bedroom and each unit would have been three bedrooms for a total of $3,600 in revenue per month for the two units. He was happy to tell me that he is now renting each of the one-bedroom units for $1,000 each for $4,000 in total monthly revenue. That is an 11% increase in monthly revenue! In this one project Keith has blown the top off of this market and is getting $1,000 per bedroom for these small, well-designed micro units located in a walkable context," Parolek wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parolek|first1=Daniel|title=An Important Win for Housing Diversity|url=http://opticosdesign.com/win-housing-diversity/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parolek|first1=Daniel|title=A win for housing diversity|url=http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/blogs/dan-parolek/21476/win-housing-diversity|website=Better Cities &amp; Towns|accessdate=March 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308134742/http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/blogs/dan-parolek/21476/win-housing-diversity#|archive-date=2015-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd Alter of Treehugger says there is a certain amount of density required for building green cities that support transit-oriented development, but that you don't want it to be too dense. "I have made the case that you don't want it too high; that there is a Goldilocks density that's just right. One form of housing that gets close to Goldilocks is the stacked townhouse," he writes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alter|first1=Lloyd|title=Density creeps are coming to a city near you, and that's a good thing.|url=http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/density-creeps-are-coming-city-near-you.html|website=Treehugger|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portland, OR, has a number of historic Missing Middle housing types located throughout the city, most of which are duplexes, that were built before the 1920s before the city's first zoning plan was approved. Zoning for single-family homes was expanded in the 1950s and the building of duplexes or triplexes largely became illegal in Portland. Some local developers are now advocating for these Missing Middle types, saying that they are key to building the bike-friendly neighborhoods Portland is known for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Michael|title=Why are these 11 buildings illegal in most of Portland?|url=http://bikeportland.org/2015/06/19/11-buildings-illegal-portland-144633|website=BikePortland.org|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Security Agency ''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: Agencija za Nacionalnu Bezbjednost; ANB) is the national [[intelligence agency]] of [[Montenegro]]. Its headquarters are located in [[Podgorica]].

According to the law governing ANB, the agency is tasked with collecting, storing, analyzing, assessing, exchanging and guarding 

* Intelligence on activities aimed against independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, security and constitutional order of Montenegro
* Intelligence pertaining to defense interests of Montenegro, and accomplishment of strategic defense goals and interests of Montenegro (intelligence and counterintelligence activities in the defense field)
* Intelligence on terrorism activities 
* Intelligence on organized crime activities
* Intelligence on gravest forms of crimes against humanity and other assets protected by international law
* Intelligence on foreign intelligence assets, when pertaining to Montenegrin national security
* Intelligence on potential threats to Montenegrin economic interests
* Intelligence on potential threats to international security
* Intelligence on other forms of threats to national security of Montenegro

ANB is also responsible for counterintelligence protection of [[Parliament of Montenegro]], [[Government of Montenegro]], [[President of Montenegro]], and other Government bodies and ministries, pertaining to activities significant to security of personnel, buildings and assets of aforementioned institutions.  

==History==

Contemporary history of state intelligence in Montenegro can be traced to 13 May 1944, when [[OZNA]] was formed, as part of [[Yugoslav People's Army]], with  autonomous center of territorial intelligence in Montenegro. OZNA was split from the Army in March 1946, and incorporated in [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Montenegro|Ministry of Interior]], thus becoming civilian intelligence agency. Within the Yugoslav army, [[KOS (Yugoslavia)|KOS]] was formed as military [[counterintelligence]] agency, while civilian branch (now attached to Ministry of Interior) was renamed [[State Security Administration|UDB]].

In May 2005, National Security Agency was formed as a separate Government agency, inheriting the employees and assets from Montenegrin UDB.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3125">'''Negative vote weight''' (also known as ''inverse success value'') refers to an effect that occurs in certain elections where votes can have the opposite effect of what the voter intended.  A vote for a party might result in the loss of seats in parliament, or the party might gain extra seats by not receiving votes.

The effect that a vote for a party might result in the loss of a seat is contrary to the requirement that every vote in a democratic election should have the same weight.  It also violates the requirement that the vote may not explicitly run counter to the intention of the voter.

==Germany==
The phenomenon of negative vote weight occurred in several past federal elections in Germany, including the [[German federal election, 2009|election in 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fruitsandvotes.com/?p=6367#comments]&lt;/ref&gt; The negative vote weight could occur in a state where a party had [[overhang seat]]s. In such states, in many circumstances a vote for a party will not increase its national seat total ([[mixed member proportional representation|MMP]] allocations are calculated at the national level in Germany), but may increase the proportion of the party's national seats to be allocated to the state where it already had overhang seats (overhang seats being allocated at the state level). This effectively decreased the party's total seat count, and a voter would have been better served by not voting for that party.

However, the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] ruled on 3 July 2008 that this was unconstitutional, as a negative vote weight is incompatible with the constitutional guarantee of equality and directness. Accordingly, the election law was changed in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/17/118/1711819.pdf Bill amending the Federal Election Law]. 11 December 2012. Retrieved 25 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ZEIT ONLINE GmbH, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2013-02/bundestag-wahlrecht-beschluss |title=Bundestag: Deutschland hat ein neues Wahlrecht &amp;#124; ZEIT ONLINE |publisher=Zeit.de |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ==
Negative vote weight is possible in national elections in the [[Elections in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]] and [[Elections in Romania|Romania]]. It can also occur in some of the [[Austria]]n states' local elections. In both cases, however, the incidence is lower, and the effect is less pronounced than in Germany.

==Referendums==
Negative vote weight can occur in [[popular referendum]]s that have a vote quorum (where the proposed change is considered only if a minimum number of people vote). A vote ''against'' the proposal can cause the quorum to be satisfied and thus result in the acceptance of the proposal. For this reason, some popular referendums aim for an approving quorum where the proposed change is only considered if a minimum number of people vote ''for'' the proposal.

'''No-cost campaign''' is a term coined initially by a Stanford student. It refers to a [[political campaign]] in which the candidates run without funding. Based on a foundation and the principles of [[Web 2.0]] networking, the original essay analyzes the potential of social networking site [[Digg|Digg.com]]. Because Web 2.0 follows the democratic principle of being powered by the masses, it is a well-suited medium for political campaigning, and could save hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign money.

'''Oleksa Dovbush''' ({{lang-uk|Олекса Довбуш}}) (born 1700, [[Pechenizhyn]] [[Kolomyia]]— died 24 August 1745) was a famous [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] outlaw, leader of opryshky,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opryshky movement in the Carpathians|url=http://wiki-carpathians.com/history/opryshky-carpathians/|publisher=Wiki Carpathians|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became a [[folk hero]], often compared to [[Robin Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;Orest Subtelny, ''Ukraine: A History'', Toronto Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8020-8390-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=Ivan+Boichuk&amp;source=web&amp;ots=0PMXeMoer0&amp;sig=H6OpuelNWRQEYvrO1hzAyAMZn4Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA192,M1 p. 192]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Oleksa was born in the [[Hutsul]] village of [[Pechenizhyn]] in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the early 18th century. He became the leader of his own band that consisted of almost 50 members (''leheni''). Popular tradition portrays him as a protector to the poor people of the region. There are few written references left of him and his activities.

The many folk songs and the few prose legends that still survive in [[Prykarpattia]] portray him as a local hero who robbed the rich and helped the poor [[serfdom|serfs]], like the mythical Robin Hood. His residence is believed to be located near the city of [[Bolekhiv]] in [[Ivano-Frankivsk oblast]]. It is a rock complex that is called the [[Rocks of Dovbush]] which was nominated in the seven historical and seven natural wonders of Ukraine. Dovbush's deeds became so admired that the tales of his acts spread beyond the Hutsul region to the neighboring Pokuttia and Podillya regions of western Ukraine. His portraits were sold at local market places. He was feared by Polish [[szlachta]] (landowning nobility). Once, a military expedition of 2000 soldiers, headed by Polish [[magnate]] [[Józef Potocki]], was sent to stop his activities. Nonetheless, he could not be captured.  Dovbush was shot and mortally wounded by one Stefan, the husband of his lover Dzvinka, in 1745.&lt;ref&gt;http://pisni.org.ua&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hassidic legend, Dovbush at one time hid in the house of [[Baal Shem Tov]] and gave him his pipe as a token of friendship.

==Legacy==
After his death, his legacy was extended by several of his companions and/or people that idolized him: Vasyl Bayurak (a memorial plate is erected in [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] that mentions of his execution), [[Maksym Zalizniak]], [[Ustym Karmaliuk]], and many others.

His legend entered Ukrainian folklore and was the subject of various artistic works, by, among others, the writers [[Ivan Franko]] and [[Yuriy Fedkovych]]. A film was made about him, and there are streets and locations named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4100">The '''''promissione ducale''''' ({{lang-la|promissio domini ducis}}) was an [[oath of office]] sworn by the incoming [[Doge of Venice]]. It contained not only an [[oath of allegiance]] to the [[Republic of Venice]], but also spelled out the constitutional limitations to the Doge's power, which he swore to abide by.

== History ==
The ''promissione'' had its origins in the oaths of office sworn by civil magistrates in the Italian city-states ([[Medieval commune|communes]]), covering both the established legal order, and the exercise of jurisdiction by the magistrates.{{sfn|Leicht|1935}} Thus in Venice too, the [[Doges of Venice]] were accustomed to take such oaths, or ''promissioni'', which covered both matters political as well as matters of [[criminal law]]; the earliest of which is the collection of penal guidelines known as the ''promissione del maleficio'' of [[Orio Mastropiero]] ({{reign|1178|1192}}) in 1181, which was reformed in 1195 under [[Enrico Dandolo]] ({{reign|1192|1205}}).{{sfn|Leicht|1935}}

The political oath of office on the other hand contained a series of promises to govern and adjudicate fairly and impartially, maintain the secrets of the state, execute the deliberations of the [[Great Council of Venice]], etc. At the same time, already in the very first surviving example, that of Doge Dandolo in 1193, it contains a set of restrictions on the Doge's power, such as a prohibition on conducting direct correspondence with foreign princes, or of meddling in the election of the [[Patriarch of Venice]]. These restrictions were increased over time, so that in 1229, after the death of Doge [[Pietro Ziani]], a commission of five "[[corrector]]s of the ducal ''promissione''" (''Correttori alle promissione ducale'') was established to revise them.{{sfn|Leicht|1935}} In the course of the centuries the ''promissione'' became more and more extensive and from 1595 it was printed. The ''promissione ducale'' of Doge [[Marino Grimani (doge)|Marino Grimani]] ({{reign|1595|1605}}) contained 108 pages, that of Doge [[Giovanni II Cornaro]]  ({{reign|1709|1722}}) had 165 pages, and the one for the last Doge, [[Ludovico Manin]] ({{reign|1789|1797}}), had 301 pages.

Not only were the powers of the Doge circumscribed, but eventually restrictions were also extended to his relatives, primarily to avoid any danger of the office becoming [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]]: in 1473, the Doge's sons and grandsons were prohibited from being elected to any council apart from the Great Council, and three years later they were forbidden from being elected to the boards of ''savii'' as well. These restrictions were only partially lifted a few decades before the [[Fall of the Republic of Venice|end]] of the Republic: in 1763, the Doge's brother and two of his sons were allowed to sit in the [[Venetian Senate]], but without the right to vote during the Doge's lifetime.{{sfn|Leicht|1935}} The oath equally also contained provisions regarding the Doge's spouse, the [[Dogaressa]], including her clothing and ceremonial duties.{{sfn|Leicht|1935}}

'''Raymond'''-Louis '''Lefebvre''' ([[Vire]], 1891-Barents Sea, 1920) was a [[French people|French]] writer and political activist. He attended the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern]] in 1920, but disappeared in the [[Barents Sea]] whilst returning.

Lefebvre served as a soldier during the [[First World War]] and in 1917 described his experiences in ''Le sacrifice d'Abraham'' (The Sacrifice of Abraham). He had been wounded and was revolted by the whole experience. This work placed him alongside [[Henri Barbusse]], [[Georges Duhamel]], [[Marcel Martinet]] – amongst others – as being one of the writers who developed a revolutionary perspective during the war.&lt;ref name="Serge"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serge|first1=Victor|title=Héros et martyrs du communisme Raymond Lefebvre|journal=Le bulletin communiste|date=1921|volume=2|issue=4|url=https://www.marxists.org/francais/serge/works/1921/04/lefebvre.htm|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was involved in setting up a radical veterans association, the [[Association Républicaine des Anciens Combattants]].&lt;ref name="Serge"/&gt;

After attending the 2nd Congress of the Cominiern, he was appointed to the Provisional International Bureau of the [[Kultintern]], an organisation set up to promote proletarian culture.&lt;ref name="AB &amp; Kultiintern"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biggart|first1=John|title=Alexander Bogdanov and the short history of the Kultintern|url=https://bogdanovlibrary.org/current-research/|website=Alexander Bogdanov Library|publisher=Historical Materialism|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, Christine Shawcroft, who just became the chairwoman of the Labour Party disputes panel not even three months prior to the event, was found to be defending Alan Bull, a candidate who posted a link to a Renegade Tribune article along with a Facebook post that said, "International Red Cross report confirms the Holocaust of six million Jews is a hoax". As a response to the incident, Renegade Tribune made an article called "UK Labour Candidate Shared Holohoax Article from Renegade Tribune, Suspended by Party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/03/labour-cant-tackle-anti-semitism-under-corbyn/|title=Labour can’t tackle anti-Semitism under Corbyn|last1=Daisley|first1=Stephen|date=March 29, 2018|accessdate=August 22, 2018|website=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Forms of government}}
A '''right-wing dictatorship''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''rightist dictatorship''') is an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] (or sometimes [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]) [[regime]] whose policy could be called [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]]. There are various definitions of the term "rightist". The broadest one includes all dictatorships that do not consider themselves [[Communism|communist]]. Those are usually pro-capitalist in economic matters and [[Conservatism|conservative]] in ideological ones. The term [[Fascism|fascist]] dictatorship is sometimes used interchangeably with the right-wing one. It is commonly accepted that [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] were ruled by fascist governments at some points of their history, but how it refers to other right-wing regimes is a question of further debate. The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] in Portugal was a right-wing dictatorship which was [[Corporatism|corporatist]] in nature. Most South American dictatorships during the second half of the 20th century were right-wing: [[Pinochet]], the [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian Military Government]], etc. There have also been a number of military dictatorships installed by [[anti-communists]] which were generally conservative and rightist.

== Military government ==
In the most common Western view, the perfect example of a right-wing dictatorship is any of those that once ruled in [[South America]]. Those regimes were predominantly military juntas and most of them collapsed in the 1980s. Communist countries, which were very cautious about not revealing their authoritarian methods of rule to the public, were usually led by civilian governments and officers taking power were not much welcomed there. Few exceptions include the [[Burmese Way to Socialism]] ([[Burma]], 1966–1988), the [[Military Council of National Salvation]] ([[People's Republic of Poland]], 1981–1983) or the [[North Korea]]n regime's evolution throughout the rule of [[Kim Il-sung]].

== Religion and the government ==
Most right-wing regimes kept strong ties with local Churches (usually the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic ones]] since most of those regimes happened in Catholic countries). This policy of a strong Church-state alliance is usually referred to as [[Austrofascism]]. The most pro-Catholic dictatorships were [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal (1933–1974)]] and the Federal State of Austria (1934–1938). Non-Christian dictatorships include those in the [[Muslim]] world, the most famous being [[Iran]] since the [[Islamic revolution|revolution of 1979]]. There are several other examples of [[Theocracy|theocratic]] (and therefore right-wing) regimes in the region, like [[Somalia]]{{clarify|date=February 2011}} or [[Islamic State of Afghanistan|Afghanistan under the Taliban]]. While it is unclear whether a monarchy could be called a dictatorship, theocratic [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] or [[Vatican City]] share many similarities with the regimes mentioned above. Many of those are/were led by spiritual leaders and examples include the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]] under the Reverend [[Josef Tiso]] or Iran under the [[Ayatollah]]s [[Khomeini]] (1979–1989) and [[Khamenei]] (1989–present). Some right-wing dictatorships, like the [[Nazi Germany]], were even openly hostile to certain religions.&lt;ref name="Gottfried2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottfried|first=Ted|title=Heroes of the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdKyZVcVmuQC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=14 January 2017|year=2001|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=9780761317173|pages=24–25|quote=Some groups that are known to have helped Jews were religious in nature. One of these was the Confessing Church, a Protestant denomination formed in May 1934, the year after Hitler became chancellor of Germany. One of its goals was to repeal the Nazi law "which required that the civil service would be purged of all those who were either Jewish or of partly Jewish descent." Another was to help those "who suffered through repressive laws, or violence." About 7,000 of the 17,000 Protestant clergy in Germany joined the Confessing Church. Much of their work has one unrecognized, but two who will never forget them are Max Krakauer and his wife. Sheltered in sixty-six houses and helped by more than eighty individuals who belonged to the Confessing Church, they owe them their lives. German Catholic churches went out of their way to protect Catholics of Jewish ancestry. More inclusive was the principled stand taken by Catholic Bishop Clemens Count von Galen of Munster. He publicly denounced the Nazi slaughter of Jews and actually succeeded in having the problem halted for a short time. ... Members of the Society of Friends--German Quakers working with organizations of Friends from other countries--were particularly successful in rescuing Jews. ... Jehovah's Witnesses, themselves targeted for concentration camps, also provided help to Jews.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe ==
In some post-communist countries, people involved in the previous regime took power in the years following the end of the Cold War. The most famous example of a [[Europe]]an dictatorship of that sort is [[Belarus]] under [[Alexander Lukashenko]].{{clarify|date=February 2011}} Belarus and [[Azerbaijan]] were both considered "authoritarian regimes" by the [[Democracy Index]] as of 2008. [[Freedom House]] marks them "not-free states" together with [[Russia]], so whether Russia is a dictatorship or just a seriously flawed democracy is a question of further debate. All three governments are non-communist and especially in Russia sometimes stay in total opposition to the communist parties, therefore they{{original research inline|date=February 2011}} could be called right-wing as well.

=== List of European right-wing dictatorships ===
Considering a right-wing dictatorship any non-democratic (non-parliamentary or pseudo-parliamentary political system, suppression of basic freedoms such as association and speech, prosecution of opponents, etc.) regime that is not communist, the list of European examples would be as following:

The '''Rural Appalachian Improvement League''' (RAIL) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation based in [[Mullens, West Virginia]].  Since 2001, when flooding devastated southern West Virginia, RAIL has worked to improve the quality of life for residents of the area.  Its mission is "to build human &amp; civic capacity through incubation of nonprofit and grassroots organizations, and through the provision of programs in health, home repair, and education at the Mullens Opportunity Center." ([http://www.railwv.org])

RAIL is located in the Mullens Opportunity Center (MOC), which it also administers.  The MOC is located at 300 Front Street, in the former Mullens Elementary School.  RAIL programs offered at the MOC include GED and literacy classes, high-speed public internet access, meeting space, a fitness center, and business incubator opportunities.  The [[Upper Guyandotte Watershed Association]](UGWA) is a separate non-profit launched by RAIL that also operates out of the MOC.

Many of the programs at RAIL have been developed by [[Volunteers in Service to America|AmeriCorps VISTAs]], many of whom are from other regions of the United States.  Other RAIL activities focus on community economic development, housing, cultural heritage, environment, and property acquisition.

In 2007, [[Wyoming County, West Virginia|Wyoming County]] was designated a 'Pilot Community' by Groundwork USA, which is a nationwide organization that is "a network of independent, not-for-profit, environmental businesses" that gets "local people, business, government and other organizations involved in practical projects." Groundwork strives to help communities improve their local environment by reclaiming [[Brownfield land|brownfields]], abandoned lands, and other under-utilized properties and returning them to productive use such as recreation, green space, and commercial development. ([http://www.groundworkusa.org/])

RAIL was appointed administrator for a grant to study the formation of Groundwork Wyoming County (GWWC), and will act as consultant in a feasibility study.  If launched, GWWC will be the first rural Groundwork Trust in the U.S., and its course will set important precedents, both within Groundwork USA and in rural Appalachia.

RAIL also helped launch the Wyoming County Business Retention, Expansion, and Development (BRE&amp;D) Program that works to connect local businesses and entrepreneurs with the resources they need to be successful.  These resources include business planning, employee training, financial assistance, and networking opportunities.

[[Russia]]n embargo of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] goods is trade and economic confrontation that resulted from putting all Ukrainian importers to the "list of risk" by the [[Federal Customs Service of Russia]] on 14 August 2013 that resulted the embargo of imports from Ukraine to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iss.europa.eu/uploads/media/Alert_Ukraine_trade.pdf The Russia-Ukraine trade spat].

== Timeline of the events ==

=== 2013 ===
In the end of July 2013 Russian customs officers began unreasonable total inspection of all vehicles that transported Ukrainian goods. That forced Ukrainian cargoes idle on the [[Russia–Ukraine border|border]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dt.ua/ECONOMICS/ukrayina-poskarzhitsya-u-yevraziysku-komisiyu-na-torgovelnu-blokadu-rosiyi-126788_.html Україна поскаржиться у Євразійську комісію на «торговельну блокаду» Росії].

On 14 August 2013, short after the beginning of the embargo, civic movement "[[Vidsich]]" called in [[Social Network]]s for a [[Do not buy Russian goods!|boycott of Russian goods]] to respond the embargo of Ukrainian goods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tyzhden.ua/News/87066 У соцмережах українців закликають бойкотувати російські товари]. ''tyzhden.ua''. (15 August 2013). {{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This message had massively spread in social networks. On 22 August near the [[Presidential Administration of Ukraine]] activists held an action during which announced the launch of campaign of [[Do not buy Russian goods!|boycott of Russian goods]]. Activists launched a massive campaign on the Internet to attract volunteers and activists to work. From 24 August they massively distributed leaflets calling for a boycott in dozens of cities in Ukraine. Since November activists also begun to distribute leaflets calling for not buying goods in Russian stores and not being served in Russian banks.

However, activists announced the restoration of campaign in March 2014 after the beginning of [[2014 Crimean crisis|"Crimean crisis"]].

=== International response ===
On 28 August 2013 the [[European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs]] held an emergency meeting on the situation in [[Egypt]] and [[Ukraine]]. The initiator of the extraordinary session was chairman of the committee [[Elmar Brok]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2013/08/19/6996299/ Європа стурбована, що Росія погрожує Україні]. ''Українська правда''. (19.08.2013). {{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Committee supported Ukraine in trade conflict with Russia. It was decided to raise that issue on the [[G20]] summit in [[Saint Petersburg]] and pass a resolution about the support of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ukrainian/politics/2013/08/130828_euparliament_special_committee_results_vc.shtml В Європарламенті домовились, як захистити Україну від Росії]. ''BBC'' (28.08.2013). {{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government of Germany, commenting the trade embargo, called on Russia to respect the right of Ukraine for the close relationship with [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ua-today.com/modules/myarticles/article_storyid_58616.html Германия прямо объяснила Путину и его оркам, что нечего закатывать Украине сцены ревности]. ''Сегодня''. (21.08.2013). {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2013 [[The European Parliament]] have adopted the resolution on Russia's pressure on the countries of [[Eastern Partnership]] and called on the [[European Union]] leadership to protect [[Ukraine]], [[Moldova]] and [[Armenia]]. The European Parliament called on the [[European Commission]] and the [[European External Action Service]] to consider Russia's actions being beyond the economy and being in a political dimension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;f=ST%2013695%202013%20INIT The Resolution about the pressure exercised by Russia on countries of the Eastern Partnership in the context of the upcoming summit in Vilnius].

European Parliament website (12 September 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2013 the European Parliament supported the introduction of restrictions against the import of Russian goods in response to the same actions against countries of Eastern Partnership. If Russia introduces visa restrictions for citizens of these countries it will get "mirrored" measures for their citizens. In addition, the [[European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs]] asked to ensure compliance with the European laws by Russian companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvi.ua/new/2013/09/25/yes_zaklykaye_blokuvaty_rosiyskyy_import ЄС закликає блокувати російський імпорт] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108220358/http://tvi.ua/new/2013/09/25/yes_zaklykaye_blokuvaty_rosiyskyy_import |date=8 November 2014 }}.

On 23 November 2013, after the announcement by [[Cabinet of Ukraine]] about suspension of the process of signing of association agreement with the EU and after the beginning of [[Euromaidan]], [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]] said she wants to talk to the president [[Vladimir Putin]] about stopping the pressure on Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2013/11/23/7002820/ Меркель хоче дізнатися, коли Кремль припинить тиск на Україну]. ''Українська правда''. (23.11.2013). {{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
According to the investigation of "[[Zerkalo Nedeli]]" newspaper, the reason for the embargo of Ukrainian production is pressure on the Ukrainian government to disrupt the signing of association agreement with the EU. The newspaper describes the events as opening of the first front of "economic war" against Ukraine. This is indicated in the investigation that Russia wants to maintain its influence over Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saryusz-wolski.pl/aktualnosci/zobacz/721/on_set_of_measures_aimed_at_involving_ukraine_into_eur-asian_integration_process Set of Measures, Aimed at Involving Ukraine into EurAsian Integration Process] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141102195056/http://saryusz-wolski.pl/aktualnosci/zobacz/721/on_set_of_measures_aimed_at_involving_ukraine_into_eur-asian_integration_process |date=2 November 2014 }}.

* According to the chairman of the [[State Duma]] Committee for [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] Leonid Slutsky, this is just a bureaucratic issue because Ukraine is not a member of the Customs Union. Slutsky hopes that by the end of August 2013 the customs services of the both countries will overcome all difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradekeynews.com/2013/08/in-russia-confirmed-that-export.html In Russia confirmed that export problems are related to Customs Union]. ''Trade Key News''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A member of the political council of [[Party of Regions]] [[Aleksey Plotnikov (politician)|Aleksey Plotnikov]] stated that the current trade and economic situation between Ukraine and Russia must not be qualified as war, only as a manifestation of panic of Russia which have lost (2 September 2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://republic.com.ua/article/28714-Soratnik-Yanukovicha-DeystviYa-RF---eto-ne-voyna-a-panika-proigravshey-storony.html Соратник Януковича: Действия РФ - это не война, а паника проигравшей стороны]. ''Re:public''. (03.09.2013). {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the former [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]], trade war which was really launched by Russia, is a manifestation of trying to achieve political goals by the means of economic blackmail, and the real purpose is permanent elimination of independence of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.ua/politics/823379-yuschenko-kaje-scho-kreml-peretvoriv-tsukerki-na-znaryaddya-viyni.html Ющенко каже, що Кремль перетворив цукерки на знаряддя війни].

== Effects ==
According to the Federation of Employers of Ukraine in the beginning of the embargo the loss for Ukraine from the Russia's actions can reach $2–2,5 billion in the second half of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpretermag.com/trade-war-with-russia-could-devastate-ukraines-budget/ Trade War With Russia Could Devastate Ukraine’s Budget]. ''The Interpreter''. (16 August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ukrainian experts as for 22 August 2013 the 10-days embargo on the Russian border can hit some manufacturers, but the scale of losses in whole Ukraine is only 500 million [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnias]]. Experts also believe that the unpredictable behaviour of Russia will force Ukrainian businessmen to seek new markets for their products, as well as make supporters of joining the [[Eurasian Customs Union|"Customs Union"]] change their mind.&lt;ref name="ATR"&gt;[http://atr.ua/watch/?video=2013-08-22-21-46-14-0535039 Акція ГР «Відсіч» під Адміністрацією Президента (відео)]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}.

On 24 August 2013 on [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio "Liberty"]] MP of [[European Parliament]] [[Pawel Kowal]] published an article in which he suggested that the situation of tension in relations between Ukraine and Russia is just the beginning of the pressure that will continue and increase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25084610.html Час здорових нервів]. ''Радіо Свобода''. (24.08.2013). {{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist, Director of "[[Democratic initiatives]]" Irina Bekeshkina said that Ukraine at the end of August 2013 is winning [[information war]] with Russia. However, according to experts, Russia will enhance the information and economic impact on Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipress.ua/news/kyiv_poky_shcho_vygraie_informatsiynu_viynu_z_moskvoyu__bekeshkina_26850.html Київ поки що виграє інформаційну війну з Москвою - Бекешкіна]. ''iPres.ua''. (Серпень 2013). {{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior Advisor to the [[Embassy of Russia in Kiev|Russian Embassy in Ukraine]] Igor Sevastiyanov indirectly confirmed this statement, saying this embargo is "training".

Also, according to [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio "Liberty"]] with reference to the heads of the companies in the end of August 2013 it was reported that some Ukrainian companies through the trade confrontation between Ukraine and Russia are shifting to other markets. Some companies do not feel any problems with exports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/25089044.html Українські виробники пристосовуються до експортних перешкод Росії].

Representatives of EU said they are ready to introduce additional steps to support Ukraine - from simplification of visa for Ukraine to financial help. Also, EU thinks about complication of access to European market for Russian goods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyx51chuYIs Поки Москва лякає Україну наслідками євроінтеграції, ЄС готовий скасувати майже всі мита (відео)].

His birthday is observed every year as the National Librarian's Day in India.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Vanda (2006). ''Essential Classification''.

He was a university librarian and professor of library science at [[Banaras Hindu University]] (1945–47) and professor of library science at the [[University of Delhi]] (1947–55).
The last appointment made him director of the first Indian school of librarianship to offer higher degrees. He was president of the Indian Library Association from 1944 to 1953. In 1957 he was elected an honorary member of the [[International Federation for Information and Documentation]] (FID) and was made a vice-president for life of the Library Association of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;"Ranganathan, Shivala Ramanrita (1892–1972)."

==Early life and education==
Ranganathan, born on 09 August 1892 to Ramamrita, in Siyali (at present, Sirkazhi) in British-ruled India at Tanjavoor (at present, Ubayavethanthapuram ,Thiruvarur District), Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="Garfield"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Islam|first=Mohammed Nurul|date=10 June 2015|title=S. R. Ranganathan: library and documentation scientist. Historical Notes|url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/108/11/2110.pdf|journal=Current Science|volume=108|pages=2110–2111|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranganathan began his professional life as a mathematician; he earned B.A. and M.A. degrees in mathematics from [[Madras Christian College]] in his home province, and then went on to earn a teaching license. His lifelong goal was to teach mathematics, and he was successively a member of the mathematics faculties at universities in [[Mangalore]], [[Coimbatore]] and [[Chennai|Madras]]). As a mathematics professor, he published papers mainly on the history of mathematics. His career as an educator was somewhat hindered by [[stammering]] (a difficulty he gradually overcame in his professional life). The Government of India awarded [[Padmashri]] to Dr. S.R. Ranganathan in 1957 for valuable contributions to Library Science.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, A.P. (1977). Ranganathan: A pattern maker. New Dehli: Metropolitan Book Co., p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

In 1923, the [[University of Madras]] created the post of University Librarian to oversee their poorly organized collection. Among the 900 applicants for the position, none had any formal training in librarianship, and Ranganathan's' handful of papers satisfied the search committee's requirement that the candidate should have a research background. His sole knowledge of librarianship came from an ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' article he read days before the interview. Ranganathan was initially reluctant to pursue the position (he had forgotten about his application by the time he was called for an interview there). To his own surprise, he received the appointment and accepted the position in January 1924.&lt;ref name=Garfield /&gt;

At first, Ranganathan found the solitude of the position was intolerable. In a matter of weeks, complaining of total boredom, he went back to the university administration to beg for his teaching position back. A deal was struck that Ranganathan would travel to London to study contemporary Western practices in librarianship, and that, if he returned and still rejected librarianship as a career, the mathematics lectureship would be his again.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Garfield, Eugene (6). "A Tribute to S. R. Ranganathan, the Father of Indian Library Science. Part 1. Life and Works". Essays of an Information Scientist 7: 37–44&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranganathan travelled to [[University College London]], which at that time housed the only graduate degree program in library science in Britain. At University College, he earned marks only slightly above average, but his mathematical mind latched onto the problem of classification, a subject typically taught by rote in library programs of the time. As an outsider, he focused on what he perceived to be flaws with the popular decimal classification, and began to explore new possibilities on his own.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, A.P. (1977). Ranganathan: A pattern maker. New Dehli: Metropolitan Book Co., p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also devised the Acknowledgment of Duplication, which states that any system of classification of information necessarily implies at least two different classifications for any given datum. He anecdotally proved this with the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC) by taking several books and showing how each might be classified with two totally different resultant DDC numbers.&lt;ref name="Srivastava, A.P. 1977"&gt;Srivastava, A.P. (1977). Ranganathan: A pattern maker. New Dehli: Metropolitan Book Co.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a book on "warfare in India" could be classified under "warfare" or "India". Even a general book on warfare could be classified under "warfare", "history","social organisation","Indian essays", or many other headings, depending upon the viewpoint, needs, and prejudices of the classifier. To Ranganathan, a structured, step-by-step system acknowledging each facet of the topic of the work was immensely preferable to the anarchy and "intellectual laziness" (as he termed it) of the DDC. Given the poor technology for information retrieval available at that time, the implementation of this concept was a tremendous step forwards for the science of information retrieval. The system remains useful even into the modern times.

He began drafting the system that was ultimately to become [[colon classification]] while in England, and refined it as he returned home, even going so far as to reorder the ship's library on the voyage back to India. He initially got the idea for the system from seeing a set of [[Meccano]] in a toy store in London. Ranganathan returned with great interest for libraries and librarianship and a vision of its importance for the Indian nation. He returned to and held the position of University Librarian at the University of Madras for twenty years. During that time, he helped to found the Madras Library Association, and lobbied actively for the establishment of free public libraries throughout India and for the creation of a comprehensive national library.&lt;ref name="Srivastava, A.P. 1977"/&gt;

Ranganathan was considered by many to be a [[workaholic]]. During his two decades in Madras, he consistently worked 13-hour days, seven days a week, without taking a vacation for the entire time. Although he married in November 1928, he returned to work the afternoon following the marriage ceremony. A few years later, he and his wife Sarada had a son. The couple remained married until Ranganathan's death.

The first few years of Ranganathan's tenure at Madras were years of deliberation and analysis as he addressed the problems of library administration and classification.&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, A.P. (1977). Ranganathan: A pattern maker. New Dehli: Metropolitan Book Co., p. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that he produced what have come to be known as his two greatest legacies: his [[five laws of library science]] (1931) and the [[colon classification system]] (1933).&lt;ref&gt;Kabir, A. (2003). Ranganathan: A Universal Librarian. Journal of Educational Media &amp; Library Sciences, 40, 453–459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the political climate at the time, Ranganathan took his position at the University of Madras in 1924. Gandhi had been imprisoned in 1922 and was released around the time that Ranganathan was taking that job. Ranganathan sought to institute massive changes to the library system and to write about such things as open access and education for all which essentially had the potential to enable the masses and encourage civil discourse (and disobedience). Although there's no evidence that Ranganathan did any of this for political reasons, his changes to the library had the result of educating more people, making information available to all, and even aiding women and minorities in the information-seeking process.

The [[Northern Ireland]] crisis got an unexpected [[metaphor]]ical reference in a book by S. R. Ranganathan, as "making an [[Ulster]] of the ... law of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]]", complaining about the harmful effects of low budget on the good functioning of a library.

==Later career==

After two decades of serving as librarian at Madras&amp;nbsp;– a post he had intended to keep until his retirement, Ranganathan retired from his position after conflicts with a new university vice-chancellor became intolerable. At the age of 54, he submitted his resignation and, after a brief bout with depression, accepted a professorship in library science at [[Banaras Hindu University]] in [[Varanasi]], his last formal academic position, in August 1945. There, he catalogued the university's collection; by the time he left four years later, he had classified over 100,000 items personally.

Ranganathan headed the [[Indian Library Association]] from 1944 to 1953, but was never a particularly adept administrator, and left amid controversy when the [[Delhi Public Library]] chose to use the Dewey Decimal Classification system instead of his own Colon Classification. He held an honorary professorship at [[Delhi University]] from 1949 to 1955 and helped build that institution's library science programs with [[S. Dasgupta]], a former student of his.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1951, Ranganathan released an album on [[Folkways Records]] entitled, ''Readings from the Ramayana: In Sanskrit Bhagavad Gita.''

Ranganathan briefly moved to [[Zurich]], Switzerland, from 1955 to 1957, when his son married a European woman; the unorthodox relationship did not sit well with Ranganathan, although his time in Zurich allowed him to expand his contacts within the European library community, where he gained a significant following. However, he soon returned to India and settled in the city of Bangalore, where he would spend the rest of his life. While in Zurich, though, he endowed a professorship at Madras University in honour of his wife of thirty years, largely as an ironic gesture in retaliation for the persecution he suffered for many years at the hands of that university's administration.

Ranganathan's final major achievement was the establishment of the [[Documentation Research and Training Centre]] as a department and research centre in the [[Indian Statistical Institute]] in Bangalore in 1962, where he served as honorary director for five years. In 1965, the Indian government honoured him for his contributions to the field with a rare title of "National Research Professor."

In the final years of his life, Ranganathan finally succumbed to ill health and was largely confined to his bed. On 27 September 1972, he died of complications from [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref&gt;Srivastava, A.P. (1977). Ranganathan: A pattern maker. New Delhi: Metropolitan Book Co., p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the 1992 centenary of his birth, several biographical volumes and collections of essays on Ranganathan's influence were published in his honour. Ranganathan's autobiography, published serially during his life, is titled ''A Librarian Looks Back''.

==Influence==

Ranganathan dedicated his book "The Five Laws of Library Science" to his maths tutor at Madras Christian College: [[Edward Burns Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Ross.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7164">'''Separation of prescribing and dispensing''', also called '''dispensing separation''', is a practice in [[medicine]] and [[pharmacy]] in which the [[physician]] who provides a [[medical prescription]] is independent from the  [[pharmacist]] who provides the [[prescription drug]].

In the [[Western world]] there are centuries of tradition for separating pharmacists from physicians. In Asian countries it is traditional for physicians to also provide drugs.

In contemporary time researchers and health policy analysts have more deeply considered these traditions and their effects. Advocates for separation and advocates for combining make similar claims for each of their conflicting perspectives, saying that separating or combining reduces [[conflict of interest in the healthcare industry]], [[unnecessary health care]], and lowers costs, while the opposite causes those things. Research in various places reports mixed outcomes in different circumstances.

==Background==
In jurisdictions (such as the [[United States]]), [[pharmacist]]s are regulated separately from [[physician]]s.  These jurisdictions also usually specify that ''only'' pharmacists may supply scheduled [[pharmaceutical]]s to the public, and that pharmacists cannot form business [[partnership]]s with physicians or give them "kickback" payments.  However, the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) Code of Ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere.  7 to 10 percent of American physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of State Compensation Insurance Funds, [http://www.aascif.org/public/jul_aug_sep06/drugs.htm Prepackaged Drugs in Workers' Compensation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some rural areas in the United Kingdom, there are dispensing physicians&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Association, briefing on dispensing doctors, 30 January 2009 [http://www.bma.org.uk/employmentandcontracts/independent_contractors/general_medical_services_contract/Dispdoctors.jsp]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines to their patients from within their practices. The law requires that the GP practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified, minimum distance (currently 1.6 kilometres) between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy. See [[Dispensing Doctors' Association]].

This law also exists in [[Austria]] for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away, or where none is registered in the city.

[[File:Pharmacy in Mexico City, March 2010.jpg|thumb|One of a chain of pharmacies in Mexico City, Mexico, named "Doctor Discount," March 2010.]]
In other [[jurisdiction]]s (particularly in [[Asia]]n countries such as [[China]],  [[Malaysia]], and [[Singapore]]), [[Physician|doctor]]s are allowed to dispense [[medication|drug]]s themselves and the practice of pharmacy is sometimes integrated with that of the [[physician]], particularly in traditional [[Chinese medicine]].

In Canada it is common for a medical clinic and a pharmacy to be located together and for the ownership in both enterprises to be common, but licensed separately.

The reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest and/or the avoidance of absolute powers. Otherwise, the physician has a financial self-interest in "diagnosing" as many conditions as possible, and in exaggerating their seriousness, because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient. Such self-interest directly conflicts with the patient's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]].  This system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the U.S. and many other governments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

A campaign for separation has begun in many countries and has already been successful (as in [[Korea]]). As many of the remaining nations move towards separation, resistance and lobbying from dispensing doctors who have pecuniary interests may prove a major stumbling block (e.g. in [[Malaysia]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Experience in Asian countries==

'''Sodium metabisulfite''' or '''sodium pyrosulfite''' (IUPAC spelling; Br. E. '''sodium metabisulphite''' or '''sodium pyrosulphite''')  is an [[inorganic compound]] of chemical formula Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  The substance is sometimes referred to as ''disodium'' metabisulfite.  It is used as a [[disinfectant]], [[antioxidant]], and [[preservative]] agent.

==Preparation==
Sodium metabisulfite can be prepared by evaporating a solution of [[sodium bisulfite]] saturated with [[sulfur dioxide]]:

: 2 HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

which leaves solid Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; behind.&lt;ref name="InorgChem"&gt;{{cite book

==Chemical structure==
The anion [[metabisulfite]] is a hybrid of dithionite (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) and dithionate (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). The anion consists of an SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group linked to an SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group, with the negative charge more localized on the SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; end.  The S–S bond length is 2.22 Å, and the "thionate" and "thionite" S–O distances are 1.46 and 1.50 Å respectively.&lt;ref&gt;K. L. Carter, T. A. Siddiquee, K. L. Murphy, D. W.

==Uses==

===Food additive===

The [[acceptable daily intake]] is up to 0.7&amp;nbsp;milligrams per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref name="food-info.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food-info.net/uk/e/e223.htm|title=Food-Info.net : E-numbers : E223: Sodium disulphite|work=food-info.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium metabisulfite oxidizes in the liver to sulfate which is excreted in the urine.&lt;ref name="food-info.net"/&gt;

===Sanitization and cleaning agent===
It is commonly used in [[homebrewing]] and [[winemaking]] to [[Disinfection|sanitize]] equipment. It is used as a cleaning agent for potable water [[reverse osmosis]] membranes in [[desalination]] systems. It is also used to remove [[chloramine]] from drinking water after treatment.

===Other uses===
*Added to local anaesthetic (lidocaine etc.) solutions to prevent oxidation of vasoconstrictor adrenaline and thus improve the shelf life of the solution {{cn|reason=that doesn't make sense. Biologic aids will not affect shelf life.|date=October 2016}}
*It is used in photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anchell|first1=Steve|title=The darkroom cookbook|date=2008|publisher=Focal Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0240810554|pages=193|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Concentrated sodium metabisulfite can be used to remove [[tree stump]]s. Some brands contain 98% sodium metabisulfite, and cause degradation of [[lignin]] in the stumps, facilitating removal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bonideproducts.com/lbonide/msds/sds271.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is also used as an [[excipient]] in some [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], such as [[paracetamol]]. Approximately 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg is used in [[epinephrine autoinjector]]s such as the EpiPen.
*A very important health related aspect of this substance is that it can be added to a blood smear in a test for [[sickle cell anaemia]] (and other similar forms of [[haemoglobin]] [[mutation]]). The substances causes defunct cells to sickle (through a complex [[polymerisation]]) hence confirming disease.
*It is used as the source of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in wine. An important anti-oxidant and bactericide
*It is also used to precipitate gold from auric acid (gold dissolved in [[aqua regia]]).
*It is used in waste treatment to chemically reduce hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium which can then be precipitated and removed from an aqueous waste stream.
*It is used as a bleaching agent in the production of Coconut cream
*It is used as a reducing agent to break sulfide bonds in shrunken items of clothing made of natural fibers, thus allowing the garment to go back to its original shape after washing
*It is used as an SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source (mixed with air or oxygen) for the destruction of cyanide in commercial gold cyanidation processes.
*It is used in the oil and gas industry as a corrosion inhibitor/oxygen scavenger.
*It is used in the water treatment industry to quench chlorine residual
*It is used in tint etching iron-based metal samples for microstructural analysis. &lt;ref&gt;https://vacaero.com/information-resources/metallography-with-george-vander-voort/991-color-metallography.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.asminternational.org/documents/10192/1874035/htp00102p025.pdf/ace8f01d-bf9a-4048-b948-a3aeb2d8a536&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical properties==
When mixed with water, sodium metabisulfite releases [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a pungent, unpleasant smelling gas that can also cause breathing difficulties in some people. For this reason, sodium metabisulfite has fallen from common use in recent times, with agents such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] becoming more popular for effective and odorless sterilization of equipment. Released sulfur dioxide however makes the water a strong reducing agent.

Sodium metabisulfite releases sulfur dioxide in contact with [[strong acid]]s:

:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

On heating to high temperature, it releases sulfur dioxide, leaving [[sodium sulfite]] behind:&lt;ref&gt;Sodium sulfite. http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_cb4111698.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

:Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Definitions==
===Minimum age===
{{Main|Adolescence#Legal issues, rights and privileges}}
The age that adolescents gain legal rights and privileges vary. Generally, those who reach the age of 18 are legally considered to have reached the [[age of majority]], but persons below that age may gain adult rights through [[Emancipation of minors|legal emancipation]].  The [[legal working age]] in Western countries is usually between 14 and 16, depending on the hours and type of employment.  This may be different from the minimum [[school leaving age]] (at which a person is legally allowed to leave [[compulsory education]]) and the [[age of consent]] to sexual activity varies widely between jurisdictions, ranging from 13 to 18 years.

The minimum age for "suitable age and discretion" varies by jurisdiction.

Fourteen years old seems to be the absolute minimum.  Under "[[common law]], a female of the age of 14 is at the age of legal discretion, and may choose a guardian."&lt;ref name=Temple /&gt;  Thus, Minnesota declared 14 to be old enough to be presumed to be of suitable age and discretion.&lt;ref name=Temple /&gt;  Under the laws of some [[United States|states]], including [[New York (state)|New York]], a child of 14 can get married with permission of a court and a guardian, and marriages of those younger than that are void.&lt;ref name=Married&gt;NY D.R.L. §15-A, found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS New York State Assembly website], go to DOM.  Accessed March 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  A New York official court video transcript states:

Crosby'', 123 CA3d Supp. 1 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service of process===
{{Main|Service of process}}
Suitable age and discretion is also an alternate method of service of process.  Typically that means a [[child]] of the defendant, even if the child is only visiting his or her parent's house, can accept service of process.&lt;ref name="Temple" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NC&gt;''Glover v.

However, service on the [[receptionist]] at the former dwelling place of the defendant was not sufficient for [[personal jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name=Connelly&gt;''Connelly v. Rodriquez'', 73 Misc. 2d 745 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Monroe Co. 1973), found at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=998740031221575895 Google scholar], accessed March 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TAMPEP''' ('''European Network for HIV/STI Prevention and Health Promotion among Migrant Sex Workers''') is an international organization that supports the health and human rights of [[migrant worker|migrant]] [[sex worker]]s in Europe.&lt;ref name=ducket&gt;Margaret Ducket, [http://data.unaids.org/Publications/IRC-pub02/jc519-migrantsrighttohealth_en.pdf Migrants' Right to Health], [[UNAIDS]] Best Practice Collection, March 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1993, with headquarters in [[Amsterdam]], the organization initially operated in Italy, Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. Today, it coordinates a network of 26 organizations in 25 countries of the [[European Union]], and receives funding from the [[European Commission]] as well as from national governmental and non-governmental organizations.

The main concern of the project is [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention; it approaches the problem from a general health and human rights approach, working for empowerment and self-determination of female and transsexual migrant sex workers, and for improvements in their working conditions and social situation.&lt;ref name=ducket/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brussa L, [http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102284097.html Migrant Sex workers in Europe: the experience of TAMPEP], ''15th International Conference on AIDS'', Bangkok Thailand 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The member organizations employ [[street work]], [[peer educator]]s and informational materials to contact migrant sex workers.&lt;ref name=gp&gt;[http://www.tampep.eu/documents/tampep_generalpresentation.pdf TAMPEP General Presentation], retrieved 4 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The organization produces regular reports about the situation of prostitutes in Europe.

TAMPEP's literature emphasizes the need to cleanly distinguish between the issues of [[human trafficking|trafficking]], [[sex work]] and [[Human migration|migration]]. TAMPEP opposes trafficking as a human rights abuse, but supports efforts to improve working conditions of sex workers and to facilitate migration.&lt;ref name=pos&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_projects/2002/com_diseases/documents/fp_commdis_2002_frep_17_3_en.pdf TAMPEP Position Paper on Migration and Sex Work (2002)], retrieved 4 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CQL | The Council on Quality and Leis an [[United States|American]] -based organization dedicated to the definition, measurement, and improvement of personal and community [[quality of life]] for people with [[disabilities]] and people with [[mental illness]] and [[substance abuse|substance abuse disorder]] and older adults. It has partnerships with organisations in [[Canada]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

CQL was founded in 1969 by leading national [[advocacy]] organizations in response to unacceptable conditions and abuses in the treatment of people with disabilities. Today, CQL operates an international [[accreditation]] program, provides consultation and technical assistance for [[Quality (business)|quality]] improvement, conducts research and disseminates knowledge, and promotes the definition of quality of life within the context of community life.

CQL member organizations form the governing body by appointing representatives to serve on the Board of Directors. Members represent leading advocacy, provider, and professional organizations and include:
* [[American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities]] – AAIDD
* [http://www.ancor.org American Network of Community Options and Resources – ANCOR]
* []Autism Society of America]]
* [http://bethesdalutherancommunities.org/ Bethesda Lutheran Communities]
* [http://www.mosaicinfo.org/ Mosaic]
* [http://www.qddp.org/ National Association of QMRPs – NAQ]
* [http://www.sabeusa.org/ Self Advocates Becoming Empowered – SABE]
* [http://www.thearc.org/ * The Arc]
* [[United Cerebral Palsy]] – UCP

== Priorities ==

CQL works with public and private organizations with a commitment to improving the quality of services and supports provided to people with disabilities and people with mental illness. CQL’s goals are to:
* Develop and implement person-directed quality measures, performance indicators, and evaluation methods
* Conduct an international accreditation program
* Provide consultation and education to build individual and organizational capacity
* Conduct research and disseminate information to enhance policy making
* Provide access to information, innovation, and emerging ideas in quality of life

== Defining "quality" ==

=== 1970s and 1980s – Compliance Standards for Services ===
CQL originated in the late 1960s in an effort to stop the abuses and inhumane treatment in large public institutions serving people with intellectual disabilities. Quality of care or quality of service was defined in terms of organizational processes, with particular emphases on assuring safety, health, and security. During the 1970s and 1980s, CQL developed national consensus standards for organizations providing services to people with intellectual disabilities. The standards reflected the principles and values of professionals, families, provider organizations, and government agencies. CQL standards were published in 1971, 1973, 1978, 1981, 1985, 1987 and 1990.

In the early stages of this period, quality in human services focused primarily on the organizations that housed people with disabilities. Over time, the focus shifted to the individuals who were cared for by these organizations. Definitions of quality addressed internal processes necessary to ensure that the service recipient received adequate and appropriate care or treatment. However, the focus remained on program evaluation as the measure of quality.

=== 1990s – Personal Outcome Measures ===
CQL shifted the definition of quality from compliance with program or process standards to responsiveness to people. Work on the Personal Outcome Measures began in 1991, as CQL held focus group meetings with people with disabilities and their families. People defined the outcomes that were most important to them. CQL introduced the ''Outcome Based Performance Measures'' in 1993 and the modified ''Personal Outcome Measures'' in 1997.

These measures represented a significant departure from traditional quality systems. CQL shifted the focus to measuring individual quality of life. Not only were the measures different, the process of gathering information also changed. Personal interviews with people with intellectual disabilities, people with mental illness, or people with other conditions are the foundation of the data gathering process. The measures are applied and evaluated based on the unique characteristics, needs, and desires of each individual.

=== 2000s – Social Capital and Community Life ===
At the start of the new century, and after ten years of data gathering and analysis, CQL recognized that personal outcomes are most likely to be realized when people are part of communities of concerned and supporting people. CQL once again shifted its definitions of quality by focusing on the social or community context for the attainment of personal quality of life. The individual focus of person-directed outcomes, self-determination and individual choice requires a social context. The challenge for organizations and support groups is not only to engage in person-directed processes; rather, it is to use the person-directed orientation to build [[social capital]] and community connections.

CQL’s ''Quality Measures 2005'' is a comprehensive resource on multiple dimensions of quality assessment and enhancement. It builds on the foundations of past standards and moves human service providers forward into the current environment.

=== 2010s - Person-centered Excellence ===

More than fifteen years of research on the CQL Personal Outcome Measure® national database revealed the importance of person-centered services and social networks in facilitating personal quality of life outcomes for people. CQL introduced the dialogue on social capital and disability in 2000, and redefined quality within the context of community inclusion. CQL argued that people find meaningful life opportunities and alternatives outside of programs and organizational services. The role of organizations is to connect people with resources and social networks in their communities. Unfortunately, our data and experience indicate that many organizations have difficulty making these connections.

This led CQL to embark on the development of new definitions, metrics and improvement methods focused on person-centered supports through the What Really Matters initiative. Over a 12-month period, CQL sought out the best thinkers and innovators across a wide range of human services to guide our work.

== History ==

CQL evolved from the work of the American Association on Mental Deficiency-AAMD (now American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities-AAIDD). In 1952, AAMD published the report of a special committee on standards for institutions serving people with [[intellectual disability]]. With funding from the [[National Institute of Mental Health]]-NIMH, AAMD undertook a major standards development project, culminating in the publication of the Standards for State Institutions for the Mentally Retarded in 1964. In 1966, AAMD and the National Association for Retarded Citizens (now The Arc), the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) and United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) formed the National Planning Committee on Accreditation of Residential Centers for the Retarded. In 1969 the [[Joint Commission]]on Accreditation of Hospitals invited the National Planning Committee to establish an accreditation council within its structure.

The Accreditation Council for Facilities for the Mentally Retarded (ACFMR) developed accreditation standards and conducted accreditation reviews of facilities serving people with intellectual disability over the next ten years. In 1979 the Joint Commission reorganized its administrative structure and terminated its agreements with various accreditation councils, replacing them with professional and technical advisory committees. The ACFMR voted to reorganize as an independent, not-for-profit organization – to be known as The Accreditation Council for Services for Mentally Retarded and Other Developmentally Disabled Persons-ACMRDD. Founding members of ACMRDD were: AAMD (now AAIDD), [[American Psychological Association]], The Arc, [[Epilepsy Foundation of America]], National Association of Private Residential Facilities (now ANCOR), [[National Association of Social Workers]], National Society for Children and Adults with Autism (now Autism Society of America), and UCP. In 1981 the American Occupational Therapy Association and the Council for Exceptional Children also became sponsoring organizations. ACMRDD’s work in updating the standards and review methodology was initially supported by the Administration on Developmental Disabilities in the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]].

During the 1980s and 1990s, the name of the organization evolved from ACMRDD to The Accreditation Council on Services for People with Disabilities-ACD, and in 1997 it became The Council on Quality and Leadership-CQL.

During the 1980s, CQL published new editions of standards and conducted a national accreditation program for organizations providing services to people with disabilities. CQL’s design and dissemination of habilitation standards emphasized the interdisciplinary team process, individualized program planning, behavior intervention, and the promotion of [[disability rights]]. The Standards for Services influenced federal certification requirements for the Intermediate Care Facilities for intellectual disability (ICF/MR) program. The Health Care Financing Administration-HCFA, now the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]]-CMS, acknowledged that its regulations were based on the 1983 draft CQL standards.

CQL standards were also recognized by the U.S. courts in several landmark cases, including:
* Wyatt v Stickney (State of Alabama, 1972)
* Evans v Washington (District of Columbia, 1978)
* The Arc v Schafer (State of North Dakota, 1982)
* Lelsz v Kavanagh (State of Texas, 1987)
* Baldridge v Clinton (State of Arkansas, 1991)
The courts affirmed that CQL standards represented a reliable benchmark for ensuring that individuals with disabilities were receiving appropriate services and that their rights, safety, and security were assured.

During this period, CQL operated as a [[standards organization]] and accreditation organization, with a particular focus on quality in services for people with intellectual disability and other [[developmental disabilities]].

In the 1990s, CQL shifted to a broader focus, moving beyond habilitation planning and measures of organizational process. Work began on the ''Outcome Based Performance Measures'', renamed ''Personal Outcome Measures'' in 2000. These new measures were a departure from previous editions of standards and redefined quality in services in terms of an organization’s capability to facilitate outcomes for people.

CQL used the term “personal outcomes” in contrast to “process outcomes”. Process outcomes are concerned with an organization’s compliance with norms or regulations. They measure organizational accomplishments, such as number of placements, hours of service delivery, staffing ratios, or number of people served in a program. Personal outcomes focus on the issues that matter most to the person receiving the services provided by the organization. They answer the question of “how well did the organization deliver its services to meet the individual needs and desires of each person?” The CQL accreditation process with the Personal Outcome Measures is built around interviews with people receiving services and learning how each person defines the outcomes for him or herself. From this understanding of what each individual wants, the organization is evaluated on how well it delivered person centered services and support. The Personal Outcome Measures apply to people with mental illness, children, youth and families, and other at risk or vulnerable people in the human service system.

In 2005, CQL published ''Quality Measures 2005&gt; emphasizing Community Life as the context for quality.

In the Fall of 2010, CQL published the [http://www.c-q-l.org/organizationtransformation.aspx '''Guide to Person-centered Excellence'''] as the culmination of the '''What Really Matters''' Initiative. CQL developed the '''Guide to Person-centered Excellence''' to encourage organizations to provide the supports and services for people that really matter. The Guide utilizes [http://www.c-q-l.org/factors.aspx CQL's 8 Key Factors and 34 Success Indicators] that promote personal quality of life. CQL developed three different applications, one for each setting: services and supports for older adults, people with mental illness, and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The 34 Success Indicators are consistent across all three settings, while the narratives are tailored to apply to the specific audience and service setting.

CQL continues to place the Personal Outcome Measures® at the foundation of work with organizations. One-to-one conversations with people receiving supports are the most powerful source of knowledge and understanding when it comes to defining excellence and person-centeredness.

'''''The Great Debaters''''' is a 2007 American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[drama (genre)|drama film]] directed by and starring [[Denzel Washington]]. It is based on an article written about the [[Wiley College]] [[debate]] team by Tony Scherman for the spring 1997 issue of ''[[American Legacy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacknews.com/pr/americanlegacy701.html BlackNews.com – American Legacy Magazine's Story The Great Debaters Turns from Pages to the Big Screen Directed By and Starring Denzel Washington and Produced By Oprah Winfrey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630181528/http://www.blacknews.com/pr/americanlegacy701.html |date=June 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film co-stars [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Kimberly Elise]], [[Nate Parker]], [[Gina Ravera]], [[Jermaine Williams]] and [[Jurnee Smollett]]. The screenplay is by Robert Eisele, with a story by Robert Eisele &amp; Jeffrey Porro. The film was released in theaters on December 25, 2007.&lt;ref name=movie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreatdebatersmovie.com/site.html |title=The Great Debaters – Official Site |publisher=Thegreatdebatersmovie.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Based on a true story, the plot revolves around the efforts of debate coach [[Melvin B. Tolson]] ([[Denzel Washington]]) at [[Wiley College]], a Historically Black College, to place his team on equal footing with whites in the American South during the 1930s, when [[Jim Crow laws]] were common and lynch mobs were a fear for blacks. The Wiley team eventually succeeds to the point where they are able to debate [[Harvard University]]. This was their 47th annual debate team.

The movie explores the social constructs in Texas during the [[Great Depression]] including not only the day-to-day insults and slights African Americans endured, but also a [[lynching]]. Also depicted is [[James Farmer|James L. Farmer, Jr.]] ([[Denzel Whitaker]]), who, at 14 years old, was on Wiley's debate team after completing high school (and who later went on to co-found C.O.R.E., the [[Congress of Racial Equality]]). According to the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', another character depicted on the team, Samantha Booke, is based on the real individual [[Henrietta Bell Wells]], the only female member of the 1930 debate team from Wiley College who participated in the first collegiate interracial debate in the United States. Wells also happened to be an African American poet whose papers are housed at the [[Library of Congress]].

The key line of dialogue, used several times, is a famous paraphrase of [[Augustine of Hippo]]: "An unjust law is no law at all."
 
Another major line, repeated in slightly different versions according to context, concerns doing what you "have to do" in order that we "can do" what we "want to do." In all instances, these vital lines are spoken by the James L. Farmer Sr. and James L. Farmer, Jr. characters.

The film depicts the Wiley Debate team beating Harvard College in the 1930s. They did not debate Harvard, however. The debate depicted in the film instead mirrored the match up between Wiley and the [[University of Southern California]], who at the time were the reigning debating champions.  Wiley College did indeed win this matchup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/education/05wiley.html |title=For Struggling Black College, Hopes of a Revival |accessdate=2007-12-05|date=2007-12-05 |publisher=[[NY Times]] | first=Laura | last=Beil}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Eisele: "In that era, there was much at stake when a black college debated any white school, particularly one with the stature of Harvard.

The film omits another reality: even though they beat the reigning champions, the Great Debaters were not allowed to call themselves victors because they were not truly considered to belong to the debate society; [[African Americans|blacks]] were not admitted until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/education/05wiley.html For Struggling Black College, Hopes of a Revival]."

The '''Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets''' ('''VAAFM''') or sometimes colloquially ''the agriculture department,'' is a [[Vermont]] executive agency (or cabinet agency). Its purpose is to develop and execute policy on farming, agriculture, food, and promoting and protecting the Vermont brand as related to food in the worldwide market. It aims to meet the needs of dairy farmers, beekeepers, orchardists, maple sugarmakers, and related industries. The VAAFM promotes agricultural trade and production, work to assure food safety, protect natural resources, and preserve the culture of rural communities.

Charles Ross of [[Hinesburg, Vermont|Hinesburg]] is the agency's current secretary.

==Divisions==
The VAAFM is organized into four divisions:
*The Division of Administration oversees and coordinates agency policy and promotes interests of consumers and producers.
*The Division of Agricultural Development provides a role in developing local, regional, national and global markets for Vermont's agricultural products.
*The Division of Agricultural Resource Management and Environmental Stewardship works to regulates pesticides, feed, seed and fertilizers. The division administers Vermont's agricultural water quality programs and enforcement of environmental and safety laws.
*The Division of Food Safety and Consumer Protection is organized into the following sections providing oversight in the areas of: livestock heath, consumer safety and protection, dairy inspection, and meat inspection.

==Standards of quality==
[[File:VTagency.png|thumb|right|200|The [[Vermont Seal of Quality]] is allowed for Vermont grown agricultural products meeting agency standards and are subject to frequent agency inspection.]]
One role of the agency is the regulation and maintenance of quality. This goes hand in hand with the management of the Vermont brand as a reliable source of quality. While meeting all [[United States Department of Agriculture]] standards, Vermont exceeds those standards in the areas of dairy and maple products. [[Maple syrup]] produced in Vermont has a higher percentage of maple solids reflected in a higher weight per gallon than maple syrup from other U.S. states or Canada. The [[butterfat]] content of Vermont [[butter]] exceeds USDA minimums and equals those of the [[Ministry of Agriculture (France)|French Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries]], the highest standards set by a national government.

Vermont-grown and -produced agricultural products meeting the agency's standards may display the [[Vermont Seal of Quality]] in its packaging and promotion.

==History==
In 2015, Act 64 required the agency to revise all Required Agricultural Practices to include small farms, nutrient storage (usually manure), [[soil health]], buffer zones (from runoff areas), livestock exclusion, and nutrient management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first= | last= | title=RAP public comment deadline, December 18 | url=| newspaper=The Chronicle | location=Barton, Vermont | pages= 24A | date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boris Spiegel.jpg|thumb|Founder and chairman [[Boris Spiegel]]]]

'''World Without Nazism''' (WWN) ({{lang-ru|Мир без нацизма, МБН}}), or Mir Bez Natsizma (MBH), is a Russian political organization with ties to [[Vladimir Putin]]'s government, which claims to campaign against "[[neo-fascism]]."&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/12/19/spies-are-back-espionage-booming-new-cold-war-290686.html|author=Elisabeth Braw|title=Russian Spies Return to Europe in 'New Cold War'|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has also been described, by security agencies from the [[Baltic republics]], as a Russian [[propaganda]] organization,&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"/&gt; and as a [[Kremlin]]-sponsored [[GONGO]], {{r|DB150208}} which aims to advance Russian foreign policies against formerly Soviet-occupied countries and to promote "a [[Soviet]]-era approach to [[World War II]]".&lt;ref name=kapo/&gt; The organization was founded and is led by [[Boris Spiegel]], a [[Russian oligarchs|Russian oligarch]] with close ties to Putin. It was founded in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], on 22 June 2010, and is registered in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwithoutnazism.wordpress.com/about/declaration/ Constituent Declaration “World without Nazism” Movement.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ng.ru/ideas/2012-01-30/9_holokost.html|script-title=ru:Без права на новый Холокост|trans-title=Without the right to a new Holocaust|work=[[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]]|date=30 January 2012|language=ru|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruvek.ru/?module=newsp&amp;action=view&amp;id=8003|script-title=ru:МИД РФ поддержит неграждан Латвии через суд|trans-title=MFA of RF will support non-citizens of Latvia through court|work=Русский век|date=22 December 2011|language=ru|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation accuses the countries that were formerly part of the [[Communist Bloc]] of "rapid nazification." It criticizes the "Western European democracies" for their alleged role in starting World War II and proposes a common history textbook for all of Europe based on "serious scientific study, as well as the decisions of international judicial and political authorities on which basis the postwar world order had been built" (see [[historiography in the Soviet Union]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rusembassy.nl/index.php/en/component/content/article/122-wwn-statement|title=Statement by the "World without Nazism" movement|author=[[Boris Spiegel]]|date=22 November 2011|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Embassy of Russia in the Netherlands]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65CZKcFDU|archivedate=2012-02-03|accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
World Without Nazism has declared its official aims to be:
* establishment of an international "early warning" system, monitoring and prevention of the uprising and spread of nazi ideas and actions;
* establishment of interaction with national, European and international law enforcement and judicial bodies in order to suppress any manifestations of neo-nazism, racism and xenophobia, including glorification of its accomplices, struggle against those who deny Holocaust,
* cooperation with international European organizations, parliaments, public associations overseeing de-nazification processes in the UN member states,
* incorporation into the educational system of the [[Council of Europe]] member-states (and further on of other states) of obligatory programs of teaching the Second World War and Holocaust history;
* popularization of publicist materials, films, works of literature and art which cover issues of revival of the nazism threat, the need to struggle against it;
* support of organizations initiating investigation of activities against persons who are accessorial to nazi crimes of the Second World War;
* perpetuation of the memory of victims of the [[Second World War]] and [[Holocaust]], heroes of Resistance and Soldiers-Liberators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stopnazism.wordpress.com/about/declaration/ Constituent Declaration “World without Nazism” Movement].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a member of Russian Public Chamber and founder of a sub-section of World Without Nazism in Russia [[Alexander Brod]], the organization also attempts to protect Russian-speaking citizens in the [[Baltic States]].&lt;ref&gt;Александр Брод: "Влияние МИД России на площадке прибалтийских стран абсолютно не ощутимо". http://regnum.su/news/fd-abroad/latvia/1446504.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--  compatriots programmes are{{by whom|date=February 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;Russian Soft Power in the 21st Century.

==Criticism==
WWN has been accused of being a [[GONGO]], "a pseudo-independent outfit that a country (usually authoritarian or non-democratic in nature) establishes to mimic an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] so as to deceive the media, public and other governments."&lt;ref name=DB150208&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/08/anti-nazi-group-secretly-helping-kremlin-rebuild-russian-empire.html |title=Anti-Nazi Group Secretly Helping Kremlin Rebuild Russian Empire|author=Kirchick, James|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=8 February 2015|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation is under observation by the police in Estonia because security officials allege its membership includes suspected extremists.&lt;ref name="kapo"/&gt; The organization is described in the Annual Review of the [[Estonian Security Police]] as a [[propaganda]] organization aimed at promoting "a [[Soviet]]-era approach to [[World War II]]."&lt;ref name=kapo/&gt; According to Estonian security officials, certain members of the organization are [[Radical nationalism in Russia|radical nationalists]] who promote Russian [[chauvinism]].&lt;ref name="kapo"/&gt; The Annual Review states that World Without Nazism cooperates closely with Russian state controlled media channels and Russian Federation embassies in target countries. It also states that WWN's goal is to create a situation according to which questioning Moscow's version of history regarding the Soviet [[occupation of the Baltic states]] and [[The Holodomor]] is equated with denial of the Holocaust.&lt;!-- particularly{{Failed verification|date=February 2012}}--&gt;.&lt;ref name="kapo"/&gt; Five WWN members who are also members of the [[New York State Assembly]] wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister of Estonia A. Ansip objecting against calling the WWN extremist.&lt;ref name="Letter to Andrus Ansip"&gt;[[Steven Cymbrowitz]], [[Alec Brook-Krasny]], [[Kevin Cahill]], [[Michelle Schimel]], [[Linda Rosenthal]] [http://worldwithoutnazism.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/estonian-prime-minister-letter-albany-07-28-11.jpg Letter to Andrus Ansip], 28 July 2011. Retrieved 14 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to V. Likhachev, a Ukrainian Congress of Ethnic Communities official, WWN accuses selected governments unsympathetic to Russia of [[anti-semitism]], [[radical nationalism]], support of neo-fascists, [[Holocaust denial]], hindering the prosecution of alleged [[Nazi war criminals]] and revisionist politics toward the consequences of the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Likhachev also alleges that the allegations are not directed against Kremlin-friendly authoritarian regimes and that WWN is profoundly focused on instances of anti-semitism by the government of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], which is pro-Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Украина без нацизма" – что это? http://noborders.org.ua/ru/o-nas/novosti/ukrayna-bez-natsyzma-chto-eto/&lt;/ref&gt; According to James Kirchick of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', the WWN employed the "fascist" label to defame governments in eastern Europe which are opposed to Russian influence.{{r|DB150208}}.

==Support==
The 2010 conference, where WWN was founded, received letters of support from [[Hillary Clinton]] and from the Ukrainian prime minister, and was attended by Ukraine's minister of education and the Israeli minister without portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://netania.israelinfo.ru/news/1830?print Мир без нацизма]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://antifashist.com/last-news/197-v-kieve-otkrylas-konferenciya.html|title=В Киеве открылась международная конференция "Уроки Второй мировой войны и Холокоста: роль СМИ в противодействии искажению истории ХХ века"|trans-title=International conference "Lessons of the Second World War and the Holocaust: the role of the media in countering the distortion of the history of the twentieth century" was opened in Kiev|publisher=Anti-Fascist Forum of Ukraine|language=ru|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian foreign minister Lavrov referred to WWN in a meeting held with Russian NGO representatives in March, 2011, pointing it out as a leading example of NGOs working to "counter attempts to rewrite and distort history, primarily the outcome of World War II."&lt;ref name=Lavrov2011Mar23/&gt; Lavrov also praised WWN for its actions in support of Lithuanian Socialist People's Front leader [[Algirdas Paleckis]], who was accused of justifying the armed aggression by the Soviet Union against a [[January Events (Lithuania)|popular gathering in Lithuania]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=Lavrov2011Mar23&gt;Тезисы выступления Министра иностранных дел России С.В.Лаврова на встрече с представителями российских неправительственных организаций международной специализации, Москва, 23 марта 2011 года. http://www.ln.mid.ru/bdomp/brp_4.nsf/2fee282eb6df40e643256999005e6e8c/ad9e5f2a6a3a02abc325785c005d6231!OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

The WWN 2012 conference in Moscow was organised under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe and in cooperation with the Federation Council of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://council.gov.ru/events/main_themes/16031/|script-title=ru:Изощрённым приемам неонацистской пропаганды нужно противопоставлять новые позитивные идеи|publisher=Federation Council of Russia|date=26 January 2012|language=ru|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
WWN is an [[umbrella organization]] for 131{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} different organizations. According to Estonian Security Police, many of the member organizations are involved in carrying out the Russian policy of compatriots or implementing Russian informational influence in target countries. [[Johan Bäckman]] is a board member and a leader of the [[Finnish Anti-Fascist Committee]].&lt;ref name=kapo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kapo.ee/cms-data/_text/138/124/files/kapo-aastaraamat-2010-eng.pdf|publisher=[[Estonian Security Police]]|title=Annual Review 2010 of the Security Police Board|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Ossetian Republic]] is considered an independent state by WWN and the South Ossetian Anti-Fascist Committee (Юго-Осетинский антифашистский комитет) is also a full member of MBN. Some member organizations are considered extremist by Estonian security forces. For example, WWN's management board has two Estonian resident representatives, Maksim Reva and Andrei Zarenkov, who the [[Estonian Security Police]] describes as radical nationalists who promote Russian chauvinism.&lt;ref name=kapo/&gt;

Other founding members listed on WWN website include [[Moscow Bureau for Human Rights]] and the [[Anti-Defamation League]], a US organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldwithoutnazism.wordpress.com/membersrus/ СПИСОК ОРГАНИЗАЦИЙ-УЧРЕДИТЕЛЕЙ МПД «МИР БЕЗ НАЦИЗМА»]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of WWN in 2010, some member organizations in different countries have renamed themselves to show they are subsidiaries of WWN: e.g. America Without Nazism, Natsivaba Eesti (Estonia without Nazism) and Rossija Bez Natsisma (RBN).

==Organisation==
The founder and chairman of World Without Nazism is [[Boris Spiegel]], a member of the [[Russian Federation Council]],&lt;ref name="Руководящие органы"&gt;[http://worldwithoutnazism.wordpress.com/about/11-2/ Руководящие органы] World Without Nazism{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is described by an opinion piece in Haaretz as a Kremlin-connected [[Russian oligarchs|oligarch]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/head-of-world-congress-of-russian-jewry-accuses-georgia-of-genocide-1.251932&lt;/ref&gt; The MBN presidium consists of 15 persons from different countries. In addition to the presidium, MBN has another wider ruling body, MBN Sovet (Council), which consists of 39 members (including 15 members of the Presidium). Additional five members, among them MEP [[Tatyana Zhdanoka]], are included in the MBN Sovet according to "a separate list".&lt;ref name="Руководящие органы"/&gt;

In 2014 statement regarding the [[War in Donbass|war in Ukraine]] the organization had said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The absence of the international community's reaction can repeat the Kristallnacht [Night of Broken Glass] for non-Ukrainians and other ethnic minorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tass.com/world/723023|title=World Without Nazism movement warns about threats Ukraine's Nazi pose to ethnic minorities|agency=[[TASS]]|date=11 March 2014|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

WWN states "the tendency to equate Soviet and the Nazi regime against a background of rapid nazification and radicalization of social consciousness in the former communist bloc" is not a coincidence. It advocates "a wide open scientific discussion on the history of the twentieth century, which could shed some light on the crimes of totalitarian regimes and the role of the Western democracies in the outbreak of World War II." It also proposes a common history textbook for all of Europe based on "serious scientific study, as well as the decisions of international judicial and political authorities on which basis the postwar world order had been built".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rusembassy.nl/index.php/en/component/content/article/122-wwn-statement |title= Statement by the "World without Nazism" movement |author=[[Boris Spiegel]] |date= 22 November 2011 |work= |publisher= [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Embassy of Russia in the Netherlands]]|archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/65CZKcFDU | archivedate = 2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Italy}}
The '''Years of Lead''' ({{lang-it|Anni di piombo}}) is a term used for a period of social and political turmoil in [[Italy]] that lasted from the late 1960s until the early 1980s, marked by a wave of both left-wing and right-wing incidents of [[political terrorism]].

The Years of Lead are often considered to have begun with the [[Hot Autumn]] [[strike action|strikes]] starting in 1969; the death of the policeman [[Antonio Annarumma]] who was killed in a leftist demonstration in November 1969; the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] in December of that year, which killed 17 and was likely perpetrated by [[right-wing terrorist]]s in Milan; and the subsequent death of [[Giuseppe Pinelli]] while in police custody.&lt;ref name=MontanelliCervi&gt;{{cite book |first=Indro |last=Montanelli |author2=Mario Cervi|title=L'Italia degli anni di piombo|place=Milan, Lombardy, Italy |publisher=Rizzoli Editore | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term's origin possibly came as a reference to the number of shootings during the period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3372239.stm | work=BBC News | first=Kathryn | last=Westcott | title=Italy's history of terror | date=January 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a popular 1981 German film ''[[Marianne and Juliane]]'', released in Italy as ''Anni di piombo'', which centered on the lives of two members of the West German militant far-left group [[Red Army Faction]] which had gained notoriety during the same period.

== The "Hot Autumn" and widespread unrest of 1960s and 1970s ==
There was widespread social conflict and unprecedented acts of terrorism carried out by both right- and left-wing paramilitary groups. An attempt to endorse the [[neo-fascist]] [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI) by the [[Tambroni Cabinet]] led to rioting and was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Indro |last=Montanelli |author2=Mario Cervi|title=L'Italia dei due Giovanni|place=Milan, Lombardy, Italy |publisher=Rizzoli Editore | year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread [[labor unrest]] and the collaboration of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] [[Student activism|student activist]] groups with [[working class]] factory workers and pro-labor radical leftist organizations such as [[Potere Operaio]] and [[Lotta Continua]] culminated in the so-called "[[Hot Autumn]]" of 1969, a massive series of [[strike action|strikes]] in factories and industrial centers in [[Northern Italy]].&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt; [[Student strike]]s and labor strikes, often led by workers, leftists, left-sympathizing laborers, or Marxist activists, became increasingly common, often deteriorating into clashes between the police and demonstrators composed largely of workers, students, activists, and often left-wing militants.&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt; The [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] (DC) were instrumental in the [[Italian Socialist Party]] (PSI) gaining power in the 1960s and they created a coalition. [[Kidnapping of Aldo Moro|The assassination]] of the Christian Democrat leader [[Aldo Moro]] in 1978 ended the strategy of ''[[historic compromise]]'' between the DC and the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI). The assassination was carried out by the [[Red Brigades]], then led by [[Mario Moretti]]. Between 1968 and 1988,&lt;ref name="lettera43.it"/&gt; 428 murders were attributed to political violence in the form of bombings, [[assassination]]s, and [[Urban warfare|street warfare]] between rival militant factions.

== Chronology ==

=== 1969 ===

==== Public protests ====
Public protests shook Italy during 1969, with the [[autonomist]] student movement being particularly active, leading to the [[factory occupation|occupation]] of the [[Fiat]] automobile factory in [[Milan]].

==== Death of Antonio Annarumma ====
On 19 November 1969, [[Antonio Annarumma]], a Milanese policeman, was killed during a riot by far-left demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cadutipolizia.it/fonti/1943{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 1981/1969annarumma.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadutipolizia.it/articoli2007/conseguenza.htm |title=Nessuna Conseguenza – La Morte di Antonio Annarumma |publisher=Cadutipolizia.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first civil servant to die in the wave of violence.

==== Piazza Fontana bombing ====
{{Main|Piazza Fontana bombing}}
The Monument to [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], the ''[[Banca Nazionale del Lavoro]]'' in Rome and the ''[[Banca Commerciale Italiana]]'' and the ''[[Piazza Fontana bombing|Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura]]'' in [[Milan]] were bombed in December.

Local police arrested 80 or so suspects from left-wing groups, including [[Giuseppe Pinelli]], an anarchist initially blamed for the bombing, and [[Pietro Valpreda]]. Their guilt was denied by left-wing members, especially by members of the [[Student activism|student movement]], then prominent in Milan's universities, as they believed that the bombing was carried out by fascists. Following the death of Giuseppe Pinelli, who mysteriously died on 15 December while in police custody, the radical left-wing newspaper ''Lotta Continua'' started a campaign accusing police officer [[Luigi Calabresi]] of Pinelli's murder.&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zavoli&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sergio |last=Zavoli |title=La notte della repubblica |place=Rome, Lazio, Italy |publisher=Nuova Eri |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Calabresi and other police officials were acquitted by judge [[Gerardo D'Ambrosio]] who decided that Pinelli's fall from a window had been caused by his being taken ill and losing his balance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDexzkoW1twC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=piazza+fontana+bombing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a3Ca-TKSIF&amp;sig=3Gu6EsXtdFOOD9JwR77mhtbJitA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAjgoahUKEwix5_q7-5PJAhVCJR4KHVmOCFs#v=onepage&amp;q=piazza%20fontana%20bombing&amp;f=false Bull, Anna Cento and Cooke, Philip. ''Ending Terrorism in Italy'', Routledge, 2013] {{ISBN|9781135040802}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,11/articleid,1109_01_1975_0250_0011_21477257/ "Né omicidio né suicidio: Pinelli cadde perché colto da malore"], ''[[La Stampa]]'', October 29, 1975 {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the anarchist Valpreda and five others were convicted and jailed for the bombing. They were later released after three years of [[preventive detention]]. Then, two neo-fascists, [[Franco Freda]] (resident in [[Padua]]) and [[Giovanni Ventura]], were arrested accused of being the organizers of the massacre; in 1987 they were acquitted by the Supreme Court for lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/01/28/strage-di-piazza-fontana-azzerati-17-anni.html?ref=search "STRAGE DI PIAZZA FONTANA AZZERATI 17 ANNI DI INDAGINI"], ''[[la Repubblica]]'', January 28, 1987 {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, new investigations into the Piazza Fontana bombing, citing new witnesses testimony, implicated Freda and Ventura again.

The [[Red Brigades]], the most prominent far-left terrorist organization, conducted a secret internal investigation that paralleled the official inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Inchieste di Robbiano di Mediglia]] Inquiry of the Red Brigades in Italy Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt; They ordered that the inquiry remain secret, because of the unfavorable light that it could shed on other terrorist organizations. The inquiry was discovered after a shootout between the Red Brigade and the [[Carabinieri]] at Robbiano di Mediglia in October 1974. The cover-up was exposed in 2000 by [[Giovanni Pellegrino]], at the time President of the Commissione Stragi (Parliamentary Committee on massacres).&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Commissione Stragi]] "Commissione Stragi" in Italy Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970 ===

==== Birth of the Red Brigades ====
The [[Red Brigades]] were founded in August 1970 by [[Renato Curcio]] and [[Margherita Cagol|Margherita (Mara) Cagol]], who had met as students at the [[University of Trento]] and later married,&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt; and [[Alberto Franceschini]].

While the Trento group around Curcio had its main roots in the Sociology Department of the Catholic University, the Reggio Emilia group (around Franceschini) mostly included former members of the FGCI (the Communist youth movement) expelled from the parent party for their extremist views.&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt;

Another group of militants came from the Sit-Siemens factories in [[Milan]]; these were [[Mario Moretti]], a union official, [[Corrado Alunni]], who would leave the Red Brigades to found another organization «fighter» and [[Alfredo Buonavita]], a blue-collar worker.&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt;

The first action of the RB was burning the car of Giuseppe Leoni (a leader of Sit-Siemens company in Milan) on 17 September 1970, in the context of the labour unrest within the factory.

==== The ''Golpe Borghese'' ====
In December, a neo-fascist coup, dubbed the ''[[Golpe Borghese]]'', was planned by young far-right fanatics, elderly veterans of [[Italian Social Republic]], and supported by members of the ''[[State Forestry Corps (Italy)|Corpo Forestale dello Stato]]'', along with right-aligned entrepreneurs and industrialists. The "Black Prince", [[Junio Valerio Borghese]], took part in it. The coup, called off at the last moment, was discovered by the newspaper ''[[Paese Sera]]'', and publicly exposed three months later.&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt;

=== 1971 ===

==== Assassination of Alessandro Floris ====
On March 26, [[Alessandro Floris]] was assassinated in Genoa by a unit of the [[October 22 Group]], a far-left terrorist organization. An amateur photographer had taken a photo of the killer that enabled police to identify the terrorists. The group was investigated, and more members arrested. Some fled to Milan and joined the "[[Gruppi di Azione Partigiana]]" (GAP) and, later, the Red Brigades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/floris.htm |title=Alessandro Floris – Associazione Vittime del Terrorismo |publisher=Vittimeterrorismo.it |date=1939-10-21 |accessdate=2010-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114084953/http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/floris.htm |archive-date=2009-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Brigades considered Gruppo XXII Ottobre its predecessor and, in April 1974, they kidnapped Judge [[Mario Sossi]] in a failed attempt at freeing the jailed members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivio900.it/it/nomi/nom.aspx?id=1462 |title=Mario Sossi − |publisher=Archivio900.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, the Red Brigades killed judge Francesco Coco on June 8, 1976, along with his two police escorts, Giovanni Saponara and Antioco Deiana, in revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/coco.htm |title=Francesco Coco – Associazione Vittime del Terrorismo |publisher=Vittimeterrorismo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506083102/http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/coco.htm |archive-date=2010-05-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1972 ===

==== Assassination of Luigi Calabresi ====
On 17 May 1972, police officer Luigi Calabresi, a recipient of the gold medal of the Italian Republic for civil valour, was killed in Milan. Authorities initially focused on suspects in ''Lotta Continua''; then it was assumed that the Calabresi had been killed by neo-fascist organizations, bringing about the arrest of two neo-fascist activists, Gianni Nardi and Bruno Stefano, along with [[Germans|German]] Gudrun Kiess, in 1974. They were ultimately released. Sixteen years later, [[Adriano Sofri]], [[Giorgio Petrostefani]], [[Ovidio Bompressi]], and [[Leonardo Marino]] were arrested in Milan following Marino's confession to the murder. Their trial finally established their guilt in organising and carrying out the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/calabresi.htm |title=Luigi Calabresi – Associazione Vittime del Terrorismo |publisher=Vittimeterrorismo.it |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519220952/http://www.vittimeterrorismo.it/memorie/schede/calabresi.htm |archive-date=2009-05-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Calabresi's assassination opened the chapter of assassinations carried out by armed groups of the far-left.&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt;

==== Peteano bombing ====
{{Further|Vincenzo Vinciguerra#The 1972 Peteano bombing}}
On 31 May 1972, three Italian [[Carabinieri]] were killed in [[Peteano]] in a bombing, attributed to ''Lotta Continua''. Officers of the Carabinieri were later indicted and convicted for perverting the course of justice.&lt;ref name=Ginzburg&gt;[[Carlo Ginzburg]], ''The Judge and the Historian. Marginal Notes and a Late-Twentieth-century Miscarriage of Justice'', London 1999, {{ISBN|1-85984-371-9}}. Original ed. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Casson identified ''[[Ordine Nuovo]]'' member [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra]] as the man who had planted the Peteano bomb.

The neo-fascist terrorist Vinciguerra, arrested in the 1980s for the bombing in [[Sagrado|Peteano]], declared to magistrate [[Felice Casson]] that this [[false flag]] attack had been intended to force the Italian state to declare a [[state of emergency]] and to become more [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]. Vinciguerra explained how the [[SISMI]] military intelligence agency had protected him, allowing him to escape to [[Francoist Spain]].

Casson's investigation revealed that the right-wing organization Ordine Nuovo had collaborated with the Italian Military Secret Service, [[SISMI|SID]] (''Servizio Informazioni Difesa''). Together, they had engineered the Peteano attack and then blamed the Red Brigades. He confessed and testified that he had been covered by a network of sympathizers in Italy and abroad who had ensured that he could escape after the attack. «A whole mechanism came into action», Vinciguerra recalled, «that is, the Carabinieri, the [[Italian Minister of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]], the customs services and the military and civilian intelligence services accepted the ideological reasoning behind the attack.»&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Ganser, ''NATO's Secret Armies.

=== 1973 ===

==== The Primavalle Fire ====
{{Main|Primavalle Fire}}
A 16 April 1973 attack by members of [[Potere Operaio]] on the house of neo-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI) militant Mario Mattei resulted in his two sons, aged 8 and 20, being burned alive.

==== Milan Police command bombing ====
During a 17 May 1973 ceremony honoring Luigi Calabresi, in which the Interior Minister was present, [[Gianfranco Bertoli]], an [[anarchism|anarchist]], threw a bomb that killed four and injured 45.

In 1975, Bertoli was sentenced to life imprisonment: the Milan Court wrote that he was embroiled in connections with the far-right, that was a SID informant and a confidant of the Police.&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt;

In the 1990s it was suspected that Bertoli was a member of [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] but he denied it in an interview: in the list of 622 Gladio members made public in 1990, his name is missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,6/articleid,0699_01_1995_0078_0006_10327158/ "Io spia dei Servizi?

A magistrate investigating the assassination attempt of Mariano Rumor found that Bertoli's files were incomplete.&lt;ref name="Ginzburg"/&gt; General [[:it:Gianadelio Maletti|Gianadelio Maletti]], head of the SID from 1971 to 1975, was convicted ''in absentia'' in 1990 for obstruction of justice in the Mariano Rumor case.

==== Piazza della Loggia bombing ====
{{Main|Piazza della Loggia bombing}}
In May 1974, a bomb exploded during an anti-fascist demonstration in [[Brescia]], killing eight and wounding 102. On 16 November 2010, the Court of Brescia acquitted the defendants: [[Francesco Delfino]] (a Carabiniere), [[Carlo Maria Maggi (politician)|Carlo Maria Maggi]], [[Pino Rauti]], [[Maurizio Tramonte]] and [[Delfo Zorzi]] (members of the ''[[Ordine Nuovo]]'' [[neo-fascist]] group). The prosecutor had requested life sentences for Delfino, Maggi, Tramonte and Zorzi, and acquittal for lack of evidence for Pino Rauti. The four defendants were acquitted again by the appeal court in 2012 but, in 2014, the supreme court ruled that the appeal trial would have to be held again at the appeal court of [[Milan]] for Maggi and Tramonte. Delfino and Zorzi were definitively acquitted. On July 22, 2015, the appeal court sentenced Maggi and Tramonte to life imprisonment for ordering and co-ordinating the massacre.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Strage di piazza Loggia, ergastolo ai neofascisti Maggi e Tramonte|url = http://brescia.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/15_luglio_22/strage-piazza-loggia-giorno-sentenza-21d95ef0-3062-11e5-8ebc-a14255a4c77f.shtml|accessdate = 2015-07-23|website = Corriere della Sera|language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== First murder of the [[Red Brigades]] ====
On 17 June 1974, two members of MSI were murdered in [[Padua]]. Initially, an internal feud between neo-fascist groups was suspected, since the crime had occurred in the city of [[Franco Freda]]. However, the murder was then claimed by the Red Brigades: it was the first murder of the organization,&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt; which, until then had only committed robberies, bombings and kidnappings.&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt;

==== Planned neo-fascist coup ====
Count [[Edgardo Sogno]] said in his memoirs that in July 1974, he visited the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) station chief in Rome to inform him of preparations for a neo-fascist coup. Asking what the United States (US) government would do in case of such a coup, Sogno wrote that he was told, "the United States would have supported any initiative tending to keep the communists out of government." 
General Maletti declared, in 2001, that he had not known about Sogno's relationship with the CIA and had not been informed about the coup, known as ''[[Golpe bianco]]'' (White Coup), led by [[Randolfo Pacciardi]].&lt;ref name="WillanCIA"&gt;[[Philip Willan]], [https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,462976,00.html "Terrorists 'helped by CIA' to stop rise of left in Italy"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 26, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August, 12 died and 105 were injured in the [[Italicus Express bombing 1974|bombing of the Italicus Roma-Brennero express]] at San Benedetto Val di Sambro.

==== Arrest of Vito Miceli ====
General [[Vito Miceli]], chief of the [[SIOS]] military intelligence agency in 1969, and head of the [[SISMI|SID]] from 1970 to 1974, was arrested in 1974 on charges of «conspiracy against the state».&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt; Following his arrest, the Italian secret services were reorganized by a 24 October 1977 law in an attempt to reassert civilian control over the intelligence agencies. The SID was divided into the current [[SISMI]], the [[SISDE]], and the [[CESIS]], which was to directly coordinate with the [[Prime Minister of Italy]]. An [[Italian Parliamentary Committee on Secret services control]] (Copaco) was created at the same time{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Miceli was acquitted in 1978.&lt;ref name="Zavoli"/&gt;

==== Arrest of Red Brigades leaders ====
In 1974, some leaders of the Red Brigades, including [[Renato Curcio]] and [[Alberto Franceschini]], were arrested, but new leadership continued the war against the Italian right-wing establishment with increased fervor.&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt;

There were technical conditions for ending terrorism: however, the political class was unwilling: the Italian left wing was less worried by the existence of an armed organization than by the possible abuses by the police against protesters. It did therefore ask for the disarmament of police during street demonstrations. Also in the ruling [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]), many underestimated the threat of the Red Brigades (speaking of "phantom" Red Brigades), emphasizing instead that of neo-fascist groups.&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt;

The year before, ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' had disbanded, although ''[[Autonomia Operaia]]'' carried on in its wake. ''Lotta Continua'' also dissolved in 1976, although their magazine struggled on for several years. From the remnants of ''Lotta Continua'' and similar groups, the terror organization ''[[Prima Linea]]'' emerged.

==== Kidnapping and assassination of Aldo Moro ====
{{Main|Kidnapping of Aldo Moro}}
On March 16, 1978, [[Aldo Moro]] was kidnapped by the [[Red Brigades]] (then led by [[Mario Moretti]]) and five of his security detail were killed. Aldo Moro was a left-leaning [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] who served several times as prime minister; before his murder, he had been trying to include the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), headed by [[Enrico Berlinguer]], in the government through a deal called the ''[[Historic Compromise]]''. PCI was, at the time, the largest communist party in western Europe; was mainly because of its non-extremist and pragmatic stance, its growing independence from Moscow and its [[Eurocommunism|eurocommunist]] doctrine. The PCI was especially strong in areas such as [[Emilia Romagna]], where it had stable government positions and mature practical experience, which may have contributed to a more pragmatic approach to politics. The Red Brigades were fiercely opposed by the Communist Party and [[trade union]]s: a few left-wing politicians even used the condescending expression "comrades who do wrong" (''Compagni che sbagliano''). {{Interlanguage link multi|Franco Bonisoli|it}}, one of RB's members who participated at the kidnapping, declared that the decision to kidnap Moro "was taken a week before, a day was decided, it could have been March 15 or 17".&lt;ref name="MontanelliCervi"/&gt;

On May 9, 1978, after a summary "trial of the people", Moro was murdered by Mario Moretti with, it was also determined, the participation of {{Interlanguage link multi|Germano Maccari|it}}.&lt;ref&gt;Flavio Haver, "Erano le 6.30, così uccidemmo Moro", ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', June 20, 1996 {{it|icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The corpse was found that same day in the trunk of a red Renault 4 in via Michelangelo Caetani, in downtown Rome. A consequence there was the fact that the PCI did not gain executive power.

Moro's assassination was followed by a large clampdown on the social movement, including the arrest of many members of ''[[Autonomia Operaia]]'', including, [[Oreste Scalzone]] and political philosopher [[Antonio Negri]] (arrested on 7 April 1979).

In April 2007 the Supreme Court confirmed the conviction of Luigi Ciavardini, a NAR member associated closely with close ties to ''[[Terza Posizione]]''. Ciavardini received a 30-year prison sentence for his role in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bologna bomber's 30-year jail term confirmed | publisher = Associated Press | date = April 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continued violence ==
In the late 1990s - early 2000s (decade), a resurgence of ''Red Brigades'' terrorism led to further assassinations.

On 20 May 1999, [[Massimo D'Antona]], consultant to the Ministry of Labour, was assassinated in an attack by a group of terrorists of the ''Red Brigades'' in Rome.

== Asylum ==

=== France ===
The [[Mitterrand doctrine]], which was established in 1985 by then French president [[François Mitterrand]], stated that Italian far-left terrorists who fled to France and who were convicted of violent acts in Italy, excluding "active, actual, bloody terrorism" during the "Years of Lead", would receive asylum and would not be subject to [[extradition]] to Italy. They would be integrated into French society.

The act was announced on 21 April 1985, at the 65th Congress of the [[Human Rights League (France)|Human Rights League]] (''Ligue des droits de l'homme'', LDH), stating that Italian criminals who had given up their violent pasts and had fled to France would be protected from extradition to Italy:

{{quote|Italian refugees ... who took part in terrorist action before 1981 ... have broken links with the infernal machine in which they participated, have begun a second phase of their lives, have integrated into French society ... I told the Italian government that they were safe from any sanction by the means of extradition.&lt;ref&gt;''Les réfugiés italiens ( ... ) qui ont participé à l'action terroriste avant 1981 ( ... ) ont rompu avec la machine infernale dans laquelle ils s'étaient engagés, ont abordé une deuxième phase de leur propre vie, se sont inséré dans la société française ( ... ). J'ai dit au gouvernement italien qu'ils étaient à l'abri de toute sanction par voie d'extradition ( ... ).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Brazil ===
Some Italian citizens accused of terrorist acts have found refuge in [[Brazil]] such as Cesare Battisti and others former members of the Armed Proletarians for Communism, a far-left militant and terrorist organization.

=== Nicaragua ===
Some Italian far-left activists found political asylum in [[Nicaragua]], including [[Alessio Casimirri]], who took part in the [[kidnapping of Aldo Moro]].

The '''Yogyakarta Principles''' is a document about [[human rights]] in the areas of [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], published as the outcome of an international meeting of human rights groups in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], in November 2006. The Principles were supplemented in 2017, expanding to include new grounds of [[gender expression]] and [[Sex characteristics (legal term)|sex characteristics]], and a number of new principles.

The Principles and the supplement contains a set of precepts intended to apply the standards of [[international human rights law]] to address the abuse of [[human rights]] of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) and [[intersex]] people.

==Versions of the Principles==
===The original 2007 Principles===
The Principles themselves are a lengthy document addressing legal matters. A website established to hold the principles and make them accessible has an overview of the principles,&lt;ref name=OVERVIEW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en_overview.htm|title=Untitled|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090627/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en_overview.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reproduced here in full:
* '''Preamble:''' The [[Preamble]] acknowledges human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity, which undermine the [[integrity]] and [[dignity]], establishes the relevant legal framework, and provides definitions of key terms.
* '''Rights to Universal Enjoyment of Human Rights, Non-Discrimination and Recognition before the Law:''' Principles 1 to 3 set out the principles of the universality of human rights and their application to all persons without [[discrimination]], as well as the right of all people to recognition as a [[person]] before the law without [[sex reassignment surgery]] or [[Sterilisation (medicine)|sterilisation]].
** ''Example:''
***Laws criminalising homosexuality violate the international right to non-discrimination (decision of the UN Human Rights Committee).
* '''Rights to Human and Personal Security:''' Principles 4 to 11 address fundamental rights to life, freedom from violence and [[torture]], [[privacy]], access to justice and freedom from arbitrary [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]], and [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;Principle 11. The Right to Protection from all form of exploitation, sale and trafficking of human being&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''Examples:''
*** The death penalty continues to be applied for consensual adult sexual activity between persons of the same sex, despite UN resolutions emphasizing that the death penalty may not be imposed for "sexual relations between consenting adults."
*** Eleven men were arrested in a gay bar and held in custody for over a year. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention concluded that the men were detained in violation of international law, noting with concern that "one of the prisoners died as a result of his arbitrary detention".
* '''Economic, Social and Cultural Rights:''' Principles 12 to 18 set out the importance of non-discrimination in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, including [[decent work|employment]], [[right to housing|accommodation]], [[social security]], [[education]], sexual and [[reproductive health]] including the right for [[informed consent]] and [[sex reassignment therapy]].
** ''Examples:''
*** Lesbian and transgender women are at increased risk of discrimination, [[homelessness]] and violence (report of [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on adequate housing).
*** Girls who display same-sex affection face discrimination and expulsion from educational institutions (report of UN Special Rapporteur on the right to [[education]]).
*** The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] has expressed concern about laws which "prohibit gender reassignment surgery for [[transsexual]]s or require [[intersex]] persons to undergo such surgery against their will".
* '''Rights to Expression, Opinion and Association:''' Principles 19 to 21 emphasise the importance of the freedom to express oneself, one's identity and one's [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]], without State interference based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including the rights to participate peaceably in public assemblies and events and otherwise associate in community with others.
** ''Example:''
*** A peaceful gathering to promote equality on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity was banned by authorities, and participants were harassed and intimidated by police and extremist nationalists shouting slogans such as "Let's get the fags" and "We'll do to you what Hitler did with Jews" (report of the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of [[racism]], [[racial discrimination]], [[xenophobia]] &amp; related [[Toleration|intolerance]]).
* '''Freedom of Movement and Asylum:''' Principles 22 and 23 highlight the rights of persons to seek [[right of asylum|asylum]] from persecution based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
** ''Example:''
*** Refugee protection should be accorded to persons facing a well-founded fear of persecution based on sexual orientation (Guidelines of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]).&lt;ref name="United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"/&gt;
* '''Rights of Participation in Cultural and Family Life:''' Principles 24 to 26 address the rights of persons to participate in family life, public affairs and the cultural life of their community, without discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
** ''Example:''
*** States have an obligation not to discriminate between different-sex and same-sex relationships in allocating partnership benefits such as survivors' pensions (decision of the UN Human Rights Committee).
* '''Rights of Human Rights Defenders:''' Principle 27 recognises the right to defend and promote human rights without discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and the obligation of States to ensure the protection of human rights defenders working in these areas.
** ''Examples:''
*** Human rights defenders working on sexual orientation and gender identity issues in countries and regions around the world "have been threatened, had their houses and offices raided, they have been attacked, tortured, sexually abused, tormented by regular death threats and even killed. A major concern in this regard is an almost complete lack of seriousness with which such cases are treated by the concerned authorities." (report of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on [[Human Rights Defenders]]).
* '''Rights of Redress and Accountability:''' Principles 28 and 29 affirm the importance of holding rights violators accountable, and ensuring appropriate redress for those who face rights violations.
** ''Example:''
*** The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed concern about "impunity for crimes of violence against LGBT persons" and "the responsibility of the State to extend effective protection. The High Commissioner notes that "excluding LGBT individuals from these protections clearly violates international human rights law as well as the common standards of humanity that define us all."
* '''Additional Recommendations:''' The Principles set out 16 additional recommendations to national human rights institutions, professional bodies, funders, [[NGO]]s, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, UN agencies, treaty bodies, Special Procedures, and others.
** ''Example:''
*** The Principles conclude by recognising the responsibility of a range of actors to promote and protect human rights and to integrate these standards into their work. A joint statement delivered at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] by 54 States from four of the five UN regions on 1 December 2006, for example, urges the Human Rights Council to "pay due attention to human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity" and commends the work of civil society in this area, and calls upon "all Special Procedures and treaty bodies to continue to integrate consideration of human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity within their relevant mandates." As this statement recognises, and the Yogyakarta Principles affirm, effective human rights protection truly is the responsibility of all.

===2017 Yogyakarta Principles plus 10===
* '''Preamble:''' The [[Preamble]] recalls developments in international human rights law, and an intention to regularly update the Principles. It defines gender expression and sex characteristics, applies these grounds to the original Principles, recognizes the [[intersectionality]] of the grounds adopted in the Principles, and their intersectionality with other grounds.
* '''The Rights to State Protection:''' Principle 30 recognises the right to State protection from violence, discrimination and harm, including the exercise of [[due diligence]] in prevention, investigation, prosecution and remedies.
* '''The Right to Legal Recognition:''' Principle 31 calls for a right to legal recognition without reference to sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics, ending the superfluous inclusion of such information in identification documents.
* '''The Right to Bodily and Mental Integrity:''' Principle 32 recognizes a right to bodily and mental integrity, autonomy and self-determination, including a freedom from torture and ill-treatment. It calls for no-one to be subjected to invasive or irreversible medical procedures to modify sex characteristics without their consent unless necessary to prevent urgent and serious harm.
* '''The Right to Freedom from Criminalization and Sanction:''' Principle 33 recognizes a right to freedom from indirect or direct criminalization or sanction, including in customary, religious, public decency, vagrancy, sodomy and propaganda laws.

* '''Additional State Obligations:''' the YP Plus 10 set out a range of additional obligations for States, including in relation to HIV status, access to sport, combating discrimination in prenatal selection and genetic modification technologies, detention and asylum, education, the right to health, and freedom of peaceful assembly and association.
* '''Additional Recommendations:''' the Principles also set out recommendations for [[national human rights institutions]] and sporting organizations.

==History==
The website promoting the Principles notes that concerns have been voiced about a trend of people's human rights being violated because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. While the United Nations [[international human rights instrument|human rights instruments]] detail obligations to ensure that people are protected from [[discrimination]] and [[LGBT stereotypes|stereotypes]],&lt;ref&gt;Preamble, Principle 25 (b) and Additional Recommendations (o) of the Yogyakarta Principles&lt;/ref&gt; which includes people's expression of sexual orientation or gender identity, implementation of these rights has been fragmented and inconsistent internationally. The Principles aim to provide a consistent understanding about application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref name = YOGYABOUT/&gt;

The Yogyakarta Principles were developed at a meeting of the [[International Commission of Jurists]], the [[International Service for Human Rights]] and human rights experts from around the world at [[Gadjah Mada University]] on [[Java (island)|Java]] from 6 to 9 November 2006. The seminar clarified the nature, scope and implementation of states' human rights obligations under existing human rights treaties and law, in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity.

We have human rights because we exist – not because we are gay or straight and irrespective of our gender identities", but that in many situations these human rights are not respected or realised, and that "the Yogyakarta Principles is to redress that situation".&lt;ref name=ILGALITH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/07/Oct/2702.htm|title=The Yogyakarta Principles: Rapporteur Addresses Gay Conference|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106032001/http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/07/Oct/2702.htm|archivedate=6 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yogyakarta Principles were presented at a United Nations event in [[New York City]] on 7 November 2007, co-sponsored by [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]]. [[Human Rights Watch]] explain that the first step towards this would be the de-criminalisation of homosexuality in 77 countries that still carry legal penalties for people in same-sex relationships, and repeal of the death penalty in the seven countries that still have the death penalty for such sexual practice.&lt;ref name = REUTERS/&gt;

===Yogyakarta Principles plus 10===

On 10 November 2017, the "Yogyakarta Principles plus 10" (The YP +10) to the supplement the Principles, formally as "Additional Principles and State Obligation on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics to Complement the Yogyakarta Principles", emerged from the intersection of the developments in international human rights law with the emerging understanding of violations suffered by person on ground of sexual orientation and gender identity and the recognition of the district and [[intersectionality|intersectional]] grounds of gender expression and [[sex characteristics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ | title = Yogyakarta Principles plus 10| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043532/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ | archive-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Lee| first = Steve| title = Updated international human rights principles for the treatment of LGBTI people released| work = LGBT Weekly| accessdate = 2017-11-29| date = 2017-11-27| url = http://lgbtweekly.com/2017/11/27/updated-international-human-rights-principles-for-the-treatment-of-lgbti-people-released/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171127230739/http://lgbtweekly.com/2017/11/27/updated-international-human-rights-principles-for-the-treatment-of-lgbti-people-released/| archivedate = 2017-11-27| df = }}

The update was drafted by a committee of [[Mauro Cabral Grinspan]], [[Morgan Carpenter]], [[Julia Ehrt]], [[Sheherezade Kara]], [[Arvind Narrain]], [[Pooja Patel]], [[Chris Sidoti]] and [[Monica Tabengwa]]. Signatories additionally include [[Philip Alston]], [[Edwin Cameron]], [[Kamala Chandrakirana]], [[Sonia Corrêa|Sonia Onufer Corrêa]], [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]], [[Maina Kiai]], [[Victor Madrigal-Borloz]], [[Sanji Mmasenono Monageng]], [[Vitit Muntarbhorn]], [[Sunil Pant]], [[Dainius Puras]], [[Ajit Prakash Shah]], [[Sylvia Tamale]], [[Frans Viljoen]], and [[Kimberly Zieselman]].

==Reasoning==

The compilers explain that the Principles detail how [[international human rights law]] can be applied to sexual orientation and gender identity issues, in a way that affirms international law and to which all states can be bound. They maintain that wherever people are recognised as being born free and equal in dignity and rights, this should include LGBT people. They argue that human rights standards can be interpreted in terms of sexual orientation and gender identity when they touch on issues of torture and violence, extrajudicial execution, access to justice, privacy, freedom from discrimination, freedom of expression and assembly, access to employment, health-care, education, and immigration and refugee issues. The Principles aim to explain that States are obliged to ensure equal access to human rights, and each principle recommends how to achieve this, highlighting international agencies' responsibilities to promote and maintain human rights.&lt;ref name = YOGYABOUT/&gt;

The Principles are based on the recognition of the right to non-discrimination. The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (CESCR) has dealt with these matters in its General Comments, the interpretative texts it issues to explicate the full meaning of the provisions of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]. In General Comments Nos. 18 of 2005 (on the [[right to work]]), 15 of 2002 (on the [[right to water]]) and 14 of 2000 (on the [[right to health|right to the highest attainable standard of health]]), it indicated that the Covenant proscribes any discrimination on the basis of, ''inter alia'', sex and sexual orientation "that has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the equal enjoyment or exercise of [the right at issue]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/comments.htm CESCR General Comments 14, 15 and 18] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806002003/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/comments.htm |date=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), notwithstanding that it has not addressed the matter in a General Comment or otherwise specified the applicable provisions of the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], on a number of occasions has criticised states, for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. For example, it also addressed the situation in Kyrgyzstan and recommended that, 'lesbianism be reconceptualised as a sexual orientation and that penalties for its practice be abolished'.

==Reception==

===United Nations===
The Principles have never been accepted by the United Nations and the attempt to make gender identity and sexual orientation new categories of non-discrimination has been repeatedly rejected by the General Assembly, the UN Human Rights Council and other UN bodies. In July 2010, Vernor Muñoz, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, presented to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] an interim report on the human right to comprehensive [[sexual education]], in which he cited the Yogyakarta Principles as a Human Rights standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N10/462/13/PDF/N1046213.pdf?OpenElement Report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to education, 23 July 2010, UN Doc. A/65/162] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927002455/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N10/462/13/PDF/N1046213.pdf?OpenElement |date=September 27, 2012 }}, para 23: &lt;blockquote&gt;Sexual education is a basic tool for ending discrimination against persons of diverse sexual orientations. A very important contribution to thinking in this area was made by the 2006 Yogyakarta Principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. The Special Rapporteur fully endorses the precepts of Principle 16, referring specifically to the right to education.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ensuing discussion, the majority of General Assembly Third Committee members recommended against adopting the principles.&lt;ref&gt;International Service for Human Rights, [http://www.ishr.ch/archive-general-assembly/933-majority-of-ga-third-committee-unable-to-accept-report-on-the-human-right-to-sexual-education Majority of GA Third Committee unable to accept report on the human right to sexual education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515111556/http://www.ishr.ch/archive-general-assembly/933-majority-of-ga-third-committee-unable-to-accept-report-on-the-human-right-to-sexual-education |date=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Representative of [[Malawi]], speaking on behalf of all African States argued that the report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reflected an attempt to introduce controversial notions and a disregard to the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders as outlined in [[Human Rights Council]] resolution 8/4. She expressed alarm at the reinterpretation of existing human rights instruments, principles and concepts. The report also selectively quoted general comments and country-specific recommendations made by treaty bodies and propagated controversial and unrecognized principles, including the so-called Yogyakarta Principles, to justify his personal opinion.&lt;ref name="daccess-dds-ny.un.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Trinidad and Tobago]], on behalf of the Caribbean States members of [[CARICOM]], argued that the special rapporteur "had chosen to ignore his mandate, as laid down in Human Rights Council resolution 8/4, and to focus instead on the so-called 'human right to comprehensive education.' Such a right did not exist under any internationally agreed human rights instrument or law and his attempts to create one far exceeded his mandate and that of the Human Rights Council."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, Official Records, Third Committee, [https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/C.3/65/SR.29 Summary record of the 29th meeting held in New York, on Monday, 25 October 2010, at 3 p.m, UN Doc.

&lt;blockquote&gt;As justification for his conclusions, he cited numerous documents which had not been agreed to at the intergovernmental level, and which therefore could not be considered as authoritative expressions of the opinion of the international community. In particular, he referred to the Yogyarkarta Principles and also to the International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education. Implementation of various provisions and recommendations of the latter document would result in criminal prosecution for such criminal offences as corrupting youth.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, Official Records, Third Committee, [https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/C.3/65/SR.29 Summary record of the 29th meeting held in New York, on Monday, 25 October 2010, at 3 p.m, UN Doc.

===Regional institutions===

The [[Council of Europe]] states in "Human Rights and Gender Identity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1476365|title=Commissioner for Human Rights - Human rights and gender identity.

They recommend that member states "abolish sterilisation and other compulsory medical treatment as a necessary legal requirement to recognise a person's gender identity in laws regulating the process for name and sex change," (V.4) as well as to "make gender reassignment procedures, such as hormone treatment, surgery and psychological support, accessible for transgender persons, and ensure that they are reimbursed by public health insurance schemes." (V.5)  Similarly, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] adopted a document titled "Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity" on 23 March 2010,&lt;ref name="Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly"&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc10/EDOC12185.htm Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, 23 March 2010]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612221226/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FWorkingDocs%2FDoc10%2FEDOC12185.htm |date=12 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the prejudice that "homosexuality is immoral" as a "subjective view usually based on religious dogma that, in a democratic society, cannot be a basis for limiting the rights of others." The document argued that the belief that "homosexuality is worsening the demographic crisis and threatening the future of the nation" is "illogical," and that "granting legal recognition to same-sex couples has no influence on whether heterosexuals marry or have children."&lt;ref name="Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly"/&gt;

===National institutions===

However, the Principles have been cited by numerous national governments and court judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/18918131.2015.1127009| issn = 1891-8131| volume = 33| issue = 4| pages = 280–298| last = O'Flaherty| first = Michael| authorlink = Michael O'Flaherty | title = The Yogyakarta Principles at Ten| journal = Nordic Journal of Human Rights| date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles influenced the proposed [[UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]] in 2008.&lt;ref name = C-FAM /&gt;

Human rights and LGBT-rights groups took up the principles, and discussion has featured in the gay press,&lt;ref name=PINKPAPER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-5889.html|title=United Nations to host LGBT rights panel|work=PinkNews|accessdate=18 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201215059/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-5889.html|archivedate=1 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as academic papers and text books (see bibliography).

A US-based Christian think tank, the [[Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute]], claimed that the Principles could devalue the concept of the family and parental authority, could be used to restrict [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref name=C-FAM&gt;[https://www.c-fam.org/publications/id.954/pub_detail.asp French UN "Sexual Orientation" Push Linked to Radical Yogyakarta Principles, Piero A.
