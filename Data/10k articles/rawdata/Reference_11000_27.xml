'''''1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die''''' is a musical reference book first published in 2005 by [[Universe Publishing]]. Part of the ''1001 Before You Die'' series, it compiles writings and information on albums chosen by a panel of music critics to be the most important, influential, and best in [[popular music]] between the 1950s and the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0628/2005930000-d.html|title=Publisher description for 1001 albums you must hear before you die / &lt;nowiki&gt;[edited by]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Robert Dimery|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was edited by Robert Dimery, an English writer and editor who had previously worked for magazines such as ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/1001-albums-you-must-hear-before-you-die-robert-dimery/1007440311#productInfoTabs|title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die|publisher=[[Barnes &amp; Noble]]|accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each entry in the book's list of albums is accompanied by a short [[essay]] written by a music critic, along with pictures, quotes, and additional information (such as the album's running time and [[Record producer|producer]]). Only albums consisting fully of original material by a particular artist were included, which meant that compilations by various artists, including most film soundtracks, were also excluded.&lt;ref name="OctopusPublishing" /&gt;

The most recent edition consists of a list of [[album]]s released between 1955 and 2017, part of a series from [[Quintessence Editions]] Ltd. The book is arranged roughly [[Chronology|chronologically]], starting with [[Frank Sinatra]]'s ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]''&lt;ref name="DimeryLydon2010"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first=Robert | editor1-last=Dimery | others=Preface by Michael Lydon |title=1001 Albums: You Must Hear Before You Die | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PIyEkArSW0EC | year=2011 | publisher=[[Lagardère Publishing#United Kingdom|Octopus]] | id={{ISBN|1-84403-714-2}}; {{ISBN|978-1-84403-714-8}} | page=[https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=X9VWAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Frank+Sinatra%22+22 22]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most recent edition concluding with ''[[I See You (The xx album)|I See You]]'' by [[The xx]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Selection and sorting methodology==
In the book's introduction, general editor Robert Dimery notes that the selections were also intended to bring attention to gifted songwriters. Joni Mitchell, Elvis Costello and Nick Cave are named as examples. The release dates are chosen from the date the album first released in the artist's home country, and the version is the first one released, which would affect The Beatles' album tally. In most cases, bonus tracks added for later versions are ignored. The editors also attempted to ensure that each album profiled was still available for purchase. Soundtracks that were not original material from a particular artist were also excluded.&lt;ref name="DimeryLydon2010"/&gt;

== Critical reception ==
In February 2006, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the book a "bookshelf-busting testament to music geeks' mania for lists" and said it was "about as comprehensive a 'best-of' as any sane person could want". The reviewer added: "For music lovers, it doesn't get much better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7893-1371-3 |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |publisher=publishersweekly.com |date=2006-02-06 |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006 edition had an average rating of 3.92 stars out of 5 on [[Amazon.com]]'s social cataloging website [[Goodreads]], with 860 ratings as of April 30, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117190.1001_Albums_You_Must_Hear_Before_You_Die |title=Goodreads: 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |publisher=goodreads.com |date=2015-04-30 |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same 2006 version has an average rating of 3.5 stars out of 5 on Amazon.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.amazon.com/1001-Albums-Must-Hear-Before/dp/0789313715 |title=Amazon.com: 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2015-04-30 |accessdate=2015-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Originally published by [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]],&lt;ref name=BillboardBrown&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6480462/33-1-3-series-survival-harry-potter |title=How the 33 1/3 Series, In Spite of Two Shrinking Industries, Continues to Thrive |work=Billboard |last=Brown |first=Harley |date=February 25, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726161236/http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6480462/33-1-3-series-survival-harry-potter |archivedate=July 26, 2017 |access-date=May 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the series was founded by editor David Barker in 2003.&lt;ref name=PMBarker/&gt; At the time, Continuum published books on philosophers; series editor Ally-Jane Grossan mentioned that Barker was "an obsessive music fan who thought, 'This is a really cool idea, why don't we apply this to albums'."&lt;ref name=BillboardBrown/&gt; ''[[PopMatters]]'' wrote that the range consists of "obscure classics to more usual suspects by the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones".&lt;ref name=PMBarker/&gt;

In 2010, Continuum was bought out by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], which continues to publish the series.&lt;ref name=BillboardBrown/&gt; Following a leave, Barker was replaced by Grossan in January 2013.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; In 2016, Daphne Brooks, Kevin Dettmarr, Amanda Petrusich, and Gayle Wald assumed co-editorial duties.

Two independent books have been spun off of the series. The first, Carl Wilson's 2007 entry on [[Celine Dion]]'s ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'', was expanded for a 2014 Bloomsbury reissue with material not specifically pertaining to the Dion album and retitled ''Let's Talk About Love: Why Other People Have Such Bad Taste''. A rejected proposal from writer [[Brett Milano]] for an entry on [[Game Theory (band)|Game Theory]]'s 1987 album ''[[Lolita Nation]]'' was instead expanded by Milano into a biography on the band's leader [[Scott Miller (pop musician)|Scott Miller]]; that project, titled ''[[Don't All Thank Me at Once|Don't All Thank Me at Once: The Lost Genius of Scott Miller]]'' was released by 125 Books in 2015.&lt;ref name=salon-z&gt;{{cite journal |first=Annie |last=Zaleski |title=The lost pop genius of Scott Miller |date=January 1, 2016 |journal=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |url=http://www.salon.com/2016/01/02/the_lost_pop_genius_of_scott_miller_whatever_makes_you_fall_in_love_with_a_pop_song_he_did_that/#comments |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106203544/http://www.salon.com/2016/01/02/the_lost_pop_genius_of_scott_miller_whatever_makes_you_fall_in_love_with_a_pop_song_he_did_that/#comments |archivedate=2016-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Bloomsbury announced the launch of {{frac|33|1|3}} Global,&lt;ref name="33-1/3 Global Launch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://333sound.com/new-series-announcement-33-13-global/ |title=New series announcement: 33 1/3 Global |work=333Sound |date=August 9, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320215054/http://333sound.com/new-series-announcement-33-13-global/ |archivedate=2018-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an extension of the {{frac|33|1|3}} series to popular music from around the world. The first two sub-series launched were {{frac|33|1|3}} Brazil, edited by Jason Stanyek, and {{frac|33|1|3}} Japan, edited by Noriko Manabe.&lt;ref name="33-1/3 Japan editor"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://333sound.com/2017/08/31/33-13-global-editor-highlight-noriko-manabe/ |title=33 1/3 Global editor highlight: Noriko Manabe |work=333Sound |date=August 31, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522044201/https://333sound.com/33-13-global-editor-highlight-noriko-manabe/ |archivedate=2018-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book for {{frac|33|1|3}} Brazil was ''Caetano Veloso's A Foreign Sound'' by Barbara Browning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bloomsbury.com/us/series/33-13-brazil/ |title=33 1/3 Brazil |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522044307/https://bloomsbury.com/us/series/33-13-brazil/ |archivedate=2018-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first books for {{frac|33|1|3}} Japan were ''Supercell ft.

==Description==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Address Book widget.png|thumb|The Address book [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard Widget]].]] --&gt;
Address Book has two viewing modes: View Card and Column, and View Card Only. The user can switch between modes with a control in the upper-left portion of the window under the close box.

In View Card and Column, the Address Book window is divided into three panes. The first pane has the title Group. This pane lists All, Directories, and each user-made group. Users can add new groups by pulling the File menu down to New Group, or typing Command-Shift-N.

When selecting All or a user-made group, the second column has the title Name. It lists the names of the people with cards in that group, or all the names if the selected group is All, in alphabetical order by first or last name, depending on user preference.

The third pane has the card corresponding to the selected name. The card can include information, some of which the user can classify into customizable categories like Home and Work. Many of the fields can have duplicate entries, for example, if the person the card describes has several email addresses. The user can edit the fields by pressing the edit button below the bottom-left of the third pane. Default fields include:
*Picture
*Name pronunciation
*First name
*Last name
*Job title
*Company
*Phone number
*Email address
*Home page
*Birthday
*Instant messaging username
**[[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]]
**[[ICQ]]
**[[XMPP|Jabber]]
**[[MSN (IM)|MSN]]
**[[Yahoo (IM)|Yahoo]]
*Address
*Related Names
*Note

Address Book can search LDAP directories. Users customize these in the LDAP tab of the preferences. Users search these by selecting Directories in the first pane, selecting a directory or All in the second pane, and typing their search in the search box above the top-left of the third pane. Results appear in the third pane.

==Integration with other Mac OS X applications==
*Address Book stores previous recipient addresses used by Mail
*URLs in Address Book cards appear in Safari's Address Book bookmarks
*Buddies in iChat can be associated with Address Book cards
*Birthdays saved in Address Book appear in iCal if enabled

==Criticism==
Address Book 4.1, included in Leopard, has received much criticism for the removal of the bluetooth SMS and call features.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

'''André Gayot''' is a French journalist. Concurrent with his studies, he started his career in 1949 at the [[ORTF]] (National French Radio) producing a show for a young audience. In 1957, he was a political columnist for the daily newspaper ''La Liberté du Massif Central'', and an editor for ''[[Paris-Presse]]''. In 1958, he joined the weekly magazine ''[[Jours de France]]''. He was appointed in 1960 director of information of the [[Republic of Niger]] where he created the information services and the daily ''Le Temps du Niger''. In 1962, he founded and directed for five years the daily ''Le Courrier de Madagascar'' in Antananarivo. He created in 1967 in Martinique the weekly ''France Antilles Spécial Dimanche''. He was in 1968 in Dakar, Senegal, leading the creation of the daily ''Le Soleil'' and of ''Les Nouvelles Imprimeries du Sénégal'', both of which paved the way to the plurality and opening of information in French West Africa. Gayot has been active in Canada where he renewed and relaunched the world's oldest French language daily, ''L'Evangéline''. He brought his expertise to the local press in Vietnam, Egypt, Mauretania, Zaïre (now Republic of Congo), Burundi and Iran.&lt;ref&gt;''La Gazette de la Presse francophone'' (Paris) Juillet 2005 NJ 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, with his friends [[Henri Gault]] and [[Christian Millau]], he founded the monthly magazine ''Le Nouveau Guide'', which went against culinary traditions of the time by promoting artistically prepared food, new cooking techniques and fresh ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIqyMMogRsMC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|title=The 1980s|author=Bob Batchelor, Scott Stoddart}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three also founded the ''[[Gault Millau]]'' guide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Food &amp; Drink: Do not pass Gault before booking a table: Who judges the judges?

The guidebooks rated and highlighted restaurants deemed to be among the top in their region, with reviews discussing décor, service, ambience and wine lists, with an emphasis on French cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Josh|last=Ozersky

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2000, his guides were published exclusively under the name Gayot, following a disagreement with the new owners of the French Gault-Millau guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://zemmrate.com/22-gault-et-millau.html|title = Culinary Guide Gault et Millau|publisher = zemrate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Gayot founded, in Paris, the monthly magazine ''Prévention Santé'' in conjunction with [[Rodale Publishing]] (Emmaus, PA USA). With son Alain and daughter Sophie, he launched in Los Angeles the website www.gayot.com devoted to gastronomy, tourism and lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

On May 7, 1979, [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], President of the Republic of Senegal presented Gayot, in his name and that of the President of the French Republic [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] in the presence of [[Michel Debré]] former French prime minister, with the distinction of Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur, for his humanitarian and cultural actions for Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Nouveau Guide GaultMillau'', June 1979&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2016}}

''"For exceptional services rendered to the freedom of press and promotion of the friendship between nations"'' was said on April 27, 2005, by the Ambassador of France in Washington, D.C., [[Jean-David Levitte]] as he bestowed on Gayot the award of the rank of [[Officer of the Legion of Honor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legiondhonneur.fr/ |title=La Légion d’Honneur |access-date=2018-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225044652/http://legiondhonneur.fr/ |archive-date=2011-02-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – the highest French distinction. Gayot is also an officer in the national order of Senegal (order of the Lion), in the national order of the République du Niger and in the order of the Comoros. He holds a master's degree in law and a doctorate degree in economics.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The '''''Annales Compostellani''''' (''Anales compostelanos'') or '''''Anales castellanos terceros''''' are a set of [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] [[annals]] found in, and named after, [[Santiago de Compostela]]. They were found in the manuscript known as the ''Tumbo negro'' (or ''colorado'') ''de Santiago de Compostela'' (also ''Codex Compostellanus'' or ''Códice compostelano''), but they were originally redacted in the [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]]. They are grouped with the ''[[Chronicon Ambrosianum]]'' and the ''[[Chronicon Burgense]]'' as the ''Efemérides riojanas''. They cover the history of the [[County of Castile|County]] and [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] until the [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of [[Seville]] in 1248.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2080">'''''The Annals of Lund''''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Lundeårbogen'', [[Latin]]: ''Annales Lundenses'') is a Latin [[manuscript]] written in [[Lund]] around 1250-1307. Several copies have survived to the modern day. ''The Annals of Lund'' are composed of two parts. The first part is based on earlier works, including the ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'', and discusses events from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] to 1256. The second part includes events from every year until 1307.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danmarkshistorie.gyldendal.dk/kap1_kilder.html Danmarks tilblivelse og europæisering – tiden indtil ca. 1453 ]. danmarkshistorie.gyldendal.dk. Hentet 17/8-2015&lt;/ref&gt; This portion is unique to the ''Annals of Lund'' and primarily deals with Danish politics. The topics include the Norwegian King [[Eric II of Norway|Erik]]’s offensive in Denmark and [[Erik Menved]]'s marriage with [[Ingeborg Magnusdotter of Sweden|Ingeborg of Sweden]] in 1296.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gribskovgymnasium.dk/fs/1200Kbh/Kilder/%C3%A5rb%C3%B8ger/1276f_Lunde%C3%A5rbogen.html Lundeårbogen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208110228/http://www2.gribskovgymnasium.dk/fs/1200Kbh/Kilder/%C3%A5rb%C3%B8ger/1276f_Lunde%C3%A5rbogen.html |date=December 8, 2015 }}.

'''Bernard Sergent''' ({{IPA-fr|sɛʁʒɑ̃|lang}}; born 23 February 1946) is a French [[ancient history|ancient historian]] and [[comparative mythologist]]. He is researcher of the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] and president of the Société de mythologie française.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythofrancaise.asso.fr/index2.html "Le Conseil d'Administration comprend actuellement", ''Société de mythologie française'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arbre-celtique.com/encyclopedie/sergent-bernard-2081.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
He has written a seminal work on [[Greek mythology]] entitled ''Homosexuality in Greek Myth'', translated into English two years later by [[Beacon Press]]. In 1986, he followed up with a study covering early [[homosexuality]] in [[Europe]], under the title of  ''L'homosexualité initiatique dans l'Europe ancienne'' (Payot 1986), which has yet to be translated into English. The two studies have been published together, with a postface, as ''Homosexualité et initiation chez les peuples indo-européens''.

In ''Genèse de L'Inde'', he attacks the recent [[Indo-Aryan migration|anti-invasionist]] reconstructions of early [[India]]n history. Instead he defends the traditional hypothesis that the [[Indo-Aryans]] invaded India in the 2nd millennium BC. According to Sergent, the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] populations are not autochthonous either, but of [[Africa]]n origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/reviews/sergent.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Les Indo-Européens - Histoire, langues, mythes'' is a general introduction to the Indo-European language family. Sergent associates the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]] with certain archaeological cultures in Southern [[Russia]], and he reconstructs an Indo-European religion (relying on the method of [[Georges Dumézil]]). He writes that the lithic assemblage of the first [[Kurgan culture]] in [[Ukraine]] (Sredni Stog II), originated from the [[Volga Delta|Volga]] and [[Ural region|South Urals]], recalls that of the [[Mesolithic]]-[[Neolithic]] sites to the east of the [[Caspian sea]], [[Dam Dam Chesme II]] and the [[Cave of Dzhebel|cave of Djebel]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Dzhebel Dzhebel], and V. A. Ranov and R. S. Davis (1979), ''[http://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=anth_pubs Toward a New Outline of the Soviet Central Asian Paleolithic]''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he places the roots of the Gimbutas' Kurgan cradle of Indo-Europeans in a more southern cradle, and adds that the Djebel material is related to a [[Paleolithic]] material of [[Northwestern Iran]], the [[Zarzian culture]], dated 10,000-8,500 BC, and in the more ancient [[Kebarian]] of the [[Near East]]. He concludes that more than 10,000 years ago the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] were a small people grammatically, phonetically and lexically close to [[Semitic people|Semitic]]-[[Hamitic]] populations of the Near East.

In the monograph, ''Les trois fonctions indo-européennes en Grèce ancienne'', vol. 1: ''De Mycènes aux Tragique'', Sergent examines the employment of the [[Trifunctional hypothesis|Dumézilian tripartite system]] in Greek [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] and [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|dramatic]] poetry. In a second volume, which has not been published yet, he will continue this examination with Greek [[philosophy]] and [[religion]].

His recent work, ''Celtes et Grecs'', is dedicated to comparative [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Celtic mythology]]. In volume 1, ''Le livre de héros'' (Payot 1999 {{ISBN|2-228-89257-2}}), the Irish hero [[Cuchulainn]] is compared with the Greek heroes [[Achilleus]], [[Bellerophon]] and [[Melanthius]] and the Irish epic [[Táin Bó Cúailnge]] with the Greek [[Iliad]], which, according to Sergent, presuppose an Indo-European "pre-Iliad". In volume 2, ''Le livre des dieux'', Sergent argues that the Celtic and Greek [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheons]] derive from a common Indo-European inheritance.

'''Catawiki''' is an online auction platform for buying and selling special items and collectibles. Catawiki was founded in 2008 as an online community for collectors. Since 2011, the company has been hosting weekly online auctions, in various categories such as vintage comic books, model trains, coins, watches, art, jewellery and classic cars. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/11771493/Internet-auctioneer-Catawiki-raises-82m-as-Dutch-start-ups-take-off.html Internet auctioneer Catawiki raises $82m as Dutch start-ups take off], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 30 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/24/catawiki/ Online Auction House Catawiki Scores €10M Series B Led By Accel Partners], [[TechCrunch]], 24 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/1376563/meet-entrepreneurs-chasing-ebays-auction-throne/ Meet the entrepreneurs chasing eBay's auction throne], ''[[Management Today]]'', 11 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Catawiki was founded by René Schoenmakers, a Dutch comic collector, and Marco Jansen, a Dutch developer. It went online on 10 September 2008 as an online wiki-based compendium of collector's catalogues. First focusing on comics, the database later covered items such as postage stamps, coins and telephone cards. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;


Since 2011 Catawiki has been hosting auctions for thousands of different objects. The site was originally in Dutch, but was made available in English in 2011, in French and German in 2012, and in Spanish, Italian and Chinese in 2015.  &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/5600/Kunst-literatuur/article/detail/4086122/2015/06/23/Online-veilinghuis-uit-Assen-verovert-de-wereld.dhtml Online veilinghuis uit Assen verovert de wereld], ''[[Algemeen Dagblad]]'', 23 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2015/07/29/catawiki-raises-82m-to-grow-its-specialist-online-auction-house-globally/ Catawiki raises $82M to grow its online auction platform for collectibles such as dinosaur bones], VentureBeat.com, 29 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Model==
Catawiki has been curating weekly auctions since 2011, across a number of categories such as art, books, curiosa, model trains, stamps, wine and classic cars. Catawiki’s auctions are online-only. Bids are open for all to see. Winners pay what they bid via a secure payment service to receive the object from the seller. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/12032751/Internet-auctioneer-Catawiki-launches-in-UK-to-capture-biggest-collectibles-market.html Internet auctioneer Catawiki launches in UK to capture biggest collectibles market], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 7 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Catawiki operates a network of over 100 experts who value, authenticate and curate objects. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/29/hollands-catawiki-raises-82m-to-take-on-ebay-in-collectible-auctions/ Holland’s Catawiki Raises $82M To Take On eBay In Collectible Auctions], TechCrunch, 29 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The site makes money by charging the buyer 9% and the seller 12.5% of the sale price. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4029">'''Charles Goddard Weld''' (1857–1911), was a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]-area physician, sailor, philanthropist, and art lover.  Weld, a resident of [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] and a scion of [[Weld Family|the Welds]] of that area, practiced surgery for many years, but ultimately gave it up to manage his family's fortune.  He made major contributions to two museums in [[Greater Boston]]:

==Museum of Fine Arts Contributions==

Weld is well known for his purchase and donation of the collection of [[Ernest Fenollosa]] for the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. The museum is now home to one of the finest and largest collections of Japanese art outside Japan, numbering over 100,000 objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/sub.asp?key=22&amp;subkey=109 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: Japanese Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104232548/http://www.mfa.org/collections/sub.asp?key=22&amp;subkey=109 |date=January 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Weld attempted to sail around the world in his personal yacht.  However, while moored in [[Yokohama]], the yacht caught fire and was destroyed. As a result, Weld spent an extended amount of time with his Bostonian friends [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] and Ernest Fenollosa. The pair had already been in Japan for some time themselves, exploring the country and collecting art.

The Fenollosa-Weld Collection contains many of the most famous pieces in the Museum of Fine Arts' collection. Among them is a handscroll painting (''[[emaki]]'') depicting the 1159 [[Siege of Sanjō Palace|Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace]]. Others are famous pieces by [[Sesshū]], [[Kanō Eitoku]], and [[Kanō Hōgai]].

While Fenollosa and Bigelow developed very widespread and inclusive tastes in art during their time in Japan, Weld's interests remained somewhat narrowly focused. His primary interests in life were sport, boating, and martial activities such as archery. As a result, he became one of the first Americans to collect Japanese swords, spears, and other martial implements as art. In addition to full swords, Weld purchased many sword ornaments, handguards (''[[tsuba]]''), and other sword fittings such as ''[[kozuka]]'', tiny blades tied to a swordhilt and used by the samurai for basic utilitarian tasks.

In 1911, the collections of Ernest Fenollosa and Charles G. Weld, much of it already physically in the Museum of Fine Arts, on loan indefinitely, became the property of the Museum, as the Fenollosa-Weld Collection.

==Peabody Essex Museum Contributions==
Weld also made major contributions to the [[Peabody Essex Museum]].  Included among these are 110 [[photographs]] that premier [[United States|American]] photographer [[Edward S. Curtis]] made for his 1905-1906 exhibit.  Clark Worswick, curator of photography for the museum, describes them as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...Curtis' most carefully selected prints of what was then his life’s work...certainly these are some of the most glorious prints ever made in the history of the photographic medium. The fact that we have this man’s entire show of 1906 is one of the minor miracles of photography and museology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pem.org/exhibitions/exhibition.php?id=9 Peabody Essex Museum: The Master Prints of Edwards S. Curtis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128000000/http://www.pem.org/exhibitions/exhibition.php?id=9 |date=January 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 14" by 17" prints are each unique and remain in pristine condition.

The '''Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union''' enshrines certain [[civil and political rights|political]], [[economic, social and cultural rights|social, and economic rights]] for [[European Union]] (EU) [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizens]] and residents into [[European Union law|EU law]]. It was drafted by the [[European Convention (1999–2000)|European Convention]] and solemnly proclaimed on 7 December 2000 by the [[European Parliament]], the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] and the [[European Commission]]. However, its then legal status was uncertain and it did not have full legal effect&lt;ref name="Craig 4th ed Chapter 11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craig|first=Paul|author2=Grainne De Burca |author3=P. P. Craig |title=EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials|edition=4th|chapter=Chapter 11 Human rights in the EU|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-927389-8|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] on 1 December 2009.

Under the Charter, the [[European Union]] must act and legislate consistently with the Charter and the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|EU's courts]] will strike down legislation adopted by the EU's institutions that contravenes it. The Charter applies to the [[Institutions of the European Union]] and its [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] when implementing European Union law.

==Background==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
The [[Treaty establishing the European Economic Community|Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (Treaty of Rome)]] did not include any reference to fundamental or human rights. The EEC Treaty was written a few years after the failure of the [[European Defence Community Treaty]] and the [[European Political Community Treaty]]. The latter treaty had included rights provisions and Craig and de Búrca argue that, in light of that failure, the drafters of the EEC Treaty wished to eschew any implicitly political elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Paul |first2=Gráinne |last2=de Búrca |title=EU Law, Text, Cases and Materials |edition=3rd |year=2003 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the idea that the purely economic end of the new EEC Treaty would be unlikely to have any implications for fundamental rights was soon to be tested.

===Court cases===
Soon after the entry into force of the EEC Treaty, the Community established itself as a major political entity with policy ramifications beyond its economic aims. In 1964, the [[European Court of Justice]] handed down its decision in ''[[Costa v ENEL]]'', in which the Court decided that Union law should take precedence over conflicting national law. This meant that national governments could not escape what they had agreed to at a European level by enacting conflicting domestic measures, but it also potentially meant that the EEC legislator could legislate unhindered by the restrictions imposed by fundamental rights provisions enshrined in the constitutions of member states. This issue came to a head in 1970 in the [[Internationale Handelsgesellschaft mbH v Einfuhr- und Vorratsstelle für Getreide und Futtermittel | Internationale Handelsgesellschaft]] case when a German court ruled that a piece of EEC legislation infringed the [[German Basic Law]]. On a reference from the German court, the ECJ ruled that whilst the application of Union law could not depend on its consistency with national constitutions, fundamental rights did form an "integral part of the general principles of [European Community] law" and that inconsistency with fundamental rights could form the basis of a successful challenge to a European law.&lt;ref&gt;Case 228/69, ''Internationale Handelsgesellschaft mbH v. Einfuhr und Vorratsstelle für Getreide und Futtermittel'' [1970] ECR 1125; [1972] CMLR 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ruling as it did in ''Internationale Handelsgesellschaft'' the ECJ had in effect created a doctrine of unwritten rights which bound the Community institutions. While the court's fundamental rights jurisprudence was approved by the institutions in 1977&lt;ref&gt;Joint Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission Concerning the Protection of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31977Y0427%2801%29:EN:HTML OJ C 103, 27/04/1977 P. 1])&lt;/ref&gt; and a statement to that effect was inserted into the [[Maastricht Treaty]]&lt;ref&gt;Article F of the Maastricht Treaty [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11992M/htm/11992M.html Maastricht Treaty].&lt;/ref&gt; it was only in 1999 that the [[European Council]] formally went about the initiating the process of drafting a codified catalogue of fundamental rights for the EU.

===Proclamation===
In 1999 the [[European Council]] proposed that a "body composed of representatives of the Heads of State and Government and of the President of the Commission as well as of members of the European Parliament and national parliaments" should be formed to draft a fundamental rights charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Presidency Conclusions: Cologne European Council 3 And 4 June 1999 |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/kolnen.htm |publisher=Council of the European Union |accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On being constituted in December of that year the "body" entitled itself the [[European Convention (1999–2000)|European Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union |date=21 February 2001 |publisher=European Parliament |accessdate=23 December 2009 |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/default_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention adopted the draft on 2 October 2000 and it was solemnly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission on 7 December 2000. It was at the same time, however, decided to defer making a decision on the Charter's legal status.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=European Council – Nice 7–10 December 2000: Conclusions of the Presidency |publisher=European Parliament |date=11 December 2000 |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/nice1_en.htm |accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did come with the political weight of having been approved by three powerful institutions and as such was regularly cited by the ECJ as a source of fundamental rights.

===Legal force===
A modified Charter formed part of the defunct [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] (2004). After that treaty's failure, its replacement, the [[Lisbon Treaty]] (2007), also gave force to the Charter albeit by referencing it as an independent document rather than by incorporating it into the treaty itself. However, both the version included in the Constitution and the one referenced in the Lisbon Treaty were amended versions of the Charter.

On the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, Justice Commissioner [[Viviane Reding]] proposed that Commissioners should swear to uphold all EU treaties and the Charter. On 3 May 2010, the European Commission swore a solemn declaration at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the EU Treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate. For the first time, the Commissioners also explicitly pledged to respect the new Charter of Fundamental Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Commission swears oath to respect the EU Treaties |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/487 |accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states insisted upon an opt-out from national application of the charter (see below for details).

==Legal status==&lt;!-- remember to change the relative link below before renaming --&gt;
[[File:04CFREU-Article2-Crop.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Article 2 of the Charter affirms the prohibition on capital punishment in the EU]]
Following the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]] in 2009 the fundamental rights charter has the same legal value as the European Union treaties. The Charter referred to in the Treaty is an amended version of the 2000 document which was solemnly declared by the same three institutions a day before the signing of the Lisbon Treaty itself.

Article 51(1) of the Charter addresses the Charter to the EU's institutions, bodies established under EU law and, when implementing EU laws, the EU's member states. In addition both Article 6 of the amended Treaty of European Union and Article 51(2) of the Charter itself restrict the Charter from extending the competences of the EU. A consequence of this is that the EU will not be able to legislate to vindicate a right set out in the Charter unless the power to do such is set out in the Treaties proper. Furthermore, individuals will not be able to take a member state to court for failing to uphold the rights in the Charter unless the member state in question was implementing EU law. It is this last point that has been subject to the most debate.

The Charter is not the first attempt to place human rights principles at the core of European Union law. All EU member states are, and candidate states are required to be, signatories to the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[European Convention on Human Rights]], so that many principles from the Convention, such as the right to a fair trial, were taken as the baseline for European Court of Justice jurisprudence even before their formal reiteration in Charter. In interpreting the human rights protections provided by the general principles of EU law (described in the [[#Court cases|Court cases]] section above), the ECJ had already dealt with the issue of whether the rights protected by those general principles applied to member states. Having ruled in ''Johnston v Royal Ulster Constabulary''&lt;ref&gt;Case 222/84 [1986] ECR 1651, [1986] 3 CMLR 240.&lt;/ref&gt; that a right to fair procedures was one of the general principles of EU law, in ''Kremzow v Austria''&lt;ref&gt;C-299/95 [1997] ECR I-2629, [1997] 3 CMLR 1289.&lt;/ref&gt; the ECJ had to decide whether or not a member state was obliged to apply that principle in relation to a wrongful conviction for murder. Kremzow's lawyers argued that his case came within the scope of EU law on the grounds that his wrongful conviction and sentence had breached his right to free movement within the EU. The ECJ responded by saying that since the laws under which Kremzow had been convicted were not enacted to secure compliance with EU law, his predicament fell outside the scope of EU law.

The wording in ''Kremzow v Austria'', referring to the "field of application of EU law", differs from the wording in the Charter which refers to the implementation of EU law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Paul |first2=Gráinne |last2=de Búrca |title=EU Law, Text, Cases and Materials |edition=4th |year=2007 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the amended explanatory memorandum issued alongside the Charter in 2007 describes the wording used in the Charter as reflecting ECJ precedent.

===The British and Polish protocol===
[[File:EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.svg|thumb|{{legend|#0088cc|States parties}}{{legend|#ff6666|States with an opt-out}}]]
{{further|Opt-outs in the European Union}}
In the negotiations leading up to the signing to the [[Lisbon Treaty]], [[Poland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] secured a protocol to the treaty relating to the application of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights in their respective countries.

The protocol, in article 1(1) states that the "Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or actions of Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms." Article 1(2) then says that the Title IV of the Charter, which contains economic and social rights, does not create justiciable rights, unless Poland and the UK have provided for such rights in their national laws.

Both countries to which the protocol currently applies had different reasons for negotiating the protocol. The United Kingdom originally opposed a legally binding charter over concerns that it would result in a stream of British citizens going to the [[European Court of Justice]] in attempts to enforce their Charter rights in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New sticking points for Blair in draft text|author=Ian Black |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 May 2003 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/may/28/politics.eu |accessdate=26 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in increased costs for business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vaz blames press for dislike of EU |author=Nicholas Watt |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 September 2000 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/sep/01/theeuro.emu |accessdate=26 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the British accepted a legally binding rights charter during the negotiations of the failed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], they negotiated a protocol during the Lisbon negotiations which, according to the then British Minister for Europe, would ensure that the Charter would not extend the powers of the European Court of Justice over United Kingdom law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU Reform Treaty Abandons Constitutional Approach |publisher=Foreign Office |date=22 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although their problems with the Charter related to its perceived liberal stance on social issues, in September 2007 the Polish government indicated that they wished to be included in the British protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Poland to join UK in EU rights charter opt-out |author=Mark Beunderman |date=7 September 2007 |newspaper=Euobserver.com |url=http://euobserver.com/9/24723 |accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable debate concerning the legal effect of the protocol. One view, shared by Jan Jirásek,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU in the United Kingdom and Poland According to the Lisbon Treaty |first=Jan |last=Jirásek |url=http://www.law.muni.cz/edicni/sborniky/cofola2008/files/pdf/evropa/jirasek_jan.pdf |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518074121/http://www.law.muni.cz/edicni/sborniky/cofola2008/files/pdf/evropa/jirasek_jan.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 May 2016 |accessdate=23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is that the protocol is an opt-out that excludes the application of the Charter to Poland and the United Kingdom. Another, shared by Ingolf Pernice, is that the protocol is only an interpretative protocol which will either have limited or no legal consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Ingolf |last=Pernice |title=The Treaty of Lisbon and Fundamental Rights |work=The Lisbon Treaty: EU Constitutionalism without a Constitutional Treaty? |editor1-first=Stefan |editor1-last=Griller |editor2-first=Jaques |editor2-last=Ziller |publisher=Springer |place=Wien New York |year=2008| url=http://www.judicialstudies.unr.edu/JS_Summer09/JSP_Week_1/Pernice%20Fundamental%20Rights.pdf |accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig and de Burcá argue that the protocol is merely declaratory. It says that the "Charter does not extend the ability" of the ECJ or other court to overturn UK or Polish law, but the ECJ already had the power to do this in any case. Accordingly, the Protocol is "unlikely that it will have any significant effect in practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul |last1=Craig |first2=Grainne |last2=de Burcá |title=EU Law: Text, Cases and Materials |edition=5th |isbn=978-0-19-957699-9 |page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[NS v Home Secretary]]'', the ECJ ruled that Article 1(1) of the protocol "explains Article 51 of the Charter with regard to the scope thereof and does not intend to exempt the Republic of Poland or the United Kingdom from the obligation to comply with the provisions of the Charter or to prevent a court of one of those Member States from ensuring compliance with those provisions."&lt;ref&gt; Joined Cases C-411/10 and C-493/10, ''N.S. v Home Secretary'' and ''M.E. v.

Under Clause 5(4) of the [[European Union (Withdrawal) Bill|Great Repeal Bill]], the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not be retained in UK law after its exit from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/642866/Factsheets_-_Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights.pdf EU (Withdrawal) Bill - Factsheet 6: The Charter of Fundamental Rights] Department for Exiting the European Union&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign groups such as [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] and [[Amnesty International]] have stated this is inconsistent with the Great Repeal Bill's aim of legal certainty and the Government's promise of retaining all EU law on the date of withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-withdrawal-bill/brexit-withdrawal-bill-to-be-debated-from-dec-4-idUKKBN1DN13J Brexit withdrawal bill to be debated from Dec 4] Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/sites/default/files/Liberty-AIUK-PLP%20Charter%20Briefing%20Oct%202017.pdf Liberty-Amnesty International-Public Law Project Charter Briefing] Liberty&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed Czech protocol===
During the [[ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon]], [[President of the Czech Republic|Czech President]] [[Václav Klaus]] expressed concern that the Charter would allow families of Germans who were expelled from territory in modern-day Czech Republic after the [[Second World War]] to challenge the expulsion before the EU's courts,&lt;ref name="notsign"&gt;{{cite news |title=I will not sign Lisbon Treaty, says Czech President |author=David Charter |newspaper=[[The Times]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6871365.ece |accessdate=28 January 2010 | location=London | date=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; though legal experts have suggested that the laws under which the German were expelled, the [[Beneš decrees]], did not fall under the jurisdiction of EU law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Lisbon Treaty: ratification by the Czech Republic |date=9 November 2009 |author=Vaughne Miller |publisher=The House of Commons Library |page=10 |url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/SNIA-05214.pdf |accessdate=28 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109005824/http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/SNIA-05214.pdf# |archive-date=9 November 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }} &lt;br&gt; {{cite web |title=The Beneš Decrees and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights |author=Steve Peers |publisher=Statewatch |date=12 October 2009 |page=9 |url=http://www.statewatch.org/news/2009/oct/lisbon-benes-decree.pdf |accessdate=28 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Klaus refused to finalize the Czech Republic's ratification of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] unless the country was excluded from the Charter, as Poland and the United Kingdom had been,&lt;ref name="notsign"/&gt; EU leaders agreed in October 2009 to amend the protocol to include the Czech Republic at the time of the next accession treaty&lt;ref name="czech-klaus"&gt;{{citation |title=Brussels European Council 29/30 October 2009: Presidency Conclusions |author=Council of the European Union |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/110889.pdf |id=15265/1/09 REV 1 |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EO CZ"&gt;Mahony, Honor (30 October 2009) [http://euobserver.com/9/28913 EU treaty closer to ratification after Czech deal agreed], EU Observer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EV CZ"&gt;Gardner, Andrew (29 October 2009) [http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2009/10/klaus-gets-opt-out/66305.aspx Klaus gets opt-out], European Voice&lt;/ref&gt; in a measure designed to persuade Klaus to sign the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Klaus gets opt-out |author=Andrew Gardner |newspaper=European Voice |date=29 October 2009  |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2009/10/klaus-gets-opt-out/66305.aspx |accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently signed the treaty.

In September 2011, the Czech government formally submitted a request to the Council that the promised treaty revisions be made to extend the protocol to the Czech Republic,&lt;ref name="Text adopted against the amendment"/&gt; and a draft amendment to this effect was proposed by the [[European Council]].&lt;ref name="Protocol amendment in European Parliament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&amp;procnum=NLE/2011/0817|title=Application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to the Czech Republic. Protocol (amend.)|work=[[European Parliament]]|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Czech Senate]] passed a resolution in October 2011 opposing their accession to the protocol.&lt;ref name="EP committee draft report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2f%2fEP%2f%2fNONSGML%2bCOMPARL%2bPE-474.039%2b04%2bDOC%2bPDF%2bV0%2f%2fEN|title=SECOND DRAFT REPORT on the draft protocol on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to the Czech Republic (Article 48(3) of the Treaty on European Union)|work=[[European Parliament]] Committee on Constitutional Affairs|accessdate=7 July 2012|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Croatia's [[Treaty of Accession 2011]] was signed in late 2011, the Czech protocol amendment was not included. During the Czech Republic's parliamentary ratification of the accession treaty in the spring of 2012, the government attempted to combine the approval of the Charter opt-out with the ratification bill. However, with the Senate controlled by the opposition parties, their objections to the opt-out could have led to the accession treaty being rejected. As a result, the government decided to separate the proposed opt-out from the accession treaty bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praguemonitor.com/2012/04/26/senate-unanimously-nods-croatias-eu-accession |title=Senate unanimously nods to Croatia's EU accession |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2013 |publisher=[[Prague Daily Monitor]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219180606/http://praguemonitor.com/2012/04/26/senate-unanimously-nods-croatias-eu-accession |archivedate=19 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vote on a draft report by the European Parliament Constitutional Affairs Committee in January 2012 recommending against granting the Czech Republic's request to be added to Protocol 30 resulted in a tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/rp12-64.pdf|title=European Union (Croatian Accession and Irish Protocol) Bill|publisher=[[House of Commons Library]]|accessdate=31 January 2013|date=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report argued that Protocol 30 was not functioning as a general opt-out from the Charter, but only allowed the countries to limit the application of subsequent EU laws based solely on the charter. Thus, the Czech Republic would still be bound by the Charter even if they were added to the Protocol. In October 2012, the committee approved the report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alde.eu/press/press-and-release-news/press-release/article/duff-welcomes-vote-against-czech-attack-on-charter-39860/|title=Duff welcomes vote against Czech attack on Charter|date=9 October 2012|accessdate=31 January 2013|publisher=[[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103153611/http://www.alde.eu/press/press-and-release-news/press-release/article/duff-welcomes-vote-against-czech-attack-on-charter-39860/#|archive-date=3 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a third draft of the report was published on 11 December 2012.&lt;ref name="Committee report submitted to the European Parliament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+COMPARL+PE-474.039+06+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN|title=Third draft report – on the draft protocol on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to the Czech Republic (2011/0817 NLE) |format=PDF|work=European Parliament|date=11 December 2012|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was tabled in Parliament during its session on 22 May 2013,&lt;ref name="Protocol amendment in European Parliament" /&gt; and the Parliament voted in favour of calling on the European Council "not to examine the proposed amendment of the Treaties".&lt;ref name="Text adopted against the amendment"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P7-TA-2013-0209&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=A7-2013-0174|title=European Parliament resolution of 22 May 2013 on the draft protocol on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to the Czech Republic (Article 48(3) of the Treaty on European Union) (00091/2011 – C7-0385/2011 – 2011/0817(NLE))|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Protocol amendment in European Parliament" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alde on rejection"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.alde.eu/press/press-and-release-news/press-release/article/european-parliament-rejects-czech-opt-out-on-charter-of-fundamental-rights-41493/ |title=European Parliament rejects Czech 'opt-out' on charter of fundamental rights |publisher=Alde.eu |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=20 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109224150/http://www.alde.eu/press/press-and-release-news/press-release/article/european-parliament-rejects-czech-opt-out-on-charter-of-fundamental-rights-41493/# |archive-date=9 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament did, however, give its consent in advance that a treaty revision to add the Czech Republic to Protocol 30 would not require a new convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P7-TA-2013-0208&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=A7-2012-0282|title=European Parliament decision of 22 May 2013 on the European Council's proposal not to convene a Convention for the addition of a Protocol on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to the Czech Republic, to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (00091/2011 – C7-0386/2011 – 2011/0818(NLE))|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, after [[Czech presidential election, 2013|presidential]] and [[Czech legislative election, 2013|parliamentary]] elections the previous year had resulted in new leadership in the country, new Czech Human Rights Minister [[Jiří Dienstbier Jr.|Jiří Dienstbier]] said that he would attempt to have his country's request for an opt-out withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://praguemonitor.com/2014/01/27/dienstbier-minister-wants-scrapping-eu-pacts-czech-opt-out|title=Dienstbier as minister wants scrapping of EU pact's Czech opt-out|date=27 January 2014|accessdate=9 February 2014|newspaper=[[Prague Daily Monitor]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325192108/http://praguemonitor.com/2014/01/27/dienstbier-minister-wants-scrapping-eu-pacts-czech-opt-out|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/zpravy/politika/_zprava/jiri-dienstbier-chce-aby-cesko-pozadalo-o-zruseni-vyjimky-v-lisabonske-smlouve--1309447|title=Jiří Dienstbier chce, aby Česko požádalo o zrušení výjimky v Lisabonské smlouvě|date=29 January 2014|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed on 20 February 2014 by the new Prime Minister [[Bohuslav Sobotka]], who withdrew the request for an opt-out during a meeting with [[President of the European Commission]] [[José Manuel Barroso]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/news/123211|title=Czech government to give up EU Charter opt-out|date=20 February 2014|accessdate=21 February 2014|last=Fox|first=Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.cz/cz/media-centrum/aktualne/premier-sobotka-se-v-bruselu-setkal-s-predsedou-evropske-komise-barrosem-i-predsedou-evropskeho-parlamentu-schulzem-116128/|title=Premiér Sobotka se v Bruselu setkal s předsedou Evropské komise Barrosem i předsedou Evropského parlamentu Schulzem|date=20 February 2014|accessdate=21 February 2014|publisher=Government of the Czech Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euroskop.cz/46/23620/clanek/barroso-cr-resetovala-vztahy-s-eu-na-mnoha-frontach/|title=Barroso: ČR "resetovala" vztahy s EU|date=20 February 2014|accessdate=21 February 2014|last=Bydžovská|first=Maria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/news-2014-02-20|title=Czech prime minister in Brussels|date=20 February 2014|accessdate=21 February 2014|publisher=[[Radio Prague]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140221234026/http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/news-2014-02-20#|archive-date=21 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after his newly elected government won the confidence of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/19/us-czech-eu-idUSBREA1I1A520140219|title=Czechs give up EU rights charter opt-out, plan joining fiscal pact|date=19 February 2014|accessdate=21 February 2014|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2014, the Council of the European Union formally withdrew their recommendation to hold a [[Intergovernmental Conference]] of member states to consider the proposed amendments to the treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/genaff/142581.pdf|title=Press release - 3313th Council meeting|date=2014-05-13|accessdate=2014-05-17|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&amp;f=ST%209693%202014%20INIT|title=List of "A" items|date=2014-05-12|accessdate=2014-05-17|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/EU/XXV/EU/02/08/EU_20839/imfname_10457081.pdf|title="I/A" item note|date=2014-04-08|accessdate=2014-05-17|publisher=[[Council of the European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?reference=2011/0817%28NLE%29|title= Procedure file - 2011/0817(NLE)|accessdate=2014-05-17|publisher=[[European Parliament]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The text==
The Charter contains some 54 articles divided into seven titles. The first six titles deal with substantive rights under the headings: dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens' rights and justice, while the last title deals with the interpretation and application of the Charter. Much of Charter is based on the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), [[European Social Charter]], the case-law of the [[European Court of Justice]] and pre-existing provisions of [[European Union law]].

* The first title ('''Dignity''') guarantees the [[right to life]] and prohibits [[torture]], [[slavery]], the death penalty, [[eugenics|eugenic practices]] and [[human cloning]]. Its provisions are mostly based on the ECHR, although Article 1 closely reflects Article 1 of the [[German Basic Law]].
* The second title ('''Freedoms''') covers liberty, personal [[integrity]], [[privacy]], protection of [[personal data]], marriage, [[freedom of thought|thought]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of expression|expression]], [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], [[right to education|education]], [[labour rights|work]], property and [[right of asylum|asylum]].
* The third title ('''Equality''') covers [[equality before the law]], prohibition of all discrimination including on basis of [[disability]], age and [[sexual orientation]], [[cultural diversity|cultural]], religious and [[linguistic diversity]], the [[children's rights|rights of children]] and the [[elderly]].
* The fourth title ('''Solidarity''') covers social and [[workers' rights]] including the [[decent work|right to fair working conditions]], protection against unjustified [[termination of employment|dismissal]], and [[universal health care|access to health care]], [[social assistance|social]] and [[housing assistance]].
* The fifth title ('''Citizen's Rights''') covers the rights of the EU citizens such as the [[right to vote]] in election to the [[European Parliament]] and to move freely within the EU. It also includes several administrative rights such as a right to good administration, to access documents and to petition the European Parliament.
* The sixth title ('''Justice''') covers justice issues such as the right to an effective remedy, a fair trial, to the [[presumption of innocence]], the [[principle of legality]], non-retrospectivity and [[double jeopardy]].
* The seventh title ('''General Provisions''') concerns the interpretation and application of the Charter. These issues are dealt with [[#Legal status|above]].

==Raising the Charter's profile==
The EU has attempted to raise the profile of the Charter so that citizens are more aware of their rights. For example, the EU [[Fundamental Rights Agency]] (FRA) has produced apps for iOS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eu-charter/id581136169?mt=8 |title=EU Charter on the App Store on iTunes |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=10 December 2012 |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Android&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.europa.fra.charter |title=EU Charter |publisher=Play.google.com |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the text of the Charter in all EU languages and related information. It has also published mini-versions of the Charter in all EU languages.

In 2010, the FRA put out a tender for poets to turn the Charter into an 80-minute-long epic poem, with music, dance and multimedia elements. This was also to raise awareness and to simplify the legal text into more understandable language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/29798 Charter of Fundamental Rights to be re-written as 80-minute-long epic poem] EUobserver, 1 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/730-FRA-Negotiated-Procedure-02032010.pdf |title=Charter in Poems |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Viviane Reding]], the [[European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom &amp; Security]], wrote to the director of the FRA slamming the idea on cost and dignity grounds and instructing him to cancel the project.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Leigh (29 April 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29972 EU commissioner kills off 'undignified' rights charter poem], EU Observer&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison criteria ==
The following tables compare '''general and technical information''' for a number of widely used and currently available [[operating system]] kernels. Please see the individual products' articles for further information.

Even though there are a large number and variety of available [[Linux distribution]]s, all of these kernels are grouped under a single entry in these tables, due to the differences among them being of the patch level. See [[comparison of Linux distributions]] for a detailed comparison. Linux distributions that have highly modified kernels — for example, [[real-time computing]] kernels — should be listed separately. There are also a wide variety of minor BSD operating systems, many of which can be found at [[comparison of BSD operating systems]].

The tables specifically do not include subjective viewpoints on the merits of each kernel or operating system. For this kind of information, please see [[operating system advocacy]].

== Feature overview ==
The major contemporary general-purpose [[Kernel (computer science)|kernels]] are shown in comparison. Only an overview of the technical features is detailed.

'''Edgar Roquette-Pinto''' (September 25, 1884 – October 18, 1954) was a Brazilian writer, ethnologist, anthropologist and physician. He was a member of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras]] and is regarded as the father of [[radio broadcasting]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A era do rádio|url = https://books.google.com.br/books?id=YA8-KcfrFfkC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Edgar+roquette-pinto+r%25C3%25A1dio&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtr_7xmpDKAhVCk5AKHbfGCw4Q6AEISDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Edgar%2520roquette-pinto%2520r%25C3%25A1dio&amp;f=false|publisher = Jorge Zahar Editor|date = 2002-01-01|isbn = 9788571106840|language = pt|first = Lia|last = Calabre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hello, Hello Brazil: Popular Music in the Making of Modern Brazil|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AKQd0WfQaw0C|publisher = Duke University Press|date = 2004-04-13|isbn = 0822385635|language = en|first = Bryan|last = McCann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Roquette-Pinto was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1884. He graduated in medicine at the [[Faculdade de Medicina do Rio de Janeiro]] in 1905. Roquette-Pinto became assistant of Anthropology at the [[National Museum of Brazil|National Museum in Rio de Janeiro]] (1906).

In 1912 Roquette-Pinto went on an expedition to [[Rondônia]] and lived for some time with the [[Nambikwara people]], which until then were virtually [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted]]. He collected extensive ethnographic material and published them in the book ''Rondonia'' (1916),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Roquette-Pinto|first1 = Edgar|title = Rondonia|url = http://www.etnolinguistica.org/biblio:roquette-pinto-1919-rondonia|website = Biblioteca Digital Curt Nimuendajú|accessdate = 4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became a classic of anthropological literature of Brazil.

In 1926 he became director of the National Museum and began building the largest collection of scientific documentaries in Brazil.

== First radio broadcast in Brazil ==
On September 7, 1922, for the [[Independence Centenary International Exposition]], American technicians from [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] installed a radio antenna atop the [[Corcovado]] mountain, to present the technology to Brazil. The first transmission  in Brazil was a speech of president [[Epitácio Pessoa]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Roquette-Pinto, envisioning the radio potential for educational uses, convinced the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]] to purchase the equipment. Still in 1922 the first radio station in Brazil was founded, the [[Rádio Sociedade do Rio de Janeiro]]. Roquette-Pinto became its first director.

In 1936, Roquette-Pinto donated the station to the Brazilian government; Radio Sociedade became Rádio MES, then Rádio MEC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Ilseongnok''''' or '''''Diary of Self-examination''''' is a daily record of events at court made in order that the monarch might reflect upon them, ostensibly towards better government. ''Ilseongnok'' began as King [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]]'s personal diary for self-reflection on his personal and academic affairs since his youth, but was transformed into an official daily journal of state affairs in 1785.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ilseongnok: Records of Daily Reflections|url=http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/nomination_forms/Korea%20Ilseongnok.pdf|website=Memory of the World Register|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extant record of the ''Ilseongnok'' covers the last 150 years of the [[Joseon dynasty]], from 1760 (the 36th year of the reign of king [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]]) to the end of the Joseon dynasty in 1910. The ''Ilseongnok'' is a vital historical record, and along with the ''[[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty|Joseon Wangjo Sillok]]'', the ''[[Seungjeongwon ilgi]]'', and the ''Bibyeonsa'', constitute one of the primary historical sources for the study of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Tai-jin Kim. 1976.

== Comparison and evaluation with Veritable Records ==

* [[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty|Veritable Records]] was not helpful to the actual state of affairs compared to the accuracy of the records because the later wages were invisible, but Ilseongnok was the data that helped the administration of the country because the future wages could be reported and referenced to the state.
* Veritable Records was based on the position of the editor and the ruling party in the process of restructuring based on Sacho(사초). Ilseongnok, on the other hand, is a record of daily work at that time, and can be a more fundamental resource than Veritable Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailies.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=5132|title='일성록' 185책 나왔다…'실록'보다 사료적 가치 높아|date=2016-06-03|work=데일리즈|access-date=2018-05-28|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Insurify''' is an American insurance [[comparison shopping website]] headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Insurify is also the operator of Evia (Expert Virtual Insurance Agent), which allows users to search for car insurance by [[Text messaging|texting]] a photo of their license plate.

== History ==
Insurify was founded in 2013 by Snejina Zacharia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Spencer|title=A Day In The Life Of An InsurTech CEO Who Just Raised $5 Million|url=https://www.benzinga.com/fintech/17/03/9208645/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-insurtech-ceo-who-just-raised-5-million|website=Benzinga|accessdate=9 October 2017|date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MIT Sloan School of Management|MIT Sloan]] fellow and Giorgos Zacharia, CTO of [[Kayak.com]] [[metasearch engine]].&lt;ref name=boston&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landry|title=Insurify Launches to Take the Hassle Out of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2016/01/28/insurify-car-insurance-comparison-tool/|accessdate=30 March 2016|publisher=[[Boston (magazine)|Boston Magazine]]|date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurify started offering its online insurance quote comparison marketplace publicly in July 2015 in Texas, California, and Florida. The company established relationships with auto insurance carriers and auto insurance brokers that allowed them to provide personalized insurance quotes based on a user's profile, vehicle, and driving history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6786">'''Kelly's Directory''' (or more formally, the '''Kelly's, Post Office and Harrod &amp; Co Directory''') was a [[trade directory]] in England that listed all businesses and tradespeople in a particular city or town, as well as a general directory of postal addresses of local [[gentry]], landowners, charities, and other facilities.  In effect, it was a Victorian version of today's [[Yellow Pages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottinghamhistory.co.uk/Directories.htm|title=Cottingham History|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many reference libraries still keep their copies of these directories, which are now an important source for historical research.

==Origins==
The eponymous originator of the directory was [[Frederic Festus Kelly]].  In 1835 or 1836 he became chief inspector of letter-carriers for the inland or general post office, and took over publication of the Post Office London Directory, whose copyright was in private hands despite its semi-official association with the post office, and which Kelly had to purchase from the widow of his predecessor.

He founded Kelly &amp; Co. and he and various family members gradually expanded the company over the next several decades, producing directories for an increasing number of UK [[county|counties]] and buying out or putting out of business various competing publishers of directories.&lt;ref name="pollard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huthwaite-online.net/hucknall/gazetteers/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other publications followed, including the ''Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes'' (1875) and ''Merchants, Manufacturers and Shippers'' (1877). In 1897, Kelly &amp; Co Ltd became '''Kelly’s Directories Ltd.'''&lt;ref name="lg"/&gt;  This name stuck for another 106 years before being renamed Kellysearch in 2003 to reflect its focus away from hard copy directories and towards an Internet-based product search engine.

The front cover of a Kelly's Directory sometimes stated "Kelly's Directories Ltd., established 1799",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade Directories|work=Stella &amp; Rose's Books|url=http://www.stellabooks.com/articles/trade_directories.php|accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this was based on the date of issue of the first Post Office London Directory by an earlier inspector of letter carriers several decades before Kelly's involvement with that publication.&lt;ref name="jenorton" /&gt;

== Kellysearch ==
For a short time, Kelly's existed online as [http://www.kellysearch.co.uk/ Kellysearch (broken link)], a directory similar to the online [[Yellow Pages]]. Kellysearch.com was established in Boston in 2004. It was in many different languages and introduced a fully searchable online-catalogue library and product [[News release|press release]] section.

The old editions of the Kelly’s Directories are seen as highly collectable by many and have also become a useful reference tool for people tracing the history of local areas (with the contents now available to buy on CD-ROM from many entrepreneurial sources for this purpose.)  An extensive but incomplete collection of Kelly’s Directorys is held in the [[Guildhall Library]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/archives-and-city-history/guildhall-library/Documents/8-trade-directories-at-guildhall-library.pdf Trade directories and telephone books at Guildhall Library]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[London]].

'''''Köhler's Medicinal Plants''''' (or, '''''Köhler's Medizinal-Pflanzen''''') is a German [[herbal]] written principally by Hermann Adolph Köhler (1834 - 1879, physician and chemist), and edited after his death by Gustav Pabst. The work was first published in the late 19th century by Franz Eugen Köhler of [[Gera]]. Its complete title is {{lang|de|Köhler's Medizinal-Pflanzen in naturgetreuen Abbildungen mit kurz erläuterndem Texte : Atlas zur Pharmacopoea germanica, austriaca, belgica, danica, helvetica, hungarica, rossica, suecica, Neerlandica, British [[pharmacopoeia]], zum Codex medicamentarius, sowie zur Pharmacopoeia of the United States of America}}.

== Publication history ==
Originally, Köhler published the herbal in two volumes: the first in 1887, the second in 1890. Volume one is illustrated with 84 full-page, multi-colour plates, and volume two with 110. A third volume was added in 1898, entitled ''Neueste Medizinalpflanzen und Verwechslungen'', which is a supplement containing additions and corrections. Among the additions are 80 more colour plates. A fourth volume was announced by the publisher, but never released. All the colour plates in the herbal were produced through a process called ''[[chromolithography]]''. The [[botanical illustrator]]s were [[Walther Otto Müller]], C. F. Schmidt, and K. Gunther.

A [[reprint]] was published in Germany a century after the original, first of extracts of the work, later the complete three volumes.

The name ''Köhler'' is sometimes [[Linguistic corruption|corrupted]] to ''Koehler'' or ''Kohler''.

Because of the identical names of first author and publisher, frequently Franz Eugen Köhler is erroneously mentioned as the author of the book.

Dated from [[Worcester]] on 20 August 1575, and titled ''A letter: whearin, part of the entertainment vntoo the Queenz Maiesty, at Killingwoorth Castl, in Warwik Sheer in this soomerz progress 1575. iz signified: from a freend officer attendant in the coourt, vntoo hiz freend a citizen, and merchaunt of London'', it describes the summer 1575 entertainment of [[Elizabeth I of England]] by [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] at [[Kenilworth Castle]]. It is addressed to Humfrey Martyn, the son of Sir Roger Martyn, a [[Master of the Mercers' Company#Elizabeth I of England|master]] of the [[Mercers' Company]]. 

==Authorship==
The authorship of the letter was ascribed to Robert Langham (c. 1535–1579/80), a mercer and keeper of the [[privy council]] chamber, based on the author's references to himself in the letter as "Lanham" or "Laneham", "Langham", "Ro. La.", and "R. L. Gent. Mercer", and other biographical details, such as his self-description as a "Merchauntaventurer, and Clark of the Councell chamber doore", for which office he writes that he obtained through the patronage of Leicester. Council records confirm that he was paid £10 each April from 1573 to 1579 as keeper of the council chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Laneham, Robert |first=Sidney|last=Lee|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter's editor, R. J. P. Kuin, argues that it is an authentic account by Langham, but others think it was written by [[William Patten (historian)|William Patten]] as a joke at Langham's expense, a view which has been accepted by some authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=16002|last=Woudhuysen|first=H. R.|title=Langham, Robert (c.1535–1579/80)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument for Patten's authorship is based on similarities of form, style, subject matter, and phraseology common to the letter and Patten's acknowledged work and the close resemblance between his known hand and that which appears in two annotated copies of the letter. In addition, Patten himself witnessed the Kenilworth festivities and contributed some Latin verses to welcome the queen.

==Reprints==
The work was reissued at Warwick in 1784, and was reprinted in [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]]'s ''Progresses of Queen Elizabeth''. [[Sir Walter Scott]] quoted from it in his novel ''[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]'' (1821), leading to the republication of the ''Letter'' in London the same year. Subsequent reprints were in [[George Adlard]]'s ''Amye Robsart'' (1870), in the Rev. Edward Hadarezer Knowles's ''Castle of Kenilworth '' (1871), and in the publications of the Ballad Society (ed. Furnivall), 1871.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Laneham, Robert (fl. 1575), writer on the Kenilworth festivities of 1575, by Sidney Lee. Published 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Library Hotel by Library Hotel Collection''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryhotel.com Library Hotel Website]&lt;/ref&gt; is a 60-room [[boutique hotel]] in [[New York City]], located at 299 [[Madison Avenue]] (at 41st Street), near the [[New York Public Library]], [[Bryant Park]], and [[Grand Central Terminal]]. The hotel was designed by architect Stephen B. Jacobs.

Library Hotel by Library Hotel Collection boasts a unique organizing principle: each of its ten guest floors has a theme, designated after a major category of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (the 5th floor, for example, is the 500s, the Sciences), with each room as a subcategory or genre, such as [[Mathematics]] (Room 500.001) or [[Botany]] (Room 500.004). (Dewey categories 000, 100, and 200 are placed on the 10th, 11th, and 12th floors, respectively.) Other room themes include [[Erotic literature|Erotic Literature]] (Room 800.001), [[Poetry]] (Room 800.003), and [[Music]] (Room 700.005). All rooms have a small complement of 50-100 books and decorations that accompany the theme, with 6,000 books overall throughout the hotel.

Because of this classification scheme, the hotel owners were sued in 2003 by the [[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC]] (owners of the Dewey Decimal Classification system). OCLC reached an agreement with the hotel enabling the hotel to continue using the Dewey system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcat.org/arcviewer/2/OCC/2010/05/07/H1273247357646/viewer/file581.htm OCLC and The Library Hotel settle trademark complaint. 24 November 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotel Denouement from Lemony Snicket's ''[[The Penultimate Peril]]'' was modeled after the Library Hotel.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The Library Hotel is owned and operated by Henry Kallan whose Library Hotel Collection includes Manhattan's Casablanca Hotel, [[Hotel Giraffe]] and [[Hotel Elysée|Hotel Elysee]]. A spin off of the Library Hotel's "book lovers' paradise" concept is the Library Hotel Collection's Aria Hotel concept designed for music lovers. Aria Hotel Prague opened in 2003 and Aria Hotel Budapest opened in 2015 and was named the #1 ranked hotel in the world for guest satisfaction in the 2017 TripAdvisor Traveler's Choice Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tripadvisor.com/TravelersChoice-Hotels ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Model Industries building''' or '''Industries Building''' is a three/four-storey building on the northwest corner of [[Alcatraz Island]] off the coast of [[San Francisco]], USA. This building was originally built by the U.S. military and was used as a laundry building until the [[New Industries Building]] was built as part of a redevelopment program on Alcatraz in 1939 when it was a federal penitentiary. As part of the Alcatraz jail, it held workshops for inmates to work in.

On January 10, 1935, the building shifted to within 2.5 feet from the edge of the cliff following a landslide caused by a severe storm. The warden at the time, James A. Johnston, proposed to extend the seawall next to it and asked the Bureau for $6500 to fund it; he would later claim to dislike the building because it was irregularly shaped.&lt;ref name="AH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rock/rock-031.htm|title=The History of Alcatraz|publisher=Alcatrazhistory.com|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller, cheaper riprap was completed by the end of 1935. A [[guard tower]] and a catwalk from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof ventilators and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof.&lt;ref name="AH"/&gt; It ceased use as a laundry in 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building. Today the building is heavily rusted after decades of exposure to the salt air and wind, and neither the guard tower on top of the building nor the Hill Tower have survived.

==Gameplay==
Gameplay will involve Larry exploring certain exhibits in the [[museum]]. Platforming involves Larry using a rope to swing from hooks and a flashlight that activates different contraptions.
Battling requires Larry to lead his enemies to a certain painting or statue and activating it, causing the object to attack (ex. Thinker will swipe at a passing enemy, an ocean painting releases a shark, etc.) Larry will be able to pilot vehicles, which are the [[Apollo lunar lander]], a Pitcairn Autogyro and Rexy the [[T-rex]].

==Plot==
The plot of the game is almost the same as the plot of the film.

Larry Daley is the CEO and founder of the company Daley Devices, and learns that the Museum of Natural History, where he once worked as a night guard and found out that the exhibits come to life every night, is having renovations, replacing the wax figures and stuffed animals with state-of-the-art 3D holograms. Larry returns to the museum, where he learns from Jedidiah the miniature cowboy and Octavius the Roman general that because of the renovations, they will be shipped to the Federal Archives (Octavius mistakenly calls it the Imperial Archives) under the Smithsonian Museum, aside from Rexy the T-Rex skeleton, Ahkmenrah and his tablet, (which is the source which makes the exhibits come to life) the Easter Island Head (nicknamed Dumb-dumb), and other signature exhibits will be staying. Larry meets with Ahkmenrah, who teaches him about the several ingots the tablet consists of, explaining that each ingot has a different power. He tells Larry he can use the tablet's powers using his flashlight and key-chain.

After returning home, Larry receives a call from Jed, informing him that the tablet was stolen by the cheeky monkey Dexter while all of them were supposed to be in federal archives without the tablet. Larry rushes to the Smithsonian in Washington DC. He steals a key card from a guard and enters the Federal Archive, and gets the tablet. However, night comes (Larry calls it "magic time" throughout the video game), causing everything to come to life. This brings the evil Kahmunrah, who is Ahkmenrah's evil brother, to life, imprisoning Jed, Dexter and the others. Larry is threatened by Kahmunrah, and is forced to give him the tablet. Kahmunrah smashes the tablet to pieces (an event that did not happen in the film), giving the ingots in the tablet to several other exhibits who are on his side (such as Napoleon, Ivan the Terrible and Al Capone)  who hide the ingots. Larry escapes by releasing a squid, who captures Kahmunrah and his servants, escaping with the tablet with only one ingot left. Larry tracks down the exhibits following Kahmunrah, and finds the ingots in several places in the museum, such as the Art Gallery (where he steals the ingot from Ivan the terrible, fixing the exhibits Ivan damaged on the way), the Air and Space Museum (where he steals an ingot from Napoleon) and so on.

In the end, there is a huge battle over the finished tablet, which is won by Larry's friends and Larry banishes Kahmunrah to the Underworld. Like the movie, the game ends with the museum being open late at night and Larry telling his boss Dr. McPhee that he stuck motors in the exhibits, while he actually just brought the tablet home, and having the exhibits come back to life.

==Reception==
The game received mixed reviews in general, with a [[Metacritic]] average of 50%.

[[IGN]] were the most positive source, saying that the game is: "Not exhilarating, not mind-blowing, but surprisingly solid. Good job, Pipeworks, you made a game that's educational, simple, and, best of all, never outstays its welcome."&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/982/982098p2.html Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian] IGN&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' called it: "A solid choice for couch time with the kids." ITReviews acknowledged: "There are decent moments, but added that the game is ridiculously short, a little too muddled and really quite poor value for money."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itreviews.co.uk/games/g582.htm Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian Video Game Reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]] also agreed on the longevity issue, saying that: "A few cute moments can't disguise this movie tie-in's biggest problem: its criminally short length."&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/nightatthemuseum2/review.html Gamespot review of Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (video game)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pacific bluefin tuna''' (''Thunnus orientalis'') is a [[predatory]] species of [[tuna]] found widely in the northern [[Pacific Ocean]], but it is [[Animal migration|migratory]] and also recorded as a visitor to the south Pacific.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name="AsiaPacific-FishWatch 2017"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiapacfish.org/index.php/species/item/27-pacific-bluefin-tuna#biology|title=AsiaPacific-FishWatch, Thunnus orientalis species profile, Biology|last=AsiaPacific-FishWatch|first=|date=2017|website=AsiaPacific-FishWatch|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past it was often included in ''[[Thunnus thynnus|T. thynnus]]'', the 'combined' species then known as the northern bluefin tuna (when treated as separate, ''T. thynnus'' is called the [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]]).&lt;ref name=Collette1999&gt;Collette, B.B.

In: Proceedings of the 5th Indo-Pacific Fish Conference, Noumea. pp. 149-164&lt;/ref&gt; It may reach as much as {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|450|kg|abbr=on}} in weight.&lt;ref name=fishbase&gt;{{FishBase species | genus = Thunnus | species = orientalis | month = December | year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the closely related Atlantic bluefin and [[Southern bluefin tuna|southern bluefin]], the Pacific bluefin is a commercially valuable species and several thousand tonnes are caught each year, making it [[overfished]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name="fishwatch.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fishwatch.gov/seafood_profiles/species/tuna/species_pages/pac_bluefin_tuna.html|title=NOAA - FishWatch: Pacific Bluefin Tuna|work=fishwatch.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiapacfish.org/index.php/species/item/27-pacific-bluefin-tuna#sustainability|title=AsiaPacific-FishWatch, Thunnus orientalis species profile, Sustainability|last=AsiaPacific-FishWatch|first=|date=2017|website=AsiaPacific-FishWatch|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered threatened by the [[IUCN]] and [[The Pew Charitable Trusts|PEW]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Pew Charitable Trusts: ''[http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/global-tuna-conservation Global Tuna Conservation.]'' Retrieved 8 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]]'s [[Seafood Watch]] program have placed all bluefin tunas on the "Avoid" list,&lt;ref name=SeafoodWatch&gt;Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch.

According to stock assessments completed in 2011, 2014 and 2016 by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC), the present-day population is at just 2.6 percent of its historic levels.&lt;ref&gt;2016 ISC Report: http://isc.fra.go.jp/pdf/ISC16/ISC16_Annex_09_2016%20Pacific%20Bluefin%20Tuna%20Stock%20Assessment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The overall fishing mortality rate for this species remains up to three times higher than is sustainable.&lt;ref name="PewMoratorium"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pew Calls for Moratorium on Commercial Fishing of Pacific Bluefin Tuna|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/news-room/statements/2016/07/19/pew-calls-for-moratorium-on-commercial-fishing-of-pacific-bluefin-tuna|publisher=[[Pew Charitable Trusts]]|accessdate=2 April 2017|date=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2011}}

===Thermoregulation===
Almost all fish are cold-blooded ([[ectothermic]]).
&lt;ref name="Purves"&gt;{{cite book

 | last3=Orians | first3 = Gordon

However, tuna and [[Lamniformes|mackerel sharks]] are [[warm-blooded]]: they can regulate their body temperature. Warm-blooded fish possess organs near their [[muscles]] called ''[[rete mirabile|retia mirabilia]]'' that consist of a series of minute parallel veins and arteries that supply and drain the muscles. As the warmer blood in the veins returns to the [[gill]]s for fresh oxygen it comes into close contact with cold, newly oxygenated blood in the arteries. The system acts as a counter-current heat exchanger and the heat from the blood in the veins is given up to the colder arterial blood rather than being lost at the gills. The net effect is less heat loss through the gills. Fish from warmer water elevate their temperature a few degrees whereas those from cold water may raise it as much as {{convert|20|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer than the surrounding sea.

The tuna's ability to maintain body temperature has several definite advantages over other sea life. It need not limit its range according to water temperature, nor is it dominated by climatic changes. The additional heat supplied to the muscles is also advantageous because of the resulting extra power and speed.  Bluefin tuna have been clocked in excess of {{convert|30|mph|km/h}} during 10 to 20 second sprints, enabling it to hunt [[squid]], [[herring]], [[mackerel]], etc., that slower predators cannot capture.

==Distribution==
The Pacific bluefin tuna is primarily found in the [[North Pacific]], ranging from the [[East Asia]]n coast to the western coast of North America.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; It is mainly a [[pelagic]] species found in [[temperate]] oceans, but it also ranges into the tropics and more coastal regions.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; It typically occurs from the surface to {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; but has been recorded as deep as {{convert|550|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

It [[Spawn (biology)|spawns]] in the northwestern [[Philippine Sea]] (e.g., off [[Honshu]], [[Okinawa]] and [[Taiwan]]) and in the [[Sea of Japan]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Monterey&gt;Monterey Bay Aquarium. ''[http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals/AnimalDetails.aspx?enc=n3f4wmcSJaMg34hN7vu5yQ== Pacific bluefin tuna.]'' Accessed 30 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these [[Fish migration|migrate]] to the East Pacific and return to the spawning grounds after a few years.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; It has been recorded more locally as a visitor to the [[Southern Hemisphere]], including off Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[Gulf of Papua]] and [[French Polynesia]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt;

The species is considered to consist of only one stock.&lt;ref name="AsiaPacific-FishWatch 2017"/&gt;

==Life cycle==
[[File:Thunnus orientalis (Osaka Kaiyukan Aquarium).jpg|thumb|At [[Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan]], Japan]]
Pacific bluefin tunas reach maturity at about 5 years of age, the generation length is estimated at 7–9 years and based on two separate sources the [[longevity]] is 15 year or 26 years.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; At maturity it is about {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=on}} long and weighs about {{convert|60|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Individuals that are {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} long are regularly seen, and the maximum reported is {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|450|kg|abbr=on}} in weight.&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; Elsewhere, a mass of up to {{convert|550|kg|lb|abbr=on}} has been reported for the species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090219062345/http://tagagiant.org/Science.Pac.shtml TAG Bluefin Science in the Pacific]. Tag-A-Giant Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Game Fish Association]], the all-tackle game fish record was a {{convert|411.6|kg|abbr=on}} individual (Donna Pascoe) caught on 19 February 2014 onboard charter boat Gladiator during the National Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fishingpro.co.nz/news/world-record-pacific-bluefin-tuna&lt;/ref&gt;

Spawning occurs from April to August, but the exact timing depends on the region: Early in the northwest [[Philippine Sea]] (the southern part of its breeding range) and late in the [[Sea of Japan]] (the northern part of its breeding range).&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Large females can carry more eggs than small ones, and between 5 million and 25 million eggs have been reported.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

Pacific bluefins eat various small schooling [[squid]]s and fishes, but have also been recorded taking [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals,&lt;ref name=fishbase/&gt; [[pelagic red crab]]s and [[krill]].&lt;ref name=Monterey/&gt;

[[Monterey Bay Aquarium]]'s [[Seafood Watch]] program have placed all bluefin tunas on the "Avoid" list,&lt;ref name=SeafoodWatch/&gt; and they are also placed on the "Red List" by both [[Greenpeace]] and the [[Blue Ocean Institute]].&lt;ref name=GreenpeaceRedList/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlueOceanI/&gt;

Pacific bluefin flesh may contain levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] that are harmful to humans that consume it.&lt;ref name=BlueOceanI/&gt; A [[Tuna#Mercury levels|similar problem]] exists in other tuna species.

About 80% of the Pacific and [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]]s are consumed in Japan, and tunas that are particular suited for [[sashimi]] and [[sushi]] can reach very high prices. In Japan, some foods made available for the first time of the year are considered good luck, especially bluefin tuna. Winning these new year auctions is often used as a way to get publicity, which raises the prices considerably higher than their market value: on January 5, 2013, a {{convert|489|lb|adj=on}} Pacific bluefin tuna caught off northeastern Japan was sold in the first auction of the year at the [[Tsukiji fish market]] in [[Tokyo]] for a record 155.4 million [[Japanese yen|yen]] (US$1.76 million) – leading to record [[unit price]]s of $3,603 per pound, or ¥ 703,167 per kilogram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A bluefin tuna sells for record $1.76M in Tokyo|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/01/04/bluefin-tuna-tokyo-sushi/1810557/?dlvrit=206567|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=5 January 2013|date=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Photojournalism''' is a particular  form of [[journalism]] (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, but in some cases the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of [[photography]] (e.g., [[documentary photography]], [[social documentary photography]], [[street photography]] or [[celebrity photography]]) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. They deliver [[news]] in a creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining.

; Timeliness: The images have meaning in the context of a recently published record of events.

; Objectivity: The situation implied by the images is a fair and accurate representation of the events they depict in both content and tone.

; Narrative: The images combine with other news elements to make facts relatable to audiences.

Like a writer, a photojournalist is a [[journalist|reporter]], but he or she must often make decisions instantly and carry [[camera|photographic equipment]], often while exposed to significant obstacles (e.g., physical danger, weather, crowds, physical access).

==History==

===Origins in war photography===

The practice of illustrating news stories with photographs was made possible by printing and photography innovations that occurred in the mid 19th century. Although early illustrations had appeared in newspapers, such as an illustration of the funeral of Lord [[Horatio Nelson]] in ''[[The Times]]'' (1806), the first weekly illustrated newspaper  was the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', first printed in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC|title=Dictionary of Nineteenth-century Journalism in Great Britain and Ireland|author1=Laurel Brake |author2=Marysa Demoor |author3=Margaret Beetham |year=2009|publisher=Academia Press|page=495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations were printed with the use of [[engraving]]s.

The first photograph to be used in illustration of a newspaper story was a depiction of barricades in Paris during the [[June Days uprising]] taken on 25 June 1848; the photo was published as an engraving in [[L'Illustration]] of 1-8 July 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barricades in Rue Saint-Maur-Popincourt, 25th June 1848|url=https://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/xir244919fre/barricades-in-rue-saint-maur-popincourt-xir244919-fre/|website=PBS LearningMedia|accessdate=9 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[American Civil War]] photographs of [[Mathew Brady]] were engraved before publication in ''[[Harper's Weekly]].'' Disaster, including train wrecks and city fires, was also a popular subject for illustrated newspapers in the early days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlebach|first=Michael L.|title=The Origins of Photojournalism in America|year=1992|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|isbn=1-56098-159-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The printing of images in newspapers remained an isolated occurrence in this period. Photos were used to enhance the text rather than to act as a medium of information in its own right. This began to change with the work of one of the pioneers of photojournalism, [[John Thomson (photographer)|John Thomson]], in the late 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvK2mgEACAAJ|title=John Thomson, Photojournalist in Asia, 1862-1872|author=Elliott S. Parker|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the radical journalist Adolphe Smith, he began publishing a monthly magazine, ''Street Life in London'', from 1876 to 1877. The project documented in photographs and text, the lives of the street people of [[London]] and established [[social documentary photography]] as a form of photojournalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/thomson/introduction.html|title=The photographs of John Thomson|publisher=National Library of Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of the images acting as a supplement to the text, he pioneered the use of printed photographs as the predominant [[media (communication)|medium for the imparting of information]], successfully combining photography with the [[Print culture|printed word]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ovenden|first=Richard|title=John Thomson (1837-1921) Photographer|year=1997|publisher=National Library of Scotland|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0114958335|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 1880, ''[[Daily Graphic|The Daily Graphic]]'' (New York)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.ic.gc.ca/heirloom_series/volume4/14-15.htm |title=Welcome to... / Bienvenue r |publisher=Collections.ic.gc.ca |date=2001-05-01 |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103145611/http://collections.ic.gc.ca/heirloom_series/volume4/14-15.htm |archivedate=2011-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published the first [[halftone]] (rather than engraved) reproduction of a news photograph.

In March 1886, when General [[George Crook]] received word that the Apache leader [[Geronimo]] would negotiate surrender terms, photographer [[C. S. Fly]] took his equipment and attached himself to the military column. During the three days of negotiations, Fly took about 15 exposures on {{convert|8|by|10|in}} glass negatives.&lt;ref name=vaughan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaughan|first=Thomas|title=C.S.

The popular publication ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' published six of his images in their April 24, 1886 issue.&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt;&lt;ref name=vaughan/&gt;

In 1887, [[flash powder]] was invented, enabling journalists such as [[Jacob Riis]] to photograph informal subjects indoors, which led to the landmark work ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authentichistory.com/postcivilwar/riis/contents.html ''How the Other Half Lives'' complete text and photos online]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1897, it became possible to reproduce halftone photographs on printing presses running at full speed.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Taft, ''Photography and the American scene: A social history, 1839–1889'' (New York: Dover, 1964), 446&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=W.

In France, agencies such as Rol, Branger and [[Charles Chusseau-Flaviens|Chusseau-Flaviens]] (ca. 1880–1910) syndicated photographs from around the world to meet the need for timely new illustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gervais | first=Thierry | title=Photographies de presse | journal=Études photographiques | language=French | pages=166–181 | url=http://etudesphotographiques.revues.org/index729.html | number=16 |date=May 2005 | accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these innovations, limitations remained, and many of the sensational [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] stories in the period from 1897 to 1927 were illustrated with engravings. In 1921, the [[wirephoto]] made it possible to transmit pictures almost as quickly as news itself could travel.

===Golden age===

The "Golden Age of Photojournalism" is often considered to be roughly the 1930s through the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Terence P. ''Introduction to the History of Communication: Evolutions &amp; Revolutions.'' Peter Lang Publishing, 2010. p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; It was made possible by the development of the compact commercial [[35mm film|35mm]] [[Leica Camera|Leica]] camera in 1925, and the first [[flash bulb]]s between 1927 and 1930, which allowed the journalist true flexibility in taking pictures.

[[File:Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The ''[[Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung]]'' pioneered modern photojournalism and was widely copied. Pictured, the cover of issue of 26 August 1936: a meeting between [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Emilio Mola]].]]

A new style of magazine and newspaper appeared that used photography more than text to tell stories. The ''[[Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung]]'' was the first to pioneer the format of the illustrated news magazine. Beginning in 1901, it began to print photographs inside the magazine, a revolutionary innovation. In the successive decades, it was developed into the prototype of the modern news magazine.&lt;ref name=Ganeva53&gt;Mila Ganeva, ''Women in Weimar Fashion: Discourses and Displays in German Culture, 1918–1933'', Screen cultures, Rochester, New York: Camden House, 2008, {{ISBN|9781571132055}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d_GByB6YjCkC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Berliner+Illustrirte+Zeitung&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PMTxUM2GKuPBigLQnIHABg&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Berliner%20Illustrirte%20Zeitung&amp;f=false p. 53].&lt;/ref&gt;

It pioneered the photo-essay,&lt;ref name=Ganeva53/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Warner Marien, ''Photography: A Cultural History'', Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2002, {{ISBN|9780810905597}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ur_8L9hasQkC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=Berliner+Illustrirte+Zeitung&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j7PyUOH4NtHNigKVjIDgAg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=pioneered%20the%20photo-essay&amp;f=false p. 235].&lt;/ref&gt; had a specialised staff and production unit for pictures and maintained a photo library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Corey Ross|title=Media and the Making of Modern Germany: Mass Communications, Society, and Politics from the Empire to the Third Reich|publisher=Oxford/New York: Oxford University|year=2008|ISBN=9780191557293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qA5ptR85VC0C|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced the use of candid photographs taken with the new smaller cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Brett Abbott|title=Engaged Observers: Documentary Photography Since the Sixties Exhibition catalogue|publisher=Los Angeles: J.

The magazine sought out reporters who could tell a story using photographs, notably the pioneer sports photographer [[Martin Munkácsi]], the first staff photographer,&lt;ref&gt;Tim Gidal, "Modern Photojournalism: The First Years", ''Creative Camera'', July/August 1982, repr. in: David Brittain, ed., ''Creative Camera: 30 Years of Writing'', Critical Image, Manchester: Manchester University, 1999, {{ISBN|9780719058042}}, pp. 73–80, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_WK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Berliner+Illustrirte+Zeitung,+Munk%C3%A1csi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DgH0UJaUOcG0igLjwIDoBQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Berliner%20Illustrirte%20Zeitung%2C%20Munk%C3%A1csi&amp;f=false p. 75].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Morris Hambourg, "Photography between the Wars: Selections from the Ford Motor Company Collection", ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' N.S. 45.4, Spring 1988, pp. 5–56, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3258720?seq=13&amp;Search=yes&amp;searchText=Titanic&amp;list=show&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DTitanic%26filter%3Diid%253A10.2307%252Fi364209%26Search%3DSearch%26wc%3Don%26fc%3Doff%26globalSearch%3D%26sbbBox%3D%26sbjBox%3D%26sbpBox%3D&amp;prevSearch=&amp;item=1&amp;ttl=1&amp;returnArticleService=showFullText&amp;resultsServiceName=null p. 17].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erich Salomon]], one of the founders of photojournalism.&lt;ref&gt;Sherre Lynn Paris, "Raising Press Photography to Visual Communication in American Schools of Journalism, with Attention to the Universities of Missouri and Texas, 1880's–1990's", Dissertation, University of Texas, 2007, {{OCLC|311853822}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ayZP0D3amnsC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Berliner+Illustrirte+Zeitung+Erich+Salomon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g-_yUKaKKqK6igLZqoGQCA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Berliner%20Illustrirte%20Zeitung%20Erich%20Salomon&amp;f=false p. 116].&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous photographers of the era included [[Robert Capa]], [[Romano Cagnoni]], [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]], [[Margaret Bourke-White]] and [[W. Eugene Smith]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] is held by some to be the father of modern photojournalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/aug/04/arts.henricartierbresson|title=Father of photo-journalism, Cartier-Bresson, dies at 96|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this appellation has been applied to various other photographers, such as [[Erich Salomon]], whose candid pictures of political figures were novel in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comesana.com/english/salomon.php|title=Erich Salomon, photographer|publisher=Eduardo Comesaña}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photojournalism of, for example, [[Agustí Centelles]] played an important role in the propaganda efforts of the Republican side in the [[Spanish Civil War]] in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albavolunteer.org/2011/12/stunning-spanish-civil-war-photography-exhibit-closes-with-symposium/|title=Photography exhibit sparks symposium|publisher=Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|In ''Migrant Mother'' [[Dorothea Lange]] produced the seminal image of the [[Great Depression]]. The FSA also employed several other photojournalists to document the depression.]]

Soldier [[Tony Vaccaro]] is also recognized as one of the pre-eminent photographers of [[World War II]]. His images taken with the modest [[Argus C3]] captured horrific moments in war, similar to Capa's Spanish soldier being shot. Capa himself was on [[Omaha Beach]] on [[D-Day]] and captured pivotal images of the conflict on that occasion. Vaccaro is also known for having developed his own images in soldier's helmets, and using chemicals found in the ruins of a camera store in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-underfire-review-20161017-snap-story.html|title=Underfire: The Untold Story of Pfc.

Until the 1980s, most large newspapers were printed with turn-of-the-century "letterpress" technology using easily smudged oil-based ink, off-white, low-quality "newsprint" paper, and coarse engraving screens. While letterpresses produced legible text, the photoengraving dots that formed pictures often bled or smeared and became fuzzy and indistinct. In this way, even when newspapers used photographs well&amp;nbsp;— a good crop, a respectable size&amp;nbsp;— murky reproduction often left readers re-reading the caption to see what the photo was all about. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' adopted [[stipple]]d [[hedcut]]s in 1979 to publish portraits and avoid the limitations of letterpress printing. Not until the 1980s did a majority of newspapers switch to "offset" presses that reproduce photos with fidelity on better, whiter paper.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

By contrast ''Life'', one of America's most popular weekly magazines from 1936 through the early 1970s, was filled with photographs reproduced beautifully on oversize 11×14-inch pages, using fine engraving screens, high-quality inks, and glossy paper. ''Life'' often published a [[United Press International]] (UPI) or [[Associated Press]] (AP) photo that had been first reproduced in newspapers, but the quality magazine version appeared to be a different photo altogether. In large part because their pictures were clear enough to be appreciated, and because their name always appeared with their work, magazine photographers achieved near-celebrity status. ''Life'' became a standard by which the public judged photography, and many of today's photo books celebrate "photojournalism" as if it had been the exclusive province of near-celebrity magazine photographers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1947 a few famous photographers founded the international photographic cooperative [[Magnum Photos]]. In 1989 [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis Corporation]] and in 1995 [[Getty Images]] were founded. These powerful image libraries sell the rights to photographs and other still images.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Decline===

The Golden Age of Photojournalism ended in the 1970s when many photo-magazines ceased publication. They found that they could not compete with other media for advertising revenue to sustain their large circulations and high costs. Still, those magazines taught journalism much about the photographic essay and the power of still images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jprof.com/magazines/05goldagephotog.html |title=Magazines and Photojournalism's Golden Age |last=Stovall |first=Jim |year=2005 |publisher=Jprof.com |accessdate=2012-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309021921/http://www.jprof.com/magazines/05goldagephotog.html |archivedate=2013-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since the late 1970s, photojournalism and [[documentary photography]] have increasingly been accorded a place in art galleries alongside [[fine art photography]]. [[Luc Delahaye]], [[Manuel Rivera-Ortiz]] and the members of [[VII Photo Agency]] are among many who regularly exhibit in galleries and museums.&lt;ref name="ZoneZero"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Malo | first=Alejandro | title=Documentary Art | publisher=ZoneZero | url=http://www.zonezero.com/zz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1157&amp;catid=14 | accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations==

The [[Danish Union of Press Photographers]] (Pressefotografforbundet) was the first national organization for newspaper photographers in the world. It was founded in 1912 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] by six press photographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressefotografforbundet.dk/forbundet/historie.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020609143555/http://www.pressefotografforbundet.dk/forbundet/historie.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-06-09 |title=Historie |language=Danish |publisher=pressefotografforbundet.dk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it has over 800 members.

The [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) was founded in 1946 in the U.S., and has about 10,000 members. Others around the world include the British Press Photographers Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebppa.com/ thebppa.com]&lt;/ref&gt; (BPPA) founded in 1984, then relaunched in 2003, and now has around 450 members. Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (1989), Northern Ireland Press Photographers Association (2000), Pressfotografernas Klubb (Sweden, 1930), and PK&amp;nbsp;— Pressefotografenes Klubb (Norway).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebppa.com/ British Press Photographers Association]; [http://www.hkppa.net/ Hong Kong Press Photographers Association]; [http://www.n-ippa.org/ Northern Ireland Press Photographers Association]; {{Sv icon}} [http://www.pfk.se/ Pressfotografernas Klubb]; {{no icon}} [http://www.fotojournalisten.com/ Fotojournalisten].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magnum Photos]] was founded in 1947 by [[Robert Capa]], [[David Seymour (photographer)|David "Chim" Seymour]], [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], [[George Rodger]], [[William Vandivert]], [[Rita Vandivert]] and [[Maria Eisner]], being one of the first photographic cooperatives, owned and administered entirely by its members worldwide.

[[VII Photo Agency]] was founded in September 2001 and got its name from the original seven founders, [[Alexandra Boulat]], [[Ron Haviv]], [[Gary Knight]], [[Antonin Kratochvil]], [[Christopher Morris (photographer)|Christopher Morris]], [[James Nachtwey]] and [[John Stanmeyer]]. Today it has 30 members, along with a mentor program.

News organizations and journalism schools run many different awards for photojournalists. Since 1968, [[Pulitzer Prizes]] have been awarded for the following categories of photojournalism: 'Feature Photography', 'Spot News Photography'. Other awards are World Press Photo, Best of Photojournalism, and Pictures of the Year as well as the UK based The Press Photographer's Year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpressphoto.org/ World Press Photo]; [http://bop.nppa.org/ Best of Photojournalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722135919/http://bop.nppa.org/ |date=2012-07-22 }}; [http://www.poyi.org/ Pictures of the Year]; [http://www.theppy.com/ The Press Photographer's Year]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical, legal, and social considerations==
[[File:Press photographers, 2016 Labour Party Conference.jpg|thumb|Photojournalists at the 2016 [[Labour Party (UK) Conference|Labour Party Conference]] in Liverpool]]
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}
Photojournalism works within the same ethical approaches to objectivity that are applied by other journalists. What to shoot, how to frame and how to edit are constant considerations. Photographing news for an assignment is one of the most ethical problems photographers face. Photojournalists have a moral responsibility to decide what pictures to take, what picture to stage, and what pictures to show the public. For example, photographs of violence and tragedy are prevalent in American journalism because as an understated rule of thumb, that "if it bleeds, it leads". The public is attracted to gruesome photographs and dramatic stories. A lot of controversy arises when deciding which photographs are too violent to show the public.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Photographs of the dead or injured arouse controversy because, more often than not, the name of person depicted in the photograph is not given in the caption. The family of the person is often not informed of the photograph until they see it published. The photograph of the street execution of a suspected Viet Cong soldier during the Vietnam War provoked a lot of interest because it captured the exact moment of death. The family of the victim was also not informed that the picture would run publicly.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Being exposed to such violence can have physiological and psychological effects on those who document it and is but one of many different forms of emotional labor that photojournalists report experiencing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=TJ|date=2018-09-07|title=Mapping the emotional labor and work of visual journalism|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1464884918799227|journal=Journalism|language=en|pages=146488491879922|doi=10.1177/1464884918799227|issn=1464-8849}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Other issues involving photojournalism include the [[right to privacy]] and the compensation of the news subject. Especially regarding pictures of violence, photojournalists face the ethical dilemma of whether or not to publish images of the victims. The victim's right to privacy is sometimes not addressed or the picture is printed without their knowledge or consent. The compensation of the subject is another issue. Subjects often want to be paid in order for the picture to be published, especially if the picture is of a controversial subject.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Another major issue of photojournalism is [[photo manipulation]]&amp;nbsp;– what degree is acceptable?&amp;nbsp; Some pictures are simply manipulated for color enhancement, whereas others are manipulated to the extent where people are edited in or out of the picture. [[War photography]] has always been a genre of photojournalism that is frequently staged. Due to the bulkiness and types of cameras present during past wars in history, it was rare when a photograph could capture a spontaneous news event. Subjects were carefully composed and staged in order to capture better images. Another ethical issue is false or misleading captioning. The [[2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies]] is a notable example of some of these issue, and see [[Photo manipulation#Use in journalism|photo manipulation: use in journalism]] for other examples.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The emergence of [[digital photography]] offers whole new realms of opportunity for the manipulation, reproduction, and transmission of images. It has inevitably complicated many of the ethical issues involved.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Often, ethical conflicts can be mitigated or enhanced by the actions of a sub-editor or picture editor, who takes control of the images once they have been delivered to the news organization. The photojournalist often has no control as to how images are ultimately used.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) is an American professional society that emphasizes photojournalism. Members of the NPPA accept the following code of ethics
{{block quote|
# The practice of photojournalism, both as a science and art, is worthy of the very best thought and effort of those who enter into it as a profession.
# Photojournalism affords an opportunity to serve the public that is equaled by few other vocations and all members of the profession should strive by example and influence to maintain high standards of ethical conduct free of mercenary considerations of any kind.
# It is the individual responsibility of every photojournalist at all times to strive for pictures that report truthfully, honestly and objectively.
# Business promotion in its many forms is essential, but untrue statements of any nature are not worthy of a professional photojournalist and we severely condemn any such practice.
# It is our duty to encourage and assist all members of our profession, individually and collectively, so that the quality of photojournalism may constantly be raised to higher standards.
# It is the duty of every photojournalist to work to preserve all freedom-of-the-press rights recognized by law and to work to protect and expand freedom-of-access to all sources of news and visual information.
# Our standards of business dealings, ambitions and relations shall have in them a note of sympathy for our common humanity and shall always require us to take into consideration our highest duties as members of society. In every situation in our business life, in every responsibility that comes before us, our chief thought shall be to fulfill that responsibility and discharge that duty so that when each of us is finished we shall have endeavored to lift the level of human ideals and achievement higher than we found it.
# No Code of Ethics can prejudge every situation, thus common sense and good judgment are required in applying ethical principles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nppa.org/code_of_ethics USNPPA Code of Ethics]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Unethical practices==

Most photojournalists consider stage-managed shots presented as candid to be unethical.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethical Journalist: Making Responsible Decisions in the Digital Age|last=Foreman|first=Gene|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781119031734|location=United States|pages=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been examples in the history of photojournalism of photographers purposefully deceiving their audience by doing so.

Mike Meadows, a veteran photographer of the [[Los Angeles Times]], was covering a major wild fire sweeping southern California on 27 October 1993. His picture of a [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] firefighter, Mike Alves cooling himself off with water in a pool in [[Altadena, California|Altadena]] ran both in the Times and nationally. Prior to submitting the photograph for a [[Pulitzer Prize]], Meadows' assignment editor, Fred Sweets, contacted the firefighter, who reportedly said he had been asked by Meadows to go to the pool and splash water on his head. Meadows denied the accusation, claiming "I may have been guilty of saying this would make a nice shot, but to the best of my recollection, I did not directly ask him to do that. ... I've been doing breaking news stories for years and years and I've never in my life set up a picture." Meadows was suspended without pay for a week and picture was withdrawn from any prize competitions - the Times called it a "fabrication" and the paper's photography director, Larry Armstrong, said "when you manipulate the situation, you manipulate the news."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1994/02/02/la-times-gets-burned-by-disaster-photograph/c01c281d-45a3-4b7f-b048-477c5e072649/|title=L.A. TIMES GETS BURNED BY DISASTER PHOTOGRAPH|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|date=2 February 1994|work=Washington Post|access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Keating, a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner from [[The New York Times]], photographed a young boy pointing a toy gun outside a Middle Eastern grocery store, near a town where the [[FBI]] raided an alleged [[Al Qaeda]] cell. Other photographers at the scene claimed that Keating pointed with his own arm to show the boy which way to look and aim the gun. After the Columbia Journalism Review reported the incident, Keating was forced to leave the paper.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Kobre]]. 2008. Photojournalism: The Professionals' Approach&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of new technologies==
[[File:Roger Fenton and his assistant with photographic van.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|''Roger Fenton's Photographic Van'', 1855, formerly a wine merchant's wagon; his assistant is pictured at the front.]]
As early as the [[Crimean War]] in the mid-19th century, photographers were using the novel technology of the  [[photographic plates|glass plate camera]] to record images of British soldiers in the field. As a result, they had to deal with not only war conditions, but their pictures often required long [[shutter speeds]], and they had to prepare each plate before taking the shot and develop it immediately after. This led to, for example, [[Roger Fenton]] traveling around in a transportable dark room, which at times made him a target of the enemy. These technological barriers are why he was unable to obtain any direct images of the action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/remembrance-day-part-1-photographing-war-fenton-crimean/|title=Photographing Conflict: Roger Fenton And The Crimean War|last=Harding|first=Colin|date=2012|website=|publisher=National Media Museum|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of photography as a way of reporting news did not become widespread until the advent of smaller, more portable cameras that used an enlargeable [[film negative]] to record images. The introduction of the 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[Leica camera]] in 1925 made it possible for photographers to move with the action, take multiple shots of events as they were unfolding, as well as be more able to create a narrative through their photographs alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Fay|date=2014|title=Chasing the pictures: press and magazine photography|url=|journal=Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy|page=47|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, motor drives, electronic flash, auto-focus, better lenses and other camera enhancements have made picture-taking easier. New [[digital camera]]s free photojournalists from the limitation of film roll length. Although the number depends on the amount of megapixels the camera contains, whether one's shooting mode is [[JPEG]] or [[Raw image format|raw]], and what size of memory card one is using, it is possible to store thousands of images on a single [[memory card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/69/~/number-of-pictures-that-can-be-stored-on-a-memory-device|title=Sandisk|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LEI0060 186 Leica I Sn.5193 1927 Originalzustand Front-2 FS-15.jpg|thumb|Leica 1, (1925)'s introduction marked the beginning of modern photojournalism.]]
Social media are playing a big part in revealing world events to a vast audience. Whenever there is a major event in the world, there are usually people with camera phones ready to capture photos and post them on various social networks. Such convenience allows the Associated Press and other companies to reach out to the citizen journalist who holds ownership of the photos and get permission to use those photos in news outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keller|first1=Jared|title=Photojournalism in the Age of New Media|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/04/photojournalism-in-the-age-of-new-media/73083/|website=theatlantic.com|publisher=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of photos tends to outweigh their quality when it comes to news value. On February 18, 2004, The New York Times published on their front page a photo of AT&amp;T CEO John Zeglis which was taken with a camera phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=Stephen|title=Convergent journalism : the fundamentals of multimedia reporting|date=2005|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=0820474525|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content remains the most important element of photojournalism, but the ability to extend deadlines with rapid gathering and editing of images has brought significant changes. As recently as 15 years ago, nearly 30 minutes were needed to scan and transmit a single color photograph from a remote location to a news office for printing. Now, equipped with a digital camera, a [[mobile phone]] and a [[laptop]] computer, a photojournalist can send a high-quality image in minutes, even seconds after an event occurs. [[Camera phone]]s and portable [[satellite]] links increasingly allow for the mobile transmission of images from almost any point on the earth.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

There is some concern by news photographers that the profession of photojournalism as it is known today could change to such a degree that it is unrecognizable as image-capturing technology naturally progresses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/business/media/10photo.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=photojournalism&amp;st=cse "Lament for a Dying Field: Photojournalism," New York Times, August 10, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Staff photojournalism jobs continue to dwindle in the 2010s and some of the largest news media outlets in the U.S. now rely on freelancers for the majority of their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=T. J.|date=2016-08-12|title=Freelance Photojournalists and Photo Editors|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2016.1215851|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–21|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2016.1215851|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2016, the New York Times employed 52 photo editors and relied on freelancers to provide 50 percent or more of its visuals; The Wall Street Journal employed 24 photo editors and relied on freelancers for 66 percent of its features imagery and 33 percent of its news imagery; The Washington Post employed 19 photo editors and relied on freelancers for 80 percent of its international news imagery, 50 percent of its political news imagery, and between 60 and 80 percent of its national news imagery.

The age of the citizen journalist and the providing of news photos by amateur bystanders have contributed to the art of  photojournalism. [[Paul Levinson]] attributes this shift to the [[Kodak]] camera, one of the first cheap and accessible photo technologies that "put a piece of visual reality into every person's potential grasp."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Levinson]]. 1997. The Soft Edge: a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution, Routledge, London and New York, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The empowered news audience with the advent of the Internet sparked the creation of [[blogs]], [[podcasts]] and online news, independent of the traditional outlets, and "for the first time in our history, the news increasingly is produced by companies outside journalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kovach |first1=B. |last2=Rosenstiel |first2=T. |year=2006 |url=http://www.journalism.org/node/72 |title=The Elements of Journalism; What Newspeople Should Know and the Public Should Expect |publisher=journalism.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002000433/http://www.journalism.org/node/72 |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/10/when-photojournalists-and-thei/?scp=2&amp;sq=photojournalism&amp;st=cse |title=Gamma's Bankruptcy Shows Shift in Photojournalism |publisher= New York Times |date= August 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Chung, a former photojournalist for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and [[Reuters]], believes that professional photojournalists will have to adapt to video to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;[[dpreview.com]] [http://www.dpreview.com/articles/9982656990/no-future-in-photojournalism-interview-dan-chung 'No Future in Photojournalism' Interview: Dan Chung] Barney Britton Feb 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[digital single lens reflex]] bodies are being equipped with video capabilities.{{cite-needed|date=February 2017}}

===iPhone journalism===
Phone journalism is a relatively new and even controversial means of photojournalism, which involves the use of pictures taken and edited on phones by professional or non-professional photographers.

In recent years, as social media become major platforms on which people receive news and share events, Phone photography is gaining popularity as the primary tool for online visual communication. A phone is easy to carry and always accessible in a pocket, and the immediacy in taking pictures can reduce the intervention of the scene and subjects to a minimum.  With the assistance of abundant applications, photographers can achieve a highly aesthetic way of conveying messages.  Once the pictures are uploaded onto social media, photographers can immediately expose their work to a wide range of audiences and receive real-time feedback from them.  With a large number of active participants online, the pictures could also be spread out in a short period of time, thus evoking profound influence on society.

Having noticed the advantages of the combination of social media and [[Phoneography]], some well-known newspapers, news magazines and professional photojournalists decided to employ iPhone journalism as a new approach.  When the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London Bombings]] happened in July 2005, for the first time, both the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' ran photos on their front pages made by citizen journalists with camera phones.&lt;ref name="Lavoie"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = War and the iPhone|url = http://etudesphotographiques.revues.org/3480|journal = Études photographiques|date = 2012-05-24|issn = 1270-9050|issue = 29|language = en|first = Vincent|last = Lavoie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As work of witnesses and survivors, the images were less the outcome of documentary intent than a response to a traumatic shock.&lt;ref name="Lavoie" /&gt; These photos represented 'vivid, factual accounts of history as it explodes around us',&lt;ref name="Lavoie" /&gt; as described by ''Washington Post'' journalist Robert MacMillan.  In another instance, when superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast, causing great damage and casualty, Time sent out five photographers with iPhones to document the devastation. Photographers dived deep into the site and captured pictures in close proximity to the storm and human suffering.  One of the shots, raging ocean waves collapsing on [[Coney Island]] in Brooklyn, taken by Benjamin Lowy, made the cover of Time's November 12 issue.  Then in 2013, the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] got rid of its entire staff of 28 photographers, including [[John H. White (photojournalist)|John H. White]], a [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography|Pulitzer Prize winner in photography]]. The newspaper cited viewers shifting towards more video as a reason. They then employed freelance photographers and required them to train in how to use an iPhone for photography to fill the gap. Some viewers online were quick to point out an at times reduction in quality in comparison to the newspaper's previous full-time professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-30/business/chi-chicago-sun-times-photo-20130530_1_chicago-sun-times-photo-staff-video|title=Chicago Tribune|last=Channick|first=Robert|date=May 30, 2013|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.poynter.org/2013/sun-times-will-train-reporters-on-iphone-photography-basics/214954/|title=Poynter|last=Beaujon|first=Andrew|date=May 31, 2013|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/replacing-photographers-with-iphone-wielding-reporters-yields-mixed-results/|title=Wired|last=Schiller|first=Jakob|date=July 16, 2013|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7322">A '''reverse telephone directory''' (also known as a '''gray pages''' directory, '''criss-cross directory''' or '''reverse phone lookup''') is a collection of telephone numbers and associated customer details. However, unlike a standard [[telephone directory]], where the user uses customer's details (such as name and address) in order to retrieve the telephone number of that person or business, a reverse telephone directory allows users to search by a telephone service number in order to retrieve the customer details for that service.

Reverse telephone directories are used by law enforcement and other emergency services in order to determine the origin of any request for assistance, however these systems include both publicly accessible (listed) and private (unlisted) services. As such, these directories are restricted to internal use only. Some forms of [[city directory|city directories]] provide this form of lookup for listed services by phone number, along with address cross-referencing.

Publicly accessible reverse telephone directories may be provided as part of the standard directory services from the telecommunications carrier in some countries. In other countries these directories are often created by [[phreaking|phone phreaker]]s by collecting the information available via the publicly accessible directories and then providing a search function which allows users to search by the telephone service details.

==History==
Printed reverse phone directories have been produced by the telephone companies (in the United States) for decades, and were distributed to the phone companies, law enforcement, and [[public library|public libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19720102&amp;id=87osAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vgkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3122,379459 | title=Clinton Directory Issued | date=Jan 2, 1972 | accessdate=9 February 2014 | location=Page 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, businesses started offering reverse telephone lookups for fees, and by the early 2000s advertising-based reverse directories were available online, prompting occasional alarms about privacy concerns.

==Australia==
In 2001, a legal case ''[[Telstra|Telstra Corporation Ltd]] v Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd'' was heard in the Australian Federal Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/2001/612.html|title=Telstra Corporation Limited v Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd (2001) FCA 612 (25 May 2001)|author=[[Federal Court of Australia]]|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=austliiPP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/PLPR/2001/25.html|title=Private parts - PLPR 25; (2001) 8 PLPR 24|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave Telstra, the predominant carrier within Australia and the maintainer of the publicly accessible [[White Pages]] (residential) and [[Yellow Pages]] (commercial) directories, [[copyright]] over the content of these directories.

In February 2010 a Federal Court of Australia case ''[[Telstra|Telstra Corporation Ltd]] v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd'' determined that Telstra does not hold copyright in the White Pages or the Yellow Pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/copyright-to-enter-a-new-dimension-20101215-18y9o.html|title=Copyright to enter a new dimension|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| first=Malcolm|last=Maiden|date=16 December 2010|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it currently{{when|date=October 2014}} stands there is no legal way to ensure a particular number is not listed in the directories currently available.

==United States==

In United States, landline phone subscribers can pay a small fee to exclude their number from the directory. This service is usually called "Your Listing Not Published" and the cost ranges between $0.80 and $1.50 per month for residential customers.

As [[cellular phones]] become more popular, there has been debate about releasing cell phone numbers into public [[4-1-1|411]] and reverse number directories. (S. 1963, the "Wireless 411 Privacy Act" 9/2004). However, opposition led by leading consumer-protection organization [[Consumers Union]] presented several privacy concerns in their congressional [http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/wireless%20411%20senate%20testimony%20final.pdf testimony]. Right now,{{when|date=October 2014}} cell phone numbers are not available in any public 411 or reverse-number directories. However, several information companies provide reverse cell phone lookups that are obtained from utility resources, and are available online. Because there is no central database of cell phone numbers, reverse phone directories that claim to be free cannot return information on those numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evaluating the utility and accuracy of a reverse telephone directory to identify the location of survey respondents. | work=2005 Feb |vauthors=Schootman M, Jeffe D, Kinman E, Higgs G, Jackson-Thompson J | pmid=15652722 | doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2004.06.005 | volume=15 | pages=160-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years{{when|date=October 2014}} community web based services offer a reverse telephone directory of known telemarketers, debt collectors, fund raisers, and other solicitors which contact consumers by telephone.  Users of these services can perform a search of the telephone number which showed up on their caller ID and read through user comments to find the identity of the calling company or individual.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom proper, reverse directory information is not publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/directories_of_subscribers | title=Directories of subscribers | publisher=Information Commissioner's Office | accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[Channel Islands]] it is provided in the printed telephone directories.

Although the information is, of necessity, available to emergency services, for other agencies it is treated as 'communication data' in the [[RIPA]] regime and subject to the same controls as requests for lists of and content of calls.

Like the United States community web based services, such as Who-calls.me.uk and &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.whocallsme.eu/&lt;/nowiki&gt; offer a reverse telephone directory service. Who-calls.me.uk was ranked as the UK as the 63671st popular website for traffic volume at the end of May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.easycounter.com/report/who-calls.me.uk|title=Who-calls.me.uk: UK Free Phone Numbers Lookup|website=www.easycounter.com|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''San Diego Museum of Art''' is a fine arts museum located at 1450 El Prado in [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]] in [[San Diego]], California that houses a broad collection with particular strength in Spanish art.  The San Diego Museum of Art opened as The Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego on February 28, 1926, and changed its name to the San Diego Museum of Art in 1978.&lt;ref name="Davenport"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davenport |first1=William  |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Fine Art Treasures in the West|year=1966|publisher=Lane Magazine &amp; Book Company|location=Menlo Park, California|pages=27–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdmart.org/info-history.html |title=History of SDMA |publisher=San Diego Museum of Art |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102063301/http://www.sdmart.org/info-history.html |archivedate=January 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official Balboa Park website calls the San Diego Museum of Art "the region's oldest and largest art museum".&lt;ref name="Balboa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.balboapark.org/in-the-park/detail.php?OrgID=19 |title=The San Diego Museum of Art|publisher=Balboa Park|accessdate=February 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly half a million people visit the museum each year.&lt;ref name="Visitors"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sandiego.org/listing/Visitors/2995 |title=San Diego Museum of Art|publisher=San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau|accessdate=February 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The museum building was designed by architects [[William Templeton Johnson]] and [[Robert W. Snyder]] in a [[plateresque]] style to harmonize with existing structures from the [[Panama–California Exposition (1915)|Panama–California Exposition of 1915]].&lt;ref name="Davenport" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/bio/johnson/johnson.htm |title=William Templeton Johnson|publisher=San Diego Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dominant feature of the façade is a heavily ornamented door inspired by a doorway at the [[University of Salamanca]].&lt;ref name="Davenport" /&gt;  The [[Cathedral of Valladolid]] also influenced the museum's exterior design, and the architects derived interior motifs from the Santa Cruz Hospital of [[Toledo, Spain]].&lt;ref name="Museum" /&gt;  The original construction took two years.&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;  Sponsor [[Appleton S. Bridges]] donated the building to the [[City of San Diego]] upon its completion.&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;  In 1966 the museum added a west wing and a sculpture court which doubled its size, and an east wing in 1974 further increased its exhibition space.&lt;ref name="Davenport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;  Plans are underway for a renovation to the rotunda, sculpture garden, façade, auditorium, and other features.&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;

==Collections==
The Museum's collections are encyclopedic in nature, with pieces ranging in date from 5000 BC to 2012 AD.  The museum's strength is in Spanish works by [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], [[Zurbarán]], [[Juan Sánchez Cotán|Cotán]], [[José Ribera|Ribera]] and [[El Greco]].  Much of the museum's old master collection was donated by sisters Anne, Amy, and Irene Putnam.&lt;ref name="Davenport" /&gt;  The museum's first major acquisition was the 1939 purchase of [[Francisco Goya]]'s ''El Marques de Sofraga'', which had belonged to a private family collection until that time and had never before been on public exhibition.&lt;ref name="Davenport" /&gt;  The Putnam sisters provided financial backing for the purchase.&lt;ref name="Davenport" /&gt;  The following year, director Reginald Poland acquired a portrait by [[Giovanni Bellini]] for the museum's collection.&lt;ref name="Davenport" /&gt;  Then in 1941 the museum purchased a [[Diego Velázquez]] portrait of the Infanta Margarita of Spain, which was possibly a study for a larger portrait of her in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="Davenport" /&gt;  Other major benefactors during the museum's first quarter century were Archer M. Huntington and Mr. and Mrs. Henry Timken,&lt;ref name="Museum" /&gt; whose small art collection is housed in the nearby [[Timken Museum of Art]], established in 1965. In 2012, the Museum of Art received 48 German Expressionist paintings, drawings and prints from a range of artists, including [[Otto Dix]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Gustav Klimt]] from the collection of Vance E. Kondon and his wife Elisabeth Giesberger.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Wetherbe (March 23, 2012), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/03/san-diego-museums-gifted-40-million-art-collection.html San Diego museums receive $40-million art collection] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum houses works by Italian masters [[Giorgione]], [[Giambattista Pittoni]], [[Giotto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Luini]] and [[Canaletto]].  Works by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Frans Hals|Hals]] and [[van Dyck]] represent the [[Northern European]] School.  The museum regularly hosts touring exhibits and has lately been working to display its standard collection in new ways, including an upstairs gallery discussing information which can be gathered by looking on the back of the canvas.

==Contemporary art programming==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2018}}
In 2010, The San Diego Museum of Art in conjunction with the Agitprop gallery created The Summer Salon Series. The program, curated by Alexander Jarman and David White, featured local emerging artists who presented and performed temporary art works and workshops in direct response to the Toulouse-Lautrec exhibition. Each of the ten presentations involved Contemporary Artists' responses to the Modern Art on display in the museum.

==Special events==
Each April since 1981 the Museum hosts its major fundraiser, "Art Alive". Floral designers use flowers and other organic materials to express their interpretation of a work of art from the Museum's permanent collection. For four days the resulting creations are displayed next to the art work that inspired them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Art in full bloom |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=136EAF3987837A28&amp;p_docnum=2&amp;s_dlid=DL0111072123154205958&amp;s_ecproduct=SUB-FREE&amp;s_ecprodtype=INSTANT&amp;s_trackval=&amp;s_siteloc=&amp;s_referrer=&amp;s_subterm=Subscription%20until%3A%2012%2F14%2F2025%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docsbal=%20&amp;s_subexpires=12%2F14%2F2025%2011%3A59%20PM&amp;s_docstart=&amp;s_docsleft=&amp;s_docsread=&amp;s_username=sdubsub&amp;s_accountid=AC0110122214325408110&amp;s_upgradeable=no |newspaper=San Diego Union Tribune |date=April 28, 2011 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also hosts events such as "Art after Hours" and "Culture and Cocktails", which encourage attendees to sample the collection into the evening during extended opening hours or partake in social events centered in the gallery.

Current exhibits include "House About It" which teaches children about home building and construction, "Bugs and other insects" which features a collection of living exotic spiders and insects as well as a small collection of fossils and preserved insects, "Great Explorations", "Sea of Boats", "Ladder 11" which features a real decommissioned fire truck, "veterinary clinic" which teaches children about being a veterinarian and proper pet care, "Portia's Playhouse", "the Garden Terrace" and "Big Games".&lt;ref name="stre"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE0DD1239F93BA35753C1A967948260&amp;sec=travel&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Children's Exhibits Stress Participation|accessdate=2008-03-12|date=1981-10-08|author=Melissa Sutphen|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Grants==
The museums veterinary and pet care exhibit was created in part with support from VCA veterinary clinics.

==Building History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
The Children's Museum consists of two buildings with a connecting walkway. The main building, that houses the museum administrative offices, the live animal collection, the fire truck and the "house about it" exhibit, was originally built in 1913 as part of the Snug Harbor Complex. The portion of the museum that houses the food court area and the great explorations exhibits is the old snug harbor barn, where the livestock was originally kept to feed the residents of Sailors Snug Harbor. When the museum was developed, a modern walkway was built connecting the two structures to create one museum building.

During the 1950s, the building was designated as civil defense shelter for local residents in the event of an air raid. The sign can still be found on the back of the building.

[[File:The Family A Proclamation to the World.jpg|thumb|right|"The Family: A Proclamation to the World" heading]]
"'''The Family: A Proclamation to the World'''" is a 1995 statement issued by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) which defined the official position of the church on family, marriage, [[gender role]]s, and [[human sexuality]]. It was first announced by [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]].

==History==
President Hinckley first read the Proclamation on September 23, 1995, at the church's General [[Relief Society]] Meeting, stating that the purpose was to "warn and forewarn" the world to the danger of deviating from its standards.&lt;ref name=ensign1195/&gt; In 1997, the LDS Church included the text of the Proclamation in an amicus brief to petition the Hawaii supreme court to reject same sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Compton|first1=Laura|title=From Amici to ’Ohana: The Hawaiian Roots of the Family Proclamation|url=http://rationalfaiths.com/from-amici-to-ohana/|website=Rational Faiths|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church has published copies of the Proclamation in many languages, distributing them worldwide, and some [[Latter-day Saints]] have framed the Proclamation for display in their church buildings and homes.

The Proclamation has been discussed and referenced in the church's [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conferences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/general-conference/2001/04/first-things-first?lang=eng|title=First Things First|last1=Scott|first1=Richard G.|date=April 2001|work=[[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]]|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (lds.org)|accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/don-t-leave-for-tomorrow-what-you-can-do-today?lang=eng|title=Don’t Leave for Tomorrow What You Can Do Today|last1=Costa|first1=Claudio R.

The Proclamation has also been influential among leaders of other religious traditions. For example, in 2014 the Vatican's ''Humanum: An International Interreligious Colloquium on the Complimentarity of Man and Woman'' featured several world leaders including [[Pope Francis]] and Muslim theologian [[Kharazmi University|Dr. Rasoul Rasoulipour]] quoting from or citing its basic teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.media-mormoni.it/articolo/il-presidente-henry-b-eyring--della-prima-presidenza--incontra-papa-francesco-in-vaticano-|title=Il presidente Henry B.

== Contents ==
Although the Proclamation presents no new doctrines or policies, it provides an official statement of the church on gender and sex.&lt;ref&gt;For the text of the proclamation, please see {{cite web|title=The Family: A Proclamation to the World|url=http://lds.org/family/proclamation?lang=eng|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (lds.org)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrinal assertions===
* [[Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Marriage]] between a man and a woman is ordained of God.
* The family is ordained of God and central to God's plan.
* All human beings are [[Creation myth|created]] in the image of God.
* As a beloved spirit son or daughter of Heavenly Parents, each person has a divine nature and destiny.
* [[Gender role|Gender]] is an essential characteristic of human identity [[Pre-existence#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism)|before]], during, and [[Afterlife|after]] life on Earth.
* "In the [[Pre-existence|premortal realm]], spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan."
* "Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints make it possible for individuals to return to the [[Heaven|presence of God]] and for families to be united eternally."
* God will hold parents accountable for the way in which they fulfill responsibilities to their families.
* "Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity."

===Items of counsel===
* God's commandment to [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]] to multiply and replenish the earth remains in force.
* Sexual relations are sacred and properly take place only between a man and a woman, lawfully wedded as husband and wife. 
* Procreation is divinely appointed, and therefore life is sacred and an important part of God's plan.
* Parents have "a solemn responsibility to love and care for each other and for their children."
* Parents' responsibilities toward their children include rearing them "in love and righteousness," providing "for their physical and spiritual needs," and teaching "them to love and serve one another, observe the commandments of God, and be law-abiding citizens."
* Happiness and success come through following the teachings of Jesus and through "[[faith]], [[prayer]], [[repentance]], forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome [[recreation]]al activities."
* "By divine design fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families."
* "Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children."
* "Fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners."
* Citizens and officers of government should "promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society."

===Warnings===
* Those who commit [[adultery]] or "abuse spouse or offspring, or who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand accountable before God."
* Disintegration of the family will bring "calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets."

==Criticism==

The [[LGBT]] advocacy group [[Human Rights Campaign]] has cited the Proclamation as an indication that although telling families not to reject children due to their sexual orientation and telling members to treat them with love and compassion, the church restricts those who believe themselves to be gay, lesbian, [[bisexual]], and transgender from fully integrating into the LDS Church if they act on their same-sex attraction. Those who do act on their feelings may be disciplined in various ways including excommunication. Because discipline is administered locally actual practice differs geographically.&lt;ref name = HRC&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeppson|first=Buckley|title=Stances of Faiths on LGBT Issues: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)|url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/stances-of-faiths-on-lgbt-issues-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saint|work=HRC website|publisher=[[Human Rights Campaign]]|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The church also issued this statement after the Human Rights Campaign's criticism: {{cquote|The Church recognizes that those of its members who are attracted to others of the same sex experience deep emotional, social and physical feelings. The Church distinguishes between feelings or inclinations on the one hand and behavior on the other. It’s not a sin to have feelings, only in yielding to temptation.

There is no question that this is difficult, but Church leaders and members are available to help lift, support and encourage fellow members who wish to follow Church doctrine. Their struggle is our struggle. Those in the Church who are attracted to someone of the same sex but stay faithful to the Church’s teachings can be happy during this life and perform meaningful service in the Church. They can enjoy full fellowship with other Church members, including attending and serving in temples, and ultimately receive all the blessings afforded to those who live the commandments of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Otterson |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Otterson |date= 12 October 2010 |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-mormon-responds-to-human-rights-campaign-petition-same-sex-attraction |contribution= Church Responds to HRC Petition: Statement on Same-Sex Attraction |title= News Release |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Status==
The LDS Church has characterized the Proclamation as a reaffirmation of standards "repeatedly stated throughout its history."&lt;ref name=ensign1195&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hinckley|first=Gordon B.|title=Stand Strong against the Wiles of the World|journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]| date=November 1995 |url=http://lds.org/ensign/1995/11/stand-strong-against-the-wiles-of-the-world?lang=eng|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apostle Boyd K. Packer also stated in General Conference that it "qualifies according to the definition as a revelation and it would do well that members of the
Church read and follow it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Packer|first1=Boyd|title=President Boyd K. Packer - Cleansing the Inner Vessel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C1wUI5xuhs&amp;t=1m|website=youtube.com|publisher=Mormon Channel - LDS Church|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geisner|first1=Joseph|title=Very Careless in His Utterances: Editing, Correcting, and Censoring Conference Addresses|journal=Sunstone Magazine|date=December 2011|issue=165|page=23|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/magazine/premium-issues/|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly important because, although not [[canonized]], the Proclamation is only the fifth such statement in the history of the church.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', 1151, 1153, 1155, 1156, and archives for the 1980 General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
*Proclamation 1: issued on January 15, 1841 by the First Presidency consisting of Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and Hyrum Smith. This proclamation “reviews the progress of the Church in spite of hardships and persecution, and speaks at length on the prospects of the settlement of Nauvoo.”
*Proclamation 2: issued April 6 in New York and on October 22, 1845 by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (who were currently serving as the governing of the Church because a First Presidency had not yet been re-organized) and was “addressed to the rulers and people of all nations” and “was an announcement that God had spoken from the heavens and restored the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth.”
*Proclamation 3: issued October 21, 1865, by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for the purpose of “correct[ing] certain theories about the nature of God that had been published by one of the Twelve in official Church literature, without having those statements cleared and verified by the First Presidency and the Twelve.”
*Proclamation 4: issued on April 6, 1980 by the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the organization of the church. This proclamation was concerning the progress, doctrine, mission, and message of the Church, and also mentioned in some detail about the family.
*Proclamation 5: “The Family: Proclamation to the World.”&lt;/ref&gt; The Proclamation was especially authoritative because it was issued in the name of the three members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and the members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], each of the fifteen signatories being considered by members of the LDS Church as "[[prophet, seer, and revelator]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Curtis Dollahite|title=Strengthening our families: an in-depth look at the proclamation on the family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpQEAAAACAAJ|accessdate=April 12, 2011|date=June 2000|publisher=Bookcraft|isbn=978-1-57345-824-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig H.

'''''The Music Trades''''' is a {{age|1891|01|01}}-year-old [[United States|American]] [[trade magazine]] that covers a broad spectrum of music and music commerce, domestically and abroad.  The magazine was founded in New York City in 1890 and, since the mid-1970s, has been based in [[Englewood, New Jersey]]. ''The Music Trades'' is one of the longest-running, without interruption, trade publications in the world.&lt;ref name="Railway Age" group=upper-roman/&gt; The {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} issue — Vol. {{age|1852|02|01}}&lt;!--1852 is not the founding year, but it returns the correct vol. no.--&gt;, No. {{MONTHNUMBER|{{LASTMONTH}}}} — is approximately the {{Ordinal to word|{{#expr:{{Age in weeks|month1=01|day1=03|year1=1891|month2=02|day2=16|year2=1929}}&lt;!--add a week, i.e., Feb 16, to get result--&gt;+{{age in months|1929|01|09}}}}}} issue.&lt;ref name="No. of issues calculation" group=lower-alpha/&gt; A controlling ownership over the last {{age|1929|07|19}} years — {{Cardinal to word|{{#expr:{{#expr:trunc{{age|format=raw|1929|07|19}}/trunc{{age|format=raw|1891|01|03}}}}*100 round 0}}}} percent of the publication's total age — has been held by three generations of the Majeski family, making it among the few current publications of any ilk that has been closely held by a single family for as long a period.&lt;ref name="MT 2010 Nov"/&gt;

== History ==
''The Music Trades'' was founded in 1890 by [[John Christian Freund]] (1848–1924) and Milton Weil (1871–1935).  Freund and Weil also, in 1898, founded ''[[Musical America]],'' the oldest American magazine on classical music.&lt;ref name="Dolge 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTs 1924 Jun 4"/&gt;

===John Christian Freund===
Freund, who matriculated in 1868 at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] but left after three years without a degree, had first been a playwright and actor.&lt;ref name="Hamersley" /&gt;  Freund emigrated to New York in 1871.&lt;ref name="Freund arrival 1910 Census" /&gt;  In 1875, he founded ''The Music Trade Review,''&lt;ref name="The other MTR" group=lower-alpha/&gt; a [[fortnight]]ly publication that he later renamed ''The Musical and Dramatic Times and Music Trade Review.''  The publication ran for about 2 years.  In 1878, Freund founded the ''Musical Times'', which soon changed to ''Musical and Dramatic Times.''  On January 7, 1882, Freund launched a weekly magazine, ''Music: A Review'' (Vol., No. 1),&lt;ref name="Music: A Review Vo1 1 No 1" group=lower-roman/&gt; which contained an insert called ''The Music Trade''. Sometime on or before July 8, 1882, Freund changed the name to ''Music and Drama'', supplemented by ''Freund's Daily Music and Drama.''  ''Music and Drama'' evolved into the weekly publication, ''The Music Trades.''&lt;ref name="Hamersley" /&gt;

In 1884, Freund, with John Travis Quigg (1839–1893), founded ''The American Musician'', which ran until 1891 and became the official publication of the National League of Musicians, the forerunner of the [[American Federation of Musicians]].&lt;ref name="DuPree"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanaford 1914"/&gt;  Before founding the ''American Musician'', [http://www2.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Henry_C._Watson Henry Cood Watson] (1818–1875) began in 1864 the publication ''Watson's Art Journal,'' devoted to music criticism and trade.  Watson died in 1875 and his ''Journal'' was taken over by his pupil, William M. Thoms, who improved it, renamed it ''American Art Journal'', edited it until his retirement in 1906, then, upon his retirement, merged it with the ''American Musician.''&lt;ref name="Mott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathews"/&gt;

Around 1895, Freund's younger brother, Harry Edward Freund (1863–1950), was editor of ''Musical Weekly,''&lt;ref name="Mathews Music 1895"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spillane 1890"/&gt; which continued as a weekly with a new name, beginning January 1896, as ''The Musical Age.''  The publication was aimed at piano dealers.

===1927 sale by Milton Weil===
Milton Weil (1871–1935) was married to the actress Henrietta Lander ''(née'' Rich; 1874–1935).&lt;ref name="MTR 1899 Apr 29"/&gt; On June 13, 1927, three years after Freund died, Weil sold ''The Music Trades'' and ''[[Musical America]]'' to a newly formed syndicate that acquired four other publications and consolidated them into Trade Publications, Inc., headed by [[Walter Howey|Walter Crawford Howey]] (1882–1954) as president, Verne Hardin Porter (1888–1942) as vice president and secretary, and Edwin John Rosencrans (1870–1935), as treasurer.  The other publications were ''[[Architectural Record|The American Architect]],'' ''The Barbers' Journal,'' ''Beauty Culture,'' and ''Perfumers' Journal.''&lt;ref name="Philly Enquirer 1927 Jun 27"/&gt;

Schluter &amp; Company and Shields &amp; Company were the investment bankers who handled the deal, which involved an issuance of $1,100,000 in [[preferred stock|preferred]] and [[common stock]].&lt;ref name="NY Evening Post 1927 Jul 8"/&gt; [[Walter Howey|Howey]], Porter, and Rosencrans were also directors of Trade Publications, Inc.  The other directors were [[G. Murray Hulbert]], John Zollikoffer Lowe, Jr. (1884–1951), and [[Joseph Urban]].  Shields &amp; Company and Nixon &amp; Company, of Philadelphia, also made s public offering of ten-year {{frac|6|1|2}} percent gold bonds of Trade Publications, Inc., that carried [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]] to purchase [[common stock]] at a price that closely corresponded with the value of the stock.&lt;ref name="Philly Enquirer 1927 Jun 27"/&gt;

[[Walter Howey|Howey]] and Porter had been former executives of the [[Hearst Corporation]].&lt;ref name="NY Evening Post 1927 Jul 8"/&gt;  Rosencrans was the managing editor of ''The American Architect.''  Years before the deal, Rosencrans, a civil engineer, had been partners with architect John F. Jackson (1867–1948).  Their firm, Jackson &amp; Rosencrans, designed over seventy [[YMCA]]s.&lt;ref name="Architects Bios"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mish Alumnus 1934"/&gt;  Lowe was a lawyer and onetime law partner in a firm with [[Samuel Seabury (judge)|Samuel Seabury]].

===1929 bankruptcy===
[[File:Henrietta Lander.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Henrietta Lander, 1888]]
Walter Howey — who, before heading Trade Publications, had been the founding managing editor of the ''[[New York Daily Mirror]]'' — left Trade Publications to again become the managing editor of the ''[[New York Daily Mirror|Mirror]]'' on August 1, 1928.&lt;ref name="NY Evening Post"/&gt;  Trade Publications, Inc., filed for bankruptcy in 1929. [[Irving Trust|The Irving Trust Co.]] was appointed receiver for Trade Publications, Inc., which had liabilities of $716,839 and assets of $59,511. John Logan Lyttle (1879–1930), bankruptcy referee, sold at auction to John Majeski, Weil's former assistant, on July 19, 1929, four of the six magazines for $45,200: (i) ''Musical America'', (ii) ''[[The Music Trades]]'', (iii) ''The Barbers' Journal'', and (iv) ''Beauty Culture.''&lt;ref name="NYTs 1929 Jul 20"/&gt; Of the $45,000 Majeski paid for the six publications, $11,000 of it was attributable to ''Musical America'' and ''The Music Trades,'' for which, three years earlier, around 1926–1927, he had offered a quarter of a million dollars, in a losing bid against Trade Publications, Inc.  Majeski's acquisition included the publications' names, a collection of back issues, and a few months of office space in the [[Steinway Hall|Steinway Building]].&lt;ref name="High Fidelity"/&gt;

A few months before the bankruptcy auction on July 19, 1929, Weil was said to have sold all his interest in Trade Publications, Inc., for $200,000 in [[preferred stock]]. After he sold, he and his wife moved to Paris, where they were residing during the bankruptcy auction. The bankruptcy sale wiped-out Weil's stake built-up over a lifetime.  Weil, at the time of the bankruptcy sale, was said to have only taken $5,000 with him to Paris.  Weil's father, Jacob A. Weil (1835–1913), was a Paris-born American and his mother, Dina ''(née'' Lilienthal; born 1843), was a German-born American.

===Double suicide of Milton and Henrietta Weil===
[[File:Paris 9e Hotel Scribe 332.JPG|thumb|right|275px|Hotel Scribe, Paris, 2011]]
Distraught over the loss of their fortune during the pre-[[Crash of 1929]], then the [[Crash of 1929|Crash]], and their subsequent inability to recover during the [[Great Depression]] – Milton and Henrietta Weil carried out a double suicide pact on May 22, 1935, leaving a note and taking [[veronal]] in their room of the Hotel Scribe in the Opera District of Paris.&lt;ref name="Chester Times 1935 May 22"/&gt;  Henrietta died the next morning, May 23, 7:40 {{smallcaps|am}} at the [[American Hospital of Paris|American Hospital]];&lt;ref name="Syracuse Journal 1935 May 23"/&gt; Milton died 23 hours and 25 minutes later, May 24, 7:05 {{smallcaps|am}}, at the same hospital.&lt;ref name="Cumberland News 1935 May 24"/&gt;  They are buried next to each other at the [[Neuilly-sur-Seine community cemetery|New Cemetery]] of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].&lt;ref name="Americans Abroad Death Reports"/&gt;

==Legacy of Freund and Weil==
: Freund and Weil were exponents of American classical music, despite the fact that Freund had only become a [[United States nationality law|naturalized United States citizen]] on November 2, 1903.  Their publications ''[[Musical America]]'' and ''The Music Trades'' complemented each other, and, in a unique sense, gave them a comprehensive and credible view of the growth of classical music in America and its international rank, as an art-form and in commerce.  To the extent that both publications reached an international [[Audience measurement|readership]], Freund and Weil held sway as [[impresarios]] and movement leaders of American classical music.  Their publications flourished during the early 1900s — on a new wave of American composers, including those of the [[Second New England School]] — joined by foreign composers that emigrated to [[United States|America]] after 1880 in a flood of nearly [[History of immigration to the United States#Immigration 1850 to 1930|25 million Europeans]].  In commerce, 1875 to 1932 represented a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of piano making — nearly 364,545 were sold at the peak in 1909, according to the National Piano Manufacturers Association.&lt;ref name="History of Piano Sales"/&gt; New York City, followed by Chicago, was the manufacturing leader of pianos during that age.

Freund and Weil's publications gave them broad access in the field of music.  Notably, they served as bridges between the art and the money, connecting artists, organizations, commerce, and public policy.  The spectrum that both publications collectively chronicled gave Freund and Weil a strong platform to serve as advocates, opinion leaders, conciliators, counselors, [[arbitration|arbiters]], and ambassadors for music and the music trades in America. As an example, Freund and Weil were influential in the founding of the National Music Managers Association (for national managers) and the National Concert Managers' Association (for local managers), aimed at improving cooperation between the two for the benefit of musicians.&lt;ref name="Doering"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Other Milton Weils" group=lower-alpha/&gt;  Also, Freund and Weil were, in 1918, the founding president and secretary-treasurer, respectively, of the Musical Alliance of the United States,&lt;ref name="Musical Alliance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Freund's Musical Alliance 1918"/&gt; an organization that endures today.  At its founding, Freund had called for an alliance to organize "all workers in the field, from the man at the bench in a piano factory to the conductor of the great symphony."&lt;ref name="On Being 2014 Jan 31"/&gt;

==The Majeski years — 1910–present==
[[File:John F Majeski Sr Music Trades 1926.jpg|thumb|right|180px|John F. Majeski, Sr., 1926 (photo courtesy of The Music Trades Corporation)]]
On July 19, 1929, John Francis Majeski, Sr. (1892–1971) — who in 1910 had joined the staff of ''[[Musical America]],'' which at the time owned ''The Musical Trades'' — became the new owner of (i) ''The Music Trades'', (ii) ''[[Musical America]]'', (ii) ''Barbers Journal'', and (iv) ''Beauty Culture.''&lt;ref name="Presto 1928 Aug 1"/&gt;  On August 22, 1929, Majeski formed three holding companies: The Music Trades Corporation, The Musical America Corporation, and Beauty Culture Publishing Corporation — the third as holding company for ''Barbers Journal'' and ''Beauty Culture.''

In 1959, Majeski sold ''[[Musical America]]'' — which later merged with ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]'' in 1964 — but retained his interest in ''The Musical Trades,'' and served as its publisher until his death.  At the time of his death, his son, John Francis Majeski, Jr. (1921–2011), was the magazine's editor.&lt;ref name="NYTs 1971 Nov 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio Index 1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Who Was Who in Am 1973"/&gt;  John Majeski, Jr., was the magazine's editor until 1982 and its publisher until 1985.&lt;ref name="High Fidelity"/&gt;  In 2005, John Majeski, Jr., received the American Music Conference Lifetime Achievement Award for his achievements, contribution to music, and long tenure as editor of ''The Music Trades.''&lt;ref name="NAMM Oral History 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMT 2012 Feb"/&gt;

==Current ownership==
''The Music Trades'' has been controlled by the Majeski family for {{cardinal to word|{{age|format=raw|1929|07|19}}}} years (since July 19, 1929).  Its holding company is The Music Trades Corporation, a New Jersey entity based in [[Englewood, New Jersey|Englewood]], which is controlled by the third-generation Majeski family — Paul Anton Majeski (born 1960), publisher since 1985, and Brian T. Majeski (born 1956), editor since 1982.  Paul holds a bachelor's degree in accounting from [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] (1982) and Brian holds a bachelor's degree in philosophy from [[Lawrence University]] (1978).

* Vol. 21, No. 21, May 25, 1901: Responding to a 1901 campaign by the National Musicians Union against [[ragtime]], [the campaign is] "rather quixotic.  There are ears to which "rag-time" is more fascinating than grand opera, and ears of this sort are more numerous"
* "Too Many Piano Factories in Chicago," by Philip J. Meahl (1865–1933), Vol. 23, No. 1, January 4, 1902, pg. 13: "There is some likelihood of the piano manufacturing business being overdone"

'''Historic reviews'''
: Harry Botsford (born 1890) wrote an article titled [https://books.google.com/books?id=iQ1TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA212 "Diversified Needs of the Trade Magazine,"] in ''The Editor'' ([[Ridgewood, New Jersey]]), Vol. 52, No. 7, April 10, 1920, pps. 4–5.  In it, he lauds ''The Music Trades'' as "one of the foremost publications which may be classed as a trade journal," and proceeds to examine a particular issue — Vol. 58, No. 25, December 20, 1919.  Botsford points out that the articles in the issue are diverse, but at first glance, seemingly not relevant for a lack of direct connections to the music field.  Yet he sees how topics of other sectors and industries — and commerce as a whole — relate to music commerce.  Botsford stated that the articles, all of them, were interesting and well-written; but averred that each writing assignment might have been better-filled by "a live writer in the field, if said writer would have used his brain."  Botsford, a trade writer himself, seemed to be challenging his profession to exercise more [[interdisciplinarity]] writing.  Referring to Secor's article, Botsford posed the question, "Why couldn't some of we fellows who write for farm papers have thought of the idea? Have we been overlooking possibilities?"

The December 20, 1919, issue, as a whole, bears some similarities to some of the special macro-economic issues of the 21st-century.  Botsford's review covered the following articles by authors, nearly all of whom were trade publication editors:

'''''The Vermont Ghost Guide''''' is a comprehensive paranormal travel guide published in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42812921|title=The Vermont ghost guide|last=A.|first=Citro, Joseph|date=2000|publisher=University Press of New England|isbn=1584650095|location=Hanover, NH|oclc=42812921}}&lt;/ref&gt; that documents all of the major [[haunting]]s and ghost-sightings in [[Vermont]], inspired by the numerous Vermont wildlife and destination guides. The book was researched and written by Vermont [[folklore]] expert [[Joseph A. Citro|Joe Citro]] and illustrated by [[Horror fiction|horror]] artist and fellow Vermonter [[Stephen R. Bissette|Steve Bissette]]. The book is divided into sections, each devoted to a single region of Vermont and its supposed [[undead]] residents. Like his other non-fiction books, Citro does not speculate on whether or not the paranormal occurrences he describes are in fact true, but instead leaves that job entirely to the reader. However, as a joke, Citro did insert one account that was a complete fabrication, although he has never revealed which one that may be.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

{{Politics of Somalia}}
The '''Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic''' ('''TFC''') was the principle organizing document of [[Somalia]]. Written and approved in February 2004, it represented one of the [[Transitional Federal Institutions]] (TFIs). The other TFIs included the [[Transitional Federal Parliament]] (TFP), which was the [[Legislature|legislative]] branch, and the [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG), the TFI's [[Executive (government)|executive]] wing.

The TFC was distinct from the national [[constitution]], which was distinguished as a separate document (Chapter 4, Article 11, Section 3(a)).

On 1 August 2012, an 825-member national constituent assembly approved a new provisional constitution by a landslide of 96% for the [[Federal Republic of Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/08/201281101033529886.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chapter 1==
The Charter's first Chapter establishes the Transitional Federal Government as the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] government of Somalia (Article 1), and gives the government supremacy of law over the nation (Article 3).

It defines Somalia in Article 3 as having the following borders:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a)   North; [[Gulf of Aden]].&lt;br/&gt;
(b)   North West; [[Djibouti]].&lt;br/&gt;
(c)   West; [[Ethiopia]].&lt;br/&gt;
(d)   South south-west; [[Kenya]].&lt;br/&gt; 
(e)   East; [[Indian Ocean]].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 4 also stipulates that all disputes regarding inconsistencies between national laws and the Charter should be brought before the Supreme Court for adjudication.&lt;ref name="Charter"&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,LEGISLATION,SOM,456d621e2,4795c2d22,0.html The Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chapter 2==
* Declares [[Mogadishu]] as the capital, and grants Parliament rights to pass laws over its governance (Article 5).
* Defines the [[File:Flag of Somalia.svg|20px]] [[Flag of Somalia|flag]] and [[File:Coat of arms of Somalia.svg|20px]] [[Coat of arms of Somalia|emblem]] of Somalia (Article 6), which serve, along with the National Anthem and the Public Seal, as national symbols (Article 9).
* Defines [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as the official national languages, and [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] as secondary languages (Article 7).
* Defines [[Islam]] as the national religion and [[sharia]] as the basis of national legislation (Article 8).

==Chapter 3==
This chapter grants citizenship to all persons who were citizens of the Somali Republic at the time the Charter came into effect, and extends citizenship to all those who were born in the Somali Republic, or whose father is a citizen of the Somali Republic, so long as that did not conflict with other citizenships (Article 10).

==Chapter 4==
This Chapter defines the government as a [[federation]] and describes the nature of the [[federal government]]. It defines the scope and structure of the republic as a hierarchy (Article 11):

* [[Transitional Federal Government]] at the national level
* State Governments where "two or more regions federate, based on their free will."
* [[Regions of Somalia|Regional Administrations]]
* [[Districts of Somalia|District administrations]]

'''Two Boys Blowing Bubbles''' is a painting by the Flemish artist [[Michaelina Wautier]]. It was painted in the 1640s. Besides the two boys, the painting depicts a candle and a sandtimer, both symbols of the passing of time.  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mas.be/sites/mas/files/MAS_Michaelina_gids_EN.pdf|title=Michaelina, Baroque’s Leading Lady|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=20/21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was previously attributed to [[Jacob van Oost]]. However, research done in 2007 led to the re-attribution to Wautier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://samblog.seattleartmuseum.org/2018/08/boys-blowing-bubbles/|title=Object of the Week: Boys Blowing Bubbles {{!}} SAM Blog|website=samblog.seattleartmuseum.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting hangs in the [[Seattle Art Museum]] who purchased it in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://art.seattleartmuseum.org/objects/13629/boys-blowing-bubbles?ctx=e40c99e0-3812-46bc-a319-5044f57701f1&amp;idx=0|title=Boys Blowing Bubbles – Works – eMuseum|website=art.seattleartmuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second version by Wautier is in a private collection in Spain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''United Art Rating''' is a reference book published since 1999 by [[Artists Trade Union of Russia]] as one of the instruments of art market regulations.&lt;ref&gt;"Чтобы как-то стабилизировать ценообразование на арт-рынке, Профессиональный союз художников с 1999 года издает "Единый художественный рейтинг". В него входят имена, даты жизни и рейтинговые категории почти 40 тыс. художников Российской империи, СССР, русского зарубежья, Российской Федерации и республик бывшего Советского Союза. Живые и ушедшие — вперемешку. "Делить художников по принципу "жив или мертв" неправильно: с точки зрения ценообразования смерть мастера не самый значительный фактор",— рассказывает Сергей Заграевский. Тем не менее высшую часть пирамиды рейтинга формируют великие мастера прошлого. Основание пирамиды — растущие молодые художники или инертная масса работников изобразительного цеха, которые не участвуют в бурной выставочной жизни. Эксперты, занимающиеся составлением рейтинга, отслеживают динамику роста или деградации тех и других. Живопись — это не теннис, и здесь, конечно, трудно быть уверенным, кто кого обыграет… И все же справочник во многом — зеркало ценообразования: середнячки редко бывают богаты". ([http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1028246 Ксения Гулиа. Картинная лотерея. Журнал «Деньги», № 37(692) от 22.09.2008])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Проект «Арт—рейтинг» может помочь «войти» и в современное искусство, и в сложный процесс арт—рынка. В Арт—рейтинге — в Едином художественном рейтинге Профессионального союза художников — сделана некая попытка классификации: расположить художников по уровню реализации их дарования с учетом, конечно, участия в престижных выставках, внимания к ним средств массовой информации, искусствоведов, музейных работников, членства в союзах, творческих объединениях и прочее... Подобная попытка поставить художников в ряд «по росту» может показаться безнадежной. Но она удалась. Поставленная задача решена, правда, без особых претензий на полную строгость и объективность, что и хорошо".([http://www.artcitiez.com/index.php?id=813 Журнал «Арт Город», № 1 (24), 2010])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Оценивая современную живопись, из-за отсутствия аукционов галеристы и покупатели руководствуются художественным рейтингом. Рейтинг в данном случае понимается как попытка со стороны экспертов стратифицировать творчество художников. Наиболее полным на сегодняшний день рейтингом как украинских, так и российских художников является «Единый художественный рейтинг»". ([http://www.dengi-info.com/archive/article.php?aid=1262 Дмитрий Банников. Рынок современной живописи: с надеждой на лучшее!

== About ==
United Art Rating (before 2012, referred to as United Artists Rating) is a rating published as a periodical reference book, registered as [[mass media]]. As of 2016, it has stood 22 printed editions, total number of printed copies is more than 90000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artunion.ru/rating/archive_engl.htm Archive of United Art Rating editions]&lt;/ref&gt; The electronic version is also available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rating.artunion.ru/electronic_engl.htm United Art Rating. The electronic version]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2016, United Art Rating included the names, dates of life and rating categories of 58965 artists (painters, graphic and poster artists, theatre decorators, batik painters, illustrators, animators, sculptors, jewelers, ceramists, authors of installations etc.).

Editor-in-chief: [[Sergey Zagraevsky]], chairman of Artists Trade Union of Russia, member of [[Russian Academy of Arts]] and Russian Academy of Art-critics, Honored culture worker of Russian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zagraevsky.com Dr. Sergey Zagraevsky. Official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, United Art Rating was awarded the gratitude of the Minister of culture of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rating.artunion.ru/feedback.htm United Art Rating. Feedback (in Russian).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles of rating ==
The Rating Centre acts under Artists Trade Union of Russia and has a status of an independent professional jury, free in its judges and estimations. Defining rating categories is made on the basis of all available information about works of art, biographies, expositions, collections and sales of works, catalogues and Internet and press publications, art historians' and art-managers' opinions, public opinion polls etc.

United Art Rating consists of 2 sections:
*Russian Art Rating (Rating of artists of Russian Empire, the USSR, Russian emigration, Russian Federation and the republics of the former Soviet Union);
*International Artists Rating (All-world Rating of artists of 18th–21st centuries, forming the world art heritage).

Artists are subdivided into categories "A" and "B": an artist of "A" category does not virtually submit to the market's demand. an artist of "B" category is mainly oriented to the market demand.

Each category has its levels from the first (the top of recognition and fame; is referred to the deceased classic artists, whose works of art are widely recognized in museums) to the seventh one (amateur artist).

According to the declared principles, defining of rating categories is made on available information about expositions, sales and collections of works, catalogues, publications, biographies, public-opinion polls etc. Rating criteria are: art level of works, their humanistic significance, professionalism, exhibitions, works in museums, recognition by the public, galleries and art critics, social and civil significance of works, price level of works etc.

United Art Rating contains pricing recommendations about sale and purchase of works of art.

United Art Rating is constantly changed, refined and supplemented.

== Description of rating categories ==
*1 – an artist of world fame, tested with time (for no less than a century).
*1A – a world-famous artist.
*1B – a high-class professional artist with remarkable organizational skills, who is popular and in demand.
*2A – a high-class professional artist with a bright creative individuality.
*2B – a high-class professional artist, recognized and in demand with the art-market and public.
*3A – a professional artist with a recognizable individual style.
*3B – a professional artist, recognized and asked for in the art market and by the public.
*4A – an established professional artist with creative potential.
*4B – an established professional artist, who is in demand in the art market.
*5A – a formed professional artist with creative potential.
*5B – a formed professional artist.
*6A – a forming professional artist with creative potential.
*6B – a forming professional artist.
*7 – an amateur artist with perspective evaluation of specialists.
*8 – an amateur artist.
*9 – an artist-beginner.
*10 – an artist-apprentice.

'''YOLO''' is the [[acronym]] of "'''you only live once'''".  Along the same lines as the Latin "''[[carpe diem]]''" ("seize the day"), it is a call to live life to its fullest extent, even embracing behavior which carries inherent risk. 
{{toc left}}{{-}}
== Background ==
{{wikiquote|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe}}
Similar phrases have been in use for more than a century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/05/24/live-once/|title=You Only Live Once – YOLO|publisher=Quote Investigator|date=May 24, 2012|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including these:
* the English translation of "[[wikiquote:Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|one lives but once in the world]]" by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] from his 1774 German play ''[[Clavigo (play)|Clavigo]]'';
* the title of an 1855 [[waltz]], "[[Man lebt nur einmal!]]" ("You Only Live Once!") by {{nowrap|[[Johann Strauss II]]}};
* and the Latin phrases, "''[[memento mori]]''" ("remember &amp;#91;that you have&amp;#93; to die") and "''[[carpe diem]]''" ("seize the day").

==Emergence of acronym==
In the early 21st century, the acronym "YOLO" became a staple of music and [[youth culture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/shows/skins/episode_music.jhtml?episodeID=174429 |title=Skins &amp;#124; Ep. 107 &amp;#124; Songs from the Show |publisher=MTV |date=August 14, 2014 |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; being a subject of graffiti,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swanson |first=Mirjam |url=http://www.pe.com/sports/high-school/hsg-schools/hsg-headlines/20120518-track-and-field-mitchells-making-most-of-it.ece |title=Track and Field: Mitchells making most of it|publisher=Press-Enterprise|date=May 18, 2012 |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="callsitayear"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.madison-press.com/news/local-news/class-2012-calls-year/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608092909/http://www.madison-press.com/news/local-news/class-2012-calls-year/ | archivedate=June 8, 2012 | title=Class of 2012 calls it a year | publisher=The Madison Press | accessdate=March 3, 2013 | last=Dye|first=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Express-Times File Photo|url=http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/hunterdon-county/express-times/index.ssf/2012/05/clinton_police_two_men_spray-p.html |title=Clinton Police: Two Men Spray-Paint Profanity, 'YOLO' on Town Structures |publisher=Lehigh Valley|date= |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2012/05/31/grove-city-middle-school-aged-boys-charged-vandalism.html |title=Middle School Boys Accused of Spray-Painting Homes, Destroying Water Fountain|publisher=10tv.com |date=May 31, 2012 |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]] [[hashtag]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/06/01/parent-teachers-swore-at-hoffman-estates-students-over-senior-prank/ |title=Parents, Students: Hoffman Estates School Overreacted To Senior Prank|publisher=CBS Chicago|date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; pranks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Sharon|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/hoffman-estates-conant-high-school-senior-prank-156416395.html |title=Student Arrested Following Conant High School Senior Prank |publisher=NBC Chicago |date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20120601/news/706019819/ |title=Students Lose Prom, Graduation Privileges After Senior Prank |publisher=DailyHerald.com |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tattoo]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zac Efron Tat-Tat-Tatted Up!|url=http://perezhilton.com/2011-12-16-zac-efron-yolo-tattoo#.T2pL2tkyGSo}}&lt;/ref&gt; music, television shows, and merchandise.&lt;ref name="xxlmag.com"/&gt;

The acronym was most popularized in the 21st century by [[Rapping|rapper]] [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], who planned to release a 2011 joint [[mixtape]] titled ''YOLO'' along with [[Rick Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fuse.tv/2012/06/drake-won-t-name-rick-ross-mixtape-yolo-calls-phrase-epidemic |title=Drake Won't Name Rick Ross Mixtape "YOLO," Calls Phrase "Epidemic" |publisher=Fuse |date=June 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote this mixtape, "YOLO" was mentioned prominently on several of their tracks such as "[[The Motto]]", released on November 29, 2011, with the aim of promoting the tape.

[[Hip-hop]] magazine ''Da South'' reported that the rapper [[Lecrae]] has [[Deconstruction|deconstructed]] the phrase "YOLO" in his 2012 song "[[Church Clothes|No Regrets]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dasouth.com/reviews/9266-lecrae-church-clothes| deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524093801/http://www.dasouth.com/reviews/9266-lecrae-church-clothes | archivedate=May 24, 2013 | title=Lecrae - Church Clothes: DaSouth.com|last=Hill|first=Kellus|date=May 14, 2012|publisher=Da South|accessdate=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opening monologue of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on January 19, 2014, Drake apologized about pop culture's adoption of the phrase, saying he had no idea it would become so big.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|deadurl=yes |last=Hosted by Drake |first=SNL |url=http://www.gossipcop.com/drake-snl-monologue-jewish-black-bar-mitzvah-video-2014-sasheer-zamata-debut-saturday-night-live-watch/ |title=Drake's SNL Intro |publisher=Gossip Cop |accessdate=January 28, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202175546/http://www.gossipcop.com/drake-snl-monologue-jewish-black-bar-mitzvah-video-2014-sasheer-zamata-debut-saturday-night-live-watch/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:五百羅漢堂華林寺.Jpeg|thumb|250px|Chinese luohan hall]]

A set of life-size glazed pottery sculptures of [[arhat|luohans]] usually assigned to the period of the [[Liao dynasty]] (907–1125) was discovered in caves at I Chou (I-chou, Yizhou) in Yi xian or [[Yi County, Hebei]] ({{zh|s=易县|t=易縣|p=Yì Xiàn}}), south of [[Beijing]], before World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman, 200; Rawson, 159; Art history sources mostly use "Yixian", though "Yi xian" appears more correct.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been described as "one of the most important groups of ceramic sculpture in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Gillman Lecture, 3.20&lt;/ref&gt; They reached the international art market, and were bought for Western collections. At least eight statues were originally found, including one large fragment which was long thought to have been destroyed in [[Berlin]] during World War II, but has been sighted in Russia recently.

Others are now in the following collections: the [[British Museum]] in London, two in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in Toronto, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Penn Museum]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Nelson Gallery of Art]], [[Kansas City]], the [[Musée Guimet]] in Paris, and a Japanese collection.  With the example lost in Berlin, this makes a total of ten figures.&lt;!-- Some discrepancies in the sources here --&gt;  There are fragments probably from the same set in other collections.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman, p. 483, note 11 for p. 200; updated to include the Paris example ([http://www.guimet.fr/fr/collections/chine/143-statue-du-luohan-tamrabhadra Musée Guimet page]&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances of the find, and the subsequent events as the figures reached the art market, have been the subject of much scholarly investigation, without being entirely clarified.

A luohan (often written luóhàn) is the Chinese term for an [[arhat (Buddhism)|arhat]], one of the historical disciples of the [[Buddha]]. As Buddhist tradition developed, and especially in the East Asian Buddhist countries, the number of arhats or luohans tended to increase, and at least the most important were regarded as, or as almost, [[bodhisattva]]s or fully enlightened beings, with a wide range of supernatural powers.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, 102&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Buddhist tradition, groups of 16, 18 or 500 luohans awaited the arrival of [[Maitreya]], the Future Buddha,&lt;ref name=toah&gt;{{cite web|title=Arhat (luohan), Liao dynasty (907–1125), ca. 1000|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/21.76|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and groups were often used in East Asian [[Buddhist art]]. The full set is thought by most scholars to have had figures for the typical Chinese main grouping of [[Sixteen Arhats|Sixteen]] or [[Eighteen Arhats]], although [[William Watson (sinologist)|William Watson]] describes this "usual assumption" as "speculative". These and earlier smaller groupings of six or eight were each given names and personalities in Buddhist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, 102–116; Wisdom, 112–114; Steinhardt, 7–8; Gillman, 126; Watson, 123, quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

This set is exceptional in its quality and the individuality of each figure; it has been suggested that they were also portraits of notable contemporary monks. For Watson they are "outstanding examples of the naturalistic pseudo-portrait of the period, displaying to great perfection an idealization of the face", where "only the elongation of the ear-lobes follows [traditional Buddhist] [[iconography]]".&lt;ref name="Watson, 123"&gt;Watson, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  The green hair of some of the figures is also a departure from naturalism. The findspot in 1912 seems not to have been the original location of the group, which is unknown, and the set of 16 or 18 figures was probably made to be set on platforms along the walls of a "luohan hall" in a temple.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt, 7–8; Gillman, 126; Gillman Lecture, 35:00 – 37:00&lt;/ref&gt; The openwork bases were intended to suggest mountains; paintings of luohans often show them perched on small peaks, indicating the mountain retreats of the ascetic monk.&lt;ref&gt;Gillman Lecture, 38:30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
[[File:Luohan side.jpg|thumb|The older of the New York figures, from the side]]
In their first years in the West the figures were usually assigned to the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907), with some proposing various later dates in the [[Ming dynasty]] period and those of the dynasties in between.  But a date in the regional [[Liao Dynasty]] (916–1125 CE) came to be preferred, although in recent years they are increasingly, partly because of the results of scientific dating methods, placed in the early 12th century, which is mostly in the following [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin and Hobson's titles; Hobson, 69–70; Watson, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermoluminescence dating]] tests of the statues in Philadelphia and New York (younger figure) produced a midpoint date of 1210, ± 100 and 200 years respectively, the midpoint being during the period of the following Jin dynasty.  Derek Gillman tentatively suggests the specific date of 1159, to match the recorded renovation of a large temple in the region, which he proposes as a candidate for their original location.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt, 8; Gillman Lecture, 53:10, for some minutes; Wisdom, 116 (Technical note).&lt;/ref&gt;  An early 12th-century coin was also found inside the Boston figure.&lt;ref name="Watson, 123"/&gt;

== History in the art world ==
[[File:Luohan (arhat), Yixian cave, Hebei Province, China, Liao Dynasty, 11th century - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09807.JPG|thumb|Luohan at [[Royal Ontario Museum]]]]
[[File:Green Luohan, Southeast Asia Gallery, Royal Ontario Museum, shoulder detail.JPG|thumb|upright|Detail from [[Royal Ontario Museum]]]]
The figures were reportedly in the hands of Chinese dealers who told the German sinologist [[Friedrich Perzynski]] about them in 1912, and subsequently showed him examples, some of which he bought and exported to Europe. They had apparently been found in one or more caves near Yixian, [[Hebei]], some 100 miles south-west of Beijing in northwestern China.&lt;ref&gt;Gillman Lecture, 23:40; others give shorter distances&lt;/ref&gt;   Perzynski claimed that he visited the cave the luohans had come from, by which time only a few fragments remained there. He described the episode in an article for ''[[Deutsche Rundschau]]'' soon after, repeating his story in a book published a few years later,&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin, 16&lt;/ref&gt; but the accuracy, indeed the veracity, of his account has been challenged in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Abstracts of the 1998 AAS Annual Meeting, March 26–29, 1998, Washington, DC [http://www.asian-studies.org/absts/1998abst/china/c23.htm Session on the Luohans]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="homage to heaven earth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Far Eastern Department, Royal Ontario Museum|title=Homage to Heaven, Homage to Earth: Chinese Treasures of the Royal Ontario Museum|year=1992|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apr06&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyle|first=Brian|title=View of the Luohan sculpture, Matthews Family Court of Chinese Sculpture, April 2006|url=http://images.rom.on.ca/public/index.php?function=image&amp;action=simpledetail&amp;image_name=ROM2006_7147_4|publisher=Royal Ontario Museum|accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 two figures were exhibited in Paris (without their bases), and a third (with base) was acquired by the British Museum in 1914, see [[Seated Luohan from Yixian]].&lt;ref&gt;Hobson&lt;/ref&gt;  Now six figures are in museums in North America, with two surviving and one missing or destroyed in Europe, and one of the set in Japan.  The Metropolitan acquired its two examples separately in 1921, by which time Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto and the Matsukata Collection in Japan already had theirs, and a further four were "owned by private collectors and dealers", so making a total of ten figures, "besides a great many small fragments, several hands and feet, and baskets full of broken pieces".&lt;ref&gt;"Bulletin", 15, quoted; this covers the first the MMA bought, the younger luohan, with a later article in the June edition on the second aged figure, see Wisdom, 226&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure long thought lost from the [[Museum für Ostasiatische Kunst]] in Berlin is a head and bust length fragment, 60&amp;nbsp;cm high, of a younger man with his head turned to his left, and his shoulder bared.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/h_sinica/galleries/72157626382928151/#photo_5623883586 Photo on Flickr]; Gridley, 10, 113, 114; Steinhardt, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 2011 lecture Derek Gillman reported that [[Stanley Abe]], a fellow specialist, had recently been shown it in a storeroom of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St Petersburg]].&lt;ref name="Gillman Lecture, 21:10"&gt;Gillman Lecture, 21:10&lt;/ref&gt; The figure in Paris is an uncertain member of the group, very similar overall, but with differences in the posture of the shoulders and its stippled design on the robes. Many scholars question whether it really belongs with the group.&lt;ref&gt;Gillman Lecture, 22:30&lt;/ref&gt;

To a surprising degree, the number of surviving pieces differs between sources.  Most older sources say there were eight, including the Berlin figure. Three of these, those in Boston, Japan and Ontario, are reported to have later heads.&lt;ref&gt;Gillman, 126 n&lt;/ref&gt; This may explain why [[William Watson (sinologist)|William Watson]] in 2000 wrote that "Five Luohan in ''sancai'' pottery are preserved in Western museums", presumably excluding the example in Japan.&lt;ref name="Watson, 123"/&gt; The group of nine as listed by [[Laurence Sickman]] and others includes the examples from Berlin (as "present location unknown") and Japan (as "Matsukata Collection") but excludes the one now in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman, 483, note 11&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2010 Gillman says what is presumably the same Japanese example was in the "Saizon Museum of Modern Art" (more usually "Sezon").&lt;ref&gt;Gillman, 126n&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the current museum web pages mention a group of eight,&lt;ref name="friends of far east" /&gt; probably counting Berlin, plus the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (with two) in New York City,&lt;ref name=toah/&gt; [[British Museum]] in London, [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] in Kansas City, [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in Toronto, Ontario, and [[Penn Museum]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="homage to heaven earth" /&gt;  The current Penn Museum webpage lists eight surviving figures, including the "Matsukata Collection" but excluding Paris and Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penn.museum/collections/object/151869 Penn Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt; Lecturing in 2011, Derek Gillman, Executive Director and President of the [[Barnes Foundation]], said there were "nine known examples; there's a tenth which may be part of the group, and three are known, er, believed to have been broken".&lt;ref&gt;Gillman Lecture, 3:50&lt;/ref&gt;

The luohan at the Royal Ontario Museum, in the Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art, was one of the first pieces to be included in the museum's Chinese art collection.&lt;ref name="friends of far east"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheong|first=Phillip|title=Reflections on the Luohan|newspaper=Friends of the Far East: Newsletter for the Bishop White Committee|date=Autumn 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the piece dates back to the [[Liao Dynasty]] (916–1125 CE),&lt;ref name=foal&gt;{{cite web|title=Figure of a luohan|url=http://images.rom.on.ca/public/index.php?function=image&amp;action=simpledetail&amp;image_name=ROM2005_1592_1|publisher=[[Royal Ontario Museum]]|accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  its tri-colour glaze of green, amber, and cream, is reminiscent of elements from Tang Dynasty sculptures.&lt;ref name="art treasures in ROM"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinrich|first=Theodore Allen|title=Art Treasures in the Royal Ontario Museum|year=1963|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|location=Toronto|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
The dimensions of the figures vary somewhat; taking the younger of the two in New York as an example, they are: height of the figure alone 50 in. (127&amp;nbsp;cm); including the base the height is 92 in. (233.7&amp;nbsp;cm).  The base is 41 in. (104.1&amp;nbsp;cm) wide and 38 in. (96.5&amp;nbsp;cm) deep. The whole piece weighs 450&amp;nbsp;lbs (204.1&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/42722 Metropolitan object page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The statues are assembled from several pieces of glazed [[terracotta]] (not [[stoneware]] as sometimes said),&lt;ref&gt;Gillman Lecture, 21:00&lt;/ref&gt;  with their bases made separately, and using a combination of moulded and freely formed "slab-constructed" sections.  They use the difficult [[sancai]] three-colour glazing process (here in fact often including four colours), which requires two firings.  This was widely used for vessels and figures found in [[T'ang dynasty]] (618–907) tombs ([[Tang Dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun|this set in London is a good example]]), but from the mid-8th century is rarely found in most of China.  However the regional Liao dynasty, founded by the semi-nomadic [[Khitan people]], continued to use the style, although normally for vessels rather than figures, and Beijing and Yixian were on the southern edge of their state, with Beijing (as "Nanjing") their southern capital.&lt;ref name="Wisdom, 115–116"&gt;Wisdom, 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures, variously described as life-size or "slightly over life-size",&lt;ref&gt;Wisdom, 115; Sickman, 200 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; are among the largest made with the technique and are agreed to be outstanding examples from the technical as well as the artistic point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman, 201; Wisdom, 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one scholar "it would tax the best-equipped modern pottery to build up and fire such massive objects without sinkage or warping or loss of pose",&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, 70&lt;/ref&gt; though he was probably unaware that because of their exceptional size the figures have iron rods inserted internally before firing to support the structure, a very unusual element.&lt;ref name="Gillman Lecture, 21:10"/&gt;

Because of their high quality it is often believed that they may have been made at one of the imperial kilns, which were home to the most highly skilled craftsmen.&lt;ref name=toah/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawson; Sickman and Soper&lt;/ref&gt;  Remains of a kiln have been excavated since 1983 at Longquan (not [[Longquan]]), between Beijing and the findspot, which seems a plausible site for their manufacture, with fragments of figures with similar characteristics found,&lt;ref name="Wisdom, 115–116"/&gt; although Gillman is unconvinced by this suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;Gillman Lecture, long passage beginning 41:00&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Zhonghua Da Zidian''''' ({{zh|t=中華大字典|s=中华大字典| p=Zhōnghuá Dà Zìdiǎn| w=Chung-hua Ta Tzu-tien|l=Chinese Great Dictionary}}) is an unabridged [[Chinese dictionary]] of [[Chinese characters|characters]], originally published in 1915. The chief editors were [[Xu Yuan'gao]] (徐元誥), [[Lufei Kui]] (陆费逵）, and [[Ouyang Pucun]] (歐陽溥存/欧阳溥存). It was based upon the 1716 ''[[Kangxi Zidian]]'', and is internally organized using the 214 [[Kangxi radicals]]. The 1915 publication contains more than 48,000 entries for individual characters, including many invented in the two centuries since the ''Kangxi Dictionary''.

Each character entry includes the [[fanqie]] spelling from the [[Jiyun]], the modern pronunciation given with a common [[homophone]], different meanings (up to 40), classical quotations, and two-character compounds using the character. Although Teng and Biggerstaff (1971:131) acknowledged that the ''Zhonghua Da Zidian'' "is very comprehensive and is very carefully compiled," they noted three defects. The index, which is arranged by number of [[Stroke (Chinese character)|strokes]], can be inconvenient (e.g., 2189 characters are listed under 9 strokes). The margins do not have characters to help locate entries under a radical. The two-character phrases may be listed under either component.

The 1615 '''''Zìhuì''''' is a [[Chinese dictionary]] edited by the [[Ming Dynasty]] scholar Mei Yingzuo ([[:zh:梅膺祚|梅膺祚]]). It is renowned for introducing two [[lexicography|lexicographical]] innovations that continue to be used in the present day: the [[Kangxi radical|214-radical system]] for [[Chinese characters#Indexing|indexing]] Chinese characters, which replaced the classic ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' dictionary's [[List of Shuowen Jiezi radicals|540-radical system]], and the [[Collation#Radical-and-stroke sorting|radical-and-stroke sorting]] method.

==Title==
The dictionary title combines ''zì'' {{linktext|字}} "character; script; writing; graph; word" and ''huì'' {{linktext|彙}} "gather together; assemble; collection; list". Early forms of the graph ''huì'' 彙 depicted a "hedgehog" (''wèi'' {{linktext|猬}}), and it was borrowed as a [[phonetic loan character]] for the word huì {{linktext|匯}} "gather together; collection", both of which, in [[simplified Chinese characters|the simplified character system]], are {{linktext|汇}}. In modern Chinese usage, ''zìhuì'' {{linktext|字匯}} or {{linktext|字彙}} means "glossary; wordbook; lexicon; dictionary; vocabulary; (computing) [[Character encoding|character set]]" (''[[Wenlin]]'' 2016).

English translations of ''Zihui'' include "Collection of Characters" (Zhou and Zhang 2003), "The Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Characters" (Yong and Peng 2008), and "Character Treasure" (Ulrich 2010)

==Text==
[[File:Four-tone hand diagram.png|thumb|Traditional representation of the four tone classes on a hand.]]
The ''Zihui'' dictionary comprises 14 volumes ({{linktext|巻}}), with a comprehensive and integrated format that many subsequent Chinese dictionaries followed. 

Volume 1 contains the [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]], including Mei Yingzuo's preface dated 1615, style guide, and appendices. For instance, the "Sequences of Strokes" shows the correct [[stroke order]], which is useful for students, "Ancient Forms" uses early [[Chinese script styles]] to explain the six [[Chinese character classification|Chinese character categories]], and "Index of Difficult Characters" lists graphs whose radicals were difficult to identify (Yong and Peng 2008: 287-288). 

Volume 14 encompasses the [[Book design#Back matter (end matter)|back matter]], with three main appendices. "Differentiation" lists 473 characters with similar forms but different pronunciations and meanings, such as {{linktext|刺}} and {{linktext|剌}} or {{linktext|段}} and {{linktext|叚}}. "Rectification" corrects misunderstandings of 68 characters commonly used in contemporary [[Woodblock printing|printed]] books. "Riming" gives [[rime tables]] intended to explain the [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]] and ''[[fanqie]]'' pronunciation glosses (Yong and Peng 2008: 287). Note that the above image of early ''Zihui'' dictionaries shows the traditional hand representation of the four tone classes.

The [[Body text|main body]] of the ''Zihui'' dictionary is divided into 12 volumes (2-13) called ''ji'' ({{linktext|集}}, collections) and numbered according to the twelve [[Earthly Branches]]. Each one begins with a grid diagram showing all the radicals included in the volume and their page numbers. This reference guide to the volumes made looking up characters more convenient than in the previous dictionaries (Yong and Peng 2008: 287). 

The ''Zihui'' included 33,179 [[Headword|head character]] entries, most of which were from [[Song Lian]]'s 1375 ''Hongwu zhengyun'' (洪武正韻, [[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu]] Dictionary of Standard Rhymes). The entries included common characters used in the [[Chinese classics]] and some popular or nonstandard characters (''súzì'' 俗字), both contemporary and early (Yong and Peng 2008: 287). Mei Yingzuo made his dictionary more easily accessible to the general literate public by using the current [[regular script]] form of characters. Beginning with the ''Shuowen jiezi'', earlier Chinese dictionaries were arranged according to radicals written in the obsolete [[seal script]] (Norman 1988: 172). 

The basic format of each ''Zihui'' character entry comprised first the pronunciations including variants, and then the definitions, giving the primary meaning followed by common and extended meanings. In addition to using the traditional ''[[fanqie]]'' spelling, Mei indicated pronunciation with a commonly used [[homophone|homophonous]] character, no doubt in recognition of the fact that it was "almost impossible for the average reader to derive correct current readings from Tang dynasty ''fanqie''" (Norman 1988: 172). Definitions are for the most part brief and readily understandable, and reference to a text is almost always given by way of examples, generally from ancient books and partly from colloquial language. ''Zihui'' innovations in dictionary format, such as the arrangement of meanings, the use of plain language, and usage examples from informal language, made the book "exceptional at the time" (Yong and Peng 2008: 287).

The best-known lexicographical advances in Mei Yingzuo's ''Zihui'' are reducing the unwieldy ''Shuowen Jiezi'' [[List of Shuowen Jiezi radicals|450-radical system]] for collating Chinese characters into the more legical [[Kangxi radical|214-radical system]], and arranging graphs belonging to a single radical according to the number of residual strokes, making finding character entries a relatively simple matter (Norman 1988: 171). To illustrate the inefficiencies of the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' system, only a few characters are listed under some radicals. For instance, its "man radical" 男, which compounds the modern [[Radical 102|"field radical" 田]] and the [[Radical 19|"power radical" 力]], only lists three: ''nan'' 男 ("man; male"), ''sheng'' 甥 ("nephew; niece"), and ''jiu'' 舅 ("uncle; brother in law"). In contrast, the ''Zihui'' eliminates the "man radical" and lists ''nan'' 男 under the "power radical", ''sheng'' 甥 under the [[Radical 100|"life radical" 生]], and ''jiu'' 舅 under the [[Radical 134|"mortar radical" 臼]]. The 214 radicals are arranged according to stroke number, from the single-stroke [[Radical 1| "one radical" 一]] to the seventeen-stroke [[Radical 214|"flute radical" 龠]]. The ''Zihui'' character entries are arranged according to the stroke number left after subtracting the respective radical, for instance, the characters under the [[Radical 30|"mouth radical" 口]] begin with {{linktext|卟}}, {{linktext|古}}, and {{linktext|句}} and end with {{linktext|囔}}, {{linktext|囕}}, and {{linktext|囖}}. This "[[Collation#Radical-and-stroke sorting|radical-and-stroke]]" system remains one of the most common forms of Chinese lexicographic arrangement today,

==History==
With the possible exception of the 1324 ''[[Zhongyuan Yinyun]]'', there were few advances in Chinese lexicography between the sixth and seventeenth centuries. Many dictionaries prior to the Ming Dynasty were modeled on the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' 540-radical format, and new dictionaries were generally no more than minor revisions and enlargements of older works. Mei Yingzuo's ''Zihui'' represents the "first important lexicographic advance" after this long period. He greatly simplified and rationalized the traditional set of radicals, introduced the principle of indexing graphs according to the number of residual strokes, and wrote characters in contemporary regular script instead of ancient seal script. The importance of Mei's innovations is confirmed by the fact that they were promptly imitated by other Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] period dictionaries (Norman 1988: 172).

The ''Zihui'' also formed the basis for the ''[[Zhengzitong]]'', written and originally published by Zhang Zilie (張自烈) as the 1627 ''Zihui bian'' (字彙辯; "''Zihui'' Disputations") supplemental correction to the ''Zihui'', then purchased by Liao Wenying (廖文英) and republished as the 1671 ''Zhengzitong''. Another Qing dynasty scholar [[Wu Renchen]] published the 1666 ''Zihui bu'' (字彙補 "Zihui supplement"). The most important of the works based on the ''Zihui'' model was undoubtedly the 1716 ''[[Kangxi Zidian]]'', which soon became the standard dictionary of Chinese characters, and continues to be used widely today (Norman 1988: 172). After the ''Kangxi Zidian'' adopted Mei's 214-radical system, they have been known as the [[Kangxi radicals]] rather than "Zihui radicals".

==Innovations==
The best-known lexicographical advances in Mei Yingzuo's ''Zihui'' are reducing the unwieldy ''Shuowen Jiezi'' [[List of Shuowen Jiezi radicals|450-radical system]] for collating Chinese characters into the more legical [[Kangxi radical|214-radical system]], and arranging graphs belonging to a single radical according to the number of residual strokes, making finding character entries a relatively simple matter (Norman 1988: 171). To illustrate the inefficiencies of the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' system, only a few characters are listed under some radicals. For instance, its "man radical" 男, which compounds the modern [[Radical 102|"field radical" 田]] and the [[Radical 19|"power radical" 力]], only lists three: ''nan'' 男 ("man; male"), ''sheng'' 甥 ("nephew; niece"), and ''jiu'' 舅 ("uncle; brother in law"). In contrast, the ''Zihui'' eliminates the "man radical" and lists ''nan'' 男 under the "power radical", ''sheng'' 甥 under the [[Radical 100|"life radical" 生]], and ''jiu'' 舅 under the [[Radical 134|"mortar radical" 臼]]. The 214 radicals are arranged according to stroke number, from the single-stroke [[Radical 1| "one radical" 一]] to the seventeen-stroke [[Radical 214|"flute radical" 龠]]. The ''Zihui'' character entries are arranged according to the stroke number left after subtracting the respective radical, for instance, the characters under the [[Radical 30|"mouth radical" 口]] begin with {{linktext|卟}}, {{linktext|古}}, and {{linktext|句}} and end with {{linktext|囔}}, {{linktext|囕}}, and {{linktext|囖}}. This "[[Collation#Radical-and-stroke sorting|radical-and-stroke]]" system remains one of the most common forms of Chinese lexicographic arrangement today.

The Chinese scholar Zou Feng (邹酆 lists four major lexicographical format innovations that Mei Yingzuo established in the ''Zihui'', and which have been used in many dictionaries up to the present day (1983, Yong and Peng 2008: 289-290). First, the ''Zihui'' includes both formal seal script and [[clerical script]] as well as informal regular script characters, and gives the latter more significance than previously. Second, character entry presentation is improved by including both ''fanqie'' and homophonic phonetic notation, initiating a "more scientific format" for displaying definitions from original through extended meanings, using the label 〇 to display characters with multiple pronunciations and meanings, and indicating characters that have multiple [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], all of which are standard format elements in modern Chinese dictionaries. Third, radicals and character entries are classified in a more logical manner, as explained above.  Fourth, the ''Zihui'' was the first Chinese dictionary to integrate the main body and appendices into one whole, thus improving practicality for the user.
