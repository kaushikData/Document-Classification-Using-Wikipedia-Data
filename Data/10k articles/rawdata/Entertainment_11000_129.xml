Evans"&gt;[http://www.canmag.com/nw/8327-josh-flitter-ace-ventura Alrighty Then! Josh Flitter for Third Ace Ventura]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Justin Heimberg"&gt;[http://www.movieweb.com/news/16/14116.php Jeff Sank, Jason Heimberg and Justin Heimberg On Ace Ventura Duty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713070837/http://www.movieweb.com/news/16/14116.php |date=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{cleanup|section|date=November 2010}}
Ventura must follow in his father's (''Ace Ventura Sr.'s'') footsteps to save his mother from going to jail.

In the beginning, Ace is chasing a woman. He catches her, and walks straight into the alligator habitat. Later in a dream Ace sees a panda ,Ting Tang, being captured. Soon his mother is blamed for the theft. She asks if she can make one phone call. She calls Rex Ventura, Ace's paternal grandfather. Rex tells Ace the history of the Ventura Family and their relationship with animals. Rex Ventura is an elderly man with several animals such as a cat, a turtle and a dog which Ace thinks is dead.

At his mother's trial, Ace Jr. presents evidence that proves his mother couldn't have committed the crime of stealing Ting-Tang the panda; however, the Ranger (the one that Ace doesn't like), dismisses the evidence and Ace's mother is ultimately taken to jail.

At school the next day, Ace hears that many of his classmates, including his crush, Laura ([[Emma Lockhart]]), have brutally murdered their pets. Laura has killed her pet emerald green koi fish. Ace goes to school the next day and talks to a boy nicknamed A-Plus. A-Plus has a hidden lab in his locker, which Ace uses as his office. They believe a scientist named Dr. Sickinger ([[Cullen Douglas]]), who's also somewhat insane, is the panda thief, primarily because he created a website called "PandaHub." However, Sickinger is ultimately proven innocent and ends up working with the kids to find out who the real culprit is. The kids discover that Sickinger used to work for Quenton Pennington Jr. ([[Reed Alexander]]), a rich kid whose family motto is, "What a Pennington wants a Pennington gets." In the end Ace finds that Pennington Sr. ([[Brian Patrick Clarke]]) stole Ting Tang, as well as a bunch of other famous animals (Tabby the tabby, Princess the lap dog, Freedom the hawk, and Callypso the magic horse), and that Pennington Jr. stole Ace's classmates' pets. His mother's name is finally cleared and is rewarded for his heroics. At this point in the movie, it is also discovered that Ace has been using extreme hallucinogens such as LSD throughout the whole film, and that the entire story is just a figment of Ace's imagination whilst high.

Ace's father does not appear in this film. Until Rex comes in, whenever Ace Jr. would ask his mom about his dad, she would simply tell him that he had disappeared on a business trip when he was a baby and wouldn't go into any greater detail. However, before she's taken to jail (before Rex comes in), she elaborates on what happened to Ace Sr.: when their son was still just a baby, Ace had rescued a group of endangered animals and while flying them to safety, the airplane that they were in disappeared somewhere over the [[Bermuda Triangle]], and Ace Ventura Sr. was never seen or heard from again after that.

==Reception==

If I were a kid, I might like it. But I'm not a kid, and I didn't."&lt;ref name=puccio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviemet.com/review/ace-ventura-jr-pet-detective-dvd-review |title=ACE VENTURA JR.: PET DETECTIVE - DVD review |author=Puccio, John J |date=February 18, 2009 |work=moviemet.com |publisher= |accessdate=July 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323125307/http://moviemet.com/review/ace-ventura-jr-pet-detective-dvd-review |archivedate=March 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bechdel test''' ({{IPAc-en|'|b|É|k|d|Él}} {{respell|BEK|dÉl}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alison Bechdel Audio Name Pronunciation|url=http://www.teachingbooks.net/pronounce.cgi?aid=10597|website=TeachingBooks.net|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added.&lt;ref name="savigny et al"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raalte |first1=Christa van |editor1-last=Savigny |editor1-first=Heather |editor2-last=Thorsen |editor2-first=Einar |editor3-last=Jackson |editor3-first=Daniel |editor4-last=Alexander |editor4-first=Jenny |title=Media, Margins and Popular Culture |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781137512819 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Er2hCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;pg=PT32 |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=en |chapter=1. No Small-Talk in Paradise: Why Elysium Fails the Bechdel Test, and Why We Should Care}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of all films meet these criteria, according to user-edited databases and the media industry press.&lt;!-- Please refer to sources cited below, the lead paragraph cites sources only for quotations --&gt; The test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in films and other fiction, and to call attention to [[gender inequality in fiction]].

Also known as the '''BechdelâWallace test''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alison Bechdel Would Like You to Call It the "BechdelâWallace Test," ThankYouVeryMuch|url=http://www.themarysue.com/bechdel-wallace-test-please-alison-bechdel/|accessdate=26 August 2015|date=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is named after the American cartoonist [[Alison Bechdel]], in whose comic strip, ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]'', the test first appeared, in 1985. Bechdel credited the idea to a friend, Liz Wallace, and to the writings of [[Virginia Woolf]]. After the test became more widely discussed in the 2000s, a number of variants and tests inspired by it have been introduced.

==History==

===Gender portrayal in popular fiction===
[[File:Female and male characters in film.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Female and male characters in film, according to four studies]]
In her 1929 essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]] observed about the literature of her time what the Bechdel test would later highlight in more recent fiction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bechdel-Test: Frauen spielen keine Rolle|url=http://kurier.at/kultur/4506969-bechdel-test-frauen-spielen-keine-rolle.php|accessdate=19 August 2012|newspaper=[[Kurier]]|date=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|All these relationships between women, I thought, rapidly recalling the splendid gallery of fictitious women, are too simple. ... And I tried to remember any case in the course of my reading where two women are represented as friends. ... They are now and then mothers and daughters. But almost without exception they are shown in their relation to men. It was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until [[Jane Austen]]'s day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex. And how small a part of a woman's life is that ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolf|first=Virginia|title=A Room of One's Own: Chapter 5|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91r/complete.html|work=[[University of Adelaide#North Terrace|The University of Adelaide Library]]|publisher=[[University of Adelaide Press]]|accessdate=24 December 2012|authorlink=Virginia Woolf|editor=Thomas, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In film, a study of gender portrayals in 855 of the most financially successful U.S. films from 1950 to 2006 showed that there were, on average, two male characters for each female character, a ratio that remained stable over time. Female characters were portrayed as being involved in sex twice as often as male characters, and their proportion of scenes with explicit sexual content increased over time. Violence increased over time in male and female characters alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bleakley | first1 = A. | last2 = Jamieson | first2 = P.

According to a 2014 study by the [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]], in 120 films made worldwide from 2010 to 2013, only 31% of named characters were female, and 23% of the films had a female protagonist or co-protagonist. 7% of directors were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sakoui|first1=Anousha|last2=Magnusson|first2=Niklas|title='Hunger Games' success masks stubborn gender gap in Hollywood|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-film-women22-20140922-story.html|accessdate=22 September 2014|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=22 September 2014}} With reference to: {{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Pieper|first2=Katherine|title=Gender Bias Without Borders: An Investigation of Female Characters in Popular Films Across 11 Countries|url=http://seejane.org/symposiums-on-gender-in-media/gender-bias-without-borders/|website=See Jane|accessdate=16 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study looking at the 700 topâgrossing films from 2007 to 2014 found that only 30% of the speaking characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Stacy L.|last2=Choueiti|first2=Marc|last3=Pieper|first3=Katherine|last4=Gillig|first4=Traci|last5=Lee|first5=Carmen|last6=Dylan|first6=DeLuca|title=Inequality in 700 Popular Films: Examining Portrayals of Gender, Race,  &amp; LGBT Status from 2007 to 2014|url=http://annenberg.usc.edu/pages/~/media/MDSCI/Inequality%20in%20700%20Popular%20Films%208215%20Final%20for%20Posting.ashx|publisher=USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 analysis of [[screenplay]]s of 2,005 commercially successful films, Hanah Anderson and Matt Daniels found that in 82% of the films, men had two of the top three speaking roles, while a woman had the most dialogue in only 22% of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swanson|first1=Ana|title=The problem with almost all movies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/12/the-problem-with-almost-all-movies/|work=The Washington Post|date=12 April 2016|language=en-US}} With reference to: {{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Hanah|last2=Daniels|first2=Matt|title=The Largest Analysis of Film Dialogue by Gender, Ever|url=http://polygraph.cool/films/|website=Polygraph|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bechdel test===
[[File:Dykes to Watch Out For (Bechdel test origin).jpg|400px|thumb|A character in ''[[Dykes to Watch Out For]]'' explains the rules that later came to be known as the Bechdel test (1985)]]
The rules now known as the Bechdel test first appeared in 1985 in Alison Bechdel's comic strip ''[[Dykes To Watch Out For]]''. In a strip titled "The Rule", two women, who resemble the future characters Mo and Ginger,&lt;ref name="Martindale"/&gt; discuss seeing a film and one woman explains that she only goes to a movie if it satisfies the following requirements:
# The movie has to have at least two women in it,

The test has also been referred to as the "BechdelâWallace test"&lt;ref name="sparqling" /&gt; (which Bechdel herself prefers),&lt;ref&gt;On the [[Fresh Air]] program on NPR on August 17, 2015, in response to a question from host Terry Gross, Bechdel said she would prefer the test be referred to as the BechdelâWallace Test.&lt;/ref&gt; the "Bechdel rule",&lt;ref name="ok" /&gt; "Bechdel's law",&lt;ref name="antipope" /&gt; or the "Mo Movie Measure".&lt;ref name=AB/&gt; Bechdel credited the idea for the test to a friend and [[karate]] training partner, Liz Wallace, whose name appears in the [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] of the strip.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94202522 NPR] [[Neda Ulaby|Ulaby, Neda]] "The 'Bechdel Rule,' Defining Pop-Culture Character".

Originally meant as "a little lesbian joke in an alternative feminist newspaper", according to Bechdel,&lt;ref name="San Diego City Beat 23 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morlan|first1=Kinsee|title=Comic-Con vs. the Bechdel Test|url=http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-13243-comic-con-vs-the-bechdel-test.html|accessdate=15 August 2014|work=[[San Diego City Beat]]|date=23 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316161800/http://www.sdcitybeat.com/sandiego/article-13243-comic-con-vs-the-bechdel-test.html|archivedate=16 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the test moved into mainstream criticism in the 2010s and has been described as "the standard by which feminist critics judge television, movies, books, and other media".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiger|first=Kay|editor-first=James|editor-last=Lowder|title=Triumph of The Walking Dead|chapter=No Clean Slate: Unshakeable race and gender politics in ''The Walking Dead''|year=2011|publisher=[[BenBella Books]]|isbn=9781936661138|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lz3fp1fVw90C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104|accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, an Internet newspaper described it as "almost a household phrase, common shorthand to capture whether a film is woman-friendly".&lt;ref name="The Daily Dot 18 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Romano|first=Aja|title=The Mako Mori Test: 'Pacific Rim' inspires a Bechdel Test alternative|url=http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/mako-mori-test-bechdel-pacific-rim/|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of major Hollywood productions such as ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' (2013) to pass the test was addressed in depth in the media.&lt;ref name="Metro 18 July 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=McGuinness|first=Ross|title=The Bechdel test and why Hollywood is a man's, man's, man's world|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/07/18/movie-lovers-hit-back-at-hollywood-misogyny-with-the-bechdel-test-3886103/|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Neda Ulaby]], the test resonates because "it articulates something often missing in popular culture: not the number of women we see on screen, but the depth of their stories, and the range of their concerns."&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; Dean Spade and Craig Willse described the test as a "commentary on how media representations enforce harmful [[gender norm]]s" by depicting women's relationships to men more than any other relationships, and women's lives as important only insofar as they relate to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Dean |last1=Spade|first2=Craig |last2=Willse|editor-last=Hawkesworth|editor-first=Mary|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199328581|page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several variants of the test have been proposedâfor example, that the two women must be named characters,&lt;ref name="EW 6 August 2010"/&gt; or that there must be at least a total of 60 seconds of conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministfrequency.com/2012/02/the-2012-oscars-and-the-bechdel-test/ |title=The Oscars and the Bechdel Test |publisher=Feminist Frequency |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test has also attracted academic interest from a computational analysis approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N15/N15-1084.pdf Bechdel Test academic paper.]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the Bechdel test was added to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Suh |first1=Haley |title=Words To Know By Now: Binge-Watching, Bechdel Test Added To Oxford English Dictionary |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haleysuh/2018/06/15/words-to-know-by-now-binge-watching-bechdel-test-added-to-oxford-english-dictionary |accessdate=20 June 2018 |work=Forbes |date=15 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in the film industry===
In 2013, four Swedish cinemas and the Scandinavian cable television channel [[Viasat Film]] incorporated the Bechdel test into some of their ratings, a move supported by the [[Swedish Film Institute]].&lt;ref name="G"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/swedish-cinemas-bechdel-test-films-gender-bias |title=Swedish cinemas take aim at gender bias with Bechdel test rating |work=The Guardian |date=November 6, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the European cinema fund [[Eurimages]] incorporated the Bechdel test into its submission mechanism as part of an effort to collect information about gender equality in its projects. It requires "a Bechdel analysis of the script to be supplied by the script readers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender equality within Eurimages: current situation and scope for evolution|url=http://www.ewawomen.com/en/eurimages-news.html|website=European Women's Audiovisual Network|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[screenwriting software]] developers began incorporating functions that allow writers to analyze their scripts for gender representation. Software with such functions includes [[Highland 2]], [[WriterDuet]] and the forthcoming [[Final Draft (software)|Final Draft]] 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ryzik |first1=Melena |title=Is your script gender-balanced?

==Application==

In addition to films, the Bechdel test has been applied to other media such as video games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Kishonna|title=Race, Gender, and Deviance in Xbox Live: Theoretical Perspectives from the Virtual Margins|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317521803|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh-gBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anthropy |first=Anna |title=Rise of the videogame zinesters: How freaks, normals, amateurs, artists, dreamers, dropouts, queers, housewives, and people like you are taking back an art form |year=2012 |publisher=Seven Stories Press |isbn=9781609803735 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nc3GRXqgPZ8C&amp;lpg=PT7 |edition=Seven Stories Press 1st |accessdate=2014-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Agnello |first=Anthony John |title=Something other than a man: 15 games that pass the Bechdel Test |url=http://gameological.com/2012/07/something-other-than-a-man-15-games-that-pass-the-bechdel-test/ |accessdate=26 July 2012 |work=Gameological |date=July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and comics.&lt;ref name="MTV Geek! 22 February 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zalben |first=Alex |title=''Witchblade''/''Red Sonja #1'' Passes The Bechdel Test |url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/02/22/witchbladered-sonja-1-passes-the-bechdel-test-advance-review/ |accessdate=26 July 2012 |newspaper=[[MTV Geek!]] |date=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theater, British actor Beth Watson launched a "Bechdel Theatre" campaign in 2015 that aims to highlight test-passing plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Jo Caird|title = Does your show pass the Bechdel test? {{!}} Opinion |url = https://www.thestage.co.uk/opinion/2015/does-your-show-pass-the-bechdel-test/|website = The Stage|date=14 October 2015|access-date = 2016-02-05|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pass and fail proportions===
The website ''bechdeltest.com'' is a user-edited database of some 6,500 films classified by whether they pass the test, with the added requirement that the women must be ''named'' characters. {{as of|April 2015}}, it listed 58% of these films as passing all three of the test's requirements, 10% as failing one, 22% as failing two, and 10% as failing all three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statistics |url=http://bechdeltest.com/statistics/ |work=bechdeltest.com |accessdate=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', if passing the test were mandatory, it would have jeopardized half of the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] nominees.&lt;ref name="EW 6 August 2010"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Mark |title=I Am Woman. Hear Me... Please! |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20408121,00.html |accessdate=26 July 2012 |newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=6 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news website ''[[Vocativ]]'', when subjecting the top-grossing films of 2013 to the Bechdel test, concluded that roughly half of them passed (although some dubiously) and the other half failed.&lt;ref name="Vocativ 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Sharma |first1= Versha |last2= Sender |first2= Hanna |title= Hollywood Movies With Strong Female Roles Make More Money |url= http://www.vocativ.com/culture/celebrity/hollywood-movies-strong-female-roles-make-money/ |accessdate= 2 January 2014 |newspaper= Vocativ |date= 2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Charles Stross]] noted that about half of the films that ''do'' pass the test only do so because the women talk about marriage or babies.&lt;ref name="Power 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Power |first=Nina |title=One-dimensional woman |year=2009 |publisher=Zero Books |isbn=1846942411 |pages=39 et seq. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3gDWJEJblEC&amp;pg=PA39 |accessdate=2014-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Works that fail the test include some that are mainly about or aimed at women, or which do feature prominent female characters. The television series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' highlights its own failure to pass the test by having one of the four female main characters ask: "How does it happen that four such smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends? It's like seventh grade with bank accounts!"&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

===Financial aspects===
''Vocativ''{{'}}s authors also found that the films from 2013 that passed the test earned a total of $4.22 billion in the United States, while those that failed earned $2.66 billion in total, leading them to conclude that a way for Hollywood to make more money might be to "put more women onscreen."&lt;ref name="Vocativ 2014"/&gt; A 2014 study by [[FiveThirtyEight]] based on data from about 1,615 films released from 1990 to 2013 concluded that the [[median]] budget of films that passed the test was 35% lower than that of the others. It found that the films that passed the test had about a 37 percent higher [[return on investment]] (ROI) in the United States, and the same ROI internationally, compared to films that did not pass the test.&lt;ref name="538 2014"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= FiveThirtyEight |first= Walt |last= Hickey |title= The Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood's Exclusion of Women |date= 1 April 2014 |url= http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanations===
Explanations that have been offered as to why many films fail the Bechdel test include the relative lack of gender [[diversity (politics)|diversity]] among scriptwriters&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; and other movie professionals, also called the "[[celluloid ceiling]]": In 2012, only one in six of the directors, writers, and producers behind the 100 most commercially successful movies in the United States was a woman.&lt;ref name="Metro 18 July 2013" /&gt;

Writing in ''[[National Review]]'' in 2017, film critic [[Kyle Smith]] suggested that the reason for the Bechdel test results was that "Hollywood movies are about people on the extremes of society â cops, criminals, superheroes â [which] tend to be men", and that such films were more often created by men because "women's movie ideas", mostly about relationships according to Smith, "aren't commercial enough for Hollywood studios".&lt;ref name="Smith 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Kyle|title=If You Like Art, Donât Take the Bechdel Test|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449340/bechdel-test-feminist-litmus-test-movies-useless-political-correctness|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=National Review|date=10 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the Bechdel test just as meaningless as a test asking whether a film contained [[cowboy]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith 2017" /&gt; Smith's article provoked vigorous criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Conservative Film Critic Slammed for Bechdel Test Takedown|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/10/kyle-smith-slammed-bechdel-test-takedown/|accessdate=18 July 2017|work=[[EW.com]]|date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessandra Maldonado and Liz Bourke wrote that Smith was wrong to contend that female authors do not write books that generate "big movie ideas", citing [[J.

== Limitations ==
The Bechdel test only indicates whether women are present in a work of fiction to a certain degree. A work may pass the test and still contain sexist content, and a work with prominent female characters may fail the test.&lt;ref name="ok"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oudaily.com/l_and_a/arts_and_entertainment/column-bechdel-rule-still-applies-to-portrayal-of-women-in/article_d3dc6a7d-8fcb-589c-885a-649fe33db5e1.html |first=Sarah |last=Wilson |date=28 June 2012 |publisher=The Oklahoma Daily |title=Bechdel Rule still applies to portrayal of women in films}}&lt;/ref&gt; A work may fail the test for reasons unrelated to gender bias, such as because its setting works against the inclusion of women (e.g., [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'', set in a medieval monastery).&lt;ref name="antipope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stross|first=Charles|title=Bechdel's Law|url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2008/07/bechdels_law.html|work=Charlie's Diary|date=28 July 2008|authorlink=Charles Stross|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; What counts as a character or as a conversation is not defined (e.g., the [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]] song "[[Baby Got Back]]" has been described as passing the Bechdel test, because it begins with audio of a [[valley girl]] saying "oh my god, Becky, look at her butt")&lt;ref name=LifehackerDouglas&gt;[https://lifehacker.com/the-bechdel-test-and-other-media-representation-tests-1819324045 The Bechdel Test, and Other Media Representation Tests, Explained], by Nick Douglas, at ''[[Lifehacker]]''; published October 10, 2017; retrieved April 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JezebelSimulator&gt;[https://jezebel.com/this-bechdel-test-simulator-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-pre-1753250185 This Bechdel Test Simulator Shows How Easy It Is to Predict Who Makes Sexist Movies (Men)], by Kara Brown, at ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]''; published January 15, 2016; retrieved April 17, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and works with very few of either will often fail the test automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gomez Maureira |first1=M.A.|last2=Rombout|first2=L.E.|editor1-last=Chorianopoulos|editor1-first=Konstantinos|title=Entertainment Computing - ICEC 2015: 14th International Conference, ICEC 2015, Trondheim, Norway, September 29 - October 2, 2015, Proceedings|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319245898|page=546|chapter=Sonifying Gender Representation in Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt at a [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] analysis of works as to whether they pass the test, at least one researcher, Faith Lawrence, noted that the results depend on how rigorously the test is applied. One of the questions arising from its application is whether a reference to a man at any point within a conversation that also covers other topics invalidates the entire exchange. If not, the question remains how one defines the start and end of a conversation.&lt;ref name="sparqling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Faith|title=SPARQLing Conversation: Automating The BechdelâWallace Test|url=http://nht.ecs.soton.ac.uk/2011/papers/12-flawrence.pdf|date=June 2011|work=Paper presented at the Narrative and Hypertext Workshop, Hypertext 2011|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In response to its increasing ubiquity in film criticism, the Bechdel test has been criticized for not taking into account the quality of the works it tests (bad films may pass it, and good ones fail), or as a "nefarious plot to make all movies conform to [[feminist]] dogma".&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=We Were Feminists Once: From Riot Grrrl to CoverGirlÂ¨, the Buying and Selling of a Political Movement|date=2016|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781610395892|pages=55â57}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Andi Zeisler]], this criticism indicates the problem that the test's utility "has been elevated way beyond the original intention. Where Bechdel and Wallace expressed it as simply a way to point out the rote, unthinkingly normative plotlines of mainstream film, these days passing it has somehow become synonymous with 'being feminist'. It was never meant to be a measure of feminism, but rather a cultural barometer." Zeisler noted that the false assumption that a work that passes the test is "feminist" might lead to creators "gaming the system" by adding just enough women characters and dialogue to pass the test,&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016" /&gt; while continuing to deny women substantial representation outside of formulaic plots.

Similarly, the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' film critic [[Robbie Collin]] disapproved of the test as prizing "box-ticking and stat-hoarding over analysis and appreciation", and suggested that the underlying problem of the lack of well-drawn female characters in film ought to be a topic of discourse, rather than individual films failing or passing the Bechdel test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collin|first=Robbie|title=Bechdel test is damaging to the way we think about film|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10450463/Bechdel-test-is-damaging-to-the-way-we-think-about-film.html|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''FiveThirtyEight''{{'}}s writer Walt Hickey noted that the test does not measure whether any one film is a model of gender equality, and that passing it does not ensure the quality of writing, significance or depth of female rolesâbut, he wrote, "it's the best test on gender equity in film we haveâand, perhaps more important ..., the only test we have data on".&lt;ref name="538 2014" /&gt;

[[Nina Power]] wrote that the test raises the questions of whether fiction has a duty to represent women (rather than to pursue whatever the creator's own agenda might be) and to be "realistic" in the representation of women. She also wrote that it remained to be determined how often real life passes the Bechdel test, and what the influence of fiction on that might be.&lt;ref name="Power 2009" /&gt;

The "Sphinx test" by the Sphinx theater company of London asks about the interaction of women with other characters, as well as how prominently women characters feature in the action, how proactive rather than reactive they are, and whether they are portrayed stereotypically.

===Tests about characteristics other than gender===

====Sexuality====
The "[[Vito Russo]] test" created by the [[LGBT]] organization [[GLAAD]] tests for the representation of LGBT characters in films. It asks: Does the film contain a character that is identifiably LGBT, and is not solely or predominantly defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as tied into the plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GLAAD introduces 'Studio Responsibility Index', report on LGBT images in films released by 'Big Six' studios |url=http://www.glaad.org/releases/glaad-introduces-studio-responsibility-index-report-lgbt-images-films-released-big-six |date=August 20, 2013 |publisher=[[GLAAD]] |accessdate=August 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Atlantic 21 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=John|first=Arit|title=Beyond the Bechdel Test: Two (New) Ways of Looking at Movies|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/08/beyond-bechdel-test-two-new-ways-looking-movies/68563/|accessdate=15 September 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====People of color====
A test proposed by TV critic Eric Deggans asks whether a film that is not about race has at least two non-white characters in the main cast,&lt;ref name="Zeisler 2016" /&gt; and similarly, writer Nikesh Shukla proposed a test about whether there are two main characters who are [[people of color]], who talk to each other without mentioning their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shukla|first1=Nikesh|title=After the Bechdel Test, I propose the Shukla Test for race in film|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/after-bechdel-test-i-propose-shukla-test-race-film|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawn|first1=Randee|title=Gender and race issues are slowly fading as more filmmakers consider three key tests|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-1117-film-tests-20161011-snap-20161109-story.html|accessdate=22 November 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] suggested in January 2016 the "DuVernay test", (named for director [[Ava DuVernay]]) asking whether "African-Americans and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dargis|first1=Manohla|title=Sundance Fights Tide With Films Like âThe Birth of a Nationâ|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/movies/sundance-fights-tide-with-films-like-the-birth-of-a-nation.html|accessdate=4 February 2018|work=The New York Times|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to point out the lack of people of color in [[Hollywood]] [[movie]]s, through a measure of their importance to a particular movie or the lack of a gratuitous link to white actors.&lt;ref name="2016-02-01_TC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/could-this-be-the-bechdel-test-for-race.html|title=Could This Be the Bechdel Test for Race|accessdate=February 4, 2018|last=Evans|first=Dayna|date=February 1, 2016|work=The Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadia Latif and Leila Latif of ''[[The Guardian]]'' have suggested a series of five questions:
* Are there two named characters of color?
* Do they have dialogue?
* Are they not romantically involved with one another?
* Do they have any dialogue that isn't comforting or supporting a white character?
* Is one of them definitely not [[Magical Negro|magic]]?&lt;ref name="2016-01-19_NL-LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/18/hollywoods-race-problem-film-industry-actors-of-colour|title=How to fix Hollywood's race problem|accessdate=June 20, 2017|last1=Latif|last2=Latif|first1=Nadia|first2=Leila|date=January 18, 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplified version by Nikesh Shukla, already proposed in 2013, asks if "two ethnic minorities talk to each other for more than five minutes about something other than race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shukla|first=Nikesh|title=After the Bechdel Test, I propose the Shukla Test for race in film|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/10/after-bechdel-test-i-propose-shukla-test-race-film|accessdate=November 22, 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tests about nonfiction===
The Bechdel test has also inspired gender-related tests for nonfiction. Laurie Voss, [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of [[npm (software)|npm]], proposed a Bechdel test for software. [[Source code]] passes this test if it contains a function written by a woman developer which calls a function written by a different woman developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=seldo |author=Laurie Voss |number=571453200093437952 |date=27 Feb 2015 |title=Does your project pass the Bechdel test?

The Bechdel test also inspired the [[Finkbeiner test]], a checklist to help journalists to avoid gender bias in articles about [[women in science]].&lt;ref name="CJR 22 March 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brainard |first=Curtis |title='The Finkbeiner Test' Seven rules to avoid gratuitous gender profiles of female scientists |url=http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/finkbeiner_test_gender_gap_fem.php?page=all |accessdate=31 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |date=22 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was originally coined to describe relatively simple [[Wargaming|wargames]] that did not require extraordinary focus to play. The name was then adopted by [[gamer|gamers]] to mean casual, short and easy to play games in general.

== Characteristics ==

Beer and pretzels games vary greatly in [[wikt:theme|theme]] and [[gameplay]], but have a set of common characteristics. Rules are simple and generally explainable in just a few minutes, turns pass quickly and humor is common. Randomness, either in the form of cards of dice is essential. Fortunes may revert quickly and the game often ends suddenly and unexpectedly. Scoring requires very simple calculations.

From a design stand-point, beer and pretzels games are non-trivial to create. They need to have enough depth to encourage repeat play without a stiff learning curve, and need to be enjoyable in quick sessions.&lt;ref name=tabletop /&gt;

'''''Blackbird''''' is a play written in 2005 by Scottish playwright [[David Harrower]]. It was inspired in part by the crimes of [[sex offender]] [[Toby Studebaker]], and depicts a young woman meeting a middle-aged man fifteen years after being sexually abused by him when she was twelve.

David Harrower's ''Blackbird'' is not to be confused with the [[Adam Rapp]] play of the same name.

==Synopsis==
At his workplace, 55-year-old Ray is shocked to be visited by a young woman, 27-year-old Una. Fifteen years earlier, they had a sexual relationship for three months when Una was 12 and Ray was 40; subsequently, Ray had been jailed for three years for [[statutory rape]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://newyorktheater.me/2016/03/18/blackbird-review-child-rape-15-years-later/ "''Blackbird'' Review: Child Rape, 15 Years Later"] by Jonathan Mandell, newyorktheater.me, 18 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, they ran off together, and, while Ray was taking time to compose himself after realizing what he had just done, he left her alone in a motel room. She got worried and left to find him, which led to both of them frantically searching for one another and raising suspicions within the small coastal town where they were staying. Eventually, a couple out walking their dog took Una in and called the police after learning why she was there. Ray was then arrested and imprisoned. Upon his release, he managed to establish a reasonably successful new life under another name, but Una recognized him in a photograph and tracked him down.

Ray takes Una to the office break room, where the two engage in a long and difficult confrontation involving Una's continuing struggles to understand and come to terms with the abuse and her intensely conflicting emotions, which pivot between anger, curiosity, confusion, and even a persistent attachment to Ray, whom Una loved â and she believed that he loved her. The fearful Ray, who is himself trying to forget the past and the potential feelings he had for Una, parries her demanding questions and descriptions of her feelings and experiences, all the while uncertain of her intentions.

==Film adaptation==
A film adaptation of the play titled ''[[Una (film)|Una]]'' premiered in September 2016 at the [[Telluride Film Festival]]. The film stars [[Rooney Mara]] as Una and [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rooney-mara-ben-mendelsohn-star-746600|title=Rooney Mara and Ben Mendelsohn to Star in ''Blackbird''|publisher=Indiewire.com|first=David|last=Rooney|date=5 November 2014|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Academy Of Stage &amp; Screen Combat (BASSC)''' is a British organisation for the tuition and development of [[stage combat]] for [[theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levenson|first=E.|url=http://www.rblandmark.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&amp;SubSectionID=4&amp;ArticleID=1580&amp;TM=83655.09|title=Putting the Fight in Julius Caesar|publisher=The Brookfield Landmark|year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[television]] and [[feature film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332452/fullcredits|title=Troy - Cast &amp; Crew Credits|publisher= IMDB.com|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''The British Academy Of Stage &amp; Screen Combat (BASSC)''' has its roots in the now defunct [[Society of British Fight Directors]].   In the early to mid nineties the [[Society of British Fight Directors]] went through a transitional period, as its focus began to shift towards the teaching of Stage Combat. In 1996, the ''Society of British Fight Directors'' voted to change its name to [[The British Academy of Dramatic Combat (BADC).]]

''The British Academy of Stage &amp; Screen Combat'' was formed in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marysia|first=K.|url=http://www.bassc.org/about/|title=BASSC About Us|publisher=BASSC|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609094631/http://bassc.org/about|archivedate=2009-06-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; many founding members being of the former ''S.B.F.D''. The organisation set about creating its current reputation as the invigorating and driving force behind stage combat in the United Kingdom.

In 1997, British Equity recognised the ''BASSCâs'' Advanced Certificate as a valid qualification for entry onto the Equity Fight Directorsâ Training Scheme and, in 2001, the BASSC was appointed by the Equity Council for the training and assessment of Fight Directors candidates applying to join the Equity Fight Directorsâ Register. The ''BASSC'' is currently respected, both nationally and internationally, as a provider of professional level stage combat training.

Richard Ryan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=R.|url=http://www.stagefight.com/|title= Richard Ryan Official Website|publisher=Stagefight.com|year=  2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed the first Master Teacher of the BASSC. Since then he has gone on to become an established Hollywood Fight Director. His film credits include:  [[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]], [[Troy (film)|Troy]], [[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]], [[Stardust (2007 film)|Stardust]], [[Ironclad (film)|Ironclad]],  [[The Eagle (2011 film)|The Eagle]], [[The Last Legion]],  [[Fallen (1998 film)|Fallen]] &amp; [[The Hammer of The Gods (film)|The Hammer of The Gods]]. As well as television &amp; theatre, his work extends as far as [[video games]]; Notably, he was the Fight/Combat Consultant for the best-selling [[Xbox 360]] game [[Fable 2]] from [[Lionhead Studios]].

==Today==
''BASSC'' teachers can be found at many leading UK Drama &amp; Arts Schools, including the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], [http://www.bcu.ac.uk/conservatoire/acting Royal Birmingham Conservatoire of Music and Acting] , [[East 15 Acting School]], [[London college of Music]], [[Royal Academy of Music]], [[Central School of Speech and Drama]],  [[Italia_Conti_drama_school|Italia Conti]], [[Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama]], [[Drama Studio London|Drama Studio]], [[Fourth Monkey Theatre Company]], [[British American Drama Academy]] and the [[City Lit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wild|first=J.|url= http://www.thecnj.com/camden/082406/edu082406_01.htm |title=Taking a swipe at the traditional subjects|publisher= Camden News Journal|year=  2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classes and Workshops are also held across the UK and are open to the public and other actor/combatants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Girard|first= D.|url=http://regentbackstage.blogspot.com/2009/02/virginia-beach-bash-09-fighting-for.html |title=Virginia Beach Bash '09: Fighting for Film and TV!|publisher= Recent Bacstage|year=  2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''BASSC'' now has training schemes in place which allow for development from Actor/Combatant to Certified Teacher as well as assessment and training of Fight Directors for the Equity register.

==Fight Performance Tests==
For Actor/Combatants, the ''BASSC'' offers 'Fight Performance Tests' in core stage combat weapon systems from the BASSC syllabus.

The test requires actors to perform a dramatic scene containing a stage combat fight, choreographed and taught by a ''BASSC'' certified teacher. Students are marked on both stage combat technique and the acting within the scene. Based upon marks the awards available are: Fail, Pass &amp; Pass with Distinction.

Below is a list of the BASSC core weapon syllabus:

Weapons Systems
*Unarmed Combat
*Single Rapier
*Rapier &amp; Dagger
*Broadsword
*Quarterstaff
*Sword &amp; Shield
*Smallsword
*Knife
*Rapier &amp; Cloak

[[File:Camrose Trophy for Home International Bridge Championships.jpg|thumb|right|The Camrose Trophy]]

The '''Camrose Trophy''' or "The Camrose" is an annual [[Contract bridge|bridge]] competition among open teams representing the [[home nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland: England ([[English Bridge Union|EBU]]), [[Northern Ireland]] (NIBU), [[Republic of Ireland]] (CBAI), [[Scotland]] (SBU) and [[Wales]] (WBU). As such it is the [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#open|open]] [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#team|teams-of-four]] component of the "Home Internationals" organised by [[Bridge Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/Brief%20History.htm "Home Internationals: a brief history"]. By [[Patrick Jourdain]]. Bridge Great Britain. Retrieved 17 December 2013. "The Camrose" is the open teams event.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Berry, 1st Viscount Camrose|Lord Camrose]], owner of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', donated the trophy in 1936 and it was first contested in 1937. The original trophy has been lost and replaced. Because of [[World War II]] the series was interrupted mid-way in 1939 and not resumed until 1946, yet the Camrose is the world's most-played international bridge series.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Beside "The Camrose" (Open flight), the Home Bridge Internationals include annual series for Women from 1950, Juniors from 1971, Under-19 from 1990, and Seniors from 2008.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

==Structure==
Since 2007 there have been six rather than five teams in the competition, to avoid having one team sit out each round. From 2007 to 2009 the sixth team was the defending champion, so there were two teams from the previous year's winning nation. England's second team won in 2009, when it was the final-round host by coincidence.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Since then by design the sixth team is a second team from the final-round host nation, which follows a five-year cycle from Northern Ireland in 2010 to England in 2014. That second representative is named for the national bridge federation; thus "Wales" and "Welsh Bridge Union" both entered in 2011.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Since 2005 a [[round-robin tournament|double round-robin]] is scheduled on two weekends.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; With six teams, each weekend comprises five rounds of three head-to-head matches, a single round-robin. A match is now 32 {{gcb|deal|deals}} scored at [[Duplicate bridge#IMP scoring|IMPs]] and converted to {{gcb|victory|victory points (VP)}}.&lt;ref name=event2011&gt;[http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/Camrose%20Results%202011.pdf "Camrose Trophy 2011"]. Bridge Great Britain. Retrieved 17 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; So every team plays 320 deals in the entire event, 64 against each of its rivals. Before 2005, the teams played head-to-head matches over five weekends.

Before 2007 there were simply five national teams, or four during the 48-year absence by the [[Republic of Ireland]] from 1951 to 1998.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

==Results==
England won both of the completed pre-war and the first 17 post-war contests, through 1962. Only England and Scotland were winners in the 56 renditions before year 2000, including EnglandâScotland ties 1972 and 1973. Ireland first won in 2000 and won four straight beginning 2005.&lt;ref name=winners&gt;[http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/Camrose%20Winners%20List.htm "Archives: Camrose Trophy Winners"]. Bridge Great Britain. Retrieved 17 December 2013. See also sibling pages.&lt;/ref&gt; Wales won its first Camrose in 2011, but now England are again dominant, winning six times in the last eight years. The 2016 contest was won by England.

===Winners by nation===
The competition has been completed 73 times up to 2016.&lt;ref name=winners/&gt; There was an outright winner on each occasion except for 1972 and 1973, when England and Scotland tied for first place.&lt;!--not the 1961 tie that [ref name=winners] lists--&gt; England's count includes a win in 2009 by its second team, "English Bridge Union".&lt;ref name=winners /&gt;

Three times recently (*), the winners have been one of two entries from their countries, namely "Ireland" 2008, "EBU" 2009 (English Bridge Union), and "Wales" 2011. They were the defending champion team, the England "B" team, and the Wales "A" team respectively. Their compatriots were "Hosts Ireland", "England", and "WBU" (Welsh Bridge Union).&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name=scores&gt;[http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/Camrose%20Results%202010.htm "Past Results: Camrose Results 2010"].

==Players==
{{gcb|team|Teams}} competition in bridge requires a minimum of four players on each team; up to two additional players may be added as alternates. Two tables are in play at the same time with the NorthâSouth pair at one table and EastâWest pair at the other table being teammates.

Camrose matches comprise two sets of 16 deals with player substitutions permitted between sets.&lt;ref name=event2011/&gt; Since 2007 the annual event comprises ten matches for each national team; previously there were eight or six matches. All 2011 participants played in 80 to 144 of 160 deals on the second weekend, or five to nine of ten sets (five matches), led by Rex Anderson and David Greenwood who played nine sets for Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=event2011/&gt; Anderson is the career leader with 92 ''matches'' played (through 2011).

'''''Carmageddon TDR 2000''''' (also known as '''''Carmageddon: Total Destruction Racing 2000''''' or '''''Carmageddon 3: TDR 2000''''' in North America), is a [[vehicular combat game|vehicular combat]] [[video game]]. The sequel to ''[[Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now]]'', it was developed by [[Torus Games]] and released in the United Kingdom on September 1, 2000, and on December 14 in North America.

== Description ==
[[image:Carmageddon TDR 2000 in-game screenshot (Windows).png|thumb|left|Driving around the first level, ''The Boulevard'']]
The title is a homage to the inspiration for the ''Carmageddon'' series, ''[[Death Race 2000]]''. As with the other games in the series, one of the most controversial aspects was that [[pedestrian]]s could be killed by immolation (being set on fire) or graphic [[collision]]s that could include [[dismemberment]]. In some countries, the human pedestrians were replaced with [[zombie]]s - actually only changing the red blood to green slime - but [[Patch (computing)|patches]] were circulated on the internet that reverted the game to its original state.

While still part of the game series' canon, the gameplay was not a significant advancement on the original, which resulted in poor sales for the game and blurred the chances of a 4th installment of the series. However, almost 12 years later, a long-awaited 4th installment of the series was announced on the official site, called Carmageddon: Reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carmageddon.com/reincarnation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613083024/http://www.carmageddon.com/reincarnation |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During development of TDR 2000, SCi hired Tozzer.com to create an online comic based on the ''Carmageddon'' video game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tozzer.com/carm/carm.htm Tozzer - the kid, the comic, the movies, the mayhem&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427220318/http://www.tozzer.com/carm/carm.htm |date=2007-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This reference is not a reliable, credible, 3rd-party source but is sufficient as evidence of the comic's existence at least. --&gt;

A [[Game Boy Color]] version of the game was also slated to be released however it was cancelled for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carmageddon.com/history/carmageddon-tdr-2000-game-boy-color |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818120917/http://www.carmageddon.com/history/carmageddon-tdr-2000-game-boy-color |archivedate=2012-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion pack==
''The Nosebleed Pack'' was the official expansion pack for ''TDR2000'' adding new vehicles, environments, powerups and improved multiplayer modes with extra maps. It was later released as a free [[Patch (computing)|patch]]. The soundtrack is by Plague and [[Utah Saints]].

{{about|literary continuators|a 'continuator state' in geopolitics|succession of states}}

A '''continuator''', in [[literature]], is a writer who creates a new work based on someone else's prior text, such as a [[novel]] or novel fragment. The new work may complete the older work (as with the numerous continuations of [[Jane Austen]]'s unfinished novel ''[[Sanditon]]''), or may try to serve as a [[sequel]] or [[prequel]] to the older work (such as [[Alexandra Ripley]]'s ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'', an authorized continuation of [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''). This phenomenon differs from those authors who, because they share a common culture, use characters or themes from a common cultural stock.

==History==
The development of [[Europe]]an classical literature out of the common stock of oral tradition proved conducive to reworkings, revisions, and [[satire]]s. Numerous writers of [[Greece]]'s golden age revived and reworked stories of the [[Trojan War]] and [[Greek mythology]], although they were not strictly continuators as, for the most part, they did not invent or even extrapolate much from the received stories, choosing to alter the tone and treatment rather than the stories.

[[Latin literature]], on the other hand, may be regarded as systematic continuators of Greek models. The pinnacle of [[Augustan literature]], the ''[[Aeneid]]'', is essentially a continuation of the ''[[Iliad]]'': not only in that it follows a minor character from his imagined origins in [[Troy]] to his founding of [[Rome]], but in that it continues a historical ethos. This move, by connecting the Roman empire both culturally and pseudo-historically to the Homeric myth, is commonly viewed as a move by [[Virgil]] to legitimize the Roman empire. For instance, the epic opens with a summary of the progress of Aeneas and his progeny (in [[John Dryden]]'s translation):

&lt;poem&gt;
:Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,
:And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,
:Expel'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.
:Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,
:And in the doubtful war, before he won
:The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;
:His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,
:And settled sure succession in his line,
:From whence the race of Alban fathers come,
:And the long glories of majestic Rome.
&lt;/poem&gt;

[[W. A. Camps]] expresses this common analysis of Virgil when he writes, "There is more than one reminder in the poem that its hero Aeneas is ancestor of Octavian through the supposed descent of [[gens Julia|the Julii]] [i.e., Octavian's family] through Aeneas' son Julius."{{ref|1}}

Like their medieval predecessors, [[Renaissance]] authors drew inspiration from earlier writers. More significantly, the spread of printing, slow increase in literacy, and the development of capitalism conspired to shape a modern concept of text and authorship. In this context, one sees "continuators" in the modern sense: authors either inspired or hired to complete or continue a predecessor's concept. This habit was most noticeable in the most commercialized spheres of literature. [[Elizabethan drama]], for example, is full of examples. As an instance of completion, [[Francis Godolphin Waldron]] completed ''The Sad Shepherd'', a late unfinished play by [[Ben Jonson]]. As an instance of sequel-writing, [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''The Tamer Tamed'' continues and lampoons Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''. Controversial literature was amenable to such continuations, as evidenced most especially by the [[Martin Marprelate]] affair; [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|Arcadia]]'' was continued by [[Anna Weamys]].

The '''Annual Gen Con EN World RPG Awards''' (or '''ENnie Awards''') are annual, fan-based awards for [[role-playing game]] products and publishers hosted at [[Gen Con]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. The name of the award is derived from the [[EN World]] web site that has hosted the awards since their inception in 2001. The ENnies were created by [[Russ Morrissey]] and [[Eric Noah]] and have been run and owned by [[Russ Morrissey]] since 2001.

The awards were initially focused on ''[[d20 System]]'' products and publishers and were a solely [[internet]]-based event (hosted by EN World). They have since broadened their scope to include all forms of roleplaying, and since 2002 have been announced at a live awards ceremony at Gen Con.
 
In 2007, the ENnies were sponsored for the first time by a corporation, [[Your Games Now]]. In 2008 they were sponsored by [http://www.avatarart.com Avatar Art]. In 2010, 2011, and 2012 they were sponsored by both [[Indie Press Revolution]] and [[DriveThruRPG]]. From 2013-2016  they were sponsored by [[DriveThruRPG]].  In 2015, [[Campaign Coins]] made the medals as a sponsorship.  In 2017, [[Lone Wolf Development]] became a sponsor.

The ENnies comprise two rounds. In the first round, publishers submit their products for nomination by that year's five  democratically elected judges. As of 2017, judges have had a two-year term limit, but are permitted to return after a year off. In the second round, the public votes on the nominated products, with the results being presented live at [[Gen Con]].

The '''Irish Music Hall of Fame''' was a multimedia exhibition in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] which opened in September 1999.  It recognised what it described as the best of Irish musical talent of all types over the decades. 

==Overview==
Musician and singer [[Van Morrison]] was the first person to be inducted into the museum. The museum was a memorabilia-filled display telling the story of Irish music through exclusive and personally donated merchandise from many important Irish musical artists including [[Van Morrison]], [[U2]], [[SinÃ©ad O'Connor]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[The Undertones]] and [[Boyzone]].

The museum has since closed and is currently looking for a new location with an undetermined reopening date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u2tour.de/travelguide/guides/en/Hot_Press_Irish_Music_Hall_Of_Fame_closed.html Infos at U2.tour.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Larry Simon''' '''Gelbart''' (February 25, 1928 â September 11, 2009)&lt;ref name="McLellan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-larry-gelbart12-2009sep12,0,2812430.story|title='MASH' writer Larry Gelbart dies at 81|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=2009-09-11|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American television writer, playwright, screenwriter, director and author, most famous as a creator and producer of the television series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and as co-writer of Broadway musicals ''[[City of Angels (musical)|City of Angels]]'' and ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]''.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gelbart was born in Chicago, Illinois, to [[Jewish]] immigrants Harry Gelbart, "a barber since his half of a childhood in [[Latvia]],"&lt;ref name="LaughingMatters"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gelbart | first=Larry | title=Laughing Matters: On Writing MASH, Tootsie, Oh, God!, and a Few Other Funny Things | location=New York | publisher=Random House | year=1998 | isbn=0-679-42945-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Frieda Sturner, who migrated to America from [[DÄbrowa GÃ³rnicza]], [[Poland]]. Marcia Gelbart Walkenstein was his sister.

His family later moved to Los Angeles and he attended [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]]. Drafted shortly after World War Two, Gelbart worked for the [[Armed Forces Radio Service]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-larry-gelbart12-2009sep12,0,2812430.story#axzz2u5iBIuLR |title=Larry Gelbart dies at 81; 'MASH' writer - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=1928-02-25 |accessdate=2014-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Gelbart began as a writer at the age of sixteen for [[Danny Thomas]]'s [[radio]] show after his father, who was Thomas's [[barber]], showed Thomas some jokes Gelbart had written. During the 1940s Gelbart also wrote for [[Jack Paar]] and [[Bob Hope]]. In the 1950s, his most important work in [[television]] involved writing for [[Red Buttons]], for [[Sid Caesar]] on ''[[Caesar's Hour]]'', and in [[Celeste Holm]]'s ''[[Honestly, Celeste!]]'', as well as with writers [[Mel Tolkin]], [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]], [[Selma Diamond]], [[Neil Simon]], [[Mel Brooks]], [[Carl Reiner]] and [[Woody Allen]] on two Caesar specials.&lt;ref&gt;Malarcher, Jay (2003). ''The Classically American Comedy of Larry Gelbart''. Lanham, Md.: The Scarecrow Press. {{ISBN|0-8108-4772-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Gelbart was one of the main forces behind the creation of the television series [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|''M*A*S*H'']], writing the pilot (for which he received a "Developed for Television by __" credit); then producing, often writing and occasionally directing the series for its first four seasons, from 1972 to 1976. ''M*A*S*H'' earned Gelbart a [[Peabody Award]] and an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] and went on to considerable commercial and critical success.

===Films===
Gelbart's best known screen work is perhaps the screenplay for 1982's ''[[Tootsie]]'', which he co-wrote with [[Murray Schisgal]]. He was nominated for an Academy Award for that script, and also was Oscar-nominated for his adapted screenplay for 1977's ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh, God!]]'' starring [[John Denver]] and [[George Burns]]. On his relationship with actor Dustin Hoffman in ''Tootsie'', Gelbart is reported to have said, "Never get involved in a film where the Oscar-winning star is smaller than the statuette." He later retracted this statement, saying that it was just a joke.

He collaborated with Burt Shevelove on the screenplay for the 1966 British film ''[[The Wrong Box]]''. Gelbart also co-wrote the golden-era film spoof ''[[Movie Movie]]'' (1978) starring [[George C. Scott]] in dual roles, the racy comedy ''[[Blame It on Rio]]'' (1984) starring [[Michael Caine]] and the 2000 remake of ''[[Bedazzled (2000 film)|Bedazzled]]'' with [[Elizabeth Hurley]] and [[Brendan Fraser]].

His script for ''[[Rough Cut (1980 film)|Rough Cut]]'' (1980), a caper film starring [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Lesley-Anne Down]] and [[David Niven]], was credited under the pseudonym Francis Burns.

Gelbart-scripted films for television included ''[[Barbarians at the Gate (film)|Barbarians at the Gate]]'' (1993), a true story about the battle for control of the [[RJR Nabisco]] corporation starring [[James Garner]] that was based on [[Barbarians at the Gate|the best-selling book of that name]]; the original comedy ''[[Weapons of Mass Distraction]]'' (1997) starring [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[Gabriel Byrne]] as rival media moguls; and ''[[And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself]]'' (2003) starring [[Antonio Banderas]] as the Mexican revolutionary leader.

===Broadway===
Gelbart co-wrote the long-running [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[farce|musical farce]] ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' with [[Burt Shevelove]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]] in 1962. After the show received poor reviews and box-office returns during its previews in Washington, D.C., rewrites and restaging helped; it was a smash Broadway hit and ran for 964 performances. Its book won a [[Tony Award]]. A film version starring [[Zero Mostel]] and directed by [[Richard Lester]], was released in 1966. Gelbart was critical of the movie, as most of his and Shevelove's [[libretto]] was largely rewritten.

Gelbart's other Broadway credits include the musical ''[[City of Angels (musical)|City of Angels]]'', which won him the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical]], the [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical]], and an [[Edgar Award]]. He also wrote the Iran-contra [[satire]] ''[[Mastergate (play)|Mastergate]]'', as well as ''[[Sly Fox]]'' and a musical adaptation of the [[Preston Sturges]] movie ''[[Hail the Conquering Hero]]'', whose grueling development inspired Gelbart to utter what evolved into the classic quip, "If [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] is alive, I hope he's out of town with a musical."&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{cite news | last = Barthel | first = Joan | title = Life for Simonâ-Not That Simple | newspaper = The New York Times | page = D9 | date = February 25, 1968 }}, cited in

According to Martin Gottfried, when producer Robert Whitehead tried to divert Gelbart by musing about how the ongoing war crimes trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] might turn out, Gelbart shot back, "They ought to send him out of town with a musical." {{cite book | last = Gottfried | first = Martin | title = All His Jazz: The Life and Death of Bob Fosse | publisher = Da Capo | edition = 2nd | date = 2003 | location = New York | page = 128 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5Vr0l7Ux2OAC&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q=eichmann%20%22out%20of%20town%22%20musical | isbn = 978-0-306-81284-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A self-proclaimed '''[[Bon Vivant]]''' and 'Vaudeville's Darkest Muse', He appears regularly on the International Circuit in [[Cabaret]], Burlesque,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burlesquemap.blogspot.com/2012/12/chaz-royal-celebrating-his-10-year.html|title=BURLESQUE MAP LONDON: Chaz Royal: Celebrating his 10 Year Anniversary in Burlesque - Friday 23rd November 2012 at Bush Hall, London|first=Eva|last=Lamour|date=8 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] and has appeared in cities such as Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, New York, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Perth (Australia), Stockholm and Venice. He is much admired and respected for his personal style, unique persona and melancholic live performances.

==Early life==

Le Pustra was born in South Africa and adopted at birth. He was raised in a middle-class family in a small coastal town, and in 2000 he moved to London to pursue a career in [[Musical Theater]] but struggled to find work. He had a few day jobs ranging from an usher at [[Theatre Royal Drury Lane]] in Covent Garden to a kitchen porter in Surrey. There was also a brief stint as a [[Cher]] impersonator on a Cruise Ship, a [[Tarot]] reader in a nightclub and as an 'Extra' in British Soap Operas.

==Le Pustra's Kabarett Der Namenlosen==
In 2016, Le Pustra created a contemporary reimagining of the Cabarets and Nightclubs from 1920's Berlin, entitled '''Le Pustra's Kabarett der Namenlosen'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/berlin-alternative-clubs-nightlife-berghain-lgbt-kabarett-der-namenlosen-ballhaus-porn-karaoke-a7371336.html|title=Berlin's alternative nightlife, from cabaret to porno karaoke|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/babylon-berlin-burlesque-bauhaus-guide|title=From Burlesque to Bauhaus, Hereâs Where to Find the Roaring â20s in Berlin Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''or'' Cabaret of the Nameless featuring selected music from [[Friedrich Hollaender]], [[Mischa Spoliansky]] and [[Kurt Weill]]. The original show was a notorious but popular Cabaret in Weimar-era Berlin from 1926 till 1932 and created by Erich "Elow" Lowinsky. In October 2017, Le Pustra and the cast of Kabarett der Namenlosen performed "[[Das lila Lied]]" for the [[BBC Four]] series ''Tunes for Tyrants: Music and Power with Suzy Klein''.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b097f5vs|title=BBC Four - Tunes for Tyrants: Music and Power with Suzy Klein|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016 and 2017 American Artist, [[Ella Guru]] created two large oil paintings inspired by the show.

[[File:2008 Philippine primetime ratings.PNG|250px|thumb|Primetime ratings for 2008: GMA is blue and ABS-CBN is red; the highest spike refers to the ''[[Marimar (2007 TV series)|Marimar]]'' finale. The spike for GMA's primetime chart on April was the premiere of ''[[Dyesebel (TV series)|Dyesebel]]''. ABS-CBN's two largest spikes come from the finales of ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus]]'' and ''[[Pinoy Dream Academy (season 2)|Pinoy Dream Academy]]''. ]]

The following is a list of '''[[Philippines|Philippine]] [[television]] [[television ratings (audience measurement)|ratings]] for 2008''' coming from [[AGB Nielsen Philippines]].

Mega Manila accounts for about 48% of total TV households in urban Philippines. The Mega Manila and Luzon markets combined account for about 76% of the total TV households in urban Philippines. Non-urban households aren't included in both Mega Manila and NUTAM surveys.

The largest television market is at [[Mega Manila]]; in AGB-Nielsen's case, Mega Manila consists of [[Metro Manila]], [[Bulacan]], [[Rizal]], [[Cavite]] and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]. Metro Manila and other urban areas in the Philippines comprise the National Urban Television Audience Measurement (NUTAM) and are scattered throughout the country.

==National Urban Television Audience Measurement==
In national urbal Philippines, the three [[Manny Pacquiao]] boxing bouts scored the highest ratings, each surpassing 45%, making GMA airing the top three aired programs in urban Philippines.

===Weekly ratings===
Week 1 began on December 30, 2007 and ended on January 5, 2008. The list will be updated every Sunday, when the week ends.

AGB Nielsen defines "non-primetime" as prior to 6:30 pm and "primetime" as after 6:30 pm up to sign-off.

GMA almost swept the weekly non-primetime and primetime races, if not for ABS-CBN's broadcast of the Hatton-Malinggagi bout that beat the GMA programs for the week of November 23â29. ABS-CBN fared better in weekend programming, but generally, ratings during the weekend are lower than their weekday counterparts.

ABS-CBN won the primetime race during these days, all of them occurred during the weekend:
*June 7: Airing of ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus]]: The Big Night''&lt;ref name="Jun 6-10"&gt;TV ratings for the dates [http://www.pep.ph/guide/2078/TV-Ratings-(June-6-10):-Victory-and-death-highlight-weekend-ratings Jun 6-10], ''Philippine Entertainment Portal&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from [[Manny Pacquiao]]'s bouts, two programs starring [[Marian Rivera]], ''[[Marimar (2007 TV series)|Marimar]]'' and ''[[Dyesebel (TV series)|Dyesebel]]'' were the top-rating programs of the year, rating between the high-thirties and the mid-forties; in fact, ABS-CBN closed the gap whenever Marian Rivera's programs are not on-air.

''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' remains the most consistent non-primetime program, despite being challenged by GMA's [[Sine Novela]]s.

No ratings were published on March 20â22 ([[Holy Week]]), August 25 and September 29.

''London 2012'' received "mixed or average reviews" on all platforms according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MCiOS /&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPS3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPC /&gt;&lt;ref name=MCX360 /&gt;

Chris Schilling of [[IGN]] said of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions that "Sega's celebration of the year's biggest sporting event is better than you might expect." In his opinion, the events of both versions would not hold up too well in the long term, but that is not really what an Olympics game is about. He praised the online and offline multiplayer mode.&lt;ref name=IGN /&gt;&lt;ref name=IGN2 /&gt; The German PC game magazine ''[[GameStar]]'' criticized the gameplay, because it is almost impossible to play it with the mouse and the keyboard, so the player is forced to get a gamepad to play ''London 2012''. They also mentioned that the gameplay of the events would not be different from each other and that the [[AI]] of the computer opponents is not balanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wittluski |first1=Thomas |last2=Witt |first2=Malte |date=2 July 2012 |url=https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/london_2012,2569536.html |title=Olympische Spiele: London 2012 im Test - Quicktime-Olympiade |language=German |website=[[GameStar]] |publisher=[[Webedia]] |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Digital Fix'' gave the PS3 version seven out of ten and said it was "a fine example of an Olympics type game. The presentation is excellent, the events are more varied than you might expect and the subtleties of controls mean you'll have a wonderful time as you begin any experience with the game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Luciano |date=24 July 2012 |url=https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/content/1010/london-2012-the-official-video-game/ |title=London 2012: The Official Video Game [of the Olympic Games] Review (PS3) |website=The Digital Fix |publisher=Poisonous Monkey |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612230559/http://gaming.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/1010/london-2012-the-official-video-game.html |archivedate=12 June 2015 |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' gave the Xbox 360 version a similar score of seven out of ten and said it was "Not just an Olympics tie-in but a proper sports game, with the majority of events finding a good balance between realism and enjoyment."&lt;ref name=Metro /&gt; However, ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the same console version three stars out of five and said, "There are lots of events that can be enjoyed time and time again, although far less than the 46 advertised. Motion controls add very little, but do at least offer new ways to experience the game, alongside a plethora of game modes. While London 2012: The Game may fall short of Gold, it's certainly deserving of a respectable Bronze."&lt;ref name=DigitalSpy /&gt;

The game held the top spot of the UK All Format chart for three weeks following its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Burgess |first=Robert |date=14 August 2012 |url=http://www.gamebrit.com/2012/08/14/uk-chart-three-weeks-at-the-top-for-london-2012/ |title=UK Chart: Three Weeks At The Top For London 2012 |website=Gamebrit |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2013, the game has sold 680,000 copies in the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Purchese |first=Robert |date=10 May 2013 |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-10-aliens-colonial-marines-managed-1-31-million-sales |title=Aliens: Colonial Marines managed 1.31 million sales |website=Eurogamer |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7318">The '''Margolis Brown Adaptors Company (MBAC)''' is an internationally touring [[physical theatre]] company that also houses the Margolis Method Training Center now located in [[Highland, Sullivan County, New York|Highland, New York]].  It was established in [[New York City]] in 1984 by Kari Margolis and Tony Brown.  As co-artistic directors, Margolis and Brown have thus far co-authored, directed, and sometimes performed in 16 full-length theatrical productions, as well as numerous site-specific works at such places as the [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[Coney Island]], and the historic [[John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge]] on the [[Delaware River]].

The MBAC were artists in residence at the Brooklyn Arts and Culture Association (BACA) in New York City from 1985 to 1990.  In 1987 they established an independent performance space and [[multimedia]] center in Brooklyn and mounted four original productions there. The company has toured nationally and internationally to Barcelona, Berlin, London, Singapore and throughout Canada and Mexico. The company relocated to [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, in 1993. There they continued to create and produce multimedia theater productions and trained actors in the Margolis Method for over 12 years.  MBAC established an international training center in [[Sullivan County, New York]] in 2005 and divide their time between New York and Minneapolis.  From 2005 thru 2010 the Company divided its time between both sites.  In 2011, the Company and Training Center have moved all operations to the Highland NY site. 

==Performances==
MBAC theatrical productions are collaboratively written original performance works produced by the company.  Productions are characterized by frequent utilization of multimedia and sparse text, thereby relying on unconventional means of dramatic conveyance.  Examples of those alternative dramatic vehicles are projected images, prerecorded or live sound, or an actor's physicality.  In addition, the actors often appear in non-representational dramatic situations.

==Margolis Method==

Margolis has developed a physically based approach to performance called the ''Margolis Method.''  The method, along with 25 years of personal research, takes inspiration from the research of such artists as  [[Etienne Decroux]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], and [[Jerzy Grotowski]]. The method's goal is to analyze and focus the dramatic force and emotion created by an actor's physicality to further the creative and expressive process.  It seeks to empower the actor to work simultaneously as a director, playwright and performer.

The Margolis Method was developed in response to what Margolis saw as a fragmented and ineffective way of teaching actors in America.  Pedagogically, Margolis rejected the notion that actor training could be broken down into separate contexts (''i.e.'': stage "voice" and "movement" classes) and instead suggested that all aspects of actor training are inextricably linked.  Rather than focusing primarily on establishing character through developing the character's psychological motivations and emotional states, Margolis sought ways to approach drama and character from a physical perspective as well.  To accomplish this, Margolis Method focuses on theatrical notions like conflict, timing, and neutrality and employs concepts borrowed from physics, such as inertia, lines of force and density (as well as concrete manifestations of these principles, such as: pendulums, pulleys and elastics).

'''''Minutes to Fame''''' ({{zh|t=æ®é·ä¸å®}}) was a [[game show]]-style [[talent contest]] from [[Hong Kong]]. It was a weekly program presented by [[Television Broadcasts Limited]] (TVB) and broadcast on [[TVB Jade]] in three series from February 2005 to August 2007. The show is intended to be [[satire|satirical]] and funny, since most of the contestants are inexperienced and are trying to get famous.

The show was hosted by [[Hacken Lee]] and [[Joey Leung]] in the first two seasons, who both acted as two of its judges. They were replaced by [[Miriam Yeung]] and [[Sammy Leung]] for the third season. All three seasons featured one or more guest judges in each episode, which varies between episodes.

==Background==
Inspired by the ''[[Idols (TV series)|Idols]]'' franchise, the show gives ordinary [[Hongkongers]] the opportunity to appear as contestants on stage to sing and perform. Its slogan is "å¨åç¡èï¼æ®é·ä¸å®ï¼" (The whole city (Hong Kong) gets excited for the minutes to fame). The show has received top ratings, and the finals of the first series, on 4 June 2005, reached 33 points on the charts. It has led to the creation of several spinoffs by other Chinese television stations, including [[Asia TV]] and [[Guangdong Television]], and to collaboration with other [[mainland Chinese]] television stations to provide contestants for their own shows, such as [[CCTV]]'s [[China Dream]] Show.

The program was among TVB's first to recruit competitors from [[Overseas Chinese|overseas]]. Starting from May 2005, primaries are not only held in Hong Kong, but also in [[Guangzhou]], [[Macau]], [[Toronto]], [[Taipei]], [[Shanghai]], [[Singapore]], [[Sydney]] etc. Similarly, the European branch of TVB, TVB-S Europe, held a Minutes to Fame contest in [[Paris]] and [[Rotterdam]] on August 28, 2005 and August 29, 2005 respectively. The winner of both contests would proceed in a Minutes to Fame special later that year, where contestants from all over the world would compete.

==Format==
Each episode features a number of contestants whose objective is to remain on stage for as long as possible. Their act must involve singing one of eight randomly selected songs for each episode, which includes [[Cantopop]], [[Mandopop]], and even English-language [[popular music]]. Besides singing, contestants may also choose to enhance their act by playing an [[musical instrument|instrument]], [[acrobatics]], [[stage magic|magic]], etc.

At any point during their performance, any of the judges may strike a [[gong]] on the table in front of them, at which point the contestant must stop singing. Their score is determined by the duration of their performance, in seconds, excluding the [[introduction (music)|introduction]], and each second is worth [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]100 in [[prize money]]. At the conclusion of each episode, the contestant with the longest act by duration is the night's winner and qualifies for subsequent rounds, and eventually the final round, "Battle for the King" ({{lang|zh-hk|å®çç­é¸æ°}}).

While the show is meant to be competitive, judges have been harsh to contestants that they "ding" out, and often make fun of them directly. A [[laugh track]] is heavily used instantly whenever one-liners or off-key singing was present, supplementing the [[studio audience]]'s reactions. But sometimes it happens whenever spot-on singing happens if the contestant has an unusual appearance. Note that most Hong Kong variety shows use laugh tracks heavily for network purposes.

On 5 July 1989, she premiered as a cast member of the popular series ''[[Home and Away]]'', on which she played [[Viv Newton|Aviva "Viv" Newton]]. She left the series on 25 May 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krizanovich|first=Karen|title=Is she with you?|journal=TV Guide|date=4â10 November 1989|issue=33|pages=56â57|publisher=Murdoch Magazines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips was sharing a house with [[Justine Clarke]] and began auditioning the week after Clarke had left the serial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Behind the scenes|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=19â25 January 2008|page=13|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips told a writer from ''[[Look-in]]'' that she liked to be kept busy on set. She explained that "people" were often left trying to find her because she was not where she should have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Summer Bay watch|journal=[[Look-in]]|date=13 October 1990|issue=41|page=18|publisher=[[IPC Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips told Graeme Kay from ''BIG!'' that the role had taken up too much of her time and she preferred having a free schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=Graeme|title=Mouche Phillips â she can speak Tahitan!|journal=BIG!|date=5â18 December 1990|issue=49|page=4|publisher=[[EMAP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''NHL 16''''' is an [[ice hockey]] [[simulation video game]] developed by [[EA Canada]] and published by [[EA Sports]]. It is the 25th installment of the [[NHL (video game series)|''NHL'' series]] and was released on September 15, 2015 in [[North America]] and September 17 and 18 in [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. The game was released on [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], with a separate release for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] titled '''''NHL: Legacy Edition'''''. [[Jonathan Toews]] of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] is the official cover athlete, marking his second appearance on an ''NHL'' cover, following ''[[NHL 11]]''.

Featuring game presentation in the style of the [[NBC Sports Network]], ''NHL 16'' runs on EA Sports' advanced [[Ignite (game engine)|Ignite]] game engine and features many game modes, including one that has the player take control of their own custom player and pursuing a career in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and one that has the player play as the manager of any NHL team. The fan-favorite EA Sports Hockey League (EASHL) mode, an online [[co-operative play]] mode, also returns to the game after being left out of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of ''[[NHL 15]]'', the game's predecessor. Upon release, ''NHL 16'' received positive reviews and was declared an improvement over ''NHL 15'' by critics.

==Gameplay==
''NHL 16'' contains several game modes; "Be a GM", where the player controls the general manager of a team of their choice, "Be a Pro", where the player controls their own custom player and progresses his career, Hockey Ultimate Team, where the player collects cards of real-life players, build a team, and then take on either players online or A.I. teams, and EA Sports Hockey League, abbreviated as 
EASHL, a multiplayer-only mode where players can use their own custom player to join other teams, also with custom players controlled by other people, and take on other teams.&lt;ref name="Features"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.easports.com/nhl/news/2015/nhl-16-feature-set | title=NHL 16 Full Feature Set | publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] | date=May 20, 2015 | accessdate=September 21, 2015 | author=Richards, Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHL 16"&gt;{{cite video game | title = ''NHL 16'' | developer = [[EA Canada]] | publisher = [[EA Sports]] | platform = [[PlayStation 4]] / [[Xbox One]] | date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EASHL returns after being dropped from the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] versions of ''[[NHL 15]]''. It features some changes in its progression system to address balance issues, including a switch to a class-based progression model similar to Be a Pro mode, and the removal of attributes and boosts.&lt;ref name=polygon-nhl16beta&gt;{{cite web|title=NHL 16 gets series' first-ever beta next week, for revamped EA Sports Hockey League|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/22/9012567/nhl-16-ea-sports-hockey-league-beta-date-interview|website=Polygon|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A beta for the EASHL mode was available for ''NHL 15'' owners from July 30 to August 10.&lt;ref name=polygon-nhl16beta/&gt;

Other features included are offline and online [[Shootout (hockey)|shootout]] modes, online team play, which has the user take control of players from real-life teams, and online versus, a simple head-to-head match.&lt;ref name="NHL 16"/&gt; Returning to the game is the [[NBC Sports Network]]-style presentation, which features the network's [[score bug]] as well as commentary provided by [[Mike Emrick|Mike "Doc" Emrick]] ([[Play-by-play announcer|play-by-play]]), [[Eddie Olczyk]] ([[Color commentator|color]]), and [[Ray Ferraro]] (ice-side reporter). Emrick and Olczyk's actual selves are present during the pregame intro cutscenes.&lt;ref name="NHL 16"/&gt;

==Cover==
''NHL 16'' did not have a cover vote in contrast to the previous year's iteration. At the 2015 NHL Awards, it was revealed that [[Patrick Kane]] and [[Jonathan Toews]] of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], who had won the [[2015 Stanley Cup Finals]], were selected to be on the cover of the game. It is Toews' second appearance on the cover of an ''NHL'' game, following ''[[NHL 11]]''.&lt;ref name="Toews Cover"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=772078 | title=Blackhawks stars Toews, Kane named cover athletes for 'NHL 16' video game Wednesday, 06.24.2015 / 9:05 PM / News | publisher=[[NHL]] | accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was supposed to be Kane's second appearance as well, following ''[[NHL 10]]'',&lt;ref name="Toews Cover"/&gt; but on August 12 EA Sports announced that Kane would no longer be appearing on the cover of the game in light of the fact he was the subject of a police investigation over a sexual assault allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EA Sports pulls Patrick Kane from 'NHL 16' cover amid reported rape investigation|url=http://nesn.com/2015/08/ea-sports-pulls-patrick-kane-from-nhl-16-cover-amid-reported-rape-investigation/|website=NESN|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.thescore.com/nhl/news/808876|title = Blackhawks' Patrick Kane removed from 'NHL 16' cover amid investigation|date = August 12, 2015|accessdate = August 12, 2015|website = The Score|publisher = |last = Gold-Smith|first = Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''NHL: Legacy Edition''==
''NHL: Legacy Edition'' is an updated version of ''[[NHL 15]]'' for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. There are some minor changes, such as the menu music; however, the EA Sports logo is instead shown for the album arts, the NHL Moments Live from 2013â14 is replaced by some new ones that were made available as the [[2015-16 NHL season]] progressed, and in the "Custom Team" game mode the team name selection is improvised.&lt;ref name="NHL: Legacy Edition"&gt;{{cite video game | title = ''NHL: Legacy Edition'' | developer = [[EA Canada]] | publisher = [[EA Sports]] | platform = [[PlayStation 3]] / [[Xbox 360]] | date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They directed acclaim at the fun gameplay of the game's wide variety of game modes as well as the return of the EASHL mode. Some criticism was aimed mainly at some lack of depth in these game modes as well as the game's menus and interface.

Mat Paget of [[GameSpot]] awarded the game an 8/10. He complimented the content of ''NHL 16''{{'}}s game modes as well as the inclusion of the On-Ice Trainer, which he believes would help brand new players and would work very well in the game's Be A Pro mode. He stated, however, that the game's menus can sometimes be confusing to get around.&lt;ref name="GameSpot review"/&gt; For ''[[Game Informer]]'', Matt Bertz wrote that EA Sports are heading in the right direction with ''NHL 16'', but he felt that they failed to bring any "game-breaking quality" in terms of gameplay. Bertz complimented the game's improved [[artificial intelligence]] system for opposing teams as well as the ''[[NHL on NBC]]'' game presentation.&lt;ref name="GameInformer review"/&gt; Anthony LaBella of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' found the inclusion of several game modes to be positive for the game, but felt that some of them were not thoroughly developed enough. LaBella also enjoyed the revamped EASHL mode as well as the game's presentation.&lt;ref name="GameRev review"/&gt;

[[File:National Theatre of Kosovo.jpg|thumb|''The National Theatre of Kosovo'' - 90s season]]

'''The National Theatre of Kosovo''' ({{lang-sq|Teatri KombÃ«tar}}; {{lang-sr|Narodno pozoriÅ¡te|script=Latn}} / {{lang|sr|ÐÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð´Ð½Ð¾ Ð¿Ð¾Ð·Ð¾ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐµ}}) was founded in 1946 in the city of [[Prizren]], [[Kosovo]]. It is the highest ranked theatre institution in the country which has the largest number of productions. The National Theatre is the only public theatre in Kosovo and therefore it is financed by Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport. This theatre has produced more than 400 premieres which have been watched by more than 3 million spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkrs-ks.org/?page=1,134 Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport - Republic of Kosovo]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Establishment ===
''The National Theatre of Kosovo'' was founded in 1946 in [[Prizren]] and it was the first professional theatre in [[Kosovo]] after the [[World War II]]. In the beginning it was called ''People`s Provincial Theatre'' and it was placed in the âPartizanâ sport center.  This object had a very small stage and did not fulfill the basic requirements for a place which could be used as a theatre. The founders of the first professional theatre in Kosovo were Pavle Vugrinac, Milan and Cica Petrovic who gathered young talented actors willing to work for the theatre and named Shefqet Musliu as their general director.  After the staff was completed with 14 art enthusiasts who delivered two premiers, ''People`s Provincial Theatre'' was officially established on October 7, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Sokoli, Qemal. ''Zhvillimi i Teatrit Kombetar te Kosoves''. Pristina: ''Litografia'', 2006, Pg.13&lt;/ref&gt; The first official show released by this theatre was called âThe sugar ballâ ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]: Topi i sheqeritâ) from the author Glishiq which was followed by 16 other successful premiers and two tours across Kosovo.
In 1946, the theatre was moved to [[Pristina]], where there was a work interruption due to construction of a new theatre facility, meanwhile the young actors working for the theatre spread to search for a job in another active theatre. Two years later, the official rebirth of the theatre was announced by the Ministry of Education and Culture of [[Serbia]] on May 1, 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Sokoli, Qemal. ''Zhvillimi i Teatrit Kombetar te Kosoves''. Pristina: ''Litografia'', 2006, Pg.12&lt;/ref&gt; Milutin Jansic was named general director and the first show to be performed in the new theatre facility in Pristina two years after the pause was âMostâ directed by Dragutin Todic.&lt;ref&gt;Sokoli, Qemal. ''Zhvillimi i Teatrit Kombetar te Kosoves''. Pristina: ''Litografia'', 2006, Pg.14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 the ''Law for People`s Provincial Theatre'' was declared and this made it possible for the theatre to be developed rapidly. There were many new actors who joined the theatre, but in the absence of professional directors, two of them (Abdurrahman Shala and [[Muharrem Qena]]) were trained under the supervision of Dobrica Radenkovic and were turned into successful and famous theatre directors and stage managers.&lt;ref&gt;Zariqi. M. and Jevriqi. D. ''Per dramen dhe teatrin ne gjuhen shqipe ne Kosove'', Jedinstvo. Prishtine:25.04.1980&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years the theatre had very capable general directors such as Azem Shkreli and Ramiz Kelmendi, who developed theatre activity in [[Kosovo]] and made the theatre a very important art institution. In the 90s follow the violent Serbian occupation measures in Kosovo, which affected theatrical activity as well. Right after the war, the name of this theatre was changed from ''Peoples Provincial Theatre'' to ''National Theatre of Kosovo''.&lt;ref name=teatrisite&gt;{{cite web|title=Teatri Kombetar i Kosoves|url=http://www.teatrikombetar.eu/?id=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Narodno pozoriÅ¡te, 1998.png|thumb|National Theatre new facility in Pristina]]

=== National Theatre activity during and after the War of Kosovo ===
From 1981 until the end of the [[Kosovo War]] the theatre has worked under Serbian political pressure, therefore many [[Albanian language|Albanian]] artists were dismissed and parallel educative home-theatres were created. Most of the dismissed artists continued their career in the parallel theatres and some of them today are part of the professional staff of the National Theatre.&lt;ref name="teatrisite"/&gt; In 1999, right after the [[Kosovo War]], the theatre`s name was changed into ''The National Theatre of Kosovo''. During the next 10 years after the war, the theatre has been home to many international and national shows and festivals.  Despite social unrest and political pressures, the National Theatre of Kosovo achieved many creativity prizes in festivals like âSterja`s Festivalâ in [[Novi Sad]], âSmall Experimental Stagesâ in [[Sarajevo]] and many other international theatrical meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Nikoliq, Milan. ''Teatrot e medha dhe te vegjel''. Scetlost,Kragujevc: 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The National theatre organizes many events which make it possible to bring international shows on stage in [[Pristina]]. Some of these very frequented events are: German Week, Frankofonian Week and Swiss Week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akademiaevolucion.com/teatri-kombetar-i-kosoves/ Evolucion Academy - Teatri Kombetar]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educating its personal staff===
In the absence of an accredited institution for the education of the new actors and staff members of the theatre, in the 50s the theatre`s workers established a theatre studio where the new members could be educated and trained according to the needs of the theatre.  This studio lasted for two years and 14 members were trained. This studio no longer exists since now there are professional institutions which do the same job. Later on, the actors and directors attended courses abroad and came back to share knowledge and experiences with other members. Thanks to the big efforts of its members, a couple of years later the National Theatre had its own artists, stage managers, costume and set designers and a qualified staff. An important role had the collaboration of the theatre with the Academy for Theatre and Movies of Serbia and Serbian radio and television. In 1970 was established the Drama Group which offered individual art education to many young art enthusiasts who gave big contributions to the National Theatre. Some of these people who later on became great artists were [[Faruk Begolli]], [[Bekim Fehmiu]], Ekrem Kryeziu, Qemajl Sokoli, [[Enver Petrovci]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Sokoli, Qemal. ''Zhvillimi i Teatrit Kombetar te Kosoves''. Pristina: ''Litografia'', 2006, Pg.17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of the National Theatre in the artistic life of Kosovo==

===Development of performing arts===
The National Theatre is initiator of many festivals and events that increase the competition between performers and performing arts institutions.  The first competition was arranged in the beginning of the 50s and resulted in the collection of original dramas of different kinds with no language restrictions. The results were quite satisfactory because many of the dramas were turned into great shows like âErvehejaâ, âDashuriaâ and âHakmarrjaâ.&lt;ref&gt;Musliu. B.''Repertori dhe disa pyetje teatrore''. Prishtine: Fjala. 1.3.1983&lt;/ref&gt; Except for original dramas, in stage were performed many books by Albanian famous authors. One of them which was very successful was âSikur tÃ« isha djalÃ«â by Haki StÃ«rmilli. In 60s and 70s many authors started writing dramas which would enrich the repertoire of the National Theatre. 
The basics of dramatic creativity were established with the permanent competition âKatarina Josipi-KATIâ which holds the name of the famous actress [[Katarina Josipi]]. This competition brings on stage many art pieces which have a large number of audience members and fill the gaps of theatrical creativity in the National Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Sokoli, Qemal. ''Zhvillimi i Teatrit Kombetar te Kosoves''. Pristina: ''Litografia'', 2006, Pg.93&lt;/ref&gt;  Except for different kinds of dramas, in stage were put even some poems like âZogu i diellitâ by Din Mehmeti and âTrungu Ilirâ by Sabri Hamiti.&lt;ref&gt;Sokoli, Qemal. ''Zhvillimi i Teatrit Kombetar te Kosoves''. Pristina: ''Litografia'', 2006, Pg.94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramadani, Musa. ''Fjala ne skene''. Prishtine: Rilindja, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of art criticism===
Magazines and newspapers like âRilindjeâ, âJedinstvoâ, âTanâ, âBota e reâ, âZÃ«riâ, âPolitikaâ and Radio-Television of Prishtina had a very important role on promoting the National Theatre activity and attracting art criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Ramadani,M. ''Teatri dhe kritika''. Prishtine: Rilindja, 1.9.1981&lt;/ref&gt; Many art critics focused on the performances of the theatre and published their opinions which influenced the popularization of the scenic art. Some of the critical books published on the National Theatre are âKur ndizen dritatâ by Vehap Shita and âFjala ne skenÃ«â by Musa Ramadani.&lt;ref&gt;Shita, Vehap. ''Skena Shqipetare''.Prishtine: Jeta e Re, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ballet troupe.jpg|thumb|Ballet troupe performing ''Flights towards the light'' at the National Theatre]]

==Internal organization of the theatre==
This institution has five organizational units.
*Albanian drama
*Serbian drama (which does not function since 1999)
*[[Kosovo Ballet]]
*Technical sector
*General sector no. 10
Except for its units, the National Theatre has its branches like theatre council, artistic board and bylaws like statute and rules of procedure. Since the National Theatre is a public institution it has never been self-financed but it is supported by Educational-Cultural Community, Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport and other artistic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sokoli, Qemal. ''Zhvillimi i Teatrit Kombetar te Kosoves''. Pristina: ''Litografia'', 2006, Pg.98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperation with other institutions==
Since its establishment, the National Theatre has cooperated with many institutions which have contributed in its expansion and promotion. The theatre is still cooperating with theatres in Albania, Poland, Turkey, England and many other countries.  The always was a very close cooperation with the Radio of Prizren and Radio of Prishtina ever since 1973. They shared directors, interpreters and technicians and realized radio dramas and radio comedies together.&lt;ref name="Sokoli, Qemal 2006, Pg.97"&gt;Sokoli, Qemal.

===Cooperation with other theatres===
The National Theatre as the leading theatrical institution has many connections with other theatres in Kosovo like Oda Theatre, Dodona Theatre and theatres in [[Prizren]], [[PeÄ|Peja]], [[Gjakova]], [[Ferizaj]], and [[Kosovska Mitrovica|Mitrovica]]. It has been part of many festivals and its directors have been jury in important cultural events like âTrebinjaâ and Kullaâ.&lt;ref&gt;Sokoli, Qemal. ''Zhvillimi i Teatrit Kombetar te Kosoves''. Pristina: ''Litografia'', 2006, Pg.95 and 96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooperation with the cinematography of Kosovo===
Since the National Theatre and the Cinematography Entrepreneurship of Kosovo have been established at the same day, October 7, 1945 at the same place, [[Prizren]], their activity is associated in many areas. In the first decades this cooperation has been developed mainly in the film studios of [[Beograd]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;Musliu. B. ''Teatrot dhe komunikimi i tij''. Prishtine: Fjala, 15.9.1985&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, many actors from  the National Theatre like KristÃ« Berisha, [[Muharrem Qena]] and Shani Pallaska  have played in movies like âEshaloni Dr.M.â, âKapiten Lleshiâ, âQerim hesapeshâ, and âJeta e minatorÃ«veâ. With the establishment of âKosova Filmâ the cooperation is very close and the result are very successful movies like âUka i BjeshkÃ«ve tÃ« Nemunaâ and âTreni pÃ«r Berlinâ.&lt;ref name="Sokoli, Qemal 2006, Pg.97"/&gt; Since the actors of the theatre were the most professional actors in the place, they were often asked to play in movies despite form acting on stage so the National Theatre had a very important role on the development of cinematography.&lt;ref&gt;Sokoli, Qemal. ''Zhvillimi i kinematografise ne Kosove''. Beograd:1983&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shows ==
The repertoire of ''The National Theatre'' consists of many dramatic shows from national and international directors. The shows produced in this theatre have been part of many international festivals where they got art awards and very good comments from many well-known art critics. Until 1989 this theatre has produced more than 400 premieres and around 10.000 replays. These shows have been watched from more than 3.200.000 people in Kosovo and abroad. Except for shows made in Albanian language, this theatre has produced many shows in [[Serbian language]] and other [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref name="teatrisite"/&gt;

'''''Neuroshima Hex!''''' is a Polish [[Military tactics|tactical]] [[board game]] based on the ''[[Neuroshima]] [[role-playing game]]''. It is published by [[Wydawnictwo Portal]] (Portal Publishing House). The game is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as its RPG counterpart.

== Gameplay ==

Neuroshima Hex is played on a [[hexagonal]] [[board game|board]]. Each player periodically draws from a deck of hexagonal [[Playing card|cards]] called "tiles." Tiles symbolize different types of military units. Annotations on the tiles denote the combat strength of each unit. Each player has one special tile called HQ (headquarters). Players take turns placing their tiles on the board. The player chooses:
* which tile from their hand to play,
* where to place the tile on the board, and
* what orientation the tile should have. Being hexagonal, there are six possible orientations for placing each tile.
Normally a card does not move once placed on the board. Periodically a tile is played that initializes combat. At that time, cards are removed from the board based on the outcome of combat between pairs of nearby opposing cards. The game is nominally concluded when all tiles from the deck have been exhausted. The winner is determined by which HQ has taken the least combat damage.

[[Image:Neuroshima HEX.jpg|400px]]

There are three major categories of tiles in each player's deck:
* One tile representing HQ. This is always drawn and placed on the board by each player first. Other than HQ, the remaining tiles are sorted randomly in the deck.
* ''Units'' (also called "soldiers") are tiles representing military units. Annotations on a Unit card denotes its combat strength:
** how much damage does that unit inflict on enemy units
** whether that damage can only be done to adjacent tiles ("melee attack" markings) or more distant tiles ("ranged attack") markings
** in what direction that damage takes place (annotations on multiple sides of the hexagon denote the ability to attack in multiple directions simultaneously)
** "toughness," meaning how much damage can a unit sustain before it is withdrawn from the playing board
** special abilities such as defense from ranged attack, or the ability prevent an enemy unit from attacking entirely (so-called "net" units)
* ''Modules'' are tiles that augment the abilities of adjacent cards:
** increasing the strength of their attack
** increasing the range of their attack
** increasing their toughness (ability to withstand attacks)
** increasing the priority of their attack in the attack sequence of all the other tiles on the board (tiles take turns attacking one another based on another set of markings on each tile)
** healing damaged tiles
** allowing a tile to be relocated after being placed on the board

At the start of each player's turn, they draw three tiles at random from their deck. One tile must be discarded. The remaining two tiles may be placed on the board. Tiles cannot be placed on top of other tiles. The player may opt to discard more than one tile. Players take turns in this fashion until the board is partially populated with tiles. Randomly a player may draw a tile that allows the player to initiate combat. When this occurs, gameplay pauses while combat is resolved. Annotations on the tiles denote what priority each card has in the combat sequence. Cards marked with a "3" have first priority, "2" second priority, and "1" third priority. In other words, tiles marked with a "3" get to attack first. Once the outcome of those attacks are resolved (i.e., "dead" units are removed from the board) then tiles marked with a "2" get to attack, and so on. Once all phases of combat (phases 3, 2, 1, 0) have concluded normal gameplay resumes.

The objective of the game is to attack the enemy's HQ. Each HQ starts with 20 [[Health (gaming)|hit points]]. Gameplay concludes when one HQ is down to 0 hit points, or when all the tiles have been exhausted from a player's deck. The winner is determined by the player's HQ that has the most remaining hit points.

The game offers four armies (denoted by four different color schemes for tiles) which differ in their strength, mobility and flexibility, as denoted by differing annotations on each army's tiles. Normally the game is played by two players, though three and four player variations exist.

As a card game, Neuroshima Hex is essentially a much more complex version of [[War (card game)|War]]. In terms of strategy, Neuroshima Hex is similar to [[chess]] in that play emphasizes correct placement of pieces on the board, with occasional combat removing pieces from the board. The game is also available as a video game, with rules essentially identical to the board game, albeit with combat between tiles automated via software.

[[File:HOTanagerRediscoveredBookshopPoetrySlam.jpg|thumb|H. O. Tanager [[performance art|performs]] at a bookstore in Boise, Idaho.]]
'''Performance poetry''' is [[poetry]] that is specifically composed for or during a [[Performance art|performance]] before an audience. During the 1980s, the term&lt;ref&gt;The term originated with an art school graduate and later creative writing P h.D. who wanted to distinguish her public poetry performances from performance art in advertisements and while writing for the ''Austin Chronicle''. ''Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street.'' Slough Press, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4276-0475-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; came into popular usage to describe poetry written or composed for performance rather than print distribution, mostly open to improvisation.

==History==
The term ''performance poetry'' originates from an early press release describing the 1980s performance poet [[Hedwig Gorski]], whose audio recordings achieved success on [[spoken word]] radio programs around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Lesley. ''Voicing American Poetry: Sound and Performance from the 1920s to the Present''. Cornell U P, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Her band, East of Eden Band, was described{{By whom|date=January 2016}} as the most successful at music and poetry collaborations, allowing cassettes of her live radio broadcast recordings to stay in rotation with popular underground music recordings on some radio stations. Gorski, an art school graduate, tried to come up with a term that would distinguish her text-based vocal performances from [[performance art]], especially the work of performance artists, such as [[Laurie Anderson]], who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture. ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' newspaper, printing Gorski's bi-weekly "Litera" column, first published the term "performance poetry" to describe the work of Gorski with composer [[D'Jalma Garnier]] III as early as 1982. She began using the term, however, to describe a 1978 "neo-verse drama" and "conceptual spoken poetry for five voices" titled ''Booby, Mama!'' that employs the cut-up method made popular by [[William Burroughs]] and [[conceptual art]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;''Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street''. College Station, TX: Slough Press, 2007, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-4276-0475-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Endowment for the Arts]] categorized performance art within the visual arts judging panels; it originally placed performance poetry within the category of theater before correcting it to literature in the 21st century. Since many performance poets did not have publications, the former classification made performance poets categorically ineligible for the NEA fellowship funding or recognition. Their audio cassettes were not acceptable sample material for literature grant consideration. A stated objection to this presentation method protested their performance poems translated into text on paper could not compete with poetry written for print publication. The National Endowment for the Arts is now accepting varied presentations for publication verification for poetry fellowship applicants, including audio recordings that have no printed versions of the poems. Performance poetry with music peaked during the 1980s just as performance art peaked in the 1970s.

During that time, San Francisco and New York were the centers for this type of activity; however, [[Austin, Texas]] (The [[Third Coast]]) also had a thriving scene during the 1980s with a coterie of unique characters. Some of the best{{Says who|date=January 2016}} original Austin performance poets and performing poets who went on to national and international notoriety include Raul Salinas, [[Konstantyn K. Kuzminsky]], Joy Cole, [[Hedwig Gorski]], [[Roxy Gordon]], Ricardo Sanchez, [[Harryette Mullen]], who was nominated for the National Book Award. The Austin Poets Audio Anthology Project, a public arts project, recorded them for radio broadcasts. There were many others, though, and Hedwig Gorski once wrote in "Litera" that some were "eerie", a word used by one newspaper reviewer to describe Gorski's vocals on the East of Eden Band track "There's Always Something That Can Make You Happy".  Other performing writers in the robust literary scene of the Austin area during that time when performance poetry turned into a school of poetry included Pat Littledog, Eleanor Crockett, Jim Ryan, Chuck Taylor, Greg Gauntner, [[Albert Huffstickler]], [[W. Joe Hoppe]], Andy Clausen, poet and playwright [[Isabella Russell-Ides]] (''Getting Dangerously Close To Myself'', Slough Press)  and [[David Jewell (poet)]]; most recorded on [[Hedwig Gorski]]'s audio anthology project.

Jewell deserves special mention as a transitional figure, younger than the aforementioned, and one not especially rooted in the Beats like Gorski who has strong connections to [[Ginsberg]], [[Gregory Corso|Corso]], [[Gary Snyder]], and others. By the 1990s the general poetry public was less interested in the Beat Poets of the 1950s and 1960s. They were looking for something fresher, newer, hipper, more in touch with the times in which they were living. Performance poets established clubs, cafes, and media as venues that later became stages for the emerging slam poetry scene. Unlike Gorski, who with East of Eden Band, began broadcasting live performance poetry on [[radio]] &lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Lesley. ''Voicing American Poetry: Sound and Performance from the 1920s to the Present. Cornell U P, 2008.''&lt;/ref&gt; and distributing the recordings of these broadcasts in place of publishing in print, Jewell and [[Poetry slam|slam]] poets were more interested in small live audiences. Venues like [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]] in [[New York City]] and mass media formats, like Gorski's and [[John Giorno]]'s, form the two lines of influence leading to [[Def Poetry]] on [[HBO]].
[[File:Galway Kinnell at Grindstone Cafe.jpg|173px|thumbnail|right|[[Galway Kinnell]] performing a poetic piece in [[Vermont]]]]
Performing poets-writers and especially performance poets excelled in the ability to put the event of oral literature into the primary social/communicative function for literature. The plurality of the literary performance is under the control of the poet/writer, and the performer never minimizes the participation of the [[audience]] members. It is important to remember that performance was the primary distribution method for poetics since tribal times and ancient [[Greece]]. As Gorski often states, broadcast and technology surpass books in reaching mass audiences for poetry, and just as writing poetry for print made poetry a completely different artform since the invention of the [[book]], audio "mediums influence the way poets write just as they do painters and sculptors".&lt;ref&gt;http://hedwiggorski.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, performance poetry is also being used as a means to promote literacy in public school systems. Global Writes Inc. has been incorporating technology, such as videoconferencing and podcasts, into literacy programs as a means for students to share their poetry. Performance poetry also provides avenues for students to perform their poems onstage. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalwrites.org/what-we-do/|title=What We Do|work=Global Writes|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry in oral cultures==
Performance poetry is not solely a [[postmodern]] phenomenon. It began with the performance of oral poems in pre-literate societies. By definition, these poems were transmitted orally from performer to performer and were constructed using devices such as repetition, [[alliteration]], [[rhyme]] and [[kenning]]s to facilitate memorization and recall. The performer "composed" the poem from memory, using the version they had learned as a kind of mental template. This process allowed the performer to add their own flavor to the poem in question, although fidelity to the traditional versions of the poems was generally favored.

==Advent of printing==
Although popular works, including popular poems or collections of poems, were already being distributed for private reading and study in manuscript form, there can be little doubt that the introduction of cheap printing technologies accelerated this trend considerably. The result was a change in the poet's role in society. From having been an entertainer, the poet became primarily a provider of written texts for private readings. The public performance of poetry became generally restricted, at least in a European context, to the staging of [[Theatre|plays]] in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] and occasionally, for example in the cases of the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[madrigal (music)|madrigalists]] or [[Robert Burns]], as texts for singing. Apart from this, the performance of poetry was restricted to reading aloud from printed books within families or groups of friends.

==20th century==
The early years of the 20th century saw a general questioning of artistic forms and conventions. Poets like [[Basil Bunting]] and [[Louis Zukofsky]] called for a renewed emphasis on poetry as sound. Bunting in particular argued that the poem on the page was like a musical score; not fully intelligible until manifested through sound. This attitude to poetry helped to encourage an environment in which poetry readings were fostered. This was reinforced by [[Charles Olson]]'s call for a poetic line based on human breath. [[Clive Sansom]] devoted much of his life to gathering and contributing poetry and drama particularly suited to performance by children.

During the 1950s, the American poet [[Cid Corman]] began to experiment with what he called oral poetry. This involved spontaneously composing poems into a tape recorder. [[Allen Ginsberg]] was to take up this practice in the 1960s. [[David Antin]], who heard some of Corman's tapes, took the process one step further. He composed his ''talk-poems'' by improvising in front of an audience. These performances were recorded and the tapes were later transcribed to be published in book form. Around the same time, [[Jerome Rothenberg]] was drawing on his ethnopoetic researches to create poems for ritual performances as [[happening]]s. Perhaps most famously, the writers of the [[Beat generation]] were noted for performance events that married poetry and [[jazz]]. Also in the late 1960s, other poets outside San Francisco and New York City were experimenting with performance pieces. Notable among these was David Franks, at the time a faculty member at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]. Franks' work was not poetry recited to a musical counterpoint but literary pieces in which the performance was a necessary and integral part of the work itself.

In [[British literature|Britain]], sound poets like [[Bob Cobbing]] and [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] were exploring the possibilities of live performance. Cobbing's groups Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle involved collaborative performance with other poets and musicians and were partly responsible for drawing a number of the poets of the [[British Poetry Revival]] into the performance arena.

Meanwhile, many more mainstream poets in both Britain and the [[Poetry of the United States|United States]] were giving poetry readings, largely to small academic gatherings on university campuses. Poetry readings were given national prominence when [[Robert Frost]] recited "The Gift Outright" from memory at the inauguration of [[John F. Kennedy]][http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/robert-frost-reads-at-jfks-inauguration].After that event, spoken word recordings of Frost and other major figures enjoyed increased popularity.

==The 1970s and after==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2016}}By the 1970s, three main forms of poetry performance had emerged. First was the poetry reading, at which poems that had been written for the page were read to an audience, usually by the author. Poetry readings have become widespread and poetry festivals and reading series are now part of the cultural landscape of most Western societies. However, most people would not consider the poetry readings of this type as part of the performance poetry phenomena.

This leaves three types of poetry performance: poems written specifically for performance on the [[Jerome Rothenberg]] model and poems like those of [[David Antin]] that are composed during performance. Both these types would generally be considered to constitute performance poetry. Another type based on the Beat method of reading their print poems is poetry with music. The bands with performance poets make spoken vocals an exercise in not singing, but the texts are not categorized as songs. While Ginsberg sang his Blake songs with a harmonium, the original practitioner of this third and most popular type of performance poetry is [[Hedwig Gorski]], who coined the term performance poetry to describe her work with music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hedwiggorski.com]&lt;/ref&gt; She is sometimes called a neo-beat, but considers herself an American "[[futurist]]". Unlike the [[Beat generation|Beats]], Ginsberg and Kerouac, her poems were written for performance with music that was specifically composed for the poems. Her spoken vocals have come as close to singing as possible without really singing. That is the key to Gorski's performance poetry: the marriage of poetry to music written specifically to fit poems written for vocal performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://eastofedenband.com&lt;/ref&gt; The other type of performance poetry Gorski practiced is without music and tied to [[conceptual art]], but that was at appearances in smaller venues that could not accommodate her band.&lt;ref&gt;Documented in JAST during an interview with Robert Creeley on TV, ''Austin Chronicle'', and http://hedwiggorski.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike Antin and Cormin, Gorski never improvised text but wrote poetry only for performance while eschewing printed poetry.

In the U. S., the rise to prominence of the [[Language poets|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]] poets with their distrust of speech as a basis for poetry has, broadly speaking, meant that performance poetry went out of fashion with the ''[[avant-garde]]''. However, the increasing popularity of open mics, which allow "unknown" poets to take the stage and share their own work in 3- to 5-minute increments and of [[poetry slam]]s has meant that performance poetry is now one of the most widespread forms of popular poetry. Chief among the proponents of these new forms of popular poetry were [[Bob Holman]] in New York, [[Marc Smith (American poet)|Marc Smith]] in [[Chicago]] and [[Alan Kaufman (writer)|Alan Kaufman]] in [[San Francisco]].  In the 1990s, the Favorite Poem project of then U.S. Poet Laureate [[Robert Pinsky]] gave new visibility to ordinary Americans reading and performing their favorite poems. Contemporary performance poets are now experimenting with poetry performances adapted to CD, to video, and to Web audiences.

The Beat Poets were the first to popularize crossing over into recorded media to distribute their performed poetry. The best-known Beat poet, [[Allen Ginsberg]], followed the lead of fellow Beat, [[Jack Kerouac]], in reciting his work for audio recording. Ginsberg always used music with his readings and often accompanied himself on the [[Pump organ|harmonium]]. Ginsberg put [[William Blake]]'s poems to music and performed them with the harmonium. Even though the Beats did not use the term "Performance Poetry" to categorize their work with music and audio recordings, the Beats provided an immediate model for the work of [[Hedwig Gorski]]. She is a Nova Scotia College of Art and Design art school graduate in 1976. The art school was infamous for starting the careers of numerous 1970s performance artists, such as [[Vito Acconci]], known for photographing his bites. It is worth noting that Gorski, who coined the term "Performance Poetry" to describe her poems written only for performance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hedwiggorski.com]&lt;/ref&gt; recordings, and broadcast usually with her musical band East of Eden Band,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastofedenband.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is the only woman, besides Patti Smith, in this group of late twentieth-century innovators reviving [[oral poetry]]. Similar to the ancient bards, touring became a widespread means for performance poets and slammers to distribute their work since the 1990s. The [[Poetry Slam]] is a competitive live performance format founded by poet [[Marc Smith (American poet)|Marc Smith]] in Chicago, which has become a hotbed for performance poetry.

Performance poetry has also been boosted considerably by the appearance of [[Def Jam]]âthe [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] recording company helmed by [[Russell Simmons]]âon the scene.  def jam has created a [[Def Poetry|television show]] that showcases performance poets that runs on [[HBO]], as well as a show of performance poets that ran on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] for almost a year and won a [[Tony Award]].

[[Hispanic]] performing artists, such as [[Pedro Pietri]], [[Miguel AlgarÃ­n]], [[Giannina Braschi]], and [[Guillermo GÃ³mez-PeÃ±a]], are known for their humorous and politically charged attacks against American imperialism.  Later contemporary [[Latino]] poets such as [[Willie Perdomo]], [[Edwin Torres (poet)]] and [[Caridad de la Luz]] would follow in this tradition.

Closely tied to [[Chicano]] poets is the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] poet [[John Trudell]] who recorded and crossed over with his poetry and music [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]]. Trudell arose from the persecution on his reservation by [[FBI]] agents, who allegedly killed his wife and children. Protest is significant with the [[minority group|minority]] practitioners of performance poetry, such as def poets and slammers. This adds to the vitality of American performance poetry and connects to the social protest of [[Beat poets]] like [[Allen Ginsberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ake.hacettepe.edu.tr/Install/JASTFiles/jast27.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328094817/http://www.ake.hacettepe.edu.tr/Install/JASTFiles/jast27.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }} TV interview 1982 [[Hedwig Gorski]] and [[Robert Creeley]] discuss Beats in the context of performance poetry.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], [[:fr:Lucien Suel]], [[:fr:Akenaton (performer)|Akenaton]], and many other represents the way of performance poetry ...

==The United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, where the influence of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E was more limited, many ''avant-garde'' poets are deeply committed to continuing the performance of Cobbing and his peers. Well-known names include [[cris cheek]] and [[Aaron Williamson]]. The work of UK poet [[Michael Horovitz]] in spreading this tradition in Britain during the early 1960s should also be acknowledged. His ''Live New Departures'' - a touring version of his poetry and arts journal ''New Departures'' (launched 1959) - gave space and opportunities to poets like [[Pete Brown]] and [[Adrian Mitchell]] as these three principals combined performed verse with the backing of jazz musicians like pianist [[Stan Tracey]] and saxophonist [[Bobby Wellins]]. However, the emergence of performed poetry as a popular art form can probably be linked to Allen Ginsbergâs stunning performance at the Albert Hall in 1965 at the [[International Poetry Incarnation]]. Horovitz, Brown and Mitchell would join Ginsberg and Beat colleagues Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso and other European poets at that landmark London occasion. These developments were also connected to the emergence of the [[Liverpool Poets]], which referred mainly to the poets [[Roger McGough]], [[Adrian Henri]] and [[Brian Patten]] who fired up audiences across the UK in the 70s and then the likes of [[John Hegley]] emerged in the 80s, influenced as much by [[stand-up comedy]] as a love for wordplay, creating the template for what became recognised as contemporary British performance poetry - a format still exemplified by the work of acts such as [[Murray Lachlan Young]], [[Francesca Beard]] and Gerard McKeown. [[Apples and Snakes]], a collective promoting performance poetry in pubs and at festivals, was started by Mandy Williams, PR Murry and Jane Addison in London in 1982 inspired by the work of New Variety/CAST. They worked with 'ranting poets' such as [[Attila the Stockbroker]] and Seething Wells and other poets and musicians with a political message such as [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]]. Apples and Snakes continues today, 31 years later, as a national organisation. In the 90s, however, in big cities like Manchester and London, a different style emerged that was influenced more by hip hop with much less emphasis on comedy in the manner of Def Poets in the United States. Well-known writers from this evolution include [[Lemn Sissay]] and the late [[Dike Omeje]] from the [[Manchester Performance Poetry Circuit|Manchester scene]] and [[Roger Robinson (poet)|Roger Robinson]] and [[El Crisis]]  from the [[London Performance Poetry Circuit|London circuit]].

On the experimental front, a number of new initiatives have grown around collaborative stage work using poetry and movement. ''ShadoWork'', for instance, aims to 'disrupt and enrich the conventional regimes of [[author]], [[Book|text]] and [[audience]]' by combining (simple) [[Theatre|theatrical]] movement with the full range of [[Human voice|voice]] and [[Theatre|stage]] in ways designed to draw deeper attention to the text.  Developments such as ''ShadoWork'' represent a 'counter-cultural' mode of performance poetry which shuns bald entertainment value, and others such as the ''Tell Tales'' initiative and Jonzi D's ''Lyrikal Fearta'' (which he calls choreo-poetry&lt;ref&gt;"A specialist in a form of theatre that he dubs choreo-poetry, Jonzi D has no qualms about shaping what was a street-based art form for the stage."[http://www.timeout.com/london/dance/features/4646/-Breakin_Convention--preview.html]&lt;/ref&gt;) go even further, extending spoken word to short prose productions and fusing performance poetry with dance.

British performance poetry continues to thrive at a grassroots level, with performances in [[Public house|pubs]] and [[theatre]]s, as well as at [[arts festival]]s such as [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] and The [[Edinburgh]] Fringe. Slams as well as open mics for more traditional writers remain popular. Media works influenced by radio performance poet [[Hedwig Gorski]] have gained ground;&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Wheeler, Voicing American Poetry: Sound and Performance from the 1920s to the Present. Cornell University Press, 2008. pg 172. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-7442-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been some crossover into TV and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/poetry_slam.shtml|title=BBC Radio 4 - Poetry Slam 2007|author=BBC|publisher=|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary British performance poets have been influenced by [[Punk subculture|punk]] poets like [[John Cooper Clarke]] and [[reggae]] poets like [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]] as well as by comedy and hip hop. In 2003 the first UK conference of performance poetry, organised by Lucy English, was held at [[Bath Spa University]]. Speakers included performing poets from the United States [[Bob Holman]] and [[Charles Bernstein]]. [[Bath Spa University|Bath Spa]] university runs a performance poetry module as part of its Creative Writing programme.

'''Premier Parks, LLC''' (formerly '''Rapids Holdings, LLC''' and '''Premier Attractions Management, LLC''') is a [[limited liability company]] based in the United States. The company owns and operates several [[amusement park]]s and [[water park]]s across the country.

==History==
Kieran Burke and Gary Story previously held the positions of [[chief executive officer]] and [[chief operating officer]] at [[Six Flags]] for more than 10 years. In 2009, the pair purchased [[Nashville Shores]], consisting of a marina, [[RV park]] and water park. They redeveloped the water park for the 2010 season. In early 2011, it was announced the pair had purchased the Ocean Breeze Waterpark in Virginia with plans to renovate it for the 2011 season.&lt;ref name="Former Six Flags executives Breeze into Virginia"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Former Six Flags executives Breeze into Virginia|journal=Park World Magazine|date=January 20, 2011|url=http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1894/Former_Six_Flags_executives_Breeze_into_Virginia.html|accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the newly founded Premier Attractions Management began operating three properties owned by [[CNL Lifestyle Properties]]: [[Frontier City]], [[SplashTown Houston]], and [[White Water Bay (Oklahoma)|White Water Bay]]&lt;ref name="CNL announces new management for eight parks"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CNL announces new management for eight parks|journal=Park World Magazine|date=January 25, 2011|url=http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1897/CNL_announces_new_management_for_eight_parks.html|accessdate=November 24, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005033/http://www.parkworld-online.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1897/CNL_announces_new_management_for_eight_parks.html|archivedate=December 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNL Lifestyle Properties had terminated its lease agreements with [[PARC Management]] for eight parks in late 2010.&lt;ref name="CNL Lifestyle Properties and PARC Management End Lease Relationship"&gt;{{Cite press release|title=CNL Lifestyle Properties and PARC Management End Lease Relationship|url=http://www.cnllifestylereit.com/resources/docs/CNL-Lifestyle-Properties-Ends-PARC-Leases.pdf|accessdate=November 24, 2013|date=November 24, 2010|publisher=CNL Lifestyle Properties}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke and Story have since gained operational control of additional parks owned by CNL Lifestyle Properties.&lt;ref name="Premier Parks to take over operation of Wet ânâ Wild Hawaii"&gt;{{cite news|last=Silverstein|first=Stephanie|title=Premier Parks to take over operation of Wet ânâ Wild Hawaii|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2013/11/21/premier-parks-to-take-over-operation.html|accessdate=November 23, 2013|newspaper=Pacific Business News|date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNL Lifestyle Properties acquires one of south Florida's largest water parks"&gt;{{Cite press release|title=CNL Lifestyle Properties acquires one of south Florida's largest water parks|url=http://www.cnllifestylereit.com/resources/docs/CNL_Lifestyle_Properties_Acquires_Rapids_Water_Park.pdf|accessdate=November 24, 2013|date=July 2, 2012|publisher=CNL Lifestyle Properties}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the company changed its name to Premier Parks, LLC taking the former corporate name of the company that had bought out Six Flags .&lt;ref name="Wet'n'Wild Phoenix, Hawaii to Add accesso eCommerce, Mobile Ticketing"&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Wet'n'Wild Phoenix, Hawaii to Add accesso eCommerce, Mobile Ticketing|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wet-n-wild-phoenix-hawaii-to-add-accesso-ecommerce-mobile-ticketing-241142071.html|accessdate=January 27, 2014|date=January 20, 2014|publisher=Premier Parks LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radiodiffusion TÃ©lÃ©vision SÃ©nÃ©galaise''' (RTS) is the [[Senegal]]ese public broadcasting company.

== History ==
The French military opened the first radio broadcasting station in [[Dakar]] in [[1932 in radio|1932]]. It began broadcasting civilian programming in 1939. The origins of RTS are in '''Radio-Dakar''', created in 1950, that broadcast eight hours per day. In 1951 two channels appear: '''Dakar Inter''' and '''Dakar Afrique''', broadcast to listeners across western Africa.

In 1959 the fusion of [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]] into the [[Mali Federation]] causes the creation of '''Radio Mali''', its bases being in Radio Inter. On August 20, 1960, when Senegal separated from the Mali Federation, Radio Mali became Radio Senegal with two channels: one national and the other international.

In 1965 the Senegalese government began its first television broadcasts, which come to an end in 1972. However, the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] created a demand that incited the Senegalese government to create an institution producing both television and radio broadcasts. The '''Office de Radiodiffusion TÃ©lÃ©vision du SÃ©nÃ©gal''' (ORTS) was created in 1973, operating two radio channels and a national television channel.

On 4 October 1973, ORTS which had been in talks with [[Radio Gambia]] about producing a joint radio programme based on [[Senegambian]] history and broadcast in the local languages came to an agreement, and the first ever recording of the programme ''[[Chossani Senegambia]]'' (the history of [[Senegambia]]) was made.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alhaji Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof|Joof, Alhaji Alieu Ebrima Cham]].

''[[Senegambia]] - The land of our heritage. (1995). p 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the ORTS changed its name to the '''SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale de Radiodiffusion TÃ©lÃ©vision SÃ©nÃ©galaise''' (RTS) also changing its structure from government direction to a publicly funded, independently managed corporation.

'''''Rising Star''''' is a short-lived American reality television singing competition which began airing on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on June 22, 2014. It was based on the international franchise series ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' itself based on the [[Israel]]i singing competition ''[[HaKokhav HaBa]]'' (meaning "The Next Star") made by [[Keshet (TV)|Keshet Broadcasting Ltd]]. The program format lets viewers vote for contestants via [[mobile app]]s. It was filmed live in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="variety1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/abcs-rising-star-juggles-time-zones-to-allow-for-live-voting-1201195783/|title=ABC's 'Rising Star' Juggles Time Zones to Allow For Live Voting|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was also carried in [[Canada]], with advertising [[simultaneous substitution]] and voting access on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=RISING STAR App Now Available from CTV.ca as Canadians Invited to Judge New Interactive Music Competition Series, Premiering Sunday|publisher=CNW|date=17 June 2014|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1374745/rising-star-app-now-available-from-ctv-ca-as-canadians-invited-to-judge-new-interactive-music-competition-series-premiering-sunday|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jesse Kinch]] was the winner of ''Rising Star''{{'}}s first and only season with a vote of 76%. Macy Kate holds the record of highest vote with 93% and she came in 9th place. Daniel &amp; Olivia hold the record of lowest vote with 6% and they came in last place. ''Rising Star'' was cancelled after the season.

[[File:RisingStarApp.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The app used to collect votes from the viewers. The blue or red arrows would be swiped to indicate a "yes" or "no" vote for each performance.]]
In contrast to other singing competition TV shows which feature a cast of celebrity judges, ''Rising Star'' features a cast of celebrity experts and considers the viewers at home the judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/abc-rising-star-judges-explain-why-this-singing-competition-will-be-different/|title=ABC's 'Rising Star' Judges Explain Why This Singing Competition Will Be Different|publisher=[[TheWrap]]|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During each performance, the audience at home was able to decide in real time whether or not a contestant was sent through to the next round by using a mobile voting app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/abc-rising-star-trailer-promo-you-are-the-judge-1201210296/|title=ABC's 'Rising Star' Trailer: You're the Judge of the New Singing Competition|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	

While the viewers at home are considered the "judges", the expert panelists ([[Brad Paisley]], [[Kesha]], and [[Ludacris]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/05/16/abc-rising-star-ke$ha-ludacris-groban/|title=ABC's 'Rising Star' team revealed: Ke$ha, Ludacris, Groban join music competition|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; also influence the vote. For the first six shows, a yes vote from one of the judges added 7% to the performers total. In the round of 13 it was announced that their yes vote would add 5%. In the quarterfinals the expert's yes vote was lowered to a 3% add. In the semifinals, the expert's yes vote was lowered to a 1% add. In the finale, the expert's yes vote only counts as a home judge vote.

===Auditions===
Each performance begins with the contestant singing behind a screen ("The Wall").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/06/03/rising-star-trailer/|title='Rising Star' trailer: Ludacris is tired of waiting for results|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the contestant reaches 70% of "Yes" votes, the wall was raised and the contestant goes to the next round of the competition. Alongside the viewers' vote, three of the panelists (excluding the host) have 7% of the vote each, which will be added should they vote "Yes".&lt;ref name="variety1"/&gt;

===Duels===
Contestants who make it through the auditions are paired by the judges to face off in a duel (in the event of an odd number of contestants making it through, the contestant who had the highest number of East Coast and West Coast votes but did not make it through the auditions was given a slot in the duels). The first contestant to sing, chosen by a coin toss before the show, sings with the wall up and sets the benchmark for the second contestant. The second contestant sings with the wall down. If the second contestant betters the first contestant's vote total, the wall rises and the second contestant was through to the next round while the first contestant is eliminated; if the second contestant fails to raise the wall, the second contestant is eliminated and the first contestant was through. Also, the losing contestant with the highest number of West Coast votes in each episode was given a save and was through the next round.

===The Round of Thirteen===
After the duel rounds end, 13 of the contestants that survived perform. The first 7 contestants perform with the wall up, after which the contestant with the lowest vote total was placed in the hot seat. The subsequent contestants perform with the wall down, and they have to better the vote total of the contestant in the hot seat to raise the wall. If they succeed in doing so, the contestant in the hot seat was eliminated, the contestant with the next lowest vote total was placed in the hot seat, and the performing contestant was provisionally qualified; otherwise, the performing contestant was eliminated if they fail to raise the wall. This continues until the six contestants with the lowest number of votes are eliminated. In addition, the eliminated contestant with the highest number of West Coast votes in each episode was given a save and was through the next round. In this stage, each panelist's vote counts as 5%.

===Quarterfinals &amp; Semifinals===
The quarterfinals and semifinals follow the same format as the Round of Thirteen, except with a few changes to the weightage of the panelists' votes and number of contestants. In the quarterfinals, eight contestants battle for six spots (including the West Coast save), and each panelist's vote counts as 3%. In the semifinals, six contestants battle for four spots (including the West Coast save), and each panelist's vote counts as 1%.

===Finale===
During the finale, contestants are paired into a duel. The first contestant sings with the wall up and sets the benchmarks for the second contestant. The second contestant sings with the wall down. If the second contestant gets the higher percentage of votes, then the wall rises and the second contestant moves onto the next round of duels. However, if the second contestant's percentage was lower than the first contestant's, the wall stays down and the contestant was eliminated. In the second round, the two contestants that moved on will duel against each other with their second song. The same process applies for this round, except the running vote total was not revealed and both contestants sing with the wall up. The contestant with the higher vote percentage becomes the winner of Rising Star. The experts' yes vote counts as a home vote as they vote with their phones; their choices are not revealed to both the performers and the audience. The West Coast cannot vote during the finale.

===Time zones===
Due to the [[effects of time zones on North American broadcasting]], the show aired at 9 p.m [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]], 8 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]], and 7 p.m. [[Mountain Time Zone]]s. To accommodate the Mountain Time Zone (which usually does not carry any live programming with the Eastern and Central time zones and airs it on an hour delay), ABC rotated the usual 7 p.m. MT program, [[Wipeout (2008 U.S. game show)|Wipeout]] to air at 8 p.m. MT instead out of ''Rising Star''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/abcs-rising-star-juggles-time-zones-to-allow-for-live-voting-1201195783/ |title=ABC's 'Rising Star' Juggles Time Zones to Allow For Live Voting |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |publisher=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the network's affiliates in the [[Caribbean Sea]] region, including [[Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]'s [[WPRU-LP]] and [[WSVI]] in the [[United States Virgin Islands]] broadcast the series live, despite being an hour ahead in the [[Atlantic Time Zone]] (as they both take ABC's Eastern feed an hour ahead).

In the state of [[Arizona]], which [[Time in Arizona|does not observe]] [[Daylight Saving Time]], the program aired live at 6 p.m. local time. For [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]] and Alaskan time zone viewers, a dedicated feed was provided to show real-time voting particular to these viewers and a comparison to how the earlier time zones voted. In an instance where a contestant who didn't pass based on viewers from the Eastern, Central, and Mountain Time Zones, yet ends up faring better with the Pacific and Alaskan time zones, the contestant would pass. In addition, a "West Coast save" was given to the losing contestant with the highest number of West Coast votes in the post-audition rounds, except for the finale.

As Alaska is one hour before the Pacific Time Zone, and programming normally airs similar to Central and Mountain time, [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaskans]] was able to participate live as well. However, residents of Hawaii were unable to participate since [[Hawaii Time Zone|Hawaii time]] is two hours behind Pacific Time. Likewise, viewers in the other western insular islands such as [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]] had no means to participate whatsoever, as network programming on the affiliates of those islands is usually delayed by a day as it would be early morning if it did air live.

During West Coast broadcasts, live cut-ins to show reactions of contestants who passed only with West Coast viewers were displayed. There was no revocation of "pass" status if West Coast viewers rejected a contestant during the initial audition rounds. ABC stated that the chances of the West Coast differing substantially from other viewers was statistically small;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/rising-star-producers-consulted-mathematicians-707878 |title='Rising Star' Producers Consulted Mathematicians Over Time Zone Dilemma |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/05/rising-star-producers-on-how-interractive-talent-show-will-tackle-u-s-4-time-zones/ |title='Rising Star' Producers On How Interactive Talent Show Will Tackle U.S.' 4 Time Zones |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in weeks 8 and 9 of the competition, West Coast votes differed enough from East Coast votes that contestants Maneepat [[Myra Molloy]] and Audrey Kate Geiger were saved over other contestants who had higher totals on the East Coast.

For CTV viewers in Canada, broadcasts originally followed the ABC model through all time zones, but switched partway through the season so all CTV stations across Canada aired the show live with the Eastern feed.

'''Soul music''' (often referred to simply as '''soul''') is a popular [[music genre]] that originated in the [[African-American culture|African American]] community in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of African-American [[gospel music]], [[rhythm and blues]] and [[jazz]]. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States, where record labels such as [[Motown]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] were influential during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the [[music of Africa]].&lt;ref name="Mojapelo2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Mojapelo|title=Beyond Memory: Recording the History, Moments and Memories of South African Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-KW9f02oNMC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=September 11, 2013|year=2008|publisher=African Minds|isbn=978-1-920299-28-6|pages=1â}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], soul is "music that arose out of the [[African American culture|black experience in America]] through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm &amp; blues into a form of [[funk]]y, [[Secularity|secular]] testifying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/otis-redding/|title=Otis Redding|website=Rockhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music. Other characteristics are a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] between the lead vocalist and the [[backup vocals|chorus]] and an especially tense vocal sound. The style also occasionally uses [[Musical improvisation|improvisational]] additions, twirls and auxiliary sounds.&lt;ref name=valter&gt;{{cite book|author=Valter OjakÃ¤Ã¤r|title=Popmuusikast|publisher=Eesti Raamat|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soul music reflected the African-American identity and it stressed the importance of an African-American culture. The new-found African-American consciousness led to new styles of music, which boasted pride in being black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rockin' in Time|last = Szatmary|first = David P.|publisher = Pearson|year = 2014|location = New Jersey|pages = 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soul music dominated the U.S. [[R&amp;B chart]] in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S., Britain and elsewhere. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed [[funk]] music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by [[psychedelic rock]] and other genres, leading to [[psychedelic soul]]. The United States saw the development of [[neo soul]] around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.

The key subgenres of soul include the Detroit ([[Motown]]) style, a rhythmic music influenced by gospel; ''deep soul'' and ''southern soul'', driving, energetic soul styles combining [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] with southern [[gospel music]] sounds; [[Memphis soul]], a shimmering, sultry style; [[New Orleans soul]], which came out of the rhythm and blues style; [[Chicago soul]], a lighter gospel-influenced sound; [[Philadelphia soul]], a lush [[orchestral]] sound with [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals; [[psychedelic soul]], a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music; as well as categories such as [[blue-eyed soul]], which is soul music performed by [[White (people)|white]] artists; [[British soul]]; and [[Northern soul]], rare soul music played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s in Northern England.

== Origins ==
[[File:Ray_Charles_classic_piano_pose.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ray Charles]] pioneered the soul music genre during the 1950s by combining blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel styles]]
Soul music has its roots in [[traditional black gospel music|traditional African-American gospel music]] and [[rhythm and blues]] and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles â in both lyrical content and instrumentation â that began in the 1950s. The term "soul" had been used among African-American musicians to emphasize the feeling of being an African-American in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Szatmary, David P. (2014). Rockin' in Time. New Jersey: Pearson. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[musicologist]] [[Barry Hansen]],&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;Barry Hansen, ''Rhythm and Gospel'', in Jim Miller (ed.), ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll'', 1976, pp. 15â18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Though this hybrid produced a clutch of hits in the R&amp;B market in the early 1950s, only the most adventurous white fans felt its impact at the time; the rest had to wait for the coming of soul music in the 1960s to feel the rush of [[rock and roll]] sung gospel-style.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:JamesBrown.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[James Brown]] was known as the "Godfather of Soul"&lt;ref name="Maycock"&gt;{{cite web|last=Maycock|first=James|title=James Brown: Soul Survivor|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/james-brown/soul-survivor/532/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
According to AllMusic, "[s]oul music was the result of the urbanization and commercialization of rhythm and blues in the '60s."&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/soul-ma0000002865 ''About Soul'', AllMusic]. Retrieved July 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "soul music" itself, referring to gospel-style music with secular lyrics, was first attested in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=soul|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=Etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "soul" in African-American parlance has connotations of African-American pride and culture. [[Gospel music|Gospel]] groups in the 1940s and '50s occasionally used the term as part of their names. The [[jazz]] style that originated from gospel became known as '''[[soul jazz]]'''. As singers and arrangers began using techniques from both gospel and soul jazz in African-American popular music during the 1960s, soul music gradually functioned as an umbrella term for the African-American popular music at the time.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|year=2001|volume=23|location=London|chapter=Soul music}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/little-richard-p4765 Richie Unterberger, "Little Richard â Artist Biography"], AllMusic&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sam_Cooke_1961.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sam Cooke]] is acknowledged as one of soul music's "forefathers".]]

Important innovators whose recordings in the 1950s contributed to the emergence of soul music included [[Clyde McPhatter]], [[Hank Ballard]], and [[Etta James]].&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt; [[Ray Charles]] is often cited as popularizing the soul music genre with his series of hits, starting with 1954's "[[I Got a Woman]]".&lt;ref name=pc15&gt;{{Pop Chronicles |15 || Ray Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Bobby Womack]] said, "Ray was the genius. He turned the world onto soul music."&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/static/p/episodes.pdf BBC Music, Episode guides to ''Soul Deep â The Story Of Black Popular Music'', 2007]. Retrieved July 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles was open in acknowledging the influence of [[Pilgrim Travelers]] vocalist Jesse Whitaker on his singing style.

[[Little Richard]], who inspired [[Otis Redding]],&lt;ref name="white"&gt;White, Charles. (2003), p. 229. ''The Life and Times of Little Richard: The Authorised Biography.'' Omnibus Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Brown]] both were equally influential. Brown was nicknamed the "Godfather of Soul Music",&lt;ref name="Maycock"/&gt; and Richard proclaimed himself as the "King of Rockin' and Rollin', Rhythm and Blues Soulin'", because his music embodied elements of all three, and since he inspired artists in all three genres.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Douglass Opie, ''Hog and Hominy: Soul Food from Africa to America'' (Columbia University Press, 2008), chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sam Cooke]] and [[Jackie Wilson]] also are often acknowledged as soul forefathers.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pc17&gt;{{Gilliland |show=17 |https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19767/m1/ |Show 17 â The Soul Reformation: More on the evolution of rhythm and blues. [Part 3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooke became popular as the lead singer of the gospel group [[The Soul Stirrers]], before controversially moving into secular music. His recording of "[[You Send Me]]" in 1957 launched a successful [[pop music]] career. Furthermore, his 1962 recording of "[[Bring It On Home To Me]]" has been described as "perhaps the first record to define the soul experience".&lt;ref&gt;Joe McEwen, ''Sam Cooke'', in Jim Miller (ed.), ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll'', 1976, pp. 113â116.&lt;/ref&gt; Jackie Wilson, a contemporary of both Cooke and James Brown, also achieved [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success, especially with his 1957 hit "[[Reet Petite]]". He even was particularly influential for his dramatic delivery and performances.&lt;ref&gt;Joe McEwen, ''Jackie Wilson'', in Jim Miller (ed.), ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll'', 1976, pp. 117â119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1960s ==
[[File:Solomon Burke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Solomon Burke]] {{small|(1940â2010)}} recorded for Atlantic in the 1960s]]
Writer [[Peter Guralnick]] is among those to identify [[Solomon Burke]] as a key figure in the emergence of soul music, and [[Atlantic Records]] as the key [[record label]]. Burke's early 1960s songs, including "[[Cry to Me]]", "[[Just Out of Reach]]" and "Down in the Valley" are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke's "Just Out Of Reach". Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke â primarily in a pop vein.  Each of these singers, though, could be looked upon as an isolated phenomenon; it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could begin to see anything even resembling a movement."&lt;ref name="Guralnick (soul)"&gt;Peter Guralnick, ''Soul'', in Jim Miller (ed.), ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll'', 1976, pp. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Aretha Franklin on January 20, 2009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aretha Franklin]] is widely known as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Soul]]"]]
[[Ben E. King]] also achieved success in 1961 with "[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand By Me]]", a song directly based on a gospel hymn.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; By the mid-1960s, the initial successes of Burke, King and others had been surpassed by new soul singers, including [[Stax Records|Stax]] artists such as [[Otis Redding]] and [[Wilson Pickett]], who mainly recorded in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]].  According to [[Jon Landau]]:&lt;ref&gt;Jon Landau, ''Otis Redding'', in Jim Miller (ed.), ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll'', 1976, pp. 210â213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Between 1962 and 1964 Redding recorded a series of soul ballads characterized by unabashedly sentimental lyrics usually begging forgiveness or asking a girlfriend to come home.... He soon became known as "Mr. Pitiful" and earned a reputation as the leading performer of soul ballads."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most important female soul singer to emerge was [[Aretha Franklin]], originally a gospel singer who began to make secular recordings in 1960 but whose career was later revitalised by her recordings for Atlantic.  Her 1967 recordings, such as "[[I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)]]", "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]" (originally sung by Otis Redding), and "[[Do Right Woman, Do Right Man]]" (written by [[Chips Moman]] and [[Dan Penn]]), were significant and commercially successful productions.&lt;ref name=pc52_2&gt;{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |Show 52 â The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Soul music dominated the U.S. African-American music charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S.  Otis Redding was a huge success at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The genre also became highly popular in the UK, where many leading acts toured in the late 1960s. "Soul" became an umbrella term, used to describe an increasingly wide variety of R&amp;B-based music styles â from the dance and pop-oriented acts at [[Motown Records]] in [[Detroit]], such as [[The Temptations]], [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]], to "[[deep soul]]" performers such as [[Percy Sledge]] and [[James Carr (musician)|James Carr]].&lt;ref name="Motown Museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Motown: The Sound that Changed America|url=https://www.motownmuseum.org/story/motown/|website=Motown Museum|accessdate=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erlewine (Sledge)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Percy Sledge: Artist Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/percy-sledge-mn0000838195/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huey (Carr)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huey|first1=Steve|title=James Carr: Artist Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-carr-mn0000107877/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different regions and cities within the U.S., including New York City, Detroit, Chicago, [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[New Orleans]], [[Philadelphia]], and Muscle Shoals, Alabama (the home of [[FAME Studios]] and [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studios]]) became noted for different subgenres of the music and recording styles.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown (Muscle Shoals)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Mick|title=Deep Soul|url=http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/muscle-shoals/index.html|website=Telegraph|accessdate=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968, while at its peak of popularity, soul began to fragment into disparate subgenres.  Artists such as James Brown and [[Sly &amp; the Family Stone]] evolved into [[funk]] music, while other singers such as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, [[Curtis Mayfield]] and [[Al Green]] developed slicker, more sophisticated and in some cases more politically conscious varieties of the genre.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; However, soul music continued to evolve, informing most subsequent forms of R&amp;B from the 1970s-onward, with pockets of musicians continuing to perform in traditional soul style.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

== 1970s and later ==

Later examples of soul music include recordings by [[The Staple Singers]] (such as ''I'll Take You There''), and [[Al Green]]'s 1970s recordings, done at [[Willie Mitchell (music)|Willie Mitchell's]]' Royal Recording in Memphis.&lt;ref name="Songfacts (Take You There)"&gt;{{cite web|title=I'll Take You There by The Staple Singers|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2173|website=Songfacts|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell's [[Hi Records]] continued in the [[Stax Records|Stax]] tradition of the previous decade, releasing a string of hits by Green, [[Ann Peebles]], [[Otis Clay]], [[O.V.

As [[disco]] and funk musicians had hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of [[quiet storm]]. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] and [[adult contemporary]]. Some funk bands, such as EW&amp;F, [[The Commodores]] and [[Con Funk Shun]] would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include [[Smokey Robinson]], Jefrry Osbourne, [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Chaka Kahn]], and [[Larry Graham]].

After the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by [[electro music]]. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as [[contemporary R&amp;B]], which sounded very different from the original [[rhythm and blues]] style. The United States saw the development of [[neo-soul]] around 1994. Mainstream [[record label]] marketing support for soul genres cooled in the 2000s due to the industry's re-focus on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]].

== Notable record labels and producers ==
=== Motown records ===
[[File:LeviStubbs.jpg|thumb|Levi Stubbs singing lead with the Four Tops in 1966]]
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
{{Main article|Motown Records}}
[[Berry Gordy]]'s successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&amp;B labels. Notable artists under this label were [[The Supremes]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Miracles]], the [[Four Tops]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[Mary Wells]], [[Junior Walker|Jr. Walker &amp; The All-Stars]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Tammi Terrell]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]],&lt;ref name=pc25&gt;{{Pop Chronicles |25| |Motown artists}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Jackson Five]].

Hits were made using a quasi-industrial "[[Assembly line|production-line]]" approach. Some considered the sound to be mechanistic, but the producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. [[Brian Holland]], [[Lamont Dozier]] and [[Eddie Holland]] were rarely out of the charts for their work as [[songwriter]]s and [[record producer]]s for [[The Supremes]], the [[Four Tops]] and [[Martha and the Vandellas]].&lt;ref name=pc25/&gt; They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. Rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or [[tambourine]]. [[Smokey Robinson]] was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to "[[The Tracks of My Tears]]" by his group [[The Miracles]], which was one of the most important songs of the decade.

=== Stax Records and Atlantic records ===
{{Main article|Stax Records|Atlantic Records}}
Stax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Winterson, Nickol, Bricheno, ''Pop Music: The Text Book''  (Edition Peters) 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stax Records]], founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind [[Motown Records]]. They were responsible for releasing hits by [[Otis Redding]], [[Wilson Pickett]], [[The Staple Singers]] and many more.&lt;ref&gt;Pareles, Jon, ''Estelle Stewart Axton, 85, A Founder of Stax Records'' (New York Times) 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmet Ertegun, who had anticipated being a diplomat until 1944 when his father died, founded [[Atlantic Records]] in 1947 with his friend [[Herb Abramson]]. Ertegun wrote many songs for [[Ray Charles]] and [[The Clovers]]. He even sang [[backup vocals]] for his artist [[Big Joe Turner]] on the song, "Shake Rattle and Roll."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Michael, ''Review of: Atlantic Records: The House That Ahmet Built, by Susan Steinberg'' (Notes) 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subgenres ==
=== Detroit (Motown) soul ===
{{further information|Motown}}
Dominated by [[Berry Gordy]]'s [[Motown|Motown Records]] empire, Detroit soul is strongly rhythmic and influenced by gospel music. The Motown sound often includes hand [[clapping]], a powerful [[bassline]], [[violin]]s and [[Bell (instrument)|bells]]. Motown Records' house band was [[The Funk Brothers]]. [[AllMusic]] cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.&lt;ref name="popsoul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/pop-soul-ma0000011870|title=Pop-Soul|publisher=[[AllMusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists of this style included [[Diana Ross]], the [[Jackson 5]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Billy Preston]].&lt;ref name="popsoul"/&gt; Popular during the 1960s, the style became glossier during the 1970s and led to [[disco]].&lt;ref name="popsoul"/&gt;

=== Deep soul and southern soul ===

{{further information|Southern soul}}
The terms ''deep soul'' and ''southern soul'' generally refer to a driving, energetic soul style combining [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]]'s energy with pulsating southern United States [[gospel music]] sounds. [[Memphis, Tennessee]] label [[Stax Records]] nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&amp;B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of [[background vocals]], and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands [[Booker T and the MGs]] (with [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Duck Dunn]], and [[Al Jackson, Jr.|Al Jackson]]) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of the [[Mar-Keys]], trumpeter [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] and saxophonist Andrew Love).

=== Memphis soul ===
{{further information|Memphis soul}}
''Memphis soul'' is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stax Records]] and [[Hi Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, [[Hammond organ]], bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's [[Al Green]] and Stax's [[Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s]]. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged [[Southern soul]] style. The Hi Records house band ([[Hi Rhythm Section]]) and producer [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]] developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style, but had their own unique sound.

=== Birmingham soul ===
Impactful and underrated [[Birmingham]] soul is a driving and strongly rhythmic style that combined elements of gospel music with the uptempo energy of R&amp;B. As a soul city it is thoroughly influenced by the hard driving "southern soul" of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] era and the musical and social legacy of that time. The rise of Muscle Shoals Alabama as a recording center was in part influenced by professional musicians coming north from Birmingham such as [[Barry Beckett]] of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] also known as the "Swampers" and bringing their musical influence with them to the [[Tennessee Valley]]. Similarly [[Detroit soul]] is influenced to a large extent by Birmingham and its downhome soul roots because many of its performers had migrated north from [[Alabama]] as well. The most notable are 3/5 of the [[Temptations]], [[Melvin Franklin]] of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]], and [[Eddie Kendricks]] both of Birmingham.

=== New Orleans soul ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
{{further information|New Orleans soul}}
The New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as [[Little Richard]], [[Fats Domino]], and [[Huey Piano Smith]] made a huge impact on the pop and R&amp;B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of [[Funk]] music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was songwriter, arranger, and producer [[Allen Toussaint]].  He worked with such artists as [[Irma Thomas]] ("the Soul Queen of New Orleans"), Jessie Hill, [[Chris Kenner]], Benny Spellman, and [[Ernie K. Doe]] on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, [[Betty Harris]], and [[Aaron Neville]]. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City- and Los Angeles-based record labelsânotably [[Lee Dorsey]] for New Yorkâbased Amy Records and the Meters for New Yorkâbased Josie and then LA-based Reprise.

=== Chicago soul ===
{{further information|Chicago soul}}
Chicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. [[Vee Jay Records]], which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Dee Clark]], and [[Gene Chandler]]. [[Chess Records]], mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced a number of major soul artists, including [[The Dells]] and [[Billy Stewart]]. [[Curtis Mayfield]] not only scored many hits with his group, [[The Impressions]], but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for [[The Fascinations]], [[Major Lance]], and the [[Five Stairsteps]].

=== Philadelphia soul ===
{{further information|Philadelphia soul}}
Based primarily in the [[Philadelphia International]] record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had a lush [[orchestral]] sound and [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals. [[Thom Bell]], and [[Kenneth Gamble &amp; Leon Huff]] are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for [[The O'Jays]], [[The Intruders (music group)|The Intruders]], [[The Delfonics]], [[The Stylistics]], [[Harold Melvin &amp; The Blue Notes]], and [[The Spinners (American R&amp;B group)|The Spinners]].

=== Psychedelic soul ===
{{Main article|Psychedelic soul}}
Psychedelic soul, sometimes known as "black rock", was a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of [[funk]] music a few years later.&lt;ref name=Harrington2002&gt;J.

=== Blue-eyed soul ===
{{Main article|Blue-eyed soul}}
Blue-eyed soul is [[Rhythm and Blues|R&amp;B]] or soul music performed by [[White (people)|white]] artists. The meaning of ''blue-eyed soul'' has evolved over decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&amp;B that was similar to the music released by [[Motown Records]] and [[Stax Records]].&lt;ref name=pc52&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |title=Show 52 â The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other [[music genre]]s that are influenced by soul music. Artists like [[Hall and Oates]], [[David Bowie]], [[Teena Marie]], Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Raynolds, [[Frankie Vali]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Adele]] are known as [[Blue-eyed soul]] singers.

=== British soul ===
[[File:Joss Stone @ Salumeria della Musica 08.jpg|thumb|Joss Stone performing in 2008]]
{{Main article|British soul}}
Soul has been a major influence on British popular music since the 1960s including bands of the [[British Invasion]], most significantly [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Humphries, ''The Complete Guide to the Music of the Beatles'' (Music Sales Group, 1998), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; There were a handful of significant British [[Blue-eyed soul]] acts, including [[Dusty Springfield]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Gulla, ''Icons of R&amp;B and soul: an encyclopedia of the artists who revolutionized rhythm'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008), p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; In 70s Carl Douglas, Real Thing and Delegation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discosavvy.com/delegation.html|title=Disco Savvy: The Complete Disco Guide to Delegation - disco and funk|website=Discosavvy.com|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; had hits in UK chart. American soul was extremely popular among some youth sub-cultures like the [[Mod (subculture)|Mod]], [[Northern soul]] and [[Modern soul]] movements, but a clear genre of British soul did not emerge until the 1980s when a number of artists including [[George Michael]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[Simply Red]], [[Lisa Stansfield]] and [[Soul II Soul]] enjoyed commercial success.&lt;ref name=Wald1997&gt;G. Wald, "Soul's Revival: White Soul, Nostalgia and the Culturally Constructed Past", M. Guillory and R. C. Green, ''Soul: Black power, politics, and pleasure'' (New York University Press, 1997), pp. 139â58.&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of British soul artists in the U.S., most notably [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Adele]], [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]], [[Joss Stone]] and [[Leona Lewis]], led to talk of a "third British Invasion" or soul invasion in the 2000s and 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=eae2e9c5-d992-4afc-ab23-0bb8046b1bcb Selling their soul: women leading the way in R&amp;B British invasion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118051701/http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=eae2e9c5-d992-4afc-ab23-0bb8046b1bcb |date=January 18, 2012 }} Canada.com June 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedailyvoice.com/voice/2008/04/the-new-british-invasion-soul-000485.php The New British Invasion: Soul Divas 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527025804/http://thedailyvoice.com/voice/2008/04/the-new-british-invasion-soul-000485.php |date=May 27, 2009 }} ''[[The Daily Voice (African American news website)|The Daily Voice]]'', April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neo soul ===
{{further information|Neo soul}}
The term ''neo soul'' is a marketing phrase coined in the early 1990s by producer and [[record label]] executive [[Kedar Massenburg]] to describe a blend of 1970s soul-style vocals and instrumentation with [[contemporary R&amp;B]] sounds, [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] beats and poetic interludes. The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s.  A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of [[Fender Rhodes]] or [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] "pads" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.

=== Northern soul and modern soul ===
{{further information|Northern soul|Modern soul}}
The phrase ''northern soul'' was coined by journalist [[Dave Godin]] and popularised in 1970 through his column in ''Blues and Soul'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features05.html|title=Chris Hunt - Wigan Casino|website=Chrishunt.biz|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to rare soul music that was played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s in [[northern England]]. The playlists originally consisted of obscure 1960s and early 1970s American soul recordings with an [[uptempo]] beat, such as those on [[Motown Records]] and more obscure labels such as [[Okeh Records]]. [[Modern soul]] developed when northern soul DJs began looking in record shops in the United States and United Kingdom for music that was more complex and contemporary. What emerged was a richer sound that was more advanced in terms of [[Hi-Fi]] and [[FM radio]] technology.

=== Hypersoul ===
Hyper soul can be described to be a medley of soul and dance music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riddim.ca/?p=180|title=What is Hypersoul? (2001) - Riddim.ca|website=Riddim.ca|accessdate=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains the vocal quality, techniques, and style but includes a movement towards technology, materialism, and heightened sexuality and sensationalism in the rhythm and lyricism.  It is also remarkable for possessing a more euro sound influence than the other subgenres of soul. The subgenre provides more roles that may be adopted by the song's female subjects and more space to express different facets of gender experience as compared to traditional soul, through the reversal of male-female dynamics and the embrace of dominating and confrontational attitudes. Performers included [[Timbaland]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Destiny's Child]]. Hypersoul maybe also be seen as a precursor to modern R&amp;B.

[[File:Sound System.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Audio technicians set up massive [[speaker enclosure]]s for a Jamaican sound system party.]]
A '''sound system''' is a group of [[disc jockey|DJs]] and [[Audio engineering|audio engineers]] contributing and working together as one, playing and producing music over a large [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]], typically for a dance event or party.

==Origin==
{{main|Sound system (Jamaican)}}
The sound system concept originated in the 1950s in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. [[DJs]] would load up a truck with a generator, turntables, and huge speakers to set up street parties. The sound system scene is generally regarded as an important part of Jamaican cultural history and as being responsible for the rise of modern Jamaican musical styles such as [[ska]], [[rocksteady]], [[reggae]] and [[Dub music|dub]]. When Jamaicans emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]], the sound system culture followed and became firmly rooted there in the 1970s. It is still strongly linked with those Jamaican-originated [[music genres]], and some bands or producers still call themselves sound systems, such as [[Dub Narcotic Sound System]] and the [[On-U Sound Records|On-U Sound System]]. When [[Asian Dub Foundation]] are advertised as ''Asian Dub Foundation'', the whole band performs, but when they announce themselves as ''Asian Dub Foundation Sound System'', members of the band mix and play music (by other artists, as well as their own) while one or two MCs [[Rapping|rap]] over the songs like DJ Pro. The term also has become connected with [[sound reinforcement system]]s by DJs such as the Valve Sound System.

== Recording artists ==

Recording and performing artists who began as sound systems include [[Soul II Soul]] and [[Massive Attack]].

{{POV-section|date=August 2012}}{{NPOV language|date=August 2012}}
{{DIY party|rig='''Sound System'''}}

The term "sound system" is also used to refer to a [[free party]] sound system, also known as a '''rig'''. The equipment includes a van, [[loudspeakers]], [[Audio amplifier|amplifiers]], [[phonograph|turntable decks]] and cables. Larger rigs might also have a [[fog machine]], [[stage lighting]], [[video projector]]s and an [[electrical generator]]; the generator enables the sound system to be set up anywhere. A sound system collective is usually five or more people, with larger sound systems having more members.  Equipment is owned by some and others are [[Disc jockey|DJs]], [[record producer]]s or enthusiastic ravers who help out. They will be the people who organise [[free party|free parties]] and [[teknival]]s and will be a group of friends with similar interests. Some owners purposely use second hand equipment, to reduce their risk if the equipment is stolen or damaged. This type of rig is called a "suicide rig" and usually used at insecure locations where it may get stolen or damaged and if it is suspected that police will have knowledge of the party.

Sometimes a sound system collective is well known for its wide travels. This type of collective can be described as modern [[Nomad]] [[tribe]]s or [[New age travellers]]. In this context the word sound system is used interchangeably to describe either the group of people or the equipment. The techno travelling scene of the 1990s was made of sound system crews like Bedlam sound system and [[Spiral Tribe]]. The free party community has been criticized for the unkempt appearance of attendees to such events, accusations of [[substance abuse]] of illegal drugs such as [[MDMA]], [[ketamine]], [[amphetamines]] and [[LSD]], and complaints about messes left behind by such parties have given the scene a negative reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1325401/Illegal-London-rave-18-hour-spree-destruction-Royal-Mail-depot.html|title=Rave hordes in 18-hour spree of destruction at former Royal Mail depot in central London|author=|date=|website=dailymail.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite such complaints, the scene continues to grow with a large following in [[Bristol]], [[Abergavenny]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[London]], [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].

'''Spanish Golden Age theatre''' refers to theatre in [[Spain]] roughly between 1590 and 1681.&lt;ref name="whitesell2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=David R. Whitesell|year=1995|title=Fredson Bowers and the Editing of Spanish Golden Age Drama|journal=Text|volume=8|page=|pages=67-84|jstor=30228091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain emerged as a European power after it was unified by the marriage of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469 and then claimed for [[Christianity]] at the [[Siege of Granada]] in 1492.&lt;ref name=gainor&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gainor|first1=Ellen|last2=Garner|first2=Stanton|last3=Puchner|first3=Martin|title=The Norton Anthology of Drama|date=November 1, 2013|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0393921519|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw a monumental increase in the production of live theatre as well as the in importance of the arts within Spanish society.

==Overview==
Theatre was an accessible art form for all participants in Renaissance Spain, being both highly sponsored by the aristocratic class and highly attended by the lower classes.&lt;ref name="thacker"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Thacker|title=A Companion to Golden Age Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBK0dgU-4wIC|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-1-85566-140-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume and variety of Spanish plays during the Golden Age was unprecedented in the history of world theatre, surpassing even the dramatic production of the [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance]] by a factor of at least four.&lt;ref name="whitesell"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30228091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thacker /&gt;&lt;ref name="mears"&gt;{{cite book|title=Compleat Catalogue of Plays that Were Ever Printed in the English Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTgJAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=22 July 2013|year=1719|publisher=W. Mears}}&lt;/ref&gt; This volume has been as much a source of criticism as praise for Spanish Golden Age theatre, for emphasizing quantity before quality.&lt;ref name=nvcc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/spd130et/spanish.htm |title=Introduction to Theatre â Spanish Renaissance Theatre |publisher=Novaonline.nvcc.edu |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of the plays of this period (10,000 to 30,000)&lt;ref name=thacker /&gt;&lt;ref name=nvcc /&gt; are still considered masterpieces today.&lt;ref name=pasto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comedia.denison.edu/golden.html |title=Golden Age |publisher=Comedia.denison.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schevill&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=470268}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prolific production greatly contributed to the accessibility of theatre in Spain.&lt;ref name=thacker /&gt; For modern theatre historians, however, it has contributed to the difficulty of researching theatre from this period. The vast majority of plays have remained virtually untouched, in terms of both production and scholarly analysis, since the seventeenth century. Combined with the error prone printing techniques that plagued the publication of Spanish plays, this has vastly undercut the study of Spanish Golden Age theatre.&lt;ref name=thacker /&gt; Although a thorough inclusive analysis remains difficult or even impossible, Spanish Golden Age theatre represents an area of active and productive research for theatre historians.&lt;ref name=whitesell /&gt;&lt;ref name=thacker /&gt;

==Genres==
Noted for its variety, the theatre of Renaissance Spain was the only in Europe to simultaneously include secular and religious dramas.&lt;ref name="mears" /&gt; Additionally, state sponsored drama existed harmoniously alongside popular for-profit theatre,&lt;ref name="mckendrick"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Melveena McKendrick]]|title=Theatre in Spain, 1490â1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2I4AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 July 2013|date=26 March 1992|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-42901-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many theatre artists contributing significantly to both. Stylistically, plays ranged from [[straight play]]s to [[opera]]s and from bawdy comedies to epic tragedies.&lt;ref name=westerntheatrehistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westerntheatrehistory.com/SpanishMovements.aspx |title=Share Documents and Files Online &amp;#124; Microsoft Office Live |publisher=Westerntheatrehistory.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421153302/http://westerntheatrehistory.com/SpanishMovements.aspx |archivedate=2012-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain also introduced its own forms and genres of theatre with the development of the Comedia nueva&lt;ref name=garay&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27922855}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[zarzuela]].&lt;ref name="dipuccio"&gt;{{cite book|author=Denise M. DiPuccio|title=Communicating Myths of the Golden Age Comedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34TXDx6cBTIC|accessdate=22 July 2013|year=1998|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0-8387-5372-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious drama===
* ''[[Autos sacramentales]]'' celebrated the mystery of the Eucharist by mixing the human, supernatural, and allegorical.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite web|title=auto sacramental|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/44690/auto-sacramental|website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*They were performed in two or four carros (two-story wagons) in parades around Madrid and other cities as part of the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] processions.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt;&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;
*They were produced by trade guilds until the mid-sixteenth century when municipal authorities produced them at great expense.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt;
*Starting in the 1550s they were performed by professional acting troupes and mixed civic and religious authority.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt;
*A special introductory prologue called a Loa sometimes preceded Autos Sacramentales. Each Loa was specific to the play it was performed with and to the audience it was performed for,&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt; and were designed to get the audience interested in the play they were about to see. The word Loa means to compliment and garner good will.&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt;

===Public theatre===
[[File:Almagro-Corral-de-Comedias.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Corral de comedias de Almagro|''Corral de comedias'' in Almagro]]]]
*Professional public theatre was established in Spain's major cities during the 1570s. The Corral de la Cruz, built in 1579, was Madrid's first permanent theatre.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt;&lt;ref name=allen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=John|title=The Reconstruction of a Spanish Golden Age Playhouse: El Corral del Principe (1583â1744)|date=January 1, 1984|publisher=University Press of Florida|isbn=978-0813007557|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Corral de comedias|Corrales de comedias]]'' originated from courtyard performances, and were constructed within rectangular courtyards enclosed by buildings on three sides. The stage was raised with a permanent backdrop, and a patio for standing spectators was placed in the upper levels.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt;&lt;ref name=allen/&gt;
*Alojerias were refreshment booths and above them were galleries for more spectators: cazuelas (reserved for women), and aposentos (box seats). Audiences were often lively and unruly.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt;&lt;ref name=allen/&gt;
*Corrales were originally licensed to charitable organizations, which used performance to support hospitals and aid the poor.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt;

===Theatre at court===
*Court performances emerged during the seventeenth century during Philip III's reign (1598â1621) at Alcazar, the royal palace.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt;&lt;ref name=mckendrick/&gt;
*In 1633 Buen Retiroâa new palace on the outskirts of Madridâbecame the center for court entertainment; in 1640 by Italian set designers supervised the establishment of the Coliseo, a permanent outdoor theatre.&lt;ref name=gainor /&gt;
*Cosimo Lotti (1571â1643) engineered a special stage above lake waters with a silver chariot drawn across the surface by two large fish, and a mountain was transformed into a palace in Calderon's ''Love, the Greatest Enchantment'' (1635).&lt;ref name=gainor /&gt;&lt;ref name=mckendrick /&gt;

==Themes==
Honor is a major theme in Spanish Golden Age drama.&lt;ref name=pasto/&gt; Theatre was used as a metaphor for life, and honor was therefore represented in a number of ways on stage, for example, reputation, and juxtaposed against disillusionment and hypocrisy. Right versus wrong is a common theme in plays from this period and Lope de Vega himself believed that everyone reacts to honor.&lt;ref name=honor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=C.A.|title=HONOR IN SPANISH GOLDEN-AGE DRAMA: ITS RELATION TO REAL LIFE AND TO MORALS|journal=Bulletin of Hispanic Studies|date=1958|volume=35|issue=4|pages=199â210|doi=10.1080/1475382582000335199|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1475382582000335199#.VECeRCldXAI|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honorable (Christian) conduct is enforced by the public and to lose your honor is to live in shame and despair. A large number of plots focus on the fear of lost reputation and on masculine honor based on women's chastity. While women seem to control their men's honor, gender roles are only very conservatively challenged. While poverty is everywhere, the plays are filled with picturesque scenes, glorious churches, and courts.&lt;ref name=johnston/&gt; Still, the playwrights of the time throw a bit of cynicism in their work. The stock character of the [[gracioso]] (disillusioned clown) survives the stories without even wondering about right and wrong.

==Playwrights==
*[[Lope de Vega]] (November 25, 1562 â August 27, 1635) One of the key figures in the Spanish Golden Century of Baroque literature. His reputation in the world of Spanish literature is second only to that of [[Cervantes]], while the sheer volume of his literary output (between 800 and 1800 plays) is unequalled, making him one of the most prolific authors in the history of literature. His most notable play is ''[[Fuenteovejuna]]'' (1613).&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Gwynne|title=Lope de Vega, Three Major Plays|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-283337-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morley&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morley|first1=Griswold|last2=Bruerton|first2=C.|title=Cronologia de las Comedias de Lope de Vega|date=1968|location=Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pedro CalderÃ³n de la Barca|CalderÃ³n de la Barca]] (January 17, 1600 â May 25, 1681) During certain periods of his life he was also a soldier and a Roman Catholic priest. Born when the theatre was being defined by Lope de Vega, he developed it further, his work being regarded as the culmination of the Spanish Baroque theatre. As such, he is regarded as one of Spain's foremost dramatists and one of the finest playwrights of world literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eckermann|first1=J.P|title=Conversations with Goethe|date=1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most notable plays is ''[[Life is a Dream]]'' (1629â1635). He also wrote about 80 Autos Sacramentales.
*[[Lope de Rueda]] (1510â1565) A very versatile writer, he wrote dramas, comedies, farces, and pasos. He was the precursor to what is considered the golden age of Spanish literature. His predecessors wrote mostly for court, but he was able to use his abundance of riotous humour, great knowledge of low life, and a most happy gift of dialogue to create a taste for drama. His works were issued posthumously in 1567 by Timoneda and include ''Eufemia'', ''Med Ora'', ''Arinelina'', and ''Los EngaÃ±ados''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lopelives.com Nineteen pasos translated into English]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sor [[Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz]] (November 12, 1651 â April 17, 1695) An important female Mexican self-taught playwright, poet, and nun. While she lived in colonial era Mexico during the time when it was ruled by Spain, she is considered both a Mexican and Spanish Golden Age dramatist.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt; One of her notable works include ''[[Loa to Divine Narcissus|Loa to the Divine Narcissus]]''. She is also pictured on the 200 pesos bill issued by the Banco de Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banxico.org.mx/billetes-y-monedas/informacion-general/billetes-y-monedas-de-fabricacion-actual/billete-de-200-pesos/pagina-billete-200-pesos.html|publisher=[[Bank of Mexico]]|title=Billete de 200 pesos|accessdate=2011-07-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907072707/http://www.banxico.org.mx/billetes-y-monedas/informacion-general/billetes-y-monedas-de-fabricacion-actual/billete-de-200-pesos/pagina-billete-200-pesos.html|archivedate=2011-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Juan del Encina]] (July 12, 1468 â late 1529 or early 1530) Often called the Founder of Spanish Drama.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Slonimsky|Slonimsky, Nicolas]], ed., ''[[Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians]]'', seventh edition. London, England: Collier Macmillan Publishers, 1984: 662&lt;/ref&gt; One of his notable works is ''Cancionero'' (1496), a collection of lyrical and dramatic poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pope|first1=Isabel|title=[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]|date=2001|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|pages=193â196|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gil Vicente]] (1465â1536) Called the Trobadour, he was a Portuguese playwright and poet who acted in and directed his own plays. He worked in Portuguese as much as he worked in Spanish and is thus, with Juan del Encina, considered joint-father of Spanish drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gil Vicente|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/627394/Gil-Vicente|website=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tirso de Molina]] (March 24, 1579 â March 12, 1648) A Baroque dramatist, poet, and Roman Catholic monk. During his lifetime he wrote around four hundred plays, of which only eighty still exist. One of his most famous plays is ''El Burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra'' (''[[The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest]]''), the piece in which [[Don Juan]] is first presented on the stage.&lt;ref&gt;edited by [[Emilio Cotarelo y Mori|E Cotarelo]] in the ''Nueva biblioteca de autores espaÃ±oles'' (supplementary to Hartzenbusch's edition)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla]] (October 4, 1607 â January 23, 1648) Many of his works were adapted outside of Spain. His main pieces are ''Del rey abajo ninguno'' and ''No hay padre siendo rey'', both published in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Francisco de Rojas y Zorrilla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actors and companies==
After 1603 only licensed companies could work in Spain, and licenses were limited in availability. Unemployed actors joined the compaÃ±Ã­as de la legua (âcompanies of the roadâ) and performed in the countryside. Companies could not perform in one place for more than two months annually, and only one company was permitted to perform at that location.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt; In 1615, Madrid assumed control and hired companies made up of actor-managers (autores), actors, and apprentices, subject to government rules.&lt;ref name=gainor /&gt; These companies were licensed by the Royal Council and highly paid to perform Autos Sacramentales both in court and at public theatres. Actors generally worked for managers under a 1 to 2-year contract&lt;ref name=mckendrick /&gt; and a typical schedule had actors study their role from 2am to 9am, rehearse until noon, take a break to eat, then perform until 7pm. While women were licensed to perform starting in 1587, this practice remained controversial until 1599, when a royal decree stipulated that only women married to company members could perform.&lt;ref name=gainor /&gt; Important performers included Lope de Rueda and later Juan Rana.&lt;ref name="hochman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Hochman|title=McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama: An International Reference Work in 5 Volumes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88xIQiXVMCQC|year=1984|publisher=VNR AG|isbn=978-0-07-079169-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27763975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costumes==
Costumes during this time were very similar to Elizabethan or [[English Renaissance theatre]] costumes. Actors dressed as lavishly as finances permitted and contracts even had special allowances for costumes. Records show that actors paid anywhere from 1/5 to 1/2 of their salary for one costume and some even petitioned civic officials for extra funds for costumes. Towns gave awards for acting and costumes, showing that the quality of the costumes was quite important to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brockett|first1=Oscar|title=History of the Theatre|date=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Boston|isbn=0-205-47360-1|pages=134â146|edition=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government made many rules dictating the specifications of costumes. For example, actors performing in Auto Sacramentales had to wear silk or velvet and women were forbidden to wear strange headdresses, dÃ©colletÃ© necklines, or wide-hooped or non-floor length skirts. As well, actors were only allowed to wear one costume per play, unless it was specifically stated in the text.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt;

==Design elements==
Three kinds of scenic background were utilized: the facade; the curtains concealing the facade, which were used when the location was not particularly important; and medieval-type mansions, which were sometimes erected on the main stage. As spectacle increased after 1650, painted flats with doors and windows were set into the facade in place of curtains. After a period of time, awnings were rigged over the seating, and, eventually, the addition of a permanent roof made it an indoor theatre.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; In the 1640s and 1650s set designs of new public and court theatres were supervised by Italian designers.&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt; Machines that simulated wind and the sounds of thunder (created with [[Thunder machine (instrument)|metal sheets]] or dropping planks of wood), rain (similar to a large [[rainstick]], and a swelling ocean were quite common and delighted theatregoers of this time. Musicians were also commonly used to create moods and important sound effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehr|first1=Nathan|title=Golden Age Theater Performance: Hearing and Perceiving|journal=Divergencias|date=2009|volume=7|issue=1|url=http://divergencias.arizona.edu/sites/divergenciasweb.arizona.edu/files/articles/goldenage.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Unlike the rest of Europe, Spain had unique theatre traditions. Religious plays continued to be produced and popular into the 1700s, religious and secular theatre thrived side by side,&lt;ref name=westerntheatrehistory /&gt; and actors were accepted in church and as worthwhile members of society. As well, Spain pioneered a three-act model for plays instead of the classic five acts,&lt;ref name=pasto /&gt; allowed women on stage,&lt;ref name=gainor/&gt; and had an organized and efficient system of actor contracts, travel stipends, licenses, and booking. Most importantly, Spanish Golden Age theatre produced wonderful politically and philosophically allegorical plays such as Calderon's ''[[Life is a Dream]]'', and Lope de Vega's ''[[Fuente Ovejuna]]'', that spoke specifically to the audience of the time.&lt;ref name=muir&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40339624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources of influence for the emerging national theatre of Spain were as diverse as the theatre that nation produced during the Golden Age. Storytelling traditions originating in Italian [[Commedia dell'arte]]&lt;ref name=johnston&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coursesindrama.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=82 |title=Background to SpanishH Drama â Medieval to Renascence Drama &gt; Spanish Golden Age Drama â Drama Courses |publisher=Courses in Drama |date=2007-12-23 |accessdate=2012-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921100614/http://www.coursesindrama.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=82 |archivedate=2011-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the uniquely Spanish expression of [[Western Europe]]'s traveling minstrel entertainments&lt;ref name="burningham"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce R.

'''Stephan K. Miller''' (May 6, 1968 â April 22, 2008) was an American [[Animal training|animal trainer]], [[Wrangler (profession)|wrangler]], and [[stunt double]] who was killed by a bear while making a promotional video. Miller had worked as a trainer at Predators in Action, an animal training facility operated by his cousin, Randy Miller, that trains wild and exotic animals for film and television appearances. At the time of his death, Miller was not working as a trainer, but was attempting to perform a bear wrestling stunt supervised by Randy Miller.&lt;ref name=flaccus42508&gt;Flaccus, Gillian, "Animal Trainer Distraught Over Fatal Bear Attacks," Aiken (S.C.) Standard, April 25, 2008, p. 7C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal training career==
Miller was an experienced animal trainer who had worked for Predators in Action for several years before leaving to pursue other business ventures. Although he was not the trainer for the bear that killed him, he was experienced with bears, having helped Randy Miller raise and train a previous bear named Dakota. Films in which animals trained by the facility appeared (including after Miller's departure) include ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996 film)|The Island of Dr. Moreau]]'', ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'', ''[[The Last Samurai]], and [[Semi-Pro]]''. Predators in Action animals have also appeared on [[Discovery Channel]] and [[National Geographic Society]] programs in which they recreated famous animal attacks, including the mauling of [[Siegfried &amp; Roy|Roy Horn]] by a [[white tiger]].&lt;ref name=flaccus42508 /&gt;&lt;ref name=facetoface&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Sharon Petzold (producer-writer), Sue Houghton (director) | title = Grizzly Face to Face: Hollywood Bear Tragedy | medium = television documentary | publisher = National Geographic Channel | location = United States | date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On April 22, 2008, while filming a promotional video at the Predators in Action facility, Miller was killed by a 4-year old [[grizzly bear]] named Rocky.&lt;ref name=bearnoconcern&gt;[[Associated Press]], [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=20080424&amp;id=gmYzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WyEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5079,5087873&amp;hl=en Bear gave off no reasons for concern before trainer's death]; Lodi (Cal.) News-Sentinel, April 23, 2008, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7364394.stm Hollywood film bear kills handler]; [[BBC News]], April 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/movie-star-grizzly-bear-kills-trainer-bite-neck-article-1.283397 Movie star grizzly bear kills trainer with bite to the neck], [[Daily News (New York)]], April 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352211,00.html Grizzly bear that appeared in Will Ferrell film kills trainer in California]; [[Fox News Channel]], April 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Rocky was a bear actor who had been trained to wrestle humans. At that time, he was best known for his appearance as "Dewey the Killer Bear" in the 2008 film ''[[Semi-Pro]]'', in which he wrestled [[Will Ferrell]]'s body double Randy Miller.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FOX" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;Bone, James, [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/americas/article1997232.ece Hollywood bear could be destroyed after killing trainer with a single bite], [[The Times]] (London), April 24, 2008, accessed May 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephan Miller had asked to be filmed wrestling Rocky for an advertisement. Although Stephan Miller had not been involved in training Rocky, Randy Miller agreed to the request because Stephan Miller was an experienced trainer and had also recently been in a photoshoot with Rocky and gotten to know him slightly. 

The plan was to first take some shots of Stephan Miller and Rocky casually standing next to each other and then later begin the staged wrestling match. However, during the initial shots, Rocky stood up in his trained wrestling posture and began the staged attack too early, catching Miller off guard without his arm raised in the proper defensive position. Randy Miller then hit Rocky with a cane, trying to make him let go of Stephan, an action that Randy later said might have unwittingly escalated the bear attack.&lt;ref name=facetoface /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SharedNow exclusive interview with Randy Miller, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d-W287aE68 Will Farrell's Grizzly Bear Exclusive]&lt;/ref&gt; The 7Â½-foot-tall, 700-pound bear bit Stephan Miller on the neck once, piercing his [[jugular vein]] and [[common carotid artery|carotid artery]].  An [[autopsy]] revealed that he died within minutes of the attack.&lt;ref name=facetoface /&gt;&lt;ref name=bearnoconcern /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flaccus, Gillian, [http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2008Apr24/0,4675,GrizzlyAttack,00.html Calif. opens inquiry into fatal grizzly bear attack]; FoxNews.com, April 24, 2008, accessed May 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Stephan Miller's death, the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] initiated a probe into the events of the attack with the intent to eventually decide whether Rocky would be euthanized.&lt;ref&gt;Miquel Marquez, Rich McHugh, Olivia Sterna, Emily Friedman. [http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=4709492&amp;page=1 Should Rocky the Bear be euthanized?]; [[ABC News]], April 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) and other animal rights groups, who have long protested use of wild animals in films, called for Rocky to be spared and to be allowed to retire to a [[zoo]] or another similar facility.&lt;ref&gt;Wathne, Lisa.[http://yubanet.com/california/PETA-Urges-Predators-in-Action-to-Retire-Grizzly-Bear-Following-Fatal-Attack.php#.VVnl4_lVikq PETA urges Predators in action to retire Grizzly bear following fatal attack]; [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], April 23, 2008. Originally published at PETA.com, archived at yubanet.com, accessed May 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, David.

It was later revealed on the [[National Geographic Channel]] program ''Grizzly Face to Face: Hollywood Bear Tragedy'' that the coroner's office and the [[California Department of Fish and Game]] ruled Miller's death accidental and did not order that the bear be euthanized. However, Rocky was required to live under restrictions and was no longer able to have contact with persons other than his trainers. He could no longer be exhibited or used for film or TV work. In ''Grizzly Face to Face'', Randy Miller stated that he planned to continue working with Rocky and try to get the restrictions lifted because he believed that Stephan would have wanted that.&lt;ref name=facetoface /&gt;

In 2012, the California Fish and Game Commission considered whether to lift the restrictions on Rocky's permit to allow him to again work in the state of California. According to Randy Miller and Rocky's legal team, new safety protocols had been put in place; other animal trainers and experts had supplied testimony that Rocky was not dangerous; a petition drive had shown that many persons from around the world supported his return to work; and the U.S. Department of Agriculture had cleared him to work, with the only remaining restrictions being in California, the location of most available work for Rocky. Following a hearing on October 3, 2012, the Commission decided not to remove Rocky's permit restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsblaze.com/story/20121003084354zzzz.nb/topstory.html "'Rocky' the Grizzly Bear Subject of Hearing in Sacramento,"] Newsblaze.com, Oct. 3, 2012, accessed May 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;California Fish and Game Commission, [http://www.americanalbacore.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Final-12_10_03.pdf Agenda for Meeting of Oct. 3, 2012], Americanalbacore.com, Oct. 3, 2012, accessed May 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Animal Defenders International, [http://www.ad-international.org/animals_in_entertainment/go.php?id=2913 "Lions in 'Gambit' Movie Were Trained By Man Whose Bear Attacked and Killed His Cousin"], ad-international.org, November 19, 2012, accessed May 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other ventures ==
In addition to his work with animals, Miller was also a co-publisher for the first three print issues of ''[[Girls and Corpses]]'' magazine with publisher/editor-in-chief [[Robert Steven Rhine]], as well as being actively involved in the launch of the [[ShareNow]] [[Social network service|social networking]] website.&lt;ref&gt;Larocco, Paul.

'''''Tails Up!''''' was a 1918 London revue presented by [[AndrÃ© Charlot]] starring [[Jack Buchanan]]. The premiere took place at the [[Comedy Theatre, London]] on 1 June 1918 with [[Philip Braham]] conducting the band, and the show ran for 467 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Lionel ''The Stage Year Book'' Carson &amp; Comerford Limited, 1919, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepingscore.x10.mx/tailsup.html Keepingscore "Tails Up"]&lt;/ref&gt;

"This is what he had written: Peter Pan has had to do the latest dance; Wendy too thought she would like to take a chance; Captain Hook was really most disgusted; Smee and Starky seemed to look quite flustered, And pretty little Tinker Bell said to Peter Pan,..."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6822">==History==
Television was first introduced in 1964, when a new organization called [[Radio Television Afghanistan]] ([[government]]-owned) founded [[RTA TV|a TV channel]]. After the completion of feasibility study under grant aid from [[Japan]], construction work of the studio and transmitter buildings were finished by August 1978. During the 1980s, many Soviet programmes were airing such as the children's show ''[[Nu Pogodi!]]''.

From 1992 onwards television went into a steep decline as a result of the war in the city of Kabul, destroying infrastructure.

During the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban rule]] between 1996 and 2001, television was strictly banned. Stores were not allowed to sell [[TV]]s, [[satellite dish]]es, [[videocassette recorder|VCRs]], or other similar technology entertainment devices. Anyone owning or watching TV was arrested and punished. The national television broadcaster was closed down, whilst private broadcasters' buildings and studios were smashed by the regime's police.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pressreference.com/A-Be/Afghanistan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The territories that were controlled by the moderate rival [[Northern Alliance]] did not have any restrictions on television. In the country's northeast of the province of [[Badakhshan]], a television channel financed by the [[Northern Alliance]] broadcast news and movies to approximately 5,000 people in the city of [[Fayzabad]]. When the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] came to power in December 2001, Radio Television Afghanistan ([[RTA TV]]), Afghanistan's [[Afghanistan]]]][[SHAMSHAD RADIO &amp; TELEVISION NETWORK]] a commercial [[television station]] operating in [[Afghanistan]] launched in October 2005 by [[SHAMSHAD RADIO &amp; TELEVISION NETWORK]], it became one of the first commercial stations in the country and laid the foundation for an accessible media outlet by offering a large library of shows. It is currently Afghanistan's most popular television channel.

As of 2016, Afghanistan has 174 radio stations, 83 private television stations, and 22 state-owned provincial channels, including [[RTA TV]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/2016_Survey-of-the-Afghan-People_full-survey.Apr2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television ownership and viewership===
&lt;!-- ----------------------updated figures as of 2016 per The Asia Foundation Report of 'A Survey of the Afghan People in 2016----------------------------------------------------- --&gt;

According to The Asia Foundation Report of 'A Survey of the Afghan People in 2016', ownership of television is concentrated in urban areas, where electricity is more dependable and corresponds to increased household income.

===Transmission===
In Afghanistan, many people watch TV through traditional [[analog television|analog]] [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] signals using indoor [[Television antenna|antenna]]s (some outdoors too). Satellite TV viewership is high.

On January 2013 Afghanistan's Ministry of Communication and Information Technology held a meeting with TV broadcasters on plans to switch from analogue to [[Digital television broadcasting|digital transmission]] systems. Afghanistan has adopted the [[DVB-T2]] standard and the swit-chover would begin in Kabul.

On Sunday, August 31, 2014 Afghanistanâs digital TV system officially inaugurated by the second vice president of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan H. E. Mohammad Karim Khalili and Minister of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) H. E. Amirzai Sangin in a ceremony officially held in Kabul Serena Hotel. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaltvnews.net/?p=24674&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Boy and the King''''' is a 1992 feature-length animated film made in Egypt by the [[Islamic]] film company [[Astrolabe Pictures]]. It includes a soundtrack of Islamic songs in English, performed by young Muslims.

== Plot summary ==
The story surrounds a young boy called Obaid. He is confronted with a choice to live an easy life in this world or to struggle for reward in the [[Akhirah|hereafter]]. The story takes place during the tyrannical rule of King Narsis, who controls his people by encouraging them to worship idols and frightening them with the magic of Cinatas, his evil sorcerer. Cinatas chooses Obaid to be his student, someone who will assist him in his magic. At first, the boy is tempted by dreams of the power and the influence he will wield as the king's next sorcerer. But, soon after he starts to question his priorities. He begins talking to a righteous and a very holy man, who opens his mind to the true meaning of life.

This righteous man tells Obaid that there is only one God, [[Allah]] Almighty and that He created mankind to worship Him alone. Though these words appeal to Obaid's heart and mind, he is still pretty much confused. The righteous man advises him to seek the truth on his own â and thus begins the boyâs quest for the real meaning of life.

== Sources ==
This story is taken from an authentic narration or a [[hadith]] of [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] that explains the reference to "the [[people of the Ditch]]" in [[Al-Burooj|Surat Al-Burooj]] from the [[Qurâan]] (85:4). The Qur'anic story is about a boy who believes in Allah Almighty, and he is blessed with divine protection from the plotting of a wicked king and a sorcerer.

'''Thomas Barrasford''' (1859â1910) was a 19th-century English business entrepreneur and entertainment [[impresario]], who owned and built a number of theatres across Britain under the '''Barrasford Halls''' brand.

==Early career==
Born in [[South Shields]], [[County Durham]], the son of a [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] [[publican]], Barrasford attended the Royal Scotch Arms pub, and noticed its transformation under his later competitors [[Edward Moss|Moss]] and Thornton into the Empire Music Hall in 1890. In 1895, in partnership with a man named Varah, Barrasford took over the wooden circus on the Ormond Street, [[Jarrow]], turning it into a music hall, known as the [[Jarrow Palace of Varieties]].&lt;ref name=NMH&gt;{{cite book|title=Northern Music Hall|author=Frank Graham/G.J. Mellor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expanding his empire quickly from 1899, he acquired the Leeds Tivoli theatre, renaming it the [[Leeds Hippodrome]] on 20 March 1899.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt; This was his first encounter with fellow impresario [[Oswald Stoll|Sir Oswald Stoll]], whose chain had just opened the [[Leed Empire theatre]], whose features and scale had, less than two months later, brought about the failure of the lessor and resultant sale of the Tivoli to Barrasford. Barrasford noticed that fellow impresario [[Frank MacNaughten]] in [[Bradford]] had countered the opening of the Stoll [[Bradford Empire]] in January 1899, by using an idea pioneered by George "Champagne Charlie" Laybourne in 1870 in his [[River Wear|Wear]] music hall, offering a "twice nightly" performance schedule. The formula proved so successful at not only countering the drop in attendance figures normally experienced in existing theatres facing competition from a new Stoll theatre, but actually increased revenues. Barrasford borrowed MacNaughten's Bradford theatre manager to replicate the system in Leeds, with the choice proving so successful and lucrative, that Barrasford moved his home and the operational headquarters of his business to [[Leeds]].&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

==Rivalry with Sir Oswald Stoll==
The form of entertainment contract at the time was called a "tour," whereby an impresario would book an act to tour all of his venues. Barrasford had noticed that Stoll would try to run his theatres cheaply, by booking foreign acts on a one-week trial contract to fill-in for his headline British acts: if they were a success then they got a tour, if not their contract would terminate at the end of the week. Barrasford hence started to attend Stoll's theatres in competition to his on a Monday, and if the act proved a success would then find them and sign them to a tour of his theatres. This skull dugery as far as Stoll was concerned was immoral, and after he banned Barrasford and his employees from the entire Stoll empire, so began a long term battle between the two impresarios.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

==Building the tour==
Barrasford in return set about competing against Stoll, by resolving to build his theatres bigger and better than the Moss and Stoll empires. In 1900 he acquired the [[Grand Theatre, Edinburgh]] (renamed from the Tivoli Theatre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Edinburgh/Grand.htm|title=Grand Theatre, Edinburgh|publisher=Arthur Lloyd|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 he acquired the [[Birmingham Hippodrome]] (renamed from the Tower theatre), and then the [[Alhambra theatre]], [[Kingston upon Hull]].&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt; In 1902 he acquired the [[Glasgow Hippodrome]], but his most important theatre in his business opened that year, the [[Bank Holiday]] opening of the brand new 4,000 seat [[Bertie Crewe]] designed [[Liverpool Royal Hippodrome]], with prices at rock bottom.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt; Although the now combined [[Moss Empires|Moss-Stoll consortia]] already had a theatre in the city, they specifically built the [[Liverpool Olympia]] close by. Opened with a production of ''[[Tally Ho!]]'' direct from the [[London Hippodrome]], it never paid its way thanks to the pulling power of the scale, extravagance and "twice-nightly" format of the Barrasford Hall.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

Barrasford followed this success with the 1903 opening of the brand new [[Newcastle Pavilion]] in Westgate Road, with a bill topped by Tyneside [[contralto]] Madame Belle Cole. Barrasford in competition to Moss-Stoll added two further existing theatres to his tour in Liverpool: the Lyric Theatre in [[Everton Valley]] (opened Easter Monday, 1903); and the St Helens Hippodrome (previously the St Helens Empire), which opened with [[Fred Karno]]'s comedy company in a production of ''Jail Birds.''&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt; Barrasford also added the [[Grand Theatre, Manchester]] and the Regent Theatre in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], neither of which proved financially successful and where hence quickly disposed of.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

In 1904, the second new Barrasford Hall opened in [[Glasgow]], the Bertie Crewe designed [[Pavilion Theatre (Glasgow)|Glasgow Pavilion]] on 29 February 1904.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt; Barrasford also expanded south at this time, adding the [[Bristol Empire]] and the [[Brighton Hippodrome]].&lt;ref name="Musgrave311"&gt;{{Harvnb|Musgrave|1981|p=311.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took over the lease on the [[Britannia Theatre, Hoxton]], letting Crewe refurbish it, but handed the lease over to Frank MacNaughten after nine months.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

The [[St Helens Hippodrome]] was the fourteenth music hall added to the Tour in four years, with the empire spanning the following:&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt; Palace, Jarrow; Tivoli, Leeds; Tivoli, Edinburgh and Tivoli, Birmingham; Alhambra, Hull; Empire, Bristol; Lyric, Everton; Grand, Manchester, and Regent, Salford. The Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, together with the Hippodromes at Liverpool, Glasgow and Brighton and St. Helens.

Barrasford now expanded the physical footprint of his theatres further afield. Registering Barrasford Circuit as a limited company at Leicester Place, off [[Leicester Square]], London, Barrasford was listed as managing director, and Hugh Astley ex-manager of the [[London Pavilion]] as chairman. They then purchased the [[Newcastle Pavilion]], and after the closure of the Hoxton venture, took on Stoll in a direct race to open in the Westend. Barrasford bought the old [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], just off [[Strand, London|The Strand]], which he commissioned Bertie Crewe to refurbish. Although Stoll's Empire won the opening race (Christmas Eve, 1904), the Lyceum opened on [[Boxing Day]].&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

But much of Barrasford's financial success had been based on alcohol sales, and London County Council refused a license on principle for the Lyceum. Although the Lyceum attracted royal patronage before the Empire, with the first production of the ballet ''Excelsior'' seen by the Prince and Princess of Wales, afterwards [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

By mid-1905, Barrasford Halls were facing a mini-financial crisis. Barrasford, in trying to out pace Stoll by trialling acts in Europe, had opened Alhambra-themed halls in [[Brussels]] and Paris. However, the former had quickly burnt down less than a year after opening, while both Paris and the Lyceum were losing money. With no possibility of a liquor license, Barrasford sold the Lyceum to the Melville family for Â£240,000.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

==Consolidation==
Barrasford moved the centre of his business operations to [[Brighton]]. Having turned the ice rink into the [[Brighton Hippodrome]] in 1902, he acquired an old music hall in New Road and refurbished it as the [[Brighton Coliseum]]. Barrasford himself lived in a converted warehouse next to the Hippodrome, called Hippodrome House.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

There now followed a period of consolidation around the business. The Tivoli, Leeds, was refurbished and renamed the New Hippodrome, opening in 1906. The Hull Alhambra was refurbished as the New Hippodrome, but on completion of works the lease was handed to its manager Alfred Graham. The opening of the [[Coventry Hippodrome]] on 31 December 1906, also coincided with disposal of the loss-making theatres in Manchester.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

On 23 December 1907, the Crewe designed [[Sheffield Hippodrome]] opened, followed the following year in the opening of the last Barrasford Hall, the Crewe designed [[Nottingham Hippodrome]], opening on 28 September 1908.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

==Other interests==
Barrasford was an enthusiastic [[race horse]] owner, and after becoming a prominent figure at the [[Jockey Club]], inventing the starting device the "Barrasford Gate."&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt; On an occasion of being assured that his horse would win at [[Pontefract Racecourse]], he placed a five-shilling bet on behalf of every member of his staff at the Leed's Tivoli. After it won, the performances that night were cancelled at the Tivoli, as the entire staff spent the night celebrating.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

==Cinema, and retirement==
Barrasford was an early adopter of the new moving pictures invention, creating the Barrascope system for [[cinematograph]] projection. Holding a patent with Leeds photographer Owen Brooks, with assistance from an engineer named Borland, they first put the machine into the Leeds Tivoli from 1902. He later adapted a number of his theatres to use it, including the Brighton Coliseum in 1909.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

By now, Barrasford was suffering from persistent ill health from [[Bright's Disease]], and impresarios in USA and Britain expressed interest in taking over his entire tour. [[Sir Alfred Butt]] succeeded, in association with the Orpheum Circuit of America, and developed a new British circuit which rivalled the Moss-Stoll combine. Barrasford died at his home in Brighton on 1 February 1910.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt; His second wife was former music hall singer [[Maud D'Almayne]], with whom he had three sons, all of whom worked in the theatre business. His funeral was one of the largest ever held in Brighton.&lt;ref name=NMH/&gt;

'''Weet weet''' (also called '''wit-wit''' or '''throwing the play stick''') is an Australian [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] children's throwing game popular in some parts of [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Haagen1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Haagen|title=Bush Toys: Aboriginal Children at Play|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIqhiI8NnYgC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=14 November 2012|year=1994|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press|isbn=978-0-85575-245-3|pages=78â}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weet weet is also the traditional name of the object that is thrown, but it is also called a "kangaroo rat". A traditional weet weet it is difficult to recreate, so a [[Juggling club|club]] can be used and small children can play the game using a [[tennis ball]] placed in a stocking. The winner is the person to throw the weet weet the furthest or most accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/participating/indigenous/resources/games_and_activities/individual_games/target_games/weet_weet.pdf |title=Weet weet |publisher=[[Australian Sports Commission]] |accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous writer [[Mark Twain]] as an example of wit and intelligence of the Australian aborigines wrote a chapter in his book ''[[Following the Equator]]'' about the weet-weet (or kangaroo-rat) &lt;ref name="oo"&gt;[http://www.classicbookshelf.com/library/mark_twain/following_the_equator/20/ ''Following the Equator'', Chapter XXI; Mark Twain.]&lt;/ref&gt; But the mentioned chapter is not a simple description of an exotic toy, it is a blunt and critical summary of the white man's genocide actions against indigenous.&lt;ref name = "oo"/&gt;

In the past Aboriginal Australians used weet weets for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cv.vic.gov.au/stories/the-koorie-heritage-trust-collections-and-history/4851/weet-weet/ |title=Weet weet |publisher=Culture Victoria |accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wet 'n Wild''' was a {{convert|27|acre|sing=on}} [[water park]] located at 2601 South [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in [[Winchester, Nevada|Winchester]], [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Park Information|url=http://www.wetnwildlv.com:80/parkinfo/|publisher=Wet 'n Wild|accessdate=March 6, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803201401/http://www.wetnwildlv.com:80/parkinfo/|archivedate=August 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property history|url=http://sandgate.co.clark.nv.us/assrrealprop/ParcelDetail.aspx?hdnParcel=16209602001&amp;hdnInstance=pcl7|publisher=Clark County Assessor's Office|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park opened in 1985 and operated until 2004.

==History==
Construction was underway as of October 1984, with plans to open the 27-acre park on May 1, 1985. The $12 million project was a joint venture between [[Howard Hughes|Howard Hughes Development Corporation]] â part of [[Summa Corporation]] â and San Diego-based [[Wet 'n Wild (brand)|Wet 'n' Wild]]. Howard Hughes Development Corporation conceived the project because of the potential to expand the local tourism market through family entertainment, and the [[Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority]] believed that the water park would appeal to families visiting Las Vegas. Howard Hughes Development Corporation chose a water park theme as the company did not want to compete against [[southern California]]'s [[Disneyland]] and [[Knott's Berry Farm]] theme parks, as many Las Vegas tourists were residents of southern California. The concept of a water park in Las Vegas was also considered ideal because of the city's dry and hot weather.&lt;ref name=Hopes&gt;{{cite news|last=Moreno|first=Richard|title=Aquatic amusement park hopes to attract families|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11514233/reno_gazettejournal/|accessdate=March 20, 2018|work=Reno Gazette-Journal|date=October 14, 1984|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water park was located on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], between the [[SLS Las Vegas|Sahara]] and [[El Rancho Hotel and Casino|El Rancho]] hotel-casinos. Wet 'n Wild opened on May 18, 1985, after $14 million was spent on construction. The park included three turbine engines capable of creating rolling four-foot waves in a 170-foot pool. The park also featured a 17,000-square-foot surf lagoon containing 500,000 gallons of water, ranging in depth from eight feet to two inches. The surf lagoon was a main attraction, as well as a 76-foot-high water slide known as the Der Stuka,&lt;ref name=Opens&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Barbara|title=Vegas water park opens Saturday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11514291/reno_gazettejournal/|accessdate=March 20, 2018|work=Reno Gazette-Journal|date=May 16, 1985|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; located along [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] on the property's west end, south of the Sahara.&lt;ref name=LVS-2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Velotta|first=Richard N.|title=Wet 'n' Wild water park coming to Las Vegas|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2012/oct/04/wet-n-wild-water-park-returning-las-vegas/|accessdate=April 2, 2018|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 500,000 people were expected to visit the water park during its first year.&lt;ref name=Hopes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opens/&gt; By June 1986, park attendance had increased 19.7 percent from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Tourism boom expected|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11514544/reno_gazettejournal/|accessdate=March 20, 2018|work=Reno Gazette-Journal|date=June 30, 1986|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A capsule known as the Bomb Bay was eventually added atop the Der Stuka. The Bomb Bay required people to push a button, which opened the floor beneath them, plummeting riders to the slide approximately 20 feet below.&lt;ref name=LVS-2012/&gt;

In 1993, the park was sued by Russell Beatty, a man who suffered temporary paralysis after his neck was broken in three areas. Beatty had been waiting for his son at the bottom of the Hydro Blaster water slide and was struck by a 275-pound man. Beatty alleged that lifeguards allowed the man to go down the slide too soon, resulting in the injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man sues Vegas water park|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11514502/reno_gazettejournal/|accessdate=March 20, 2018|work=Reno Gazette-Journal|date=September 3, 1993|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was acquired by [[Universal Studios]] in October 1998, [[Ogden Corp]] in March 1999, [[Alfa SmartParks]] in March 2000, and [[Palace Entertainment]] on July 10, 2002.&lt;ref name="sun" /&gt; The park closed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Water Park to be Named Wet 'n' Wild Las Vegas |author=Caroline Bleakley |url=http://www.8newsnow.com/story/19739061/breaking-news-new-water-park |newspaper=[[KLAS-TV]] |date=October 12, 2012 |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vegas water park resurrects 'Wet 'n' Wild' name |author=Matt Guillermo |url=http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/19724748/vegas-water-park-resurrects-wet-n-wild-name |newspaper=[[KVVU-TV]] |date=October 3, 2012 |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wet 'n Wild sold for fourth time in four years |author=Jennifer Robison |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2002/jul/10/wet-n-wild-sold-for-fourth-time-in-four-years/ |newspaper= [[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=July 10, 2002 |accessdate=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redevelopment plans===
In March 2007, [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]] and [[Christopher Milam]] announced plans to purchase the site for $1.2 billion. They intended to replace it with a mixed-use tower called the [[Crown Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvrj.com/business/7782551.html ReviewJournal.com - Business - Australian magnate to invest in LV casino&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the project was estimated to be $5 billion, and its original completion date was set for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22115300-5001021,00.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Packer's high Vegas punt | first=Rhys | last=Haynes | date=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, the project's cancellation was announced and the site was put up for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/pdf/Crown%20cancelled.pdf |title=Packer dealt a dead hand in Vegas |date=26 March 2008 |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |author=Michael West }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of turning the abandoned site into a stadium began in 2010, when Milam revealed plans for the [[All Net Resort and Arena|Silver State Arena]]. Milam's company International Development Management would get the 27-acre land from [[Sue Lowden]] and her husband Paul, and atop build a 20,000-seat stadium at the cost of $750 million, using about $9 million a year in redevelopment district taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/norm-clarke/developer-touts-20000-seat-arena|title=Developer touts 20,000-seat arena|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project stalled after [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] rejected a proposal to fund 15% of the venue with public money and nearby residents opposed construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/2012/jul/15/las-vegas-history-filled-failed-stadium-arena-proj/|title=Las Vegas' history filled with failed stadium, arena projects|author=Case Keefer|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, businessman [[Jackie Robinson (basketball, born 1955)|Jackie Robinson]], a former [[UNLV]] student and [[NBA]] player, announced that he was planning on using the same site of the proposed Silver State Arena to build the [[All Net Resort and Arena]], a $1.4 billion privately funded complex encompassing an arena, hotel and shopping project that could attract an NBA franchise to Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/2013/dec/23/another-arena-proposed-las-vegas-strip/|title=Another arena proposed for the Las Vegas Strip|author=Richard N.

'''ZST''' (pronounced ''Zest'') is a [[Japan]]-based [[mixed martial arts]] promotion and sanctioning organization holding amateur and semi-professional MMA events. ZST adopts unique rules in the MMA industry and also used to hold tag-team MMA matches.

==History==

===Before establishment===
ZST was conceived in efforts to accommodate fighters of [[puroresu]] MMA promotion [[Fighting Network Rings|RINGS]] that went defunct in February 2002. On September 22, 2002, [[Takeshi Caesar]], the president of Shoot Boxing Association (SBA), and Koki Hioki, representative of ZST, had a conversation after a Shoot Boxing event, and they announced that SBA would support ZST. For this reason, ZST promoted some matches under [[shoot boxing]] rule early on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boutreview.com/data/news/021123zst.html 11.23 ãã£ãã¡ï¼ã¤ãã¿ã¯ãç´æ´ãªãªãã¢ãã¢äººã³ã³ããæçºã11.23 Differ Ariake: Takumi Yano provokes the naive Lithuanian pair] BoutReview: 2002-11-22. Reverted: 2008-9-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First event===
The first ZST event "''The Battle Field ZST Opening Event''" was arranged on November 23, 2002 in Tokyo, and it has since experienced a dramatic increase in popularity possibly in large part due to their highly different rule format. In this event, not only usual MMA matches but MMA [[tag match]] also was held among [[Takumi Yano]], [[Masakazu Imanari]] and [[Remigijus Morkevicius]], [[Mindaugas Stankos]]

Iri-Hori pair upstages the first event] BoutReview: 2003-1-4. Reverted:2008-9-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ZST GP===
On November 23, 2003, "ZST GP Opening" was held in Tokyo.

On May 17, 2008, ZST announced a major partnership with [[Deep (mixed martial arts)|DEEP]]. The partnership will allow the two organizations to co-promote shows, share fighters and eventually unify the organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles.asp?n_id=12771 Deep, ZST Partner Up&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

===ZST Rule===
Bouts consist of three rounds with a rest period of one and a half minutes. The first and second rounds are five minutes in duration and the third round is three minutes in duration, but the third round is an extra round. Punches, elbow strikes, knees and kicks are allowed to the head and body when both fighters are standing. On the ground punches, elbow strikes, knees and kicks are only allowed to the body. Bouts are not judged. In the event that the bout goes the full-time, the bout is ruled a draw.

===Grappling rule (GT-F Rule)===
Bouts consist of two rounds with a rest period of one and two minutes. The first and second rounds are five minutes in duration. The positioning is not regarded for scoring as important factor and any motions including [[clinching position|clinching]] and holding which impedes bouts are prohibited. GT-F came from "Grappling Tournament - Featherweight".
