'''101955 Bennu''' (provisional designation {{mp|1999 RQ|36}})&lt;ref name="contest"/&gt; is a [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous asteroid]] in the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo]] group discovered by the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] Project on September 11, 1999. It is a [[potentially hazardous object]] that is listed on the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] with the second-highest cumulative rating on the [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]].&lt;ref name="risk-table" /&gt; It has a cumulative 1-in-2,700 chance of impacting Earth between 2175–2199.&lt;ref name="Sentry"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Meteoritics"/&gt; It is the planned target of the [[OSIRIS-REx]] mission which is intended to [[Sample return mission|return samples]] to Earth in 2023 for further study.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160908"&gt;{{cite news |last=Corum |first=Jonathan |title=NASA Launches the Osiris-Rex Spacecraft to Asteroid Bennu |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/08/science/space/nasa-osiris-rex-launch.html |date=8 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=9 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20160908-kc"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=The Osiris-Rex Spacecraft Begins Chasing an Asteroid |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/science/nasa-launches-osiris-rex-spacecraft-to-retrieve-asteroid-pieces.html |date=8 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=9 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---&lt;ref name="NYT-20160905"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=NASA Aims at an Asteroid Holding Clues to the Solar System’s Roots |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/science/nasa-osiris-rex-asteroid-bennu-sample.html |date=September 5, 2016 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;---&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20150331-db"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA press release" /&gt;

{{mp|101955 Bennu}} has a mean diameter of approximately {{convert|492|m|ft mi|abbr=on}} and has been observed extensively with the [[Arecibo Observatory]] planetary radar and the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] [[Deep Space Network]].&lt;ref name="Nolan2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GDSCC-img" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hudson et al. 2000" /&gt;

== Physical description ==
Asteroid Bennu has a roughly spheroidal shape, which resembles a [[spinning top]]. The direction of rotation about its axis is [[retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde]] with respect to its orbit. Bennu has a fairly smooth shape with one prominent {{val|10|–|20|u=m}} boulder on its surface, in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Meteoritics"/&gt;

There is a well-defined ridge along the equator of asteroid Bennu. The presence of this ridge suggests that fine-grained regolith particles have accumulated in this area, possibly because of its low gravity and fast rotation.&lt;ref name="Meteoritics"/&gt;

Observations of this minor planet by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] in 2007 gave an effective diameter of {{Val|484|10|u=m}}, which is in line with other studies. It has a low visible geometric albedo of {{Val|0.046|0.005}}. The [[thermal inertia]] was measured and found to vary by ±19% during each rotational period. The data suggest that the [[regolith]] grain size is moderate, ranging from several millimeters up to a centimeter, and evenly distributed longitudinally. No emission from a potential dust coma has been detected around asteroid Bennu, which puts a limit of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g of dust within a radius of 4750&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Emery2014/&gt;

[[Astrometry|Astrometric]] observations between 1999 and 2013 have demonstrated that 101955 Bennu is influenced by the [[Yarkovsky effect]], causing the [[semimajor axis]] to drift on average by {{Val|284|1.5}}&amp;nbsp;meters/year. Analysis of the gravitational and thermal effects has given a bulk density of ρ = {{Val|1260|70}}&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is only slightly denser than water. Therefore, the predicted macroporosity is {{Val|40|10}}%, suggesting that the interior has a rubble pile structure. The estimated mass is {{Val|7.8|0.9|e=10|u=kg}}.&lt;ref name=ChesleyFarnocchia2014/&gt;

=== Photometry and spectroscopy ===
[[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometric]] observations of Bennu in 2005 yielded a synodic [[rotation period]] of {{Val|4.2905|0.0065|u=h}}. It has a [[B-type asteroid|B-type]] classification, which is a sub-category of [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous]] asteroids. Polarimetric observations show that Bennu belongs to the rare [[F-type asteroid|F]] subclass of carbonaceous asteroids, which is usually associated with cometary features.&lt;ref name="Cellino2018"/&gt; Measurements over a range of [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angles]] showed a phase function slope of 0.040 magnitudes per degree, which is similar to other near-Earth asteroids with low albedo.&lt;ref name=Hergenrother2013/&gt;

== Origin and evolution ==
The carbonaceous material that composes asteroid Bennu originally came from dying stars such as [[red giants]] and [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last1=Bensby |first1=T.
 |last2=Feltzing |first2=S.
 |year=2006
 |title=The origin and chemical evolution of carbon in the Galactic thin and thick discs
 |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] theory, this material came together 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;years ago during the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|formation of the Solar System]].

Asteroid Bennu's basic mineralogy and chemical nature would have been established during the first 10 million years of the Solar System's formation, where the carbonaceous material underwent some geologic heating and chemical transformation into more complex minerals.&lt;ref name="Meteoritics"/&gt; Bennu probably began in the inner [[asteroid belt]] as a fragment from a larger body with a diameter of 100&amp;nbsp;km. Simulations suggest a 70% chance it came from the [[Polana family]] and a 30% chance it derived from the [[495 Eulalia|Eulalia]] family.&lt;ref name=Bottke2015/&gt;

Subsequently, the orbit drifted as a result of the [[Yarkovsky effect]] and [[mean motion resonance]]s with the giant planets, such as [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. Various interactions with the planets in combination with the Yarkovsky effect modified the asteroid, possibly changing its spin, shape, and surface features.&lt;ref name=Lauretta2015/&gt;

Cellino et al. have suggested a possible cometary origin for Bennu, based on similarities of its spectroscopic properties with known comets. The estimated fraction of comets in the population of Near Earth asteroids is {{val|8|5|u=%}}.&lt;ref name="Cellino2018"/&gt;

== Possible Earth impact ==
On average, an asteroid with a diameter of {{convert|500|m|ft mi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} can be expected to impact Earth about every 130,000 years or so.&lt;ref name="Earth-impact" /&gt; A 2010 dynamical study by [[Andrea Milani (mathematician)|Andrea Milani]] and collaborators predicted a series of eight potential Earth impacts by Bennu between 2169 and 2199. The cumulative probability of impact is dependent on physical properties of Bennu that were poorly known at the time, but was not found to exceed 0.071% for all eight encounters.&lt;ref name="Milani et al." /&gt; The authors recognized that an accurate assessment of {{mp|101955 Bennu}}'s probability of Earth impact would require a detailed shape model and additional observations (either from the ground or from spacecraft visiting the object) to determine the magnitude and direction of the [[Yarkovsky effect]].

The publication of the shape model and of astrometry based on radar observations obtained in 1999, 2005, and 2011,&lt;ref name=Nolan2013 /&gt; made possible an improved estimate of the Yarkovsky acceleration and a revised assessment of the impact probability. The {{As of|2014|alt=current (as of 2014)}} best estimate of the impact probability is a cumulative probability of 0.037% in the interval 2175 to 2196.&lt;ref name="ChesleyFarnocchia2014" /&gt; This corresponds to a cumulative score on the [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale|Palermo scale]] of −1.71. If an impact were to occur, the expected kinetic energy associated with the collision would be 1,200 megatons in [[TNT equivalent]].&lt;ref name = "Sentry"/&gt;

=== 2060 ===
Bennu will pass {{convert|0.005|au|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth on 23 September 2060.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; The close approach of 2060 causes [[wikt:divergent|divergence]] in the close approach of 2135. On 25 September 2135 the nominal approach distance is {{convert|0.002|au|km mi|abbr=on}} from Earth, but Bennu could pass as close as {{convert|0.0007|au|km mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; There is no chance of an Earth impact in 2135.&lt;ref name="Chodas2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentry"/&gt; The 2135 approach will create many lines of variations and Bennu may pass through a [[gravitational keyhole]] during the 2135 passage which could create an impact scenario at a future encounter. The keyholes are all less than 55&amp;nbsp;km wide.&lt;ref name="ChesleyFarnocchia2014"/&gt;

On 25 September 2175 there is a 1 in 24,000 chance of an Earth impact,&lt;ref name="Sentry"/&gt; but the nominal 2175 approach is in February 2175 at a distance of roughly {{convert|0.1|au|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt; The most threatening virtual impactor is on 24 September 2196 when there is a 1 in 11,000 chance of an Earth impact.&lt;ref name="Sentry"/&gt; There is a cumulative 1 in 2,700 chance of an Earth impact between 2175–2199.&lt;ref name="Sentry"/&gt;

=== Long term ===
Lauretta et al. reported in 2015 their results of a computer simulation, concluding that it is more likely that 101955 Bennu will be destroyed by some other cause:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The orbit of Bennu is intrinsically dynamically unstable, as are those of all [[Near-Earth object|NEO]]s. In order to glean probabilistic insights into the future evolution and likely fate of Bennu beyond a few hundred years, we tracked 1,000 virtual "Bennus" for an interval of 300 [[Myr]] with the gravitational perturbations of the planets Mercury–Neptune included. Our results ... indicate that Bennu has a 48% chance of falling into the Sun. There is a 10% probability that Bennu will be ejected out of the inner Solar System, most likely after a close encounter with Jupiter. The highest impact probability for a planet is with Venus (26%), followed by the Earth (10%) and Mercury (3%). The odds of Bennu striking Mars are only 0.8% and there is a 0.2% chance that Bennu will eventually collide with Jupiter.&lt;ref name=Lauretta2015/&gt;

The [[OSIRIS-REx]] mission of NASA's [[New Frontiers Program]] was launched towards {{mp|101955 Bennu}} on September 8, 2016. It is expected to reach the asteroid in August 2018 and return samples to Earth in 2023.&lt;ref name="NASA press release" /&gt;

=== Selection ===
Bennu was selected from over {{val|500,000}} known asteroids by the OSIRIS-REx selection committee. The primary constraint for selection was close proximity to Earth, since proximity implies low [[delta-v|impulse]] (Δv) required to reach an object from Earth orbit.&lt;ref name="Benner et al." /&gt; The criteria stipulated an asteroid in an orbit with low eccentricity, low inclination, and an orbital radius of {{val|0.8|-|1.6|ul=au}}.&lt;ref name="Why Bennu"/&gt; Furthermore, the candidate asteroid for a sample-return mission must have loose [[regolith]] on its surface, which implies a diameter greater than 200 meters. Asteroids smaller than this typically spin too fast to retain dust or small particles. Finally, a desire to find an asteroid with pristine carbon material from the early Solar System, possibly including volatile molecules and  [[organic compound]]s, reduced the list further.

With the above criteria applied, five asteroids remained as candidates for the OSIRIS-REx mission, and Bennu was chosen, in part for its potentially hazardous orbit.&lt;ref name="Why Bennu"/&gt;

== Name ==
The name Bennu was selected from more than eight thousand student entries from dozens of countries around the world who entered a "Name That Asteroid!" contest run by the [[University of Arizona]], [[The Planetary Society]], and the LINEAR Project.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="contest"/&gt; Third-grade student Michael Puzio from [[North Carolina]] proposed the name in reference to the Egyptian mythological bird [[Bennu]]. To Puzio, the [[OSIRIS-REx]] spacecraft with its extended TAGSAM arm resembles the Egyptian deity, which is typically depicted as a heron.&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;

'''Aeclanum''' (also spelled '''Aeculanum''', {{lang-it|Eclano}}, {{lang-grc|Ἀικούλανον}})&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/eclano_%28Enciclopedia_dell%27_Arte_Antica%29/ Aeclanun] on the ''[[Treccani|Italian Encyclopedia Treccani]]''&lt;/ref&gt; was an ancient town of [[Samnium]], southern [[Italy]], about 25&amp;nbsp;km east-southeast of [[Benevento|Beneventum]], on the [[Via Appia]]. It lies in [[Passo di Mirabella]], near the modern [[Mirabella Eclano]].

== Location ==
[[File:Aeclanum (Ruins-03).jpg|thumb|left|200px|View of the town]]
Aeclanum was on a promontory naturally defended, to some extent, by a steep slope on the south side down to the river Calore, while the north side lay open towards the crest of the ridge that carried what under the [[Roman Empire]] became the [[Via Appia]]. This led through [[Ampsanctus|Lacus Ampsanctus]] to [[Aquilonia, Italy|Aquilonia]] and [[Venusia]]. Another route to [[Apulia]], the Via Aurelia Aeclanensis diverged here, leading through modern [[Ariano]] to [[Herdoniae]]. The road from Aeclanum to [[Abellinum]] (mod.  [[Avellino]]) may also follow an ancient line. Today there are ruins of the city walls, of an [[aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]], baths and an [[amphitheatre]]; nearly 400 inscriptions have also been discovered. Excavation has revealed a long history of pre-Roman settlement.&lt;ref name=Princeton&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:id=aeclanum "AECLANUM (Eclano) Italy" in ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aeclanum|volume=1|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spazioinwind.libero.it/popoli_antichi/altro/Aeclanum.html Aeclanum]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Aeclanum became the chief town of the [[Hirpini]], after [[Benevento|Beneventum]] had become a [[Rome|Roman]] [[colony]]. [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] captured it in 89 BC by setting on fire the wooden breastwork by which it was defended, and sacked it. It quickly recovered, new fortifications were erected, and it became a ''[[municipium]]''. [[Hadrian]], who repaired the Via Appia from Beneventum to this point, made it a ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]''. With the [[Lombards|Lombard]] invasion of Italy it was annexed to the [[Duchy of Benevento]], but was captured and destroyed by [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Constans II]] in 663 and never recovered, being reduced to a small hamlet known as Quintodecimo, a name that referred to its distance of 15 miles from Benevento.&lt;ref name=Princeton/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Bishopric ==
Aeclanum became a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[episcopal see]], whose best known [[bishop]] was [[Julian of Eclanum]], who was consecrated by [[Pope Innocent I]] in about 417. He refused to sign the condemnation of [[Pelagianism]] issued by Pope Innocent's successor, [[Pope Zosimus]], and carried on a war of writings against [[Augustine of Hippo]]. It has been thought that the diocese was united to that of [[Frigento|Frequentium]] as early as the 5th century, but there is mention of Quintodecimo as a [[suffragan]] see of Benevento in 969 and 1058. From 1059 it was definitively united with Frequentium.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Cappelletti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JdUCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA180 ''Le Chiese d'Italia dalla loro origine sino ai nostri giorni''], Venezia 1864, vol. XIX, p.&amp;nbsp;180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diocesi.avellino.it/index.asp?sez=Vescovi Storia della diocesi di Avellino]&lt;/ref&gt; No longer a residential bishopric, Aeclanum is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 884&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Annai Velankanni''''' ({{lit|Mother Velankanni}}) is 1971 [[Indian film|Indian]] drama film in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The film stars [[Gemini Ganesan]], [[Jayalalithaa]], [[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]] and [[K. R. Vijaya]]. [[Kamal Haasan]] briefly appears in an uncredited role as Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite web |author=B. Vijayakumar |url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-columns/velankanni-mathavu-1977/article8011033.ece |title= Old is Gold - Velankanni Mathavu 1977 |work=[[The Hindu]] |date=December 20, 2015 |accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by noted choreographer K. Thangappan. It comprises three stories pertaining to [[Christian]] beliefs. [[Velankanni]], where the film is set, is a real village in [[India]], and has a large church dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Jesus]]. This film was dubbed into Malayalam language in 1977 as ''Velankanni Mathavu'' and in 1979 [[Hindi language|Hindi]] as ''Mata Velankanni''.

==Plot==
The story pivots around the centuries - an old [[Basilica]] of our lady of health at [[Velankanni]] village near [[Nagapattinam]] in [[Thanjavur]] district in [[Tamil Nadu]]. While the presiding deity of the Basilica, [[Mother Mary]] performing in lives of the devotee is narrated as a flashback, the story involving Nurse Mary ([[Jayalalithaa]]) and Susainathan ([[Gemini Ganesan]]) is in the present.

Mary ([[Jayalalithaa]]) is a nurse in a hospital at [[Nagapattinam]] and is a devotee of [[Mother Mary]] of [[Velankanni]]. She narrates the story of Kamakshi ([[K. R. Vijaya]]), a milkmaid and her son Sundaram in Velankanni village to a child patient [[Baby Sumathi]]. Mother Mary appears before Sundaram, who is on his way to the landlord's ([[R. Muthuraman]]) house at Nagapattinam to deliver milk. The landlord, a bureaucrat, is an atheist. Sundaram gives milk to mother Mary to feed the [[Infant Jesus]]. The landlord is annoyed about milk and does not believe the story of "A Lady with a Child" that caused the shortage. A miracle occurs - the milk pot overflows spontaneously. The Mother Mary appears before the landlord and he becomes a believer, a devotee of Mother Mary; he generously helps his tenant Karuppayyan ([[S. V. Ramadoss]]) in the conducting of his daughter's marriage Chellayi ([[Srividya]]) to her rich lover ([[Sivakumar]]).

The story of Swarnam ([[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]] and her lame son Raja ([[Master Sekhar]]) in Velankanni Village is narrated by Doctor Sundararajan ([[Major Sundararajan]]) to his assistant. Villagers often poked fun at Swarnam and Raja because of his lameness. On his way to the market to sell curds and milk, Mother Mary appears before Raja and cures him. Mother Mary assigns Raja the task of building a [[Church (building)|Church]] for her on the spot where she appeared before him under supervision of Priest Francis (S. V. Subbaiah).

Meanwhile, Mary rejects marriage proposals from young doctors in the hospital. She is waiting for mother Mary's Oracle to decide her marriage and the miracle occurs. Both Susainathan ([[Gemini Ganesan]]), the son of rich landlord in Nagapattinam and Mary have the same dream. Both of them are singing praises of the Mother Mary. The meet each other in the Church and eventually get married. While Mary is away from the hospital meeting Susainathan, the Kind mother attends to Mary's duties disguised as a nurse.&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

[[Image:Breakpoint 2004 Party Outside.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Breakpoint 2004&amp;mdash;'the real party is outside']]

'''Breakpoint''' was a [[Germany|German]] [[demoscene]] [[demoparty|party]]. From 2003 to 2010, it took place annually at [[Easter]] in [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]].

Breakpoint was the successor to the legendary [[Mekka &amp; Symposium]]. With over 1000 visitors, it was the world's biggest pure demoscene-party, attracting [[demosceners]] from not only [[Germany]], but also from other European countries (e.g. [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]]), or even from overseas (for example [[Australia]], [[Canada]]). The party was also the traditional host of the [[Scene.org Awards]] ceremony.

==History==
The concept of Breakpoint was born in late 2002 when internal tensions within the [[Mekka &amp; Symposium]] organizing team made another M&amp;S party impossible. Part of the remaining organizing team teamed up with organizers of other German demo parties like [[Dialogos]], [[Evoke (demo party)|Evoke]] and [[the Ultimate Meeting]], and decided to create a new demoscene party for [[Easter]]. The location was changed, from the northern city of [[Fallingbostel]] to [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], a small town near [[Frankfurt]]. The party place was decided to be an abandoned military depot out at the city borders.

Breakpoint 2003 proved to be an unmatched success among demosceners who attended, both veterans and newcomers applauded the party's incredible atmosphere and almost literally unlimited freedom, often designated by a large (often 25&amp;ndash;30 feet tall) [[bonfire]]. (The nearest residents lived kilometers away from the party, thus [[noise pollution]] and the general rowdiness was never an issue.) Criticisms of the party were minor, but pointed out that due to the failure of one of the heating pipes, the party hall became freezing during the night - this was actually parodied in various demos released there, entitling the party "[[freezing point|Freezepoint]]".

Breakpoint 2004 saw a major change in the funding of the party: [[ATI Technologies]] became the main sponsor of the event, and apart from the lucrative prizes, offered various other features to the party, such as seminars and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ati.amd.com/de/companyinfo/events/breakpoint/index.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709161749/http://ati.amd.com/de/companyinfo/events/breakpoint/index.html|archivedate=2012-07-09|title=Breakpoint 2004 press statement|publisher=[[ATI Technologies]]|date=5 Apr 2004|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, ATI was sponsoring a helicopter flight for willing visitors over the hills of the [[Rhine]]-region. The sponsorship remained constant until 2006. The party was an inarguable success, although not as buoyant as its precursor, especially considering that the heating issues from the year before turned out to be unsolvable due to the structure of the hall which served as a party hall &amp;mdash; this caused the party to be even colder than the previous year.

[[Image:Mainhall compo 9.jpg|thumb|View from the grand stand at Breakpoint 2005 while a competition was running.]]
Breakpoint 2005 caused some sad moments to the demoscene when it was announced that the military depot was scheduled for [[eminent domain|condemnation]] by the German government, and the next edition was scheduled to be held in the city's gym in the middle of Bingen. A part of the visitors feared that the degrees of liberty which made Breakpoint so popular will be lost at the new location, including the symbolic bonfire. They were, however, proven wrong when the party turned out to be what most people stated as "the best demoparty ever". The limited nature of freedom was proven to be enough for sceners to use the surrounding outdoors area as a chillout zone, even having a bonfire (although not as grandiose as in previous years). The new location also provided a solution to the heating problem. The floors inside were covered by the organizers by a layer of carpet so visitors were even able to walk barefoot or sleep on the floor. (Some visitors even joked about spending the night outdoors to get the "good old Breakpoint freeze-to-death-feeling".) The party's atmosphere was improved with both seminars for the interested and 4 live concerts of bands playing demoscene music live. The competitions also featured high quality releases and the event was voted as the "Best Alltime Demoparty" in the PAiN [[diskmag]].

Breakpoint 2006 promotion started almost immediately after its precursor, and many sceners who had been avoiding demoparties for years signaled that they would attend. The party organizing team created a "jungle" theme.  The party place was adorned with torches, rocks, skeletons and vines, doors were surrounded with totem pole-like ornaments, speaker stands and other accessories were wrapped in an [[Inca]]-esque setting. The party theme revolved around sceners losing their scene spirit and fighting their ways in competitions to retrieve and free them. The event featured the annual Scene.org Awards ceremony in a much more formal and ceremonial setting, and various live acts, including a performance by [[Welle: Erdball]].

Breakpoint 2007 lost one of its major sponsors, ATi, as a result of their merger with [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] (Intel remained a primary sponsor).  To keep a balanced budget, the organizers decided to not only raise the entrance fee to 60 [[Euro]]s, but to remove the "girls get in free" tradition and charge females equally.  Despite the financial challenges, 2007 featured the usual array of competitions and seminars, including one from the infamous film director, [[Uwe Boll]].  The Scene.org Awards ceremony was restructured with shorter screening times to reduce the show length.  The regular party band, BASS, returned with a slightly revised lineup, and the Danish Commodore revival band [[Press Play On Tape]] performed a live set as well.

Breakpoint 2008 added [[nVidia]] as a major sponsor and thus was able to lower the entrance fee to 55 Euros. The "big screen" grew again to 70 m² as the organizers acquired two Full HD projectors.

=== 2009: brokepoint ===
Breakpoint 2009 lost nVidia as a major sponsor, losing most of its budget and forcing it to ask for public donations under the temporary name "Brokepoint".  They received enough donations to hold a basic demoparty, albeit without some features such as the seminars.  The entrance fee remained 55 euros, and "supporter tickets" were added at 250 euros and up for donors.  Soon before the party began, 20th Century Fox stepped in as a major sponsor to promote the film ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''.  A special Wolverine Contest was added for demos, videos, art, and music based on the character and film trailer.  While Breakpoint could no longer pay performers, Xerxes, Romeo Knight, and Bendik returned for a free concert.

=== 2010: Like there is no tomorrow ===
Breakpoint 2010 was the final Breakpoint event. It had record attendance of more than one thousand visitors. The last day of the party coincided with the launch of the [[STS-131]], which was streamed on the bigscreen before the prizegiving.

=== Successor ===
After it was announced that Breakpoint would cease, rumours were generated about a possible successor for a German Easter-party. After a series of viral teaser videos, the invitation to the official follow-up demoparty called ''[[Revision (demoparty)|Revision]]'' was released, and the party took place in [[Saarbrücken]], largely sharing the same organizing crew as Breakpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Demoszene-Osterparty-geht-in-Revision-1159820.html|title=Demoszene-Osterparty geht in "Revision"|publisher=[[heise.de]] |first=Stefan|last= Göhler|date=2010-12-29|language=german}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Britcar''' is an [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance]] [[sports car racing]] and [[touring car racing]] series in the United Kingdom.

It was formed in 1997, as a result of a discussion in a [[Nürburgring]] bar between Willie Moore and James Tucker. Folklore has it that James Tucker and [[John Veness]] formed the organizing [[European Endurance &amp; Racing Club]] (EERC) with a [[£10]] note found on the ground.  The foremost aim was the re-introduction of a 24-Hour Race in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

At the end of the 2015 season, James sold the Britcar rights to Hedley Cowell Events Ltd. For the 2016 season, Clair and Rob Hedley re-launched Britcar Endurance as the [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] Endurance Championship and Dunlop Production Championship. Such was the interest in the run up to the 2016 [[Autosport International|Autosport International show]] they also launched a separate short series of races for Prototype and CN category cars. The Production championship was expanded after the first round to allow GT-specification cars to compete, thus becoming the Dunlop GT &amp; Production Championship.

==Cars and results==
There are two separate championships for different types of car; although some cars can run in both, they may be in different categories.

GT's, which include cars like Ferraris, Porsches, Marcos, Moslers and Ginettas over a long-distance race, normally between 2 and 4 hours in length with a compulsory pit stop. Normally cars will have between 2 and 3 drivers.

Production, which include cars like Renault Clio Cup, Seat Leon Supercopa, Porsche Boxster, BMW M3s and Mini Cooper S. These races are normally 90 minutes long, featuring a mandatory pit stop. There can be up to 2 drivers per car.

==History==

The successful first year of competition was in 2002, and following tremendous growth in 2003, it attracted [[Sky Sports]] coverage in their Motor Sports section in 2004.
The first year of the [[Silverstone Britcar 24-Hour|Britcar 24-Hour]] Race was 2005 which was won by  Rollcentre Mosler of Martin Short.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishracingnews.net/24hr.html 24hr_ August 05&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
This was followed by packed grids in 2006 season culminating in a capacity field for the 24-Hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motor.org.uk/information/britcar-24-hours-of-silverstone.html IMI: The Institute of the Motor Industry Information &gt; Britcar 24 hours of Silverstone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008140312/http://www.motor.org.uk/information/britcar-24-hours-of-silverstone.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
EERC became a [[Motor Sports Association]] (MSA) approved Championship in 2007 as well being the now essential 24 hours.  It played a supporting role to the British round of the [[A1 Grand Prix]].  The presenters of the well-known British car show ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' took part in the 2007 event, coming third of the five diesel cars, and 39th overall, at the end of the 24 Hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tsl-timing.com/file/?f=eerc/2007/73663.pdf Britcar 24hr results 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 it became known as the MSA British Endurance championship.

Such was its popularity in some seasons that over-subscription meant there are reserves waiting for grid positions.

For the 2017 season, the format was changed. Drivers in all races would now accrue points towards the Dunlop Endurance Championship but drivers could choose to do two 50-minute races under the Sprint category, or one 50-minute and one 2-hour race in the Endurance category. Grids were combined and most events were to take place over a single day. The night race proved so popular in 2016 that a second night race was introduced, to run at Silverstone earlier in the same month.

==Silverstone Britcar 24-Hour==
Britcar traditionally hosted an endurance race on the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] GP circuit.

At the end of the 2015 season, the rights for the Silverstone 24 hour endurance race were sold to [[24H Series|Creventic]] to become the UK edition of their FIA "[[Touring Car Endurance Series|touring car]]" endurance series.

For this event's history, see [[Silverstone Britcar 24-Hour]]

In [[ancient Rome]], the '''Caristia''',&lt;ref&gt;The 1988 [[Bibliotheca Teubneriana|Teubner edition]] of the [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'' (2.616) gives ''Karistia''.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Cara Cognatio''', was an official but privately observed holiday on February 22, that celebrated love of family with banqueting and gifts. Families gathered to dine together and offer food and incense to the [[Lares]] as their [[household god]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, "Religious'' Koine'' and Religious Dissent in the Fourth Century,"  ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 115;  Ittai Gradel, ''Emperor Worship and Roman Religion'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a day of reconciliation when disagreements were to be set aside, but the poet [[Ovid]] observes satirically that this could be achieved only by excluding family members who caused trouble.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' 2.623–626, 631–632; [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and context==
The Caristia was one of several days in February that honored family or ancestors. It followed the [[Parentalia]], nine days of remembrance which began on February 13 and concluded with the [[Feralia]] on February 21, or in the view of some, the Caristia on the next day. For the Parentalia, families visited the tombs of their ancestors and shared cake and wine both in the form of offerings and as a meal among themselves. The Feralia was a more somber occasion, a [[Roman festival|public festival]] of sacrifices and offerings to the [[Manes]], the spirits of the dead who required propitiation.&lt;ref&gt;Salzman, "Religious ''Koine''," p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The Caristia was a recognition of the family line as it continued into the present and among the living.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Religious Experience'' p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were distributions of bread, wine, and ''sportulae'' (bonuses, tips, tokens of appreciation).&lt;ref&gt;John F. Donahue, "Towards a Typology of Roman Public Feasting," in ''Roman Dining: A Special Issue of American Journal of Philology'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Martial]] has a pair of poems on gift-giving for the holiday; in one, he offers a sort of "[[non-apology apology]]" to his relatives Stella and Flaccus, explaining that he's sent them nothing because he didn't want to offend others who ought to receive a gift from him and wouldn't.&lt;ref&gt;Martial, ''Epigrams'' 9.54 and 55; Ruurd R. Nauta, ''Poetry for Patrons: Literary Communication in the Age of Domitian'' (Brill, 2002), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the calendar==
Unlike public festivals, the Caristia and other privately observed holidays were allowed to fall on even-numbered days of the [[Roman calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cara Cognatio remained on the calendar long after the [[Roman Empire]] had come under Christian rule. It appeared in the [[Chronography of 354]], and the calendar of [[Polemius Silvius]] (449 AD) juxtaposed the old holiday with a [[feast day]] commemorating the burial of [[St. Peter]] and [[St. Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1998, 2001), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; As a "[[love feast]]," the Caristia was not incompatible with Christian attitudes;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Religious Experience'' p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars have detected an influence of the Parentalia and Caristia on the Christian [[agape feast]], with the consumption of bread and wine at the ancestral tomb replaced by the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Effros, ''Creating Community with Food and Drink in Merovingian Gaul'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2002), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century, some Christian priests even encouraged participation in funerary meals.&lt;ref&gt;Effros, ''Creating Community'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 6th century, some [[Gallo-Roman]]s still observed a form of the holiday with food offerings to the dead and a ritual meal.&lt;ref&gt;Bernadotte Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures in Early Medieval Pastoral Literature'' (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2005), pp. 172–173, citing ''Concilium Turonense'' (567) 23, ''[[Corpus Christianorum|CCSL]]'' 148A: 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt; By then, however, the practice had come under suspicion as a "[[Paganism|pagan]]" ritual, and the [[Council of Tours|Council of Tours in 567]] explicitly censured those who "defiled" the [[Chair of Saint Peter|feast day of St. Peter]]. The observances were condemned by [[Caesarius of Arles]] as an excuse for drunkenness, dancing, singing, and other [[Christian demonology|demonic]] behaviors. The suppression of traditional commemorations of the dead were part of increasing efforts by the Church to control and monopolize religious behaviors in [[Merovingian]] Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;Effros, ''Creating Community'', pp. 74–78, especially pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile phone tracking==
{{Main|Mobile phone tracking}}
[[Stingray phone tracker|StingRay devices]] are used by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] to track people's movements, and intercept and record conversations, names, phone numbers and text messages from mobile phones.&lt;ref name="News10"/&gt; Their use entails the monitoring and collection of data from all mobile phones within a target area.&lt;ref name="News10"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news10.net/story/news/investigations/watchdog/2014/03/06/5-california-law-enforcement-agencies-connected-to-stingrays/6147381/ | title=9 Calif. law enforcement agencies connected to cellphone spying technology | publisher=ABC News, News10 | date=March 6, 2014 | accessdate=26 March 2014 |author1=Bott, Michael |author2=Jensen, Thom }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement agencies in [[Northern California]] that have purchased [[Stingray phone tracker|StingRay]] devices include the [[Oakland Police Department]], [[San Francisco Police Department]], [[Sacramento County Sheriff's Department]], [[San Jose Police Department]] and the Fremont Police Department.&lt;ref name="News10"/&gt; The Fremont Police Department's use of a StingRay device is in a partnership with the Oakland Police Department and the Alameda County District Attorney's Office.&lt;ref name="News10"/&gt;

In 2007, StingRay devices assisted the Oakland Police Department in Oakland, California in making 21 arrests, and in 2008, 19 arrests were made in unison with the use of StingRay devices.&lt;ref name="News10"/&gt;

StingRay devices are often used in combination with Hailstorm towers that jam the mobile phone signals forcing phones to drop down from 4G and 3G network bands to older, more insecure 2G bands.&lt;ref&gt;Mysterious Fake Cellphone Towers Are Intercepting Calls All Over The US, Business Insider, Jack Dutton, Sep 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states, police can get many kinds of cellphone data without obtaining a warrant. Law-enforcement records show, police can use initial data from a tower dump to ask for another court order for more information, including addresses, billing records and logs of calls, texts and locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cellphone data spying: It's not just the NSA|work= USA today|author= John Kelly|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/12/08/cellphone-data-spying-nsa-police/3902809|date= 13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hidden cellphones==

===Bugging===
Cellphone bugs can be created by disabling the ringing feature on a mobile phone, allowing a caller to call a phone to access its microphone and listen in. Intentionally hiding a cell phone in a location is a bugging technique. Some hidden cellphone bugs rely on [[Wifi]] hotspots, rather than cellular data, where the tracker [[rootkit]] software periodically "wakes up" and signs into a public wifi hotspot to upload tracker data onto a public internet server. In the United States, the FBI has used "roving bugs", which entails the activation of microphones on mobile phones to enable the monitoring of conversations.&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1029-6140191.html | title=FBI taps cell phone mic as eavesdropping tool | publisher=[[CNET]] | date=December 1, 2006 | accessdate=26 March 2014 |author1=McCullagh, Declan |author2=Broache, Anne }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WTHR]] News. (YouTube video)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allowing remote observation of the target cellphone position in real-time on a map
* Remotely enabling microphones to capture and forward conversations. Microphones can be activated during a call or when the phone is on standby for capturing conversations near the cellphone.
* Receiving remote alerts and/or text messages each time somebody dials a number on the cellphone
* Remotely reading text messages and call logs

Cellphone spying software can enable microphones on mobile phones when phones are not being used, and can be installed by mobile providers.&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt;

==Detection==
Some indications of possible cellphone surveillance occurring may include a mobile phone waking up unexpectedly, using a lot of the CPU when on idle or when not in use, hearing clicking or beeping sounds when conversations are occurring and the circuit board of the phone being warm despite the phone not being used.{{refn|&lt;ref name="WTHR1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-age.com/security-vulnerabilities-mobile-devices-123464616/|title=Common security vulnerabilities of mobile devices - Information Age|author=|date=21 February 2017|website=information-age.com|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/cyber_threats-to_mobile_phones.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/07/hackers-can-control-your-phone-using-a-tool-thats-already-built-into-it/|title=Hackers Can Control Your Phone Using a Tool That's Already Built Into It - WIRED|author=|date=|website=www.wired.com|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jsums.edu/research/files/2013/06/Cell-Phone-Vulnerabilities-1.pdf?x52307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2016/07/20/baseband-vulnerability-could-m.html|title=Baseband vulnerability could mean undetectable, unblockable attacks on mobile phones|author=|date=|website=Boing Boing|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hey-stop-using-texts-two-factor-authentication/|title=So Hey You Should Stop Using Texts for Two-Factor Authentication - WIRED|author=|date=|website=www.wired.com|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.blackberry.com/2016/04/how-to-protect-yourself-from-ss7-and-other-cellular-network-vulnerabilities/|title=How to Protect Yourself from SS7 and Other Cellular Network Vulnerabilities|author=|date=|website=blackberry.com|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.368.2999|title=Breaking Cell Phone Authentication: Vulnerabilities in AKA, IMS and Android|first1=Jethro G.|last1=Beekman|first2=Christopher|last2=Thompson|date=|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2017|via=CiteSeer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/03/security_vulner_8.html|title=Security Vulnerabilities in Mobile MAC Randomization - Schneier on Security|author=|date=|website=www.schneier.com|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/fix-ss7-two-factor-authentication-bank-accounts/|title=A Cell Network Flaw Lets Hackers Drain Bank Accounts.

==Prevention==
Preventative measures against cellphone surveillance include not losing or allowing strangers to use a mobile phone and the utilization of an access password.&lt;ref name="WTHR1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Turning off and then also removing the battery from a phone when not in use is another technique.&lt;ref name="WTHR1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[Mobile phone jammer|Jamming]] or a [[Faraday cage]] may also work, the latter obviating removal of the battery.
Another solution is cellphone with physical (electric) switch, or isolated electronic switch that disconnects microphone, camera without bypass, meaning switch can be operated by user only - no software can connect it back.

==Monitoring of Transmissions==
Undoubtedly there is a way of intercepting all communications, cellphones notwithstanding. Large government or even corporate interests are likely capable of intercepting satellite communications by individuals. While the typical user of cellphone devices may feel secure, an aggregate keyword search algorithm (for instance based on race, religion, gender preference or nationality) that changes with the global political climate may effect privacy without your knowledge or consent. Most modern messages or voice are most likely not encrypted for various reasons including the need for a single safe communication platform that both parties accept, or lack of interest. Historically there has been tension between individual privacy and the idea of a greater good or unified evil.

The '''Colorado Shakespeare Festival''' is a professional acting company in association with the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. It was established in 1958, making it one of the oldest such festivals in the United States, and has roots going back to the early 1900s.

Each summer, the festival draws about 25,000 patrons&lt;ref&gt;[http://9edyy1an29e2gxgy7puvyi8mg.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-Shakespeare-Theatre-Data.pdf Institute of Outdoor Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; to see the works of Shakespeare, as well as classics and contemporary plays, in the [[Mary Rippon Outdoor Theatre]] and indoor University Theatre.

The company is made up of professional actors, directors, designers and artisans from around the United States and the world, along with student interns from around the nation.

Timothy Orr, the current producing artistic director, was hired in 2014 after serving as an actor in the company since 2007 and associate producing artistic director since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradoshakes.org/about/staff coloradoshakes.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== 1870s-1944 ===

The festival has roots in the earliest days of the University of Colorado at Boulder, when senior classes performed commencement plays under a grove of cottonwood trees planted in the 1870s on the east lawn of the first building on campus, Old Main.

When electric lights became available in 1901, the university began to stage evening performances. The tradition was interrupted by World War I and resumed in 1919 by George F. Reynolds, an Elizabethan theater scholar and professor of English Literature.

In 1936, Reynolds helped develop plans to build the Mary Rippon Outdoor Theatre. Rippon (1850-1935) was the first female professor at the university and the first woman in the United States to teach at a state university. She was chair of the Department of Germanic Languages and Literature and also served, without financial compensation, as Dean of Women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silviapettem.com/SepLives.html "Separate Lives: The Story of Mary Rippon" by Sylvia Pettem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217203925/http://www.silviapettem.com/SepLives.html |date=2015-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maryrippon.jpg|thumbnail|Mary Rippon, 1899. CU Heritage Center.]]

After her death, University President George Norlin suggested that a planned outdoor theater be named in Rippon's honor. Construction began in 1936 with funding from the Board of Regents and the federal Works Progress Administration, as well as private donations. “Alumni Day” celebrations were held in the still-incomplete theater on June 13, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuheritage.org/collections/cu-history/playwright-and-professor-linked-in-spirit-in-mary-rippon-theater/ CU Heritage Center, "Playwright and professor linked in spirit in Mary Rippon Theater" by Sylvia Pettem, Daily Camera]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mary Rippon Outdoor Theatre was officially completed in 1939, but no plays were staged there until 1944, when book reviewer, Shakespeare scholar and associate director of libraries in charge of acquisitions James Sandoe was asked to direct a play. Because the University Theatre was occupied by the Department of the Navy due to the war effort, Sandoe, also influential in developing the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, decided to stage ''Romeo and Juliet'' in the outdoor theater. The event was so popular that it was followed by ''The Merchant of Venice'' in 1945 and ''Henry IV, Part I'' in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.lib.byu.edu/ead/XML/MSS317.xml James S. Sandoe Papers; L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandoe directed nine seasons for CSF between 1961 and 1973. No director helmed more productions until Department of Theatre and Dance professor James Symons pushed the mark to 11 in recent years.  However, no one to date—70 years later—has directed more productions of Shakespeare's plays on the Mary Rippon stage. All four of Sandoe's children appeared in the CSF. Son Sam Sandoe and daughter Anne Sandoe continue to act in the festival each summer.&lt;ref name="prog2014"&gt;Colorado Shakespeare Festival 2014 program&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s to 1960s ===

Sandoe and Jack Crouch, professor in the Department of English and Speech and head of CU's Creative Arts Festival, began to discuss the possibility of creating an annual Shakespeare festival on campus.&lt;ref name="prog2014"/&gt; Crouch took over in 1947, after which Shakespeare plays were performed in the Rippon theater every year except for 1957, when the annual production was staged in the indoor University Theater. Crouch directed seven plays over the next 10 years and founded the Colorado Shakespeare Festival, which premiered on Aug. 2, 1958, and featured three productions with ''Julius Caesar, Hamlet'' and ''The Taming of the Shrew''. More than 7,000 patrons attended 13 performances that year, paying $1.50 per ticket. The following year, more than 13,000 people attended.&lt;ref name="Engle"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbZhdm1FvFQC&amp;pg=PA90 |title=Shakespeare Companies and Festivals: An International Guide |editor=Ron Engle, Felicia Hardison Londré and Daniel J. Watermeier |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of its first decade, CSF had produced 26 of the 37 plays in the canon, with only one duplication, Hamlet in 1965. Howard M. Banks’ production of Henry V was filmed for television in 1961.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

Crouch stepped down as executive director after the 1963 season but remained active in the festival through the 1980s. CSF directors since 1963 have been Albert Nadeau (1964–66), Richard Knaub (1967-1976), Martin Cobin (1982–85), Daniel S.P. Yang (1978-1981; 1986–89), Dick Devin (1990–94; 1997-2004), Jim Symons (1995), Philip Sneed (2007-2012; now executive director at the Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities) and Timothy Orr (2013–present).&lt;ref&gt;Office of University Communications, University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent CSF alumni include Michael Moriarty (1962; “Law and Order,” “Pale Rider”), Barry Corbin (1962; “Lonesome Dove,” “Northern Exposure”), Karen Grassle (1964; “Little House on the Prairie”), Barry Kraft (1966; Oregon Shakespeare Festival), Joe Spano (1968; “NCIS,” “American Graffiti,” “Hill Street Blues”),&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt; Annette Bening (1980; “American Beauty,” “Dangerous Liaisons”), Jimmy Smits (1984; “NYPD Blue,” “Star Wars” episodes II and III), Val Kilmer (1988; “Top Gun,” “The Doors”),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradoshakes.org coloradoshakes.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s ===

The Rippon theater was used through 1966 as originally built — a three-level stage facing an open amphitheater with sandstone benches seating for about 2,000 patrons. In 1967, the university funded construction of stone walkways and forestage, and constructed two large light towers in 1968. Through the years, the Rippon theater has been continually altered and improved. In 1981 Yang hired Richard Devin to make the Rippon space more theatrical and to create more lighting areas on the stage.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

In 1975, with a production of ''Cymbeline'', CSF became one of seven companies in the world and just the second American university, after the University of Michigan, to perform Shakespeare's complete canon. That year the festival also produced a staged reading of ''Two Noble Kinsmen'', attributed to Shakespeare and John Fletcher, and Ben Jonson's ''Volpone'', the festival's only non-Shakespeare production until 1991.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

In 1978, CSF inaugurated its Young People's Shakespeare program, which performed an abbreviated versions of ''Twelfth Night'' around the Boulder community. The program morphed into a program offering internships to high school students. In 1982, CSF began its Dramaturg Program, recruiting CU doctoral students to research productions. In 1976 the festival launched CSF Annual (later renamed On-Stage Studies) a scholarly journal, under the editorship of Cobin.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

=== 1980s ===

Under Yang, the festival began hiring professional designers, technicians and directors with national reputations, including Robert Benedetti, Audrey Stanley and Tom Markus. Yang also hired graduate students from around the country, moving beyond the confines of CU-Boulder, and in 1982 hired the first Equity actor under a “guest artist contract.”&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

With such changes, CSF's reputation began to grow. Shakespeare Quarterly remarked that the festival “had stepped out of its academic cocoon” in its Summer 1980 issue and in 1989 praised its experimentation, from “Hamlet in outer space, to topless witches in Macbeth, to a commedia dell’arte Shrew.” In 1992, CSF was named as one of the top Shakespeare festivals in the nation by Time magazine. That same year, the Festival received the Colorado Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts and the Denver Drama Critic's Circle Award for “Best Season for a Theatre Company.”&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

=== 1990s ===

Dick Devin, who started working at the CSF as a lighting designer in 1981, and done design work in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Cairo, was selected as the festival's producing artistic director nine years later.&lt;ref name="Glasgow"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_13072878 |title=Arts and Entertainment: Dick Devin |author=Greg Glasgow |date=January 28, 2007 |publisher=[[Daily Camera]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Under Devin in the 1990s and 2000s, CSF bumped the number of annual summer productions from three to four, with occasional forays into non-Shakespeare other classical or related material, such as Tom Stoppard's ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'' in 1995 and Molière's ''The Miser'' in 1996.&lt;ref name="Engle"/&gt;

Among Devin's innovations was a program that offered free tickets to productions by other companies with the purchase of a season subscription. In 2003, for instance, those who bought CSF subscriptions also received tickets to productions at the Denver Center, Nomad Theatre, Denver's Curious Theatre, the Colorado Music Festival and the University of Colorado Concerts series.&lt;ref name="Glasgow"/&gt;

In 2010, Devin was named an Honorary Lifetime Member Award by the U.S. Institute for Theatre Technology Inc., of which he had served as president.&lt;ref&gt;[https://connections.cu.edu/people/shakespeare-fests-devin-honored-with-lifetime-award/ CU Connections]&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival began to experience budget shortfalls, which were periodically covered by the College of Arts and Sciences. Devin cited funding challenges as one reason he decided to step down: "After 17 years of trying to find a half million dollars a year, it gets to be a struggle to get up and make it happen every year. That's the principal reason," he told the Daily Camera newspaper.&lt;ref name="Glasgow"/&gt;

=== 2000s and 2010s ===

With the arrival of Philip Sneed in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_6198215?source=pkg "Philip Sneed: A bard comes home," Denver Post]&lt;/ref&gt; CSF began producing six plays each year, including non-Shakespeare works such as ''Woody Guthrie’s American Song'' (2008) and ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' (2009). To ''Kill a Mockingbird'' was widely praised by critics and earned a prestigious Ovation Award from the Denver Post for its director, Jane Page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/theater/ci_14103103 Denver Post]&lt;/ref&gt; Sneed was a CU-Boulder graduate and former CSF actor who came to the festival after serving as director of the Foothill Theatre Company in Nevada City, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradoshakes.org/philip-c-sneed#overlay-context=gsearch/sneed coloradoshakes.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sneed was seen as willing to experiment. He brought in Tina Packer, founder of Shakespeare and Co. in Massachusetts, to present her five-part work, ''Women of Will'', performed by Pack and Nigel Gore in 2011, and special performances of a condensed version in 2012. He also launched a plan to perform Shakespeare's ''Henriad'' histories — ''Richard II, Henry IV'', parts 1 and 2, and ''Henry V'', over three seasons, 2013-15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturewest.org/breaking-news-phil-sneed-leaving-colorado-shakes-for-arvada-center/ "Phil Sneed leaving Colorado Shakes for Arvada Center" by John Moore, culturewest.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival also produced holiday shows from 2007-2011, including ''A Child’s Christmas in Wales'' (2007–08), ''A Christmas Carol'' (2009-10) and ''It’s a Wonderful Life'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradoshakes.org Colorado Shakespeare Festival, coloradoshakes.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also established a “cultural exchange” with the Maxim Gorky Theatre in Vladivostok, Russia. In 2011, CSF hosted Gorky director Efim Zyenyatsky and Russian actors for a bi-lingual production of ''The Inspector General''. In October 2012, he traveled with frequent CSF actors Jamie Ann Romero and Geoffrey Kent to Vladivostok, where they performed in a bilingual version of ''Noises Off'', which CSF had produced the previous summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/news/features/csf%E2%80%99s-russian-connection-continues-%E2%80%98noises-off%E2%80%99-vladivostok "CSF's Russian connection continues," University of Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial difficulties and restructuring ===

On June 19, 2011 the Daily Camera newspaper (Boulder, Colo.) reported that the festival was restructuring after accumulating a $950,000 shortfall over the previous three seasons, citing university and festival officials who said the economic downturn, weather and concerns about West Nile virus had negatively affected revenue.&lt;ref name="restructure"&gt;[http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_18306855 "Colorado Shakespeare Festival restructures after $950,000 shortfall," Daily Camera]&lt;/ref&gt; The festival had sought to halt the mounting losses by cutting rehearsal time, staff and payroll, and reducing the number of outdoor performances, even as he continued to emphasize innovation.&lt;ref name="restructure"/&gt;

On July 5, 2012, the college announced that just-retired Dean Todd Gleeson had “relieved the Colorado Shakespeare Festival of its obligation to repay a shortfall of $984,889” in order to “remove a distraction” for Steven Leigh, who began his tenure as dean on July 1, 2012.&lt;ref name="memo"&gt;Memo, University of Colorado College of Arts and Sciences, July 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Under pressure from the university's Board of Regents, the college had initiated a restructuring in 2011, shifting some responsibilities from the director to new accounting and associate producing director positions and creating a new executive board to “share management responsibilities” with the director.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

In addition, in November 2012, CSF's box-office, marketing and communications functions were integrated, along with those of the CU-Boulder Department of Theatre and Dance, into CU Presents, a program of the College of Music that provides those services for other ticketed events on campus, including the Artist Series, [[Takacs Quartet|Takács Quartet]] and Holiday Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cupresents.org/2013/01/22/box-office-changes "Box office changes," cupresents.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The change, directed by campus Provost Russ Moore, was intended to improve efficiency while increasing visibility and revenue.

=== 2013 ===

On Jan. 14, 2013, Sneed announced that he was leaving CSF to take a position as executive director for the [[Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities|Arvada (Colorado) Center for Arts and Humanities]]. Associate Producing Artistic Director Timothy Orr was tapped as the interim director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_22373561/philip-sneed-resigns-from-colorado-shakespeare-festival "Philip Sneed resigns from Colorado Shakespeare Festival," Daily Camera]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 season — ''A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Macbeth, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, Abridged, Richard II'' and ''Women of Will: The Overview'' — saw a 17-percent increase in ticket revenue, which allowed the festival to pay off loans for capital improvements to the Rippon theater and make a voluntary contribution to the college in an effort to repay debt underwriting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_24345289/cu-boulder-sees-strong-final-act-2013-colorado "CU-Boulder sees strong final act for 2013 Colorado Shakespeare Festival season" by Sarah Kuta, Daily Camera]&lt;/ref&gt;
The festival was bucking a trend, which had seen the collapse of two prominent Shakespeare programs, Santa Cruz (which has announced it will be resurrected in 2015&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.santacruzshakespeare.org/ santacruzshakespeare.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and the North Carolina Shakespeare Festival,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-record.com/news/local_news/n-c-shakespeare-festival-ends-operations-after-years/article_3916b39c-2488-11e4-94fd-001a4bcf6878.html "N.C. Shakespeare Festival ends operations after 37 years," Raleigh News and Record]&lt;/ref&gt; over the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturewest.org/as-others-fold-colorado-shakespeare-festival-comes-back-strong/ "As others fold, Colorado Shakespeare Festival comes back strong," culturewest.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The season also drew critical praise, particularly for Geoffrey Kent's vivid, unconventional production of ''Midsummer''. “The performers provide moments of comedy, insight or pure delight,” wrote Denver's Westword magazine.&lt;ref&gt;"[[The cast of A Midsummer Night's Dream features no shortage of standouts]]" by Juliet Wittman&lt;/ref&gt; Former Denver Post theater critic John Moore, now associate director of content strategy for the [[Denver Center for the Performing Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.denverpost.com/stagescreen/2013/08/15/critic-john-moore-joins-the-denver-center-for-the-performing-arts/7490/ "Critic John Moore joins Denver Center," Denver Post]&lt;/ref&gt; declared, “In the summer of 2013, the Colorado Shakespeare Festival is a mover and a shaker.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturewest.org/60-second-review-colorado-shakes-midsummer-and-macbeth John Moore, culturewest.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014-2015 ===

Following a national search, the College of Arts and Sciences announced on April 11, 2014 that it had named interim director Orr as producing artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_25546360/colorado-shakespeare-festival-hires-tim-orr-producing-artistic-director "Colorado Shakespeare Festival hires Tim Orr producing (as) artistic director," Daily Camera]&lt;/ref&gt;  As interim director, Orr oversaw planning for the upcoming season, which included ''The Tempest, The Merry Wives of Windsor, I Hate Hamlet'' — [http://paulrudnick.com Paul Rudnick]’s comedy about a young actor haunted by the ghost of Shakespearean actor [[John Barrymore]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://paulrudnick.com/ paulrudnick.com]&lt;/ref&gt;— ''Henry IV, Part 1'' and two “original practices” performances of ''Henry IV, Part 2''.

The 2014 season was well received by critics, particularly ''I Hate Hamlet'', starring veteran Denver Center for the Performing Arts actor Sam Gregory as Barrymore — “An absurdly magnificent turn makes ‘I Hate Hamlet’ lovable,” wrote the Denver Post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/theater/ci_26033574/review-an-absurdly-magnificent-turn-makes-i-hate Denver Post]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also praised the sold-out performances of “Henry IV, Part 2,” using original practices, which aim to recreate the staging, rehearsal and performance conditions of Elizabethan England. “The verisimilitude to original practices is delightful,” wrote coloradodrama.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coloradodrama.com/henry_IV_part%202.html%20 coloradodrama.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217050200/http://coloradodrama.com/henry_IV_part%202.html |date=2015-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While researching ''I Hate Hamlet'', CU-Boulder theater graduate student Roxxy Duda stumbled upon a large, all-but-forgotten archive of Barrymore materials — letters, photographs, personal items including the contents of his wallet at death, and more. The actor had no association with the university, but had willed the materials to his friend, theater critic [[Gene Fowler]], a Denver native who wrote a biography of Barrymore after his death, “Goodnight, Sweet Prince.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_26119243/trove-gives-i-hate-hamlet-more-than-ghost John Barrymore trove gives "I Hate Hamlet" more than a ghost of a chance," Denver Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 season was also a box-office success, as CSF topped $800,000 in ticket sales for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailycamera.com/News/Local/ci_26596609/Colorado-Shakespeare-Festival-posts-second-straight-year-of-revenue-gains "Colorado Shakespeare Festival posts second straight year of revenue gains," Daily Camera]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 CSF announced its 2015 summer lineup: ''Much Ado About Nothing'' and ''Othello'', with Emmy Award-winning stage, TV and film actor Peter Macon in the title role, on the outdoor stage; on the indoor stage, the regional premier of David Davalos’ comedy ''Wittenberg'',  which pits Martin Luther and Dr. Faustus in a battle of wills over their 15th-century student, Hamlet, the final chapter of the ''Henriad, Henry V'' and two “original practices” performances of ''Henry VI, Part 1''.

The festival now needs only to perform the second and third parts of ''Henry VI'' to complete the Shakespeare canon for a second time, which it plans to do for its 60th anniversary season in 2017.

In 2015, Blue Mountain Arts will celebrate 20 years as the festival's primary season sponsor with an insert in the program.

===2017===

For the 2017 schedule, planned are all of

* [[The Taming of the Shrew]],
* [[Hamlet]]
* [[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]],
* [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]], ''and''
* [[Henry VI, Part 3]].

===2019===

* An "original practices" presentation of [[King John (play)|King John]]

== Education programs ==
One bright spot for CSF during its financial difficulties was the creation of a three-pronged education program. The programs included Camp Shakespeare and a School of Theatre for children, age 6 to 18, and a school tour developed with CU-Boulder's Center for Study and Prevention and Violence, which presents abbreviated Shakespeare plays — ''Twelfth Night, The Tempest, Much Ado About Nothing'' and others — and workshops to teach students about such things as bullying and the harm of gossip. Those programs brought in more than $97,000 of revenue and $40,000 in grant funding in 2011-12.

CSF's anti-violence school tour has received national attention, including a story on PBS Newsline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/american-graduate-jan-june13-shakespeare_04-03/ "Anti-bullying lessons with the Bard," March 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2014, the program had been presented to more than 50,000 Colorado school children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradoshakes.org/education/csf-schools coloradoshakes.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colorado Shakespeare Gardens ==
[[File:ShakesGardens.jpg|thumb|Colorado Shakespeare Gardens]]
Colorado Shakespeare Gardens,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradoshakespearegardens.org/about_us.php Colorado Shakespeare Gardens]&lt;/ref&gt; established in 1991, maintains public gardens featuring plants referred to in the works of Shakespeare. The organization provides educational support to the Colorado Shakespeare Festival through free garden tours, public presentations and research. Our goal is to grow plants that were authentic to Shakespeare's time.

The organization's mission statement reads, "To learn, teach, and understand about the plants and their meaning in the plays. To help and assist with the Colorado Shakespeare Festival and the Colorado Shakespeare Guild whenever we are able."&lt;ref name="CSG"&gt;http://www.coloradoshakespearegardens.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteer members design, plant and maintain the Thyme Garden, Romeo and Juliet Garden, Long Bed Garden and Knot Garden in a courtyard adjacent to the Mary Rippon Outdoor Theatre, between the Hellems Arts and Sciences and Education buildings. Among the plants featured are chamomile, cowslip, lily, hawthorn and rosemary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradoshakespearegardens.org/plants.php coloradoshakespearegardens.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado Shakespeare Gardens is currently planning an expansion and upgrade of the gardens that is expected to take several years.&lt;ref name="CSG"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6826">[[Image:Stohr WF1 Mark Jaremko.JPG|thumb|250px|Mark Jaremko, 4 time DSR National Champion]]
'''D Sports Racing''' is a [[Sports Car Club of America]] class for purpose-built, 'LeMans-style', closed wheel roadracing cars. It has been called the one racing category that remains unfettered by regulations that have throttled innovation elsewhere in motorsport.&lt;ref&gt;RaceCar Engineering magazine, February 2005, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually known simply as DSR, the class began in 1968. DSR evolved from the SCCA's older H Modified class, which traces its roots back to the early 1950s.  Today's DSR cars normally use a 1000cc four cylinder engine sourced from a Japanese motorcycle.  Several other engines are allowed - see the [http://cms.scca.com/documents/Club%20Rules/09%20GCR/SRCS.pdf SCCA Rulebook]

DSR's generally weigh under 1000&amp;nbsp;lbs with the driver and make 200 bhp at 13,000rpm.  The relatively low cost of the engines and some new chassis manufacturers led to an explosion in growth of the class between the years 2000 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;SportsCar magazine, October 2002, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; DSR's were the fastest class at the SCCA National Championship races in 2008.

A lively spot for DSR discussion can be found at the [http://dsrforum.yuku.com SportsRacer Technology Forum].

Two '''shootings in Nigeria''' occurred on Christmas Day church services in [[northern Nigeria]] on 25 December 2012, at churches in [[Maiduguri]] and [[Potiskum]]. At least twelve casualties were reported. Terror organisation [[Boko Haram]] claimed not to be responsible, however is suspected to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/12/2012122514557537669.html|title=Deadly Christmas attack on Nigeria church – Africa|agency=[[Al Jazeera English]]|date=December 25, 2012|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the city of Potiskum, [[Yobe]], in the north east of the country armed men shot at least 6 church-goers. Afterwards the church was set in fire. In [[Maiduguri]] as well 6 church-goers were killed, including the priest of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/25/world/africa/nigeria-christmas-attack/?hpt=hp_t2 |title=12 killed in attacks on two churches in Nigeria|agency=[[CNN]]|date=December 25, 2012|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days later, on 28 December, in the village of [[Musari]] another fifteen Christians were killed. Attackers invaded the village and cut their throats while asleep. The victims included a traffic police officer and fourteen civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF20121230_00417937|title=Vijftien christenen gedood in dorp Musari – Het Nieuwsblad|trans-title=Fifteen Christians slain in Muscari village|website=Nieuwsblad.be|date=December 30, 2012|accessdate=January 5, 2013|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is completely informal; it has no rules, no fee, no prizes, no formal competition, and no flyers.  Nonetheless, several hundred cars show up each Saturday morning.

The gathering started with just a few friends showing up at a donut store every Saturday, and grew from there.  One of the original participants, automotive artist Rick Finn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

made a T-shirt design in 1989 that has become the logo of the event, and is sold (in many variations now) at the donut store which the event originally centered on.&lt;ref name="official" /&gt;

The event has spawned a number of imitators in different cities.

'''Economics of corruption''' applies economic tools to the analysis of [[Political corruption|corruption]]. Rigorous study of corruption by economists commenced in the 1980s.

== History of the discipline ==
In 1968, [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate economist [[Gunnar Myrdal]] found corruption 'almost a taboo (among economists) as research topic'. Indeed, it has mostly been a matter of [[political science]] and [[sociology]]. However, the scenario changed since the 1970s. Since Rose-Ackerman's article "The Economics of Corruption", published in the ''Journal of Public Economics'' in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Rose-Ackerman S. : "The Economics of Corruption", ''Journal of
Political Economy'', Vol. IV, 1975, pp. 187-203.&lt;/ref&gt; more than 3,000 articles have been written with 'corruption' in the title, at least 500 of which directly focus on different aspects relating to corruption using an economic framework.&lt;ref&gt;JSTOR search on 8 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some books have also been published on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economics of Corruption'', edited by Ajit Mishra, 2005 : Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations have emerged to deal with the economics of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icgg.org/|title=Internet Center for Corruption Research|first=Anja|last=Schewe|website=www.icgg.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities offer courses under the title ''Economics of Corruption''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icgg.org|title=Internet Center for Corruption Research|first=Anja|last=Schewe|website=www.icgg.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate economist [[Gary Becker]] and an American Judge [[Richard Posner]] have opened a [[blog]] for open public discussion discussing economics of corruption &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2005/08/economics_of_co.html|title=The Becker-Posner Blog|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books on economics of corruption==
Some books have been produced with the specific title of "economics of corruption". One of these is ''The Economics of Corruption'' edited by [[Ajit Mishra]] published by the [[Oxford University Press]] in 2005. This book is an anthology of 11 essays under 4 categories, written by 16 economists. The titles of the essays give an idea of the various approaches taken by different economists. They are quoted below :
* Corruption : an Overview
* Corruption : Its causes and Effects
* Hierarchies and Bureaucracies: On the role of Collusion in Organizations
* A Theory of Misgovernance
* Pervasive Shortages under Socialism
* Corruption and Growth
* Corruptible Law Enforcers : How should they be compensated?
* Notes on bribery and control of corruption
* The Choice between Market failures and corruption
* Rents, Competition and corruption
* Electoral competition and Special Interest Politics

One can observe that these essays do not capture corruption in all its economic essence. Hundreds of essays have been published during the last two decades that deal with many more aspects of corruption from an economic perspective. Some other books are :
* Rose-Ackerman, S. : ''Corruption - A study in Political Economy'', 1978, Academic Press, New York.
* Ekpo, M. U. (ed.) : ''Bureaucratic corruption in sub-Saharan Africa'', 1979, University Press of America, Washington.
* Noonan, J. T. ''Bribes'', 1984, Macmillan, New York.
* Chowdhury, F. L. ''Corrupt Bureaucracy and Privatization of Tax Enforcement'', 2006, Pathak Samabesh, Dhaka.
*

==Courses on economics of corruption==
Some universities and institutions including the University of Regina in Canada, Florida State University in the United States and the University of Passau in Germany have started to offer courses on economics of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiwi.uni-passau.de/1121.html|title=Internet Center for Corruption Research|first=Anja|last=Schewe|website=www.wiwi.uni-passau.de|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the University of Rochester offers a course related to the history of economic corruption. One of the course outlines is given below. The course is offered by [[New Economic School]], an institution in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nes.ru/Acad-year-2003/2nd-module/corruprion-engl.htm|title=Economics of Corruption|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course includes 14 lectures, the themes of which are as follows.

*1. Corruption as an economic, social and political problem. Corruption's specific features in economies in transition.
*2. Corruption and rent-seeking behavior. Basic model of rent-seeking and its research. Problem of rent's dissipation.
*3. Static and dynamic models of [[Rent-seeking]]. Cases of pure and mixed public goods.
*4. Rent-seeking behavior and free-riding. Rent-seeking in teams.
*5. Rent-seeking in hierarchical systems.
*6. "Artificial" rents and seeking for them.
*7. Examples when rent-seeking arises in economies. Criminal rent-seeking.
*8. Basil model of corruption and its analysis. Corruption models' classification.
*9. Game-theoretical approaches towards corruption.
*10. Corruption in hierarchical structures.
*11. Dynamic corruption models.
*12. Economic systems with corruption efficiency.
*13. Statistical and econometrical approaches towards research of corruption.
*14. Macroeconomics aspects of corruption. Problems in estimation of corruption influence on economic development.

Evidently, the course has limited focus and in many ways do not directly address relevant areas of corruption which have already been analyzed from an economic perspective.

==Approaches to economic analyses of corruption==
As indicated above, a systematic pattern in research on corruption from economic perspective is yet to emerge. However, Ananish [[Chaudhuri]] has classified the foci of economic analyses of corruption into fourteen broad categories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Faizul Latif Chowdhury]], "Economic Approaches in Corruption Studies", ''Fiscal Frontiers'', 2008, Dhaka.&lt;/ref&gt; These are:

* Economic causes of corruption
* Rent-seeking in the public offices, including Judiciary
* Corruption as an economic behavior, e.g. game theoretic explanation
* Demand for and Supply of corruption, optimal level of corruption, optimal level of bribery, efficiency of the market in corruption
* Impact of corruption on the competitiveness in the market for goods and services
* Measurement of the level of corruption, comparative county-studies
* Corruption in different economic activities, e.g. public procurement, defense procurement
* Sources of corruption: Revenue collection, Foreign aid, Foreign Direct Investment
* Corruption in the private sector, Economies in transition
* Impact of corruption on [[economic growth]], national [[regional development|development]] and the level of [[poverty]]
* Welfare impact of corruption, Income redistribution resulting from corruption
* Factors affecting corruption, e.g. [[Shadow economy]], [[Smuggling]], [[weak state]], corruption by [[politicians]]
* Relation between corruption on the one hand and other economic-social-cultural aspects like technological progress, environment and ecology,
* Economic factors relating to [[anti-corruption programs]], e.g. optimal level of punishment for corruption etc.

The Hafun is the small peninsula in the northeast. [[Banaadir]] ([[Mogadishu]]) is highlighted red for reference.]]
The '''effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Somalia''' was significant. Coastal and rural communities in [[Somalia]], as far as {{convert|4,500|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the epicentre of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], 10,000 km of Somalia was swept away or destroyed by the resulting [[tsunami]] on 26 December 2004. As of 5 January 2005, the confirmed death toll stood at 298. According to presidential spokesperson Yusuf Mohamed Ismail of the [[Transitional Federal Government]], more than 50,000 people were also displaced

==Impact==
Most of the damage was centered in the coastal parts of the autonomous [[Puntland]] state in northeastern Somalia, particularly the area between [[Hafun]] in the [[Bari, Somalia|Bari]] region and [[Garacad]] in [[Mudug]]. The narrow and low-lying peninsula of Hafun, {{convert|1150|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Mogadishu]], was especially affected. In Puntland, rising waters destroyed properties in Hafun and Kulub, while parts of the towns and hamlets of Bander Beyla, Eyl, Foar and Bargaal were flooded. Other coastal areas, including [[Lower Juba]], were also somewhat affected. The UN reported that the waves destroyed 1,180 homes, smashed 2,400 boats and rendered freshwater wells and reservoirs unusable. The village of Kulub, near [[Garacad]], was still partially submerged as of 6 January. At Kulub, Hurdiye and other places, teams from the [[World Food Programme|WFP]] reported that all the boats and other fishing equipment used by the residents to make a livelihood had been lost.

==Aftermath==
On 30 December, around 12 tons of [[rice]], [[maize]] and [[vegetable oil]] were delivered to Hafun, four days after the tsunami. Previous attempts to deliver emergency relief failed after trucks were unable to pass tsunami damaged roads near Foar, a village of 1000 people which had been destroyed. The main [[sand]] bridge which connects the Hafun peninsula to the mainland was damaged, so the twelve tonnes were then transferred onto two four-wheel drive vehicles that managed the {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} trip from Foar to Hafun in seven hours. The UN warned that the tsunami had worsened the situation after four years of [[drought]] in northern Somalia and that further aid was required. It distributed 200 [[tonne]]s of food rations to 12,000 people, but stated that 30,000 was the target. The UN had four teams in the area and on 4 January appealed for [[U.S. Dollar|US$]]13,000,000 to assist 54,000 locals affected by the tsunami. As part of the flash inter-agency appeal of US$977,000,000 made by the [[UN Secretary-General]] on 6 January, [[USD]]10,000,000 was requested for Somalia. In February, the U.S. government made one million dollars available for tsunami relief in the country.&lt;ref name="1 MILLION dollars!"&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/KHII-69E4K3?OpenDocument&amp;rc=1&amp;cc=som US provides 1 million dollars to help tsunami-hit Somalia], [[Xinhua]], 7 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elder abuse''' (also called "'''elder mistreatment'''", "'''senior abuse'''", "'''abuse in later life'''", "'''abuse of older adults'''", "'''abuse of older women'''", and "'''abuse of older men'''") is "a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elderabuse.org.uk elderabuse.org.uk], accessed October 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) from a definition put forward by Action on Elder Abuse in the UK. Laws protecting the elderly from abuse are similar to and related to, laws protecting [[dependent adult]]s from abuse.

It includes harms by people the older person knows, or has a relationship with, such as a spouse, partner, or family member; a friend or neighbor; or people that the older person relies on for services. Many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of [[domestic violence]] or family violence since they are committed by family members. Paid caregivers have also been known to prey on their elderly patients.

While a variety of circumstances are considered elder abuse, it does not include general criminal activity against older persons, such as home break-ins, "muggings" in the street, or "distraction burglary", where a stranger distracts an older person at the doorstep while another person enters the property to steal.

The abuse of elders by caregivers is a worldwide issue. In 2002, WHO brought international attention to the issue of elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Daniels, L., (2003b, January/February). "2003 is the year elder abuse hits the international state." Victimization of the Elderly and Disabled. 5, 65-66, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, government agencies and community professional groups, worldwide, have specified elder abuse as a social problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rinkler A.G. | year = 2009 | title = Recognition and perception of elder abuse by prehospital and hospital-based care providers | url = | journal = Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 110–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the International Network for Prevention of Elder Abuse (INPEA) designated June 15 as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEAAD), and an increasing number of events are held across the globe on this day to raise awareness of elder abuse and highlight ways to challenge such abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inpea.net/ International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse], accessed June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although elders who have dementia or mental illness commonly make false accusations of theft and other forms of abuse by caregivers or family members, all reports of abuse must be investigated.

==Types==

Although there are common themes of elder abuse across nations, there are also unique manifestations based upon history, culture, economic strength, and societal perceptions of older people within nations themselves. The fundamental common denominator is the use of power and control by one individual to affect the well-being and status of another, older, individual.

There are several types of [[abuse]] of older people that are generally recognized as being elder abuse, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson, De Benedictis, Segal|title=Elder Abuse and Neglect|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|publisher=Help Guide|accessdate=15 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211154305/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Elder Abuse?|url=http://www.aoa.gov/AoA_programs/Elder_Rights/EA_Prevention/whatIsEA.aspx|publisher=Administration on Aging|accessdate=17 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220071251/http://www.aoa.gov/AoA_programs/Elder_Rights/EA_Prevention/whatIsEA.aspx|archivedate=20 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Physical abuse|Physical]]''': e.g. hitting, punching, slapping, burning, pushing, kicking, restraining, false imprisonment/confinement, or giving excessive or improper medication as well as withholding treatment and medication.
*'''[[Psychological abuse|Psychological/Emotional]]''': e.g. [[humiliating]] a person. A common theme is a perpetrator who identifies something that matters to an older person and then uses it to coerce an older person into a particular action. It may take verbal forms such as yelling,  name-calling, [[ridiculing]], [[hypercriticism|constantly criticizing]], accusations, [[blaming]], or nonverbal forms such as ignoring, silence, shunning or withdrawing affection.
* '''[[Elder financial abuse]]''': also known as financial exploitation, involving misappropriation of financial resources by family members, caregivers, or strangers, or the use of financial means to control the person or facilitate other types of abuse.
* '''[[Sexual abuse|Sexual]]''': e.g. forcing a person to take part in any sexual activity without his or her consent, including forcing them to participate in conversations of a sexual nature against their will; may also include situations where person is no longer able to give consent ([[dementia]]).
* '''[[Neglect]]''': e.g. depriving a person of proper medical treatment, food, heat, clothing or comfort or essential medication and depriving a person of needed services to force certain kinds of actions, financial and otherwise. Neglect can include leaving an at-risk (i.e. fall risk) elder person unattended. The deprivation may be intentional (active neglect) or happen out of lack of knowledge or resources (passive neglect).
 
In addition, some U.S. state laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursinghomeabuselaws.org/elders/ Nursing Home Abuse Laws (NHAL)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310015901/http://www.nursinghomeabuselaws.org/elders/ |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also recognize the following as elder abuse:
* '''[[Abandonment (legal)#Failure to fulfill a responsibility|Abandonment]]''': deserting a dependent person with the intent to abandon them or leave them unattended at a place for such a time period as may be likely to endanger their health or welfare.&lt;ref name="Oregon Revised Statutes"&gt;Oregon Revised Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rights abuse''': denying the civil and constitutional rights of a person who is old, but not declared by court to be mentally incapacitated. This is an aspect of elder abuse that is increasingly being recognized and adopted by nations.
* '''[[Self-neglect]]''': any persons neglecting themselves by not caring about their own health, well-being or safety. Self-neglect (harm by self) is treated as conceptually different than abuse (harm by others). Elder self-neglect can lead to illness, injury, or even death. Common needs that older adults may deny themselves, or ignore are the following: Sustenance (food or water); cleanliness (bathing and personal hygiene); adequate clothing for climate protection; proper shelter; adequate safety; clean and healthy surroundings; medical attention for serious illness; essential medications.&lt;ref&gt;Tina de Benedictis, Ph.D., Jaelline Jaffe, Ph.D., and Jeanne Segal, Ph.D., (2007) Elder Abuse Types, Signs, Symptoms, Causes, and Help. Helpguide, helpguide.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-neglect is often created by an individual's declining mental awareness or capability. Some older adults may choose to deny themselves some health or safety benefits, which may not be self-neglect. This may simply be their personal choice. Caregivers and other responsible individuals must honor these choices if the older adult is sound of mind. In other instances, the older adult may lack the needed resources, as a result of poverty, or other social condition. This is also not considered as "self-neglect".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Christopher, JD.

* '''[[Institutional abuse]]''' refers to physical or psychological harms, as well as rights violations in settings where care and assistance is provided to dependent older adults or others, such as nursing homes. Recent studies of approximately 2,000 nursing home facility residents in the United States reported a growing abuse rate of 44% and neglect up to 95%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nursinghomeabusecenter.com/elder-abuse/statistics/|title=Elder Abuse Statistics - Statistics on Elderly Abuse Over Time|work=Nursing Home Abuse Center|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; making elder abuse in nursing homes a growing danger. Exact statistics are rare due to elder abuse in general and specifically in nursing homes being a silent condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nursinghomeabuseguide.org/nursing-home-abuse-statistics/|title=Nursing Home Abuse Statistics - Elderly Care|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caregiver.org/selected-long-term-care-statistics|title=Selected Long-Term Care Statistics {{!}} Family Caregiver Alliance|website=www.caregiver.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warning signs==

The key to prevention and intervention of elder abuse is the ability to recognize the warning signs of its occurrence. Signs of elder abuse differ depending on the type of abuse the victim is suffering. Each type of abuse has distinct signs associated with it.
* '''Physical abuse''' can be detected by visible signs on the body, including bruises, scars, sprains, or broken bones. More subtle indications of physical abuse include signs of restraint, such as rope marks on the  wrist, or broken eyeglasses.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Lawrence|title=Elder abuse and neglect: Warning signs, risk factors, prevention, and help|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|accessdate=16 December 2012|author2=Tina De Benedictis|author3=Jeanne Segal|date=November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211154305/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Emotional abuse''' often accompanies the other types of abuse and can usually be detected by changes in the personality or behavior. The elder may also exhibit behavior mimicking dementia, such as rocking or mumbling.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; Emotional abuse is the most underreported abuse of elder abuse. Elder abuse occurs when a person fails to treat an elder with respect and includes verbal abuse, the elder experiences social isolation, or lack of acknowledgement. Some indicators of the emotional effects of elder abuse is the elder adult being unresponsive or uncommunicative. Also they can be unreasonably suspicious or fearful, more isolated, and not wanting to be as social as they may have been before. Emotional abuse is under reported, but can have the most damaging effects because it leads to more physical and mental health problems.
* '''Financial exploitation''' is a more subtle form of abuse, in comparison to other types, and may be more challenging to notice. Signs of financial exploitation include significant withdrawals from accounts, belongings or money missing from the home, unpaid bills, and unnecessary goods or services.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; 
* '''Sexual abuse,''' like physical abuse, can be detected by visible signs on the body, especially around the breasts or genital area. Other signs include inexplicable infections, bleeding, and torn underclothing.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; 
* '''Neglect''' is a type of abuse in that it can be inflicted either by the caregiver or oneself. Signs of neglect include malnutrition and dehydration, poor hygiene, noncompliance to a prescription medication, and unsafe living conditions.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;

In addition to observing signs in the elderly individual,  abuse can also be detected by monitoring changes in the caregiver's behavior. For example, the caregiver may not allow them to speak to or receive visitors, exhibit indifference or a lack of affection towards the elder, or refer to the elder as "a burden." Caregivers who have a history of substance abuse or mental illness are more likely to commit elder abuse than other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signs and symptoms of elder abuse and neglect in care|url=http://www.advocare.org.au/help-with-aged-care-complaints/signs-and-symptoms-of-eld/|publisher=Advocare Incorporated|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abuse can sometimes be subtle, and therefore difficult, to detect. Regardless, awareness organizations and research advise to take any suspicion seriously and to address concerns adequately and immediately.

=== Signs of elder abuse ===

* Broken bones or fractures
* Poor physical appearance
* Changes in mental status
* Frequent infections
* Bruising, welts or cuts
* Unexplained weight loss
* Refusal to speak
* Signs of dehydration
* Lack of cleanliness

==Health consequences==

The health consequences of elder abuse are serious. Elder abuse can destroy an elderly person's quality of life in the forms of:&lt;ref name="Dong"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dong X | year = 2005 | title = Medical Implications of Elder Abuse and Neglect | url = | journal = Clinics in Geriatric Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 293–313 | doi=10.1016/j.cger.2004.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Declining functional abilities
* Increased dependency, sense of helplessness and stress
* Worsening psychological decline
* Premature mortality and morbidity
* Depression and dementia
* Malnutrition
* Bed sores
* Death

The risk of death for elder abuse victims are three times higher than for non-victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = American Medical Association White Paper on Elderly Health | year = 1990 | title = report on the Council on Scientific Affairs | url = | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 2459–72 | doi=10.1001/archinte.1990.00390230019004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common abusers==

An abuser can be a spouse, partner, relative, a friend or neighbor, a volunteer worker, a paid worker, practitioner, solicitor, or any other individual with the intent to deprive a vulnerable person of their resources. Relatives include adult children and their spouses or partners, their offspring and other extended family members. Children and living relatives who have a history of substance abuse or have had other life troubles are of particular concern. For example, [[Elder financial abuse#Hybrid financial exploitation|Hybrid Financial Exploitation (HFE)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-04350-001|title=Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons|last=Jackson|first=Shelly L.|authorlink=|last2=Hafemeister|first2=Thomas L.|date=|website=|publisher="Psychology of Violence"|orig-year=|publication-date=2012|access-date=August 15, 2018}}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; abusive individuals are more likely to be a relative, chronically unemployed, and dependent on the elderly person.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson S, Hafemeister T | year = 2012 | title = Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons | url = | journal = Psychology Of Violence | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 285–296 | doi=10.1037/a0027273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, past studies have estimated that between 16% and 38% of all elder abusers have a history of mental illness. Elder abuse perpetrated by individuals with mental illnesses can be decreased by lessening the level of dependency that persons with serious mental illness have on family members. This can be done by funneling more resourced into housing assistance programs, intensive care management services, and better welfare benefits for individuals with serious mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Labrum T, Solomon PL. Physical elder abuse perpetrated by relatives with serious mental illness: A preliminary conceptual social–ecological model. Aggression and Violent Behavior, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; People with substance abuse and mental health disorders typically have very small social networks, and this confinement contributes to the overall occurrence of elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Labrum T, Solomon PL. Elder mistreatment perpetrators with substance abuse and/or mental health conditions: Results from the National Elder Mistreatment Study. Psychiatric Quarterly, 2017 May 23. doi: 10.1007/s11126-017-9513-z. [Epub ahead of print]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perpetrators of elder abuse can include anyone in a [[position of trust]], control or authority over the individual. Family relationships, neighbors and friends, are all socially considered as relationships of trust, whether or not the older adult actually thinks of the people as "trustworthy". Some perpetrators may "groom" an older person (befriend or build a relationship with them) in order to establish a relationship of trust. Older people living alone who have no adult children living nearby are particularly vulnerable to "grooming" by neighbors and friends who would hope to gain control of their estates.

The majority of abusers are relatives, typically the older adult's spouse/partner or sons and daughters, although the type of abuse differs according to the relationship. In some situations the abuse is "domestic violence grown old", a situation in which the abusive behavior of a spouse or partner continues into old age. In some situations, an older couple may be attempting to care and support each other and failing, in the absence of external support. With sons and daughters it tends to be financial abuse, justified by a belief that it is nothing more than the "advance inheritance" of property, valuables and money.

Within paid care environments, abuse can occur for a variety of reasons. Some abuse is the willful act of cruelty inflicted by a single individual upon an older person. In fact, a case study in Canada suggests that the high elder abuse statistics are from repeat offenders who, like in other forms of abuse, practice elder abuse for the [[schadenfreude]] associated with the act. More commonly, institutional abuses or neglect may reflect lack of knowledge, lack of training, lack of support, or insufficient resourcing. Institutional abuse may be the consequence of common practices or processes that are part of the running of a care institution or service. Sometimes this type of abuse is referred to as "poor practice", although this term reflects the motive of the perpetrator (the causation) rather than the impact upon the older person.

With the aging of today's population, there is the potential that elder abuse will increase unless it is more comprehensively recognized and addressed.

Elder abuse is not a direct parallel to child maltreatment, as perpetrators of elder abuse do not have the same legal protection of rights as parents of children do. For example, a court order is needed to remove a child from their home but not to remove a victim of elder abuse from theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Beach SR, Carpenter CR, Rosen T, Sharps P, Gelles R. Screening and detection of elder abuse: Research opportunities and lessons learned from emergency geriatric care, intimate partner violence, and child abuse. Journal of Elder Abuse and Neglect. 2016; 28(4-5): 185-216. 10.1080/08946566.2016.1229241&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors for elder abuse==

Various [[risk factors]] increase the likelihood that an elderly person will become a victim of elder abuse, including an elderly person who:&lt;ref name=" Hildreth"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hildreth C.J. | year = 2011 | title = Elder Abuse | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 306 | issue = 5| page = 568 | doi =  10.1001/jama.306.5.568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Has memory problems (such as dementia)
* Has a mental illness, either long-standing or recent
* Has physical disabilities
* Has depression, loneliness, or lack of social support
* Abuses alcohol or other substances
* Takes prescribed medications that impair judgment
* Is verbally or physically combative with the caregiver
* Has a shared living situation

Several other risk factors increase the likelihood that a caregiver will participate in elder abuse, including a caregiver who:&lt;ref name="Hildreth" /&gt;
* Feels overwhelmed or resentful
* Has a history of substance abuse or a history of abusing others
* Is dependent on the older person for housing, finances, or other needs
* Has mental health problems
* Is unemployed
* Has a criminal history
* Has a shared living situation

In addition:
* Lower income or poverty has been found to be associated with elder abuse. Low economic resources have been conceptualized as a contextual or situational stressor contributing to elder abuse.
* Living with a large number of household members other than a spouse is associated with an increased risk of abuse, especially financial abuse.

Risk factors can also be categorized into individual, relationship, community, and sociocultural levels. At the individual level, elders who have poor physical and mental health are at higher risk. At the relationship level, a shared living situation is a huge risk factor for the elderly, and living in the same area as the abuser is more likely to result in abuse. At the community level, caregivers may knowingly or inadvertently cause social isolation of the elderly. At the sociocultural level, a representation of an older person as weak and dependent, lack of funds to pay for care, elderly people who need assistance but live alone, and destruction of bonds between the generation of a family are possible factors in elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs357/en/|title=Elder abuse|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and statistics==

There has been a general lack of reliable data in this area and it is often argued that the absence of data is a reflection of the low priority given to work associated with older people. However, over the past decade there has been a growing amount of research into the nature and extent of elder abuse. The research still varies considerably in the definitions being used, who is being asked, and what is being asked. As a result, the statistics used in this area vary considerably.

One study suggests that around 25% of vulnerable older adults will report abuse in the previous month, totaling up to 6% of the general elderly population.&lt;ref name="pmid18349012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper C, Selwood A, Livingston G |title=The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect: a systematic review |journal=Age Ageing |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=151–60 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18349012 |doi=10.1093/ageing/afm194 |url=http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18349012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some consistent themes are beginning to emerge from interaction with abused elders, and through limited and small scale research projects. Work undertaken in Canada suggests that approximately 70% of elder abuse is perpetrated against women and this is supported by evidence from the AEA helpline in the UK, which identifies women as victims in 67% of calls. Also domestic violence in later life may be a continuation of long term partner abuse and in some cases, abuse may begin with retirement or the onset of a health condition.&lt;ref&gt;Silent and Invisible: A Report on Abuse and Violence in the Lives of Older Women in British Columbia and Yukon, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, abuse increases with age, with 78% of victims being over 70 years of age.&lt;ref name="HiddenVoices"&gt;Hidden Voices, Action on Elder Abuse, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher proportion of spousal homicides supports the suggestion that abuse of older women is often a continuation of long term spousal abuse against women. In contrast, the risk of homicide for older men was far greater outside the family than within.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada, 1999, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important point because the domestic violence of older people is often not recognized and consequently strategies, which have proved effective within the domestic violence arena, have not been routinely transferred into circumstances involving the family abuse of older people.

According to the AEA helpline in the UK, abuse occurs primarily in the family home (64%), followed by residential care (23%), and then hospitals (5%), although a helpline does not necessarily provide a true reflection of such situations as it is based upon the physical and mental ability of people to utilize such a resource.&lt;ref name="HiddenVoices" /&gt;

Research conducted in [[New Zealand]] broadly supports the above findings, with some variations. Of 1288 cases in 2002–2004, 1201 individuals, 42 couples, and 45 groups were found to have been abused. Of these, 70 percent were female. Psychological abuse (59%), followed by material/financial (42%), and physical abuse (12%) were the most frequently identified types of abuse. Sexual abuse occurred in 2% of reported cases.&lt;ref name="ACNZ" /&gt;
Age Concern New Zealand found that most abusers are family members (70%), most commonly sons or daughters (40%). Older abusers (those over 65 years) are more likely to be husbands.&lt;ref name="ACNZ"&gt;Age Concern Elder Abuse and Neglect Prevention Services: An Analysis of Referrals for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2004. Age Concern New Zealand, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, 4,766 cases of suspected abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation involving older adults were reported, an increase of 9 percent over 2006. 19 incidents were related to a death, and a total of 303 incidents were considered life-threatening. About one in 11 incidents involved a life-threatening or fatal situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Types of Nursing Home Abuse|url=http://bruceflint.com/types-and-symping-home-abuse/|accessdate=13 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916212825/http://bruceflint.com/types-and-symping-home-abuse/|archive-date=16 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the study called Pure Financial Exploitation vs. Hybrid Exploitation Co-Occurring With Physical Abuse and/or Neglect of Elderly Persons by Shelly L. Jackson and Thomas L. Hafemeister brought attention to the hybrid abuse that elderly persons can experience. This study revealed that victims of hybrid financial exploitation or HFE lost an average of $185,574, a range of $20–$750,000.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Barriers to obtaining statistics===

Several conditions make it hard for researchers to obtain accurate statistics on elder abuse. Researchers may have difficulty obtaining accurate elder abuse statistics for the following reasons:

* Elder abuse is largely a hidden problem and tends to be committed in the privacy of the elderly person's home, mostly by his or her family members.&lt;ref&gt;Administration on Aging. (1998). The national elder abuse incidence study: Final report. [Online], Available:www.aoa.gov/abuse/report/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Elder abuse victims are often unwilling to report their abuse for fear of others' disbelief, fear of loss of independence, fear of being institutionalized, fear of losing their only social support (especially if the perpetrator is a relative), and fear of being subject to future retaliation by the perpetrator(s).&lt;ref&gt;Acierno, R., Hernandex-Tejada, M., Muzzy, W., and Steve, K. (2009). The national elder mistreatment study (NCJ Publication No. 2264560. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bulman P | year = 2010 | title = Elder abuse emerges form the shadows of public consciousness | url = | journal = NIJ Journal | volume = 265 | issue = | pages = 4–7 | doi=10.1037/e546482010-002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, A., Tobin, T., Salomon, A., and Dubois, J. (2008). A statewide profile of abuse of older women and the criminal justice response (NCJ Publication No. 222459). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayalon|first=Liat|title=Fears come true: the experiences of older care recipients and their family members of live-in foreign home care workers.|journal=International Psychogeriatric|date=2009|volume=21|issue=4|doi=10.1017/S1041610209990421|pmid=19538830|pages=779–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Elder abuse victims' cognitive decline and ill health may prevent them from reporting their abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Choi N.G. |author2=Mayer J. | year = 2000 | title = Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation | url = | journal = Journal of Gerontological Social Work | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 5–25 | doi = 10.1300/J083v33n02_02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lack of proper training of service providers, such as social workers, law enforcement, nurses, etc., about elder abuse, therefore the number of cases reported tend to be low&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Laumann E.O. |author2=Leitsch S.A. |author3=Waite L.J. | year = 2008 | title = Elder mistreatment in the United States: Prevalence estimate from a nationally representative study | url = | journal = Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences | volume = 63 | issue = 4| pages = S248–S254 | doi=10.1093/geronb/63.4.s248}}&lt;/ref&gt; poor elders.
* The subjective nature of elder abuse, which largely depends on one's interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayalon|first=Liat|title=Abuse is in the eyes of the beholder: using multiple perspectives to evaluate elder mistreatment under round-the-clock foreign home carers in Israel|journal=Ageing and Society|date=2011|volume=31|issue=3|pages=499–520|doi=10.1017/S0144686X1000108X|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8193145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another reason why there is a lack of accurate statistics is the debate of whether to include self-neglect or not. Many are unsure if it should be included since it does not involve another person as an abuser. Those opposed to the inclusion of self-neglect make the claim that it is a different form of abuse and thus, should not be included in the statistics. Due to this discrepancy and the others mentioned above, it is difficult to get accurate data concerning the abuse of the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Brownell, P., &amp; Rosich, G. (2007). Elder abuse. In J. Blackburn &amp; C. Dulmus (Eds.), Handbook of gerontologyUnited States of America: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
[[File:Measures Used to Help Protect Older Adults with Guardians from Abuse (31560997996) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=2|Graphic depicting protective measures taken to prevent elder abuse, from the [[Government Accountability Office]]]]
Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel can play a vital role in assisting elder abuse victims. Studies have shown that elderly individuals, on average, make 13.9 visits per year to a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics. Older Americans 2008: Key indicators of well-being. Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been an increase in awareness of elder abuse over the years, physicians tend to only report 2% of elder abuse cases.&lt;ref name="Dong"/&gt; Reasons for lack of reporting by physicians include a lack of current knowledge concerning state laws on elder abuse, concern about angering the abuser and ruining the relationship with the elderly patient, possible court appearances, lack of cooperation from elderly patients or families, and lack of time and reimbursement.&lt;ref name="Dong"/&gt; Through education and training on elder abuse, health care professionals can better assist elder abuse victims.

Educating and training those in the criminal justice system, such as police, prosecutors, and the judiciary, on elder abuse, as well as increased legislation to protect elders, will also help to minimize elder abuse and will also provide improved assistance to victims of elder abuse.

In addition, community involvement in responding to elder abuse can contribute to elderly persons' safety. In general, preventing the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse helps not only the elder but it may also improve the anxiety and depression of their caregivers too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=PR|last2=Francis|first2=DP|last3=Hairi|first3=NN|last4=Othman|first4=S|last5=Choo|first5=WY|title=Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=16 August 2016|issue=8|pages=CD010321|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010321.pub2|pmid=27528431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities can develop programs that are structured around meeting the needs of elderly persons. For example, several communities throughout the United States have created Financial Abuse Specialist Teams,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coaoc.org/html/services_fast_description.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  which are multidisciplinary groups that consist of public and private professionals who volunteer their time to advise Adult Protective Services (APS), law enforcement, and private attorneys on matters of vulnerable adult financial abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Council on Aging Orange County, http://www.coaoc.org/html/services_fast_description.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==False accusations of elder abuse==

It is important to recognize that false accusations of elder abuse are very common. An elderly person who has dementia or a mental illness may falsely claim to be a victim of abuse. By one estimate, 70% of elderly people with mental impairments such as dementia, delusions, or paranoia falsely accuse caregivers of stealing. Mentally impaired elders may claim that a caregiver is feeding them poisoned food or holding them prisoner. Websites such as Alzlive.com and DailyCaring.com offer advice for caregivers who are falsely accused of elder abuse or other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alzlive.com/tips/caregiving/false-accusations-theft/|title=False Accusations--Theft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaring.com/8-ways-to-deal-with-false-dementia-accusations/|title=8 Ways to Deal with False Dementia Accusations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaring.com/responding-to-4-common-dementia-accusations-stealing-poisoning-being-held-prisoner/|title=Responding to 4 Common Dementia Accusations: Stealing, Poisoning, Being Held Prisoner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7234">The '''European Sportscar Championship''' was a name used by several [[sports car racing]] championships based in Europe. Initially created in 1970 by the [[Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile]] (FISA) as the '''European 2-Litre Sports Car Championship for Makes''', the series increased in popularity and eventually became part of the [[World Sports Car Championship]] in 1976 even after a troubled 1975 season. Only two years later, as interest in sports-prototypes faded, the championship was downgraded from World Championship status and a European championship returned once more, only to be cancelled after its sole 1978 season.

A European championship for sports cars was created once more in 1983, now named the '''European Endurance Championship''', and combined several events from the World Endurance Championship with other European rounds. The concept was however not continued the following year.

==History==
===1970 &amp;ndash; 1975===
By 1970, light open-cockpit [[sports prototype]]s which used engines under {{convert|2000|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} were becoming popular cars in the [[World Sportscar Championship|World Championship for Makes]]. Chassis manufacturers [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola]], [[Chevron Cars Ltd|Chevron]], [[Abarth]], and [[Porsche]] all offered cars to customers which were designed for this category, leading FISA to create a championship specifically for these cars and serving as a junior formula for the World Championship. Races varied from {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and ran either as a single event or in two heats. [[Grand tourer]] cars were also allowed to participate, although they were not included in the championship standings.

[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]-powered Cherons won the inaugural Championship for Makes in the opening 1970 season, leading Lola by a single point.  Lola triumphed in 1971, followed by [[Osella]] entering the series in partnership with Abarth and dominated the 1972 championship with five victories. Lola won the championship once more in 1973 before the new [[Alpine (car)|Alpine]] A441-[[Renault]] swept the 1974 season with nine wins in nine races.

The 1975 season was cancelled shortly after it had begun, only two rounds being completed before rising fuel costs forced a premature end to the championship. FISA however pressed forward with the creation of a World Championship for open-cockpit prototypes, combining not only 2-Litre entries from the European Championship, but also the prototypes with larger engines which had previously run in the World Championship for Makes.

===1976 &amp;ndash; 1977===
{{seealso|World Sportscar Championship}}
During the [[1976 World Sportscar Championship|1976]] and [[1977 World Sportscar Championship|1977]] seasons, FISA established new rules for a [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]] category of prototypes. 2-Litre sports cars from the former European Championship were part of the new Group 6 classification, competing alongside sports prototypes which used the 3-Litre and 5-Litre engine rules. The new World Sports Car Championship was created exclusively for the Group 6 category. Although a World Championship, only one race was held outside of Europe in 1976 season, and all events were within Europe in 1977.

Porsche's 3-Litre cars won every event in 1976 while Osella's 2-Litre cars were second in the Manufacturer's Championship. Osella once again led the 2-Litre category in 1977 while [[Alfa Romeo]]'s 3-Litre cars won all eight rounds. At the end of the 1977 season, FISA chose to cancel the World Sports Car Championship in order to concentrate on the World Championship for Makes. The Group 6 category would however be allowed to compete in World Championship for Makes events once again, however they were not allowed to score points towards the Championship.

===1978===
After the cancellation of the World Sports Car Championship, the European Sports Car Championship was created for 1978 in order to allow Group 6 prototypes to continue to compete for their own championship. Manufacturers no longer were granted their own championship, and emphasis was instead placed on drivers. The series was also separated into two categories, one for the 2-Litre cars and the other for the larger capacity cars. Osellas once again led the 2-Litre field, led by drive "[[Gimax]]" who won the 2-Litre Drivers Championship.  Porsche driver [[Reinhold Joest]] won the other Drivers Championship.

Diminishing support for sports prototypes and the large number of drivers which chose to compete in the [[Italian Group 6 Championship]] led FISA to cancel the European Championship outright after 1978. Group 6 cars continued to compete as guests in World Championship for Makes events until 1982 when regulations were once again changed and the [[Group C]] category was established.

===1983===
In [[1981 World Sportscar Championship season|1981]], the World Championship for Makes was succeeded by the World Endurance Championship with the introduction of the Group C and [[Group B]] regulations. As part of this change, a Drivers Championship was introduced for the first time alongside the Manufacturers Championship. However, as the majority of teams concentrated on the European events which were the majority of the schedule, a third Championship was created, known as the European Endurance Championship.

The European Endurance Championship was composed of five events which were part of the Manufacturers Championship, as well as three races which were not counted towards the Manufacturers Championship but were well attended by the teams. Porsche driver [[Bob Wollek]] won the 1983 Endurance Championship, although he was ranked fifth in the World Championship standings.

After 1983, FISA eliminated the European Endurance Championship, choosing to keep the World Championship for drivers instead.

The '''Flevo Festival''' was an open air [[Christian music festival]] held each August in the [[Netherlands]].  The festival was first organized as the '''Kamperland Festival''' in 1978 by the Dutch arm of [[Youth for Christ]] and became a private foundation in 2002.  The last event was held in 2012; one month later, the organization decided to stop gatherings because the quantity of visitors was decreasing:  For example, in 2012 the number of people attending the festival was 6,000, whereas in 2011 that number was 9,500 people.

In its heyday, the festival attracted approximately 10,000 to 20,000 people each year.  It highlighted all musical styles, but especially [[rock music|rock]], and was considered by some{{Who|date=May 2010}} to be the most important European Christian festival.  Previous headline bands have included [[Stryper]], [[dc Talk]], [[Jars of Clay]], [[Sixpence None the Richer]], [[Bride (band)|Bride]], [[Audio Adrenaline]], [[SONICFLOOd]], [[Switchfoot]] and [[Five Iron Frenzy]].

In 2013 a group of former volunteers from Flevo Festival organised a festival in line with the 35 years of history of Flevo, naming it [[Flavor Festival]].

== MMR vaccine and autism ==
In 1998 [[Andrew Wakefield]] published a fraudulent article in a ''The Lancet'', a prominent British medical journal, claiming that the MMR [[vaccines caused autism]].&lt;ref name="3."/&gt; Although the article was later retracted, the idea that vaccines cause autism became a major news story.&lt;ref name=Goldacre-2008&gt;{{cite news |title= The MMR hoax |author= Goldacre B |work=The Guardian |date=30 August 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-30 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/30/mmr.health.media|archiveurl=http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/the-medias-mmr-hoax/|archivedate=30 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that scientists had shown the narrative to be false, it had become part of the folk epidemiology of autism.&lt;ref name="1."/&gt;&lt;ref name="3."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=B.|title=Vaccines and the changing epidemiology of autism|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|volume=32|issue=5|year=2006|pages=511–519|issn=0305-1862|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00655.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative was easy to understand and apparently consistent with anecdotal evidence of children receiving autism diagnoses shortly after having been vaccinated. Doctors were highly critical of the media coverage for triggering a decline in vaccination rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5118166.stm|title= Doctors issue plea over MMR jab|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-02-04 | date=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The false belief has persisted despite a public information campaign aimed at making parents aware that by refusing vaccinations they are putting their children at risk of contracting infectious diseases that are frequently fatal.&lt;ref name=MMRthefacts/&gt;

===Mass media===
Observers have criticized the involvement of mass media in the controversy alleging that the media provided Wakefield's study with more credibility than it deserved.&lt;ref name=EMBOreports&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore Andrew | year = 2006 | title = Bad science in the headlines: Who takes responsibility when science is distorted in the mass media? | url = http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v7/n12/full/7400862.html | journal = [[EMBO Reports]] | volume = 7 | issue = 12| pages = 1193–1196 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400862 | pmc = 1794697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endorsements by [[celebrity|celebrities]] such as [[Jenny McCarthy]] and [[Robert F.

===Consequences===
The scientific consensus is that the MMR vaccine has no link to the development of autism, and that the vaccine's benefits greatly outweigh its risks.&lt;ref name=MMRthefacts/&gt; The false belief that the [[MMR vaccine]] causes autism led to a sharp drop in rates of vaccination in the UK and Ireland after 1998, creating a major public health risk. Lower vaccination rates were followed by increases in the incidence of measles and mumps, and the resulting cases of permanent disability and death.&lt;ref name=McIntyre/&gt;

Public fears about vaccination have consumed resources that might otherwise have advanced research into the real causes of autism.&lt;ref name="5."/&gt; There have been thirteen studies that properly followed the [[scientific method]] and contained large numbers of participants that failed to connect autism to the [[MMR vaccine]].&lt;ref name="4."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerber|first1=Jeffrey S.|last2=Offit|first2=Paul A.|title=Vaccines and Autism: A Tale of Shifting Hypotheses|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=48|issue=4|year=2009|pages=456–461|issn=1058-4838|doi=10.1086/596476|pmc=2908388}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been seven well-constructed studies that have attempted to link autism to [[thiomersal]] in vaccines and were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="4."/&gt; Special interest groups continue to push for more research on the link between vaccines and autism.&lt;ref name="4."/&gt;&lt;ref name="5."/&gt; Further research motivated by the folk epidemiology of autism would represent a lost opportunity to investigate autism's true causes.&lt;ref name="5."/&gt;

'''Frederick William Seward''' (July 8, 1830 &amp;ndash; April 25, 1915) was an American politician and member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] who twice served as the [[United States Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]]. The son of [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]], he served as Assistant Secretary from 1861 to 1869 under both [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Andrew Johnson]] and then from 1877 to 1879 in the administration of [[Rutherford B. Hayes]].

==Early life==
Seward was born in [[Auburn, New York]], the son of [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] and [[Frances Adeline Seward]] and elder brother of General [[William H. Seward Jr.]]

Frederick attended the Pearl Street Academy from 1839 to 1840, which is located in [[Albany, New York]]; while his father was Governor of New York State.&lt;ref&gt;Reminiscences of a Wartime Statesman and Diplomat. G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1916, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Union College]] in 1849, and studied law with [[Henry E. Davies (judge)|Henry E. Davies]] and William Kent.  In 1851, he was admitted to the bar in [[Rochester, New York]].

After graduating from college, Seward served as a [[secretary]] to his father from 1849 to 1857, and served as associate editor of the ''Albany Evening Journal'' from 1851 to 1861.

==Baltimore Plot==
On February 21, 1861, Seward arrived at the Continental Hotel in Philadelphia carrying a letter from his father for President-elect Lincoln. The letter contained information gathered by Colonel [[Charles Pomeroy Stone]] and General [[Winfield Scott]].

Stone had stationed three detectives from the New York police department in [[Baltimore]], Maryland to gather information about plots against Lincoln. Making his way by train from Illinois to Washington for his inauguration, Lincoln had intended to stop next at Baltimore, which was home to many [[Plug Uglies|secessionist sympathizers]]. According to information gathered by Stone's detectives, secessionists were planning to assassinate Lincoln during his stop in Baltimore.

The warning Fred Seward brought would contribute to Lincoln's decision to pass through Baltimore under the cover of night, rather than stop and appear in public there. Although [[Allan Pinkerton]] also warned Lincoln of danger awaiting him in Baltimore, it was Seward's information that confirmed everyone's fears.

==Civil War==
When his father was appointed [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in 1861, Seward became Assistant Secretary of State in charge of consular service under Lincoln and [[Andrew Johnson]]. He served in the position until 1869.

==Attempt on father's life==
{{main|Abraham Lincoln assassination}}
[[File:Frederick W. Seward - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick W. Seward during the Civil War.]]
On April 14, 1865, he was injured in an assassination attempt upon his father on the same night that Lincoln was murdered. [[Lewis Powell (assassin)|Lewis Powell]], also known as "Lewis Paine," an ex-Confederate co-conspirator of [[John Wilkes Booth]] attempted to kill William Seward while the Secretary of State was convalescing at home from a carriage  accident.

That was Powell's part in the plot to put the government into chaos; [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Andrew Johnson and President Lincoln were also to be killed that same evening. After Frederick blocked Powell from gaining access to William Seward's bedroom, Powell tried to shoot Frederick in the head. However, when the gun failed to fire, Powell quickly smashed the pistol over Frederick's head, causing several skull injuries. Frederick then collapsed and fell to the floor at the top of the stairs.

Powell then burst into William Seward's room and stabbed him several times in the face and neck. Powell also injured a number of other bystanders, including Frederick's sister Fanny, his brother [[Augustus Henry Seward|Augustus]], his father's nurse Private George F. Robinson and messenger Emerick Hansell, but no one was killed. Seward's mother was sure that he was going to die; instead, she died on June 21, 1865 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. His sister, Fanny, died soon afterward, in October 1866.

Powell was hanged on July 7, 1865, along with [[David Herold]], [[George Atzerodt]], and [[Mary Surratt]], who were also involved in the conspiracy.

==Later life==
Frederick's father died on October 10, 1872. Seward was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (New York Co., 7th D.) in [[98th New York State Legislature|1875]]. At the [[New York state election, 1875]], he ran on the Republican ticket for [[Secretary of State of New York]], but was defeated by Democrat [[John Bigelow]]. He served again as [[United States Assistant Secretary of State|Assistant Secretary of State]] under [[William M. Evarts]] from 1877 to 1879. Seward also edited and published his father's [[autobiography]] and letters.

==Personal life==
He married Anna Wharton of [[Albany, New York]] and spent the latter part of his life in a house he built in [[Montrose, New York]]. Mostly, his life after 1881 was devoted to the practice of his legal profession and to lecturing and writing.

Seward died at the age of 84. He was interred with his family in [[Fort Hill Cemetery]] in [[Auburn, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Frederick W.

In economics, the '''free-rider problem''' occurs when those who benefit from resources, public goods, or services do not pay for them, which results in an underprovision of those goods or services.&lt;ref name=Baumol&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumol |first=William |title=Welfare Economics and the Theory of the State |year=1952 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a free-rider may frequently ask for available parking lots ([[public goods]]) from those who have already paid for them, in order to benefit from free parking. That is, the free-rider may use the parking even more than the others without paying a penny. The free-rider problem is the question of how to limit free riding and its negative effects in these situations. The free-rider problem may occur when property rights are not clearly defined and imposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pasour, Jr. |first1=E. C. |title=The Free Rider as a Basis for Government Intervention |url=https://direct.mises.org/journals/jls/5_4/5_4_6.pdf |publisher=Libertarian Studies |accessdate=2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free-rider problem is common with goods which are [[non-excludability|non-excludable]], including [[public good]]s and situations of the [[Tragedy of the Commons]].

Although the term "free rider" was first used in economic theory of public goods, similar concepts have been applied to other contexts, including [[collective bargaining]], antitrust law, psychology and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hendriks |first=Carolyn M. |date=December 2006 |title=When the Forum Meets Interest Politics: Strategic Uses of Public Deliberation |journal=Politics &amp; Society (Vol. 34-4) |doi=10.1177/0032329206293641}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some individuals in a team or community may reduce their contributions or performance if they believe that one or more other members of the group may free ride.&lt;ref&gt;Ruël, Gwenny Ch.; Bastiaans, Nienke and Nauta, Aukje. [http://som.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/reports/themeA/2003/03A42/03a42.pdf "Free-riding and team performance in project education"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The economic problem with free riding==
Free riding is a problem of [[Pareto efficiency|economic inefficiency]] when it leads to the under-production or over-consumption of a good. For example, when people are asked how much they value a particular public good, with that value measured in terms of how much money they would be willing to pay, their tendency is to under report their valuations.&lt;ref name="Economics and the Environment"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goodstein |first1=Eban |title=Economics and the Environment |date=2014 |publisher=Library of Congress |location=University of Minnesota |isbn=978-1-118-53972-9 |edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goods which are subject to free riding are usually characterized by the inability to exclude non-payers. This problem is sometimes compounded by the fact that common-property goods are characterized by rival consumption. Not only can consumers of common-property goods benefit without payment, but consumption by one imposes an opportunity cost on others. This will lead to overconsumption and even possibly exhaustion or destruction of the common-property good. If too many people start to free ride, a system or service will eventually not have enough resources to operate.

The other problem of free-riding is experienced when the production of goods does not consider the [[Externality|external costs]], particularly the use of [[ecosystem services]].

{{Main|Assurance contract}}

An [[assurance contract]] is a contract in which participants make a binding pledge to contribute to building a public good, contingent on a quorum of a predetermined size being reached.  Otherwise the good is not provided and any monetary contributions are refunded.

A [[assurance contract#Variants|dominant assurance contract]] is a variation in which an entrepreneur creates the contract and refunds the initial pledge plus an additional sum of money if the quorum is not reached.  (The entrepreneur profits by collecting a fee if the quorum is reached and the good is provided.) In [[game theory|game-theoretic]] terms this makes pledging to build the public good a dominant strategy: the best move is to pledge to the contract regardless of the actions of others.

=== Coasian solution ===
A ''Coasian solution'', named for the economist [[Ronald Coase]], proposes that potential beneficiaries of a public good can negotiate to pool their resources and create it, based on each party's self-interested willingness to pay.  His treatise, "The Problem of Social Cost" (1960), argued that if the [[transaction cost]]s between potential beneficiaries of a public good are low—that it is easy for potential beneficiaries to find each other and organize a pooling their resources based upon the good's value to each of them—that public goods could be produced without government action.&lt;ref name=Coase1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coase |first=Ronald |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |date=October 1960 |volume=3 |pages=1–44 |doi=10.1086/466560 |title=The Problem of Social Cost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, Coase himself wrote that while what had become known as the Coase Theorem had explored the implications of zero transaction costs, he had actually intended to use this construct as a stepping-stone to understand the real world of positive transaction costs, corporations, legal systems and government actions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fox |first=Glenn |title=The Real Coase Theorems |url=http://www.canadianjusticereviewboard.ca/archive-Dr._Glenn_Fox_on_The_Real_Coase_Theorems.pdf |website=Cato Journal 27, Fall 2007 |publisher=Cato Institute, Washington, D.C. |accessdate=17 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723053515/http://www.canadianjusticereviewboard.ca/archive-Dr._Glenn_Fox_on_The_Real_Coase_Theorems.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coase1988_1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coase |first=Ronald |title=The Firm, the Market and the Law |year=1988 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I examined what would happen in a world in which transaction costs were assumed to be zero. My aim in doing so was not to describe what life would be like in such a world but to provide a simple setting in which to develop the analysis and, what was even more important, to make clear the fundamental role which transaction costs do, and should, play in the fashioning of the institutions which make up the economic system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Coase also wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The world of zero transaction costs has often been described as a Coasian world. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is the world of modern economic theory, one which I was hoping to persuade economists to leave.  What I did in "The Problem of Social Cost" was simply to shed light on some of its properties. I argued in such a world the allocation of resources would be independent of the legal position, a result which Stigler dubbed the "Coase theorem".&lt;ref name="Coase1988_2"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Firm, the Market and the Law |last=Coase |first=Ronald |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1988 |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, while Coase himself appears to have considered the "Coase theorem" and Coasian solutions as simplified constructs to ultimately consider the real 20th-century world of governments and laws and corporations, these concepts have become attached to a world where transaction costs were much lower, and government intervention would unquestionably be less necessary.

A minor alternative, especially for information goods, is for the producer to refuse to release a good to the public until payment to cover costs is met. Author [[Stephen King]], for instance, authored chapters of a new novel downloadable for free on his website while stating that he would not release subsequent chapters unless a certain amount of money was raised. Sometimes dubbed ''holding for ransom'', this method of public goods production is a modern application of the [[street performer protocol]] for public goods production. Unlike assurance contracts, its success relies largely on social norms to ensure (to some extent) that the threshold is reached and partial contributions are not wasted.

One of the purest Coasian solutions today is the new phenomenon of Internet [[crowdfunding]]. Here rules are enforced by computer algorithms and legal contracts as well as social pressure.  For example, on the [[Kickstarter]] site, each funder authorizes a credit card purchase to buy a new product or receive other promised benefits, but no money changes hands until the funding goal is met.&lt;ref name=kick&gt;{{cite web |title=Kickstarter FAQ |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/kickstarter+basics?ref=faq_nav#Kick |accessdate=17 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226050118/https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/kickstarter+basics?ref=faq_nav#Kick |archive-date=26 February 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because automation and the Internet so reduce the transaction costs for pooling resources, project goals of only a few hundred dollars are frequently crowdfunded, far below the costs of soliciting traditional investors.

=== Government provision ===
If voluntary provision of public goods will not work, then the solution is making their provision involuntary. This saves each of us from our own tendency to be a free rider, while also assuring us that no one else will be allowed to free ride.  One frequently proposed solution to the problem is for governments or [[State (polity)|states]] to impose [[taxation]] to fund the production of public goods. This does not actually solve the theoretical problem because ''good government'' is itself a public good.  Thus it is difficult to ensure the government has an incentive to provide the optimum amount even if it were possible for the government to determine precisely what amount would be optimum.  These issues are studied by [[public choice]] theory and [[public finance]].

Sometimes the government provides public goods using "unfunded mandates". An example is the requirement that every car be fit with a [[catalytic converter]]. This may be executed in the [[private sector]], but the end result is predetermined by the state: the individually involuntary provision of the public good [[air pollution|clean air]]. Unfunded mandates have also been imposed by the U.S. federal government on the state and local governments, as with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], for example.

Regardless the role of the government is provide vital goods to all individuals, some of which they cannot obtain on themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Donald. "The Proper Role of Government: Considering Public Goods and Private Goods". The Pennsylvania State University, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In order to ensure that government services are properly funded taxes and other government controlled entities are enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Jakacky, Gary. "The Role of Government in Providing". Newsmax Finance, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Although enforced taxes deter the free-rider problem many contend that some goods should be excluded and made into private goods. However, this not possible with all goods such as pure public goods that are inseparable and inclusive, thus require "provision by public means".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Bill. "Public Goods and Services". The Social Studies Help Center, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the government has a responsibility to ensure that the social welfare of individuals is met as opposed to privatized goods.&lt;ref&gt;Holtz, Brian. "The Proper Role of Government". Holtz for Congress, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsidies and joint products ===
A government may [[subsidy|subsidize]] production of a public good in the private sector. Unlike government provision, subsidies may result in some form of a [[competition|competitive]] market. The potential for [[crony capitalism|cronyism]] (for example, an alliance between political insiders and the businesses receiving subsidies) can be limited with secret bidding for the subsidies or application of the subsidies following clear general principles. Depending on the nature of a public good and a related subsidy, [[principal–agent problem]]s can arise between the citizens and the government or between the government and the subsidized producers; this effect and counter-measures taken to address it can diminish the benefits of the subsidy.

Subsidies can also be used in areas with a potential for [[Public good#Non-individualism|non-individualism]]: For instance, a state may subsidize devices to reduce [[air pollution]] and appeal to citizens to cover the remaining costs.

Similarly, a joint-product model analyzes the collaborative effect of joining a private good to a public good. For example, a tax deduction (private good) can be ''tied'' to a donation to a charity (public good).  It can be shown that the provision of the public good increases when tied to the private good, as long as the private good is provided by a monopoly (otherwise the private good would be provided by competitors without the link to the public good).

=== Privileged group ===
The study of [[collective action]] shows that public goods are still produced when one individual benefits more from the public good than it costs him to produce it; examples include benefits from individual use, [[intrinsic motivation]] to produce, and [[business model]]s based on selling [[complement good]]s. A group that contains such individuals is called a [[privileged group]]. A historical example could be a downtown entrepreneur who erects a street light in front of his shop to attract customers; even though there are positive external benefits to neighboring nonpaying businesses, the added customers to the paying shop provide enough revenue to cover the costs of the street light.

The existence of privileged groups may not be a complete solution to the free rider problem, however, as [[underproduction]] of the public good may still result. The street light builder, for instance, would not consider the added benefit to neighboring businesses when determining whether to erect his street light, making it possible that the street light isn't built when the cost of building is too high for the single entrepreneur even when the total benefit to all the businesses combined exceeds the cost.

An example of the privileged group solution could be the [[Linux]] community, assuming that users derive more benefit from contributing than it costs them to do it. For more discussion on this topic see also [[Coase's Penguin]].

Another example is those musicians and writers who create music and writings for their own personal enjoyment, and publish because they enjoy having an audience.  Financial incentives are not necessary to ensure the creation of these public goods.  Whether this creates the correct production level of writings and music is an open question.

=== Merging free riders ===
Another method of overcoming the free rider problem is to simply eliminate the profit incentive for free riding by buying out all the potential free riders. A property developer that owned an entire city street, for instance, would not need to worry about free riders when erecting street lights since he owns every business that could benefit from the street light without paying. Implicitly, then, the property developer would erect street lights until the marginal social benefit met the marginal social cost. In this case, they are equivalent to the private marginal benefits and costs.

While the purchase of all potential free riders may solve the problem of underproduction due to free riders in smaller markets, it may simultaneously introduce the problem of underproduction due to [[monopoly]]. Additionally, some markets are simply too large to make a buyout of all beneficiaries feasible—this is particularly visible with public goods that affect everyone in a country.

=== Introducing an exclusion mechanism (club goods) ===
Another solution, which has evolved for information goods, is to introduce exclusion mechanisms which turn public goods into [[club good]]s.  One well-known example is [[copyright]] and [[patent]] laws.  These laws, which in the 20th century came to be called [[intellectual property]] laws, attempt to remove the natural non-excludability by prohibiting reproduction of the good.  Although they can address the free rider problem, the downside of these laws is that they imply private monopoly power and thus are not [[Pareto-optimal]].

For example, in the United States, the patent rights given to pharmaceutical companies encourage them to charge high prices (above [[marginal cost]])&lt;!--I'm hiding this, not removing it, just in case.{{Dubious|date=August 2011| reason=Patents encourage pharmaceutical research (which is absurdly expensive) by allowing companies to have some time to recuperate their losses via market monopoly.  If a company had to share the market immediately, they would be unlikely to recover the amount lost during research.  See "generic competition paradox", which shows that it is actually the loss of the patent that causes prices to skyrocket.}}--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/Do-patents-increase-the-price-of-drugs&lt;/ref&gt; and to advertise to convince patients to persuade their doctors to prescribe the drugs.{{Dubious|date=August 2011| reason= Advertising is done by companies that don't have patents, too.  The choice to advertise is completely unrelated to patents}}  Likewise, copyright provides an incentive for a publisher to act like [[The Dog in the Manger]], taking older works [[out of print]] so as not to cannibalize revenue from the publisher's own new works.&lt;ref&gt;Examples from the entertainment industry include [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]'s "[[Disney Vault|vault]]" sales practice and its outright refusal to issue ''[[Song of the South]]'' on home video in most markets. Examples from the computer software industry include [[Microsoft]]'s decision to pull [[Windows XP]] from the market in mid-2008 to drive revenue from the widely criticized [[Windows Vista]] operating system.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed|date=August 2011}}

The laws also end up encouraging patent and copyright owners to sue even mild imitators in court and to lobby for the extension of the term of the exclusive rights in a form of [[rent seeking]].

These problems with the club-good mechanism arise because the underlying [[marginal cost]] of giving the good to more people is low or zero, but, because of the limits of [[price discrimination]] those who are unwilling or unable to pay a profit-maximizing price do not gain access to the good.

If the costs of the exclusion mechanism are not higher than the gain from the collaboration, club goods can emerge naturally. [[James M. Buchanan]] showed in his seminal paper that clubs can be an efficient alternative to government interventions.&lt;ref&gt;James M. Buchanan (February 1965). "An Economic Theory of Clubs". Economica. 32 (125): 1–14. doi:10.2307/2552442. JSTOR 2552442.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the inefficiencies and inequities of club goods exclusions sometimes cause potentially excludable club goods to be treated as public goods, and their production financed by some other mechanism.  Examples of such "natural" club goods include [[Natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] with very high fixed costs, private golf courses, cinemas, cable television and social clubs.  This explains why many such goods are often provided or subsidized by governments, co-operatives or volunteer associations, rather than being left to be supplied by profit-minded entrepreneurs.  These goods are often known as ''social goods''.

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] claimed that the "excess profits", or profits over normal profit, generated by the copyright or patent monopoly will attract competitors that will make technological innovations and thereby end the monopoly. This is a continual process referred to as "Schumpeterian [[creative destruction]]", and its applicability to different types of public goods is a source of some controversy. The supporters of the theory point to the case of Microsoft, for example, which has been increasing its prices (or lowering its products' quality), predicting that these practices will make increased market shares for Linux and Apple largely inevitable.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

A nation can be seen as a club whose members are its citizens. Government would then be the manager of this club. This is further studied in the Theory of the State.

== Altruistic solutions ==

=== Social norms ===
{{Essay-like|section|date=February 2017}}When enough people do not think like free-riders, the private and voluntary provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. Other public-spirited individuals don't do this and might even pick up existing litter. Reasons for the act could be that the person derives pleasure from helping their community, feels ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them, or could be emotionally attached to the public good. People unconsciously adapt their behavior to that of their peers; this is [[conformity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Even people who engaged in free-riding by littering elsewhere are less likely to if they see others hold on to their trash.

Social norms can be observed wherever people interact, not only in physical spaces but in virtual communities on the Internet. For example, if a disabled person boards a crowded bus, everyone expects that some able-bodied person will volunteer their seat. The same social norm, although executed in a different environment, can also be applied to the Internet. If a user enters a discussion in a chat room and continues to use all capital letters or to make personal attacks ("flames") when addressing other users, the culprit may realize he or she has been blocked by other participants. As in real life, users learning to adapt to the social norms of cyberspace communities provide a public good—here, not suffering disruptive online behavior—for all the participants.

=== Social sanctions (punishment) ===
Experimental literature suggests that free riding can be overcome without any state intervention. Peer-to-peer punishment, that is, members sanction those members that do not contribute to the public good at a cost, is sufficient to establish and maintain cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elinor Ostrom |author2=James Walker |author3=Roy Gardner |authorlink1=Elinor Ostrom |title=Covenants With and without a Sword: Self-Governance Is Possible |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |date=June 1992 |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=404–17 |doi=10.2307/1964229|jstor=1964229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., &amp; S. Gächter (2000) "Cooperation and Punishment in Public Goods Experiments"'', 90 American Economic Review'' 980.&lt;/ref&gt; Such punishment is often considered altruistic, because it comes at a cost to the punisher, however, the exact nature remains to be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fehr |first1=Ernst |last2=Gächter |first2=Simon |year=2002 |title=Altruistic punishment in humans |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=6868 |pages=137–40 |doi=10.1038/415137a|pmid=11805825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether costly punishment can explain cooperation is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dreber |first1=Anna |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |title=Winners don't punish |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=452 |issue=7185 |pages=348–51 |doi=10.1038/nature06723 |pmid=18354481 |pmc=2292414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research finds that costly punishment is less effective in real world environments. For example, punishment works relatively badly under imperfect information, where people cannot observe the behavior of others perfectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kristoffel Grechenig |first1=Nicklisch |last2=Thöni |first2=C. |year=2010 |title=Punishment despite reasonable doubt – a public goods experiment with sanctions under uncertainty |ssrn=1586775 |journal=Journal of Empirical Legal Studies |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=847–67 |doi=10.1111/j.1740-1461.2010.01197.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voluntary organizations ===
Organizations such as the [[Red Cross]], [[public radio]] and [[public broadcasting|television]] or a [[volunteer fire department]] provide public goods to the majority at the expense of a minority who voluntarily participate or contribute funds. Contributions to online collaborative media like [[Wikipedia]] and other [[wiki]] projects, and [[free software]] projects such as [[Linux]] are another example of relatively few contributors providing a public good (information) freely to all readers or software users.

Proposed explanations for [[altruism|altruistic]] behavior include [[Altruism#Evolutionary explanations|biological altruism]] and [[reciprocal altruism]].  For example, voluntary groups such as labor unions and charities often have a federated structure, probably in part because voluntary collaboration emerges more readily in smaller social groups than in large ones (e.g., see [[Dunbar's number]]).

While both biological and reciprocal altruism are observed in other animals, our species' complex social behaviors take these raw materials much farther. [[Philanthropy]] by wealthy individuals—some, such as [[Andrew Carnegie]] giving away their entire vast fortunes—have historically provided a multitude of public goods for others.  One major impact was the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s development of the "[[Green Revolution]]" hybrid grains that probably saved many millions of people from starvation in the 1970s. [[Christian missionaries]], who typically spend large parts of their lives in remote, often dangerous places, have had disproportionate impact compared with their numbers worldwide for centuries. [[Communist]] revolutionaries in the 20th century had similar dedication and outsized impacts.  International relief organizations such as [[Doctors Without Borders]], [[Save the Children]] and [[Amnesty International]] have benefited millions, while also occasionally costing workers their lives.  For better and for worse, humans can conceive of, and sacrifice for, an almost infinite variety of causes in addition to their biological kin.

=== Religions and ideologies ===
[[File:The noblest motive is the public good - Jefferson Building - Library of Congress.jpg|thumb|"The noblest motive is the public good." [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], [[Library of Congress]].]]

Voluntary altruistic organizations often motivate their members by encouraging deep-seated personal beliefs, whether religious or other (such as social justice or environmentalism) that are taken "on faith" more than proved by rational argument.  When individuals resist temptations to free riding (e.g., stealing) because they hold these beliefs (or because they fear the disapproval of others who do), they provide others with public goods that might be difficult or impossible to "produce" by administrative coercion alone.

One proposed explanation for the ubiquity of religious belief in human societies is [[Group selection#Multilevel selection theory|multi-level selection]]: altruists often lose out within groups, but groups with more altruists win.  A group whose members believe a "practical reality" that motivates altruistic behavior may out-compete other groups whose members' perception of "factual reality" causes them to behave selfishly. A classic example is a soldier's willingness to fight for his tribe or country. Another example given in evolutionary biologist [[David Sloan Wilson]]'s ''[[Darwin's Cathedral]]'' is the [[early Christian church]] under the late [[Roman Empire]]; because Roman society was highly individualistic, during frequent epidemics many of the sick died not of the diseases ''per se'' but for lack of basic nursing. Christians, who believed in an afterlife, were willing to nurse the sick despite the risks. Although the death rate among the nurses was high, the average Christian had a ''much better chance'' of surviving an epidemic than other Romans did, and the community prospered.

Religious and non-religious traditions and ideologies (such as [[nationalism]] and [[patriotism]]) are in full view when a society is in crisis and public goods such as defense are most needed. Wartime leaders invoke their God's protection and claim that their society's most hallowed traditions are at stake. For example, according to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Gettysburg Address]] during the [[American Civil War]], the Union was fighting so "that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth".  Such voluntary, if exaggerated, exhortations complement forcible measures—taxation and conscription—to motivate people to make sacrifices for their cause.

'''Friedrich "Fritz" Kreisler''' (February{{nbsp}}2, 1875{{snd}}January{{nbsp}}29, 1962) was an [[Austria]]n-born [[violin]]ist and [[composer]].&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; One of the most noted violin masters of his day, and regarded as one of the greatest violin masters of all time, he was known for his sweet [[Musical tone|tone]] and expressive [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]]. Like many great violinists of his generation, he produced a characteristic sound which was immediately recognizable as his own. Although it derived in many respects from the Franco-Belgian school, his style is nonetheless reminiscent of the ''[[gemütlich]]'' (cozy) lifestyle of pre-war [[Vienna]].

== Biography ==
Kreisler was born in [[Vienna]], the son of Anna (her original Hebrew name, listed in her sons’ birth certificates was "Chaje Riwe" (rendered as "Chaje Ribe" in Hugo's record) (née Reaches) and Samuel Kreisler, a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UvG8FTMhCyAC&amp;pg=PA456|title=Jüdisches biographisches Lexikon: eine Sammlung von bedeutenden Persönlichkeiten jüdischer Herkunft ab 1800|first=Hans|last=Morgenstern|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Lit|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEbX3O9cWaoC&amp;q=Anna%20Reches%20Samuel%20Kreisler&amp;dq=Anna%20Reches%20Samuel%20Kreisler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_6GrA06fxA&amp;sig=30TqJi5mvHxFzgv49QqBxTvfV2w&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Freud, Appraisals and Reappraisals: Contributions to Freud Studies|first=Paul E.|last=Stepansky|date=1 January 1986|publisher=Analytic Press|isbn=0-88163-038-1|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Jewish heritage, he was however [[Baptism|baptised]] at the age of 12. He studied at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]] and in Paris, where his teachers included [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Léo Delibes]], [[Jakob Dont]], [[Joseph Hellmesberger Jr.]], [[Joseph Massart]], and [[Jules Massenet]]. While there, he won the "Premier Grand Prix de Rome" gold medal at the age of 12, competing against 40 other players, all of whom were at least 20 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fritz-kreisler-mn0000757095/biography|title=Fritz Kreisler – Biography &amp; History – AllMusic|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his United States debut at the [[Steinway Hall]] in [[New York City]] on November 10, 1888, and his first tour of the United States in 1888–1889 with [[Moriz Rosenthal]]. He then returned to Austria and applied for a position in the [[Vienna Philharmonic]], but was turned down by the concertmaster [[Arnold Rosé]]. As a result, he left music to study medicine. He spent a brief time in the [[army]] before returning to the violin in 1899, when he gave a concert with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] conducted by [[Arthur Nikisch]]. It was this concert and a series of American tours from 1901 to 1903 that brought him real acclaim.

In 1910, Kreisler gave the premiere of Sir [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|Edward Elgar's Violin Concerto]], a work commissioned by and dedicated to him. He served briefly in the Austrian Army in [[World War I]] before being honourably discharged after he was wounded. He arrived in [[New York City|New York]] on November 24, 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The world of music |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/420/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Dec 14, 1914 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent the remainder of the war in America. He returned to Europe in 1924, living first in Berlin, then moving to France in 1938.  Shortly thereafter, at the outbreak of [[World War II]], he settled once again in the United States, becoming a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1943. He lived there for the rest of his life, giving his last public concert in 1947, and broadcasting performances for a few years after that.

On April 26, 1941, he was involved in a serious traffic accident. Struck by a truck while crossing a street in New York, he suffered a fractured skull and was in a coma for over a week.&lt;ref&gt;[[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]], May 12, 1941 (pp. 32–33)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, he suffered from not only some hearing loss but also sight deterioration due to cataracts.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Kreisler: Love's Sorrow, Love's Joy, by Amy Biancolli (Amadeus Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kreisler died of a heart condition aggravated by old age in New York City in 1962.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/01/30/archives/fritz-kreisler-dies-here-at-86-violinist-composed-200-works-made.html |title=Fritz Kreisler Dies Here at 86; Violinist Composed 200 Works; Made His U.S. Concert Debut in 1888 at 13.

== Legacy ==
Kreisler wrote a number of pieces for the violin, including solos for encores, such as "[[Liebesleid]]" and "[[Liebesfreud]]". Some of Kreisler's compositions were [[pastiche]]s ostensibly in the style of other composers.  They were originally ascribed to earlier composers, such as [[Gaetano Pugnani]], [[Giuseppe Tartini]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]], and then,  in 1935, Kreisler revealed that it was he who wrote the pieces. When critics complained, Kreisler replied that they had already deemed the compositions worthy: "The name changes, the value remains", he said. He also wrote [[operetta]]s, including ''Apple Blossoms'' in 1919&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011813210 Catalog Record for the vocal score of Apple Blossoms]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sissy (operetta)|de|3=Sissy (Operette)|lt=Sissy}}'' in 1932, a [[string quartet]], and [[cadenza]]s, including ones for [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Brahms's D major violin concerto]], [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]]'s [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Paganini)|D major violin concerto]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|D major violin concerto]]. His cadenzas for the Beethoven concerto are the ones most often played by violinists today.

He wrote the music for the 1936 movie ''[[The King Steps Out]]'' directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]], based on the early years of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]].

Kreisler performed and recorded his own version of the first movement of Paganini's D major violin concerto. The movement is rescored and in some places reharmonised, and the orchestral introduction is completely rewritten in some places. The overall effect is of a late-nineteenth-century work.

[[File:The Mausoleum of Fritz Kreisler in Woodlawn Cemetery.JPG|thumb|The mausoleum of Fritz Kreisler in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]]]]
Kreisler owned several antique violins made by [[luthier]]s [[Antonio Stradivari]], [[Pietro Guarneri]], [[Giuseppe Guarneri]], and [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Carlo Bergonzi]], most of which eventually came to bear his name.
He also owned a [[Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume]] violin of 1860, which he often used as his second violin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maestronet.com/m_library/world_strings/fall80.pdf  Second Fiddle by Philip Kass]&lt;/ref&gt; and which he often loaned to the young prodigy [[Josef Hassid]]. In 1952 he donated his Giuseppe Guarneri to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. where it remains in use for performances given in the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200155594/|title=Violin by Giuseppe Guarneri, Cremona, ca. 1730, "Kreisler"|website=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On recordings, Kreisler's style resembles that of his younger contemporary [[Mischa Elman]], with a tendency toward expansive [[Tempo|tempi]], a continuous and varied [[vibrato]], expressive [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], and a melodic approach to passage-work. Kreisler makes considerable use of [[portamento]] and [[rubato]]{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. The two violinists' approaches are less similar in big works of the standard repertoire, such as [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Violin Concerto]], than in smaller pieces.

A trip to a Kreisler concert is recounted in [[Siegfried Sassoon]]'s 1928 [[autobiographical novel]] ''[[Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man]]''.

==Early life==
Mohrenschildt began life as '''Jerzy Sergius von Mohrenschildt''' in [[Mozyr]], in the [[Russian Empire]], now in [[Belarus]], born on April 4 in the [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|old style]] Russian [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref name=warren168&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 168, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0088b.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt; He had an older brother, Dimitri. His wealthy father, Sergey Alexandrovich von Mohrenschildt, was of German, Swedish, and Russian descent. Mohrenschildt's mother, Alexandra, was of Polish, Russian, and Hungarian descent.&lt;ref name=warren168/&gt; Sergey von Mohrenschildt was claimed by his son to have been a [[Marshal of Nobility (Russia)|Marshal of Nobility]] of the [[Minsk Governorate]]&lt;ref name="pk1917"&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ru:Памятная книжка Минской губернии на 1917 год|url=http://book-old.ru/BookLibrary/22001-Pam.-kn.-Minskoy-gub/1916.-Pamyatnaya-knizhka-Minskoy-gubernii-na-1917-god.html|author=Минский Губернский Статистический комитет|place=Минск|year=1916|language=ru|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028095659/http://book-old.ru/BookLibrary/22001-Pam.-kn.-Minskoy-gub/1916.-Pamyatnaya-knizhka-Minskoy-gubernii-na-1917-god.html|archivedate=2014-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his testimony to the [[Warren Commission]], Mohrenschildt claimed that his father had been a Marshal of Nobility of the [[Minsk Governorate]], but the directories of 1913-1917 listed him in the lower position of Marshal for a [[uezd]] (county). Beside this, he and his children never had the title of [[baron]] or [[count]]/[[graf]], whether in Russia or in any other country.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1913-1917, and a [[Table of Ranks|civil rank]] of Actual Civil Councilor corresponding to [[Major General]]. In 1920, some years after the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]], Sergey von Mohrenschildt was arrested by the [[Bolshevik]]s for anti-Communist activities.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 171, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0090a.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to exile for life in [[Veliky Ustyug]], a town in the north of Russia. Mohrenschildt later testified to the Warren Commission that while awaiting transport to Veliky Ustyug, his father had become ill. Two Jewish doctors who treated him in jail advised him to stop eating so he would appear more sickly. The doctors then told the Soviet government that Sergey was too ill to survive the trip to Veliky Ustyug and he should be allowed to stay at home to recover, under the condition that he check in weekly until he was well enough to be sent to Veliky Ustyug. The Soviet government agreed. After his release, Sergey, his wife and the young Mohrenschildt then fled to [[Poland]] in a hay wagon (Mohrenschildt's older brother Dimitri was awaiting execution, but was later released in a [[prisoner exchange]] in Poland).&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 172, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0090b.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson McMillian|first=Patricia|title=Marina and Lee: The Tormented Love and Fatal Obsession Behind Lee Harvey Oswald's Assassination of John F.

Alexandra died of the disease shortly after the family entered Poland.&lt;ref name=warren168/&gt;

After the death of his mother, Mohrenschildt and his father made their way to [[Vilnius|Wilno]], where the family had a six acre property. Mohrenschildt graduated from the Wilno [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in 1929 and later graduated from the Polish Cavalry Academy in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 175, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0092a.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to earn a Master's degree at the Institute of Higher Commercial Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi 2007 p. 655&lt;/ref&gt; Having completed a dissertation on the economic influence of the U.S. on Latin America, he received a doctor of science degree in international commerce from the [[University of Liège]] in [[Belgium]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, pp. 177-178, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0093b.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt;

George von Mohrenschildt migrated to the [[United States]] in May 1938, after which he changed the [[nobiliary particle]] in his name from the German "von" to the French "de".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Russ|authorlink=Russ Baker|title=Family of Secrets|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59691-557-2|page=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his arrival in the U. S., British intelligence reportedly told the U.S. government that they suspected he was working for German intelligence.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Documents indicate he was under [[FBI]] surveillance for much of the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Mohrenschildt was hired by the Shumaker company in [[New York City]], which also employed a man named Pierre Fraiss who had connections with French intelligence.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} According to Mohrenschildt, he and Fraiss, among their other duties, gathered information about people involved in "pro-German" activities, such as those bidding for U.S. oil leases on behalf of Germany before the U.S. became involved in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 183, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0096a.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt; Mohrenschildt testified that the purpose of their data-collection was to help the French out-bid the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 184, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0096b.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohrenschildt spent the summer of 1938 with his older brother Dimitri von Mohrenschildt on [[Long Island]], New York. Dimitri was a staunch anti-Communist&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 176, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0092b.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] and one of the founders of the [[CIA]]'s Radio Free Europe and Amcomlib (a.k.a., [[Radio Liberty]]) stations.&lt;ref&gt;Baker 2009 p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; His contacts included top officials of the CIA.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} (Dimitri died at the age of 100 in 2002.){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

While in New York, Mohrenschildt became acquainted with the Bouvier family, including the young [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Bouvier]], the future wife of [[John F. Kennedy]]. Jacqueline grew up calling Mohrenschildt "Uncle George" and would sit on his knee.&lt;ref&gt;Baker 2009 p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; He became a close friend of Jacqueline's aunt [[Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale|Edith Bouvier Beale]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 179, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0094a.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohrenschildt dabbled in the insurance business from 1939 to 1941, but failed to pass his broker's examination.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 180, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0094b.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, he became associated with Film Facts in New York, a production company owned by his cousin Baron Maydell, who was said to have pro-Nazi sympathies.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} (Mohrenschildt denied any Nazi sympathies of his own, claiming he helped raise money for the Polish resistance.){{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Mohrenschildt made a documentary film about resistance fighters in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, pp. 182-183, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0095b.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt; According to a memo by former CIA director [[Richard Helms]], Mohrenschildt "was alleged to be a Nazi espionage agent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/D%20Disk/deMohrenschildt%20George/Item%2062.pdf|title=Oswald friend labeled CIA informant in memo|date=July 27, 1978|work=[[Dallas Times Herald]]|pages=1, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, Mohrenschildt married an American teenager named Dorothy Pierson. They had a daughter, Alexandra (known as "Alexis") and divorced in early 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi 2007 p. 656&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Mohrenschildt received a [[master's degree]] in [[petroleum geology]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, pp. 190-191, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0099b.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dallas, Oswald and Haiti ==

After the end of [[World War II]], Mohrenschildt moved to Venezuela, where he worked for Pantepec Oil, a company owned by the family of [[William F. Buckley]].&lt;ref name="baker75"&gt;Baker 2009 p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he married Phyllis Washington, the daughter of a diplomat with the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].

One of his longtime friends, offshore oil engineer George Kitchel, told the FBI that Mohrenschildt counted among his good friends oil barons [[Clint Murchison, Sr.|Clint Murchison]], [[H.L. Hunt]], [[John W. Mecom, Sr.]], and [[Sid Richardson]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker 2009 p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Mohrenschildt also joined the right-wing Texas Crusade for Freedom, whose members included [[Earle Cabell]], [[Everette DeGolyer]], [[Harold Byrd]] and [[Edward Musgrove Dealey|Ted Dealey]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker 2009 pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Mohrenschildt went to Yugoslavia to conduct a geological field survey for the [[U.S. State Department]] sponsored [[International Cooperation Administration]]. While in Yugoslavia, he was accused by the authorities there of making drawings of military fortifications. After returning to the United States, Mohrenschildt was debriefed by the CIA, both in Washington and in Dallas.&lt;ref name="Summers154"&gt;{{cite book|last=Summers|first=Anthony|title=Not in Your Lifetime|year=1998|publisher=Marlowe &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=1-56924-739-0|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Harvey Oswald]] and his Russian-born wife [[Marina Oswald]] were introduced to Mohrenschildt in the summer of 1962 in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. Mohrenschildt testified to the Warren Commission in 1964 that he had met the Oswalds through George Bouhe. When he asked "Do you think it is safe for us to help Oswald", Bouhe said he had checked with the FBI. Mohrenschildt also stated that he believed he had discussed Oswald with Max Clark, whom he believed was connected with the FBI, and with J. Walton Moore, whom Mohrenschildt described as "a Government man — either FBI or Central Intelligence",&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 235, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0122a.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="library54"&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol12/html/HSCA_Vol12_0029b.htm George de Mohrenschildt], House Select Committee on Assassinations - Appendix to Hearings, Volume 12, 4, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and who had debriefed Mohrenschildt several times following his travels abroad, starting in 1957.&lt;ref name="library54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bugliosi1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bugliosi|first1=Vincent|last2=Haines|first2=Fred|title=Final Verdict: The True Account of the Murder of John F.

Walton Moore was an agent of the CIA's Domestic Contacts Division in Dallas.)&lt;ref name="library54"/&gt; Mohrenschildt asserted that shortly after meeting Oswald, he asked Moore and [[Fort Worth]] attorney Max E. Clark about Oswald to reassure himself that it was "safe" for the Mohrenschildts to assist Oswald. Mohrenschildt testified that one of the persons he talked to about Oswald told him that Oswald "seems to be OK," and that "he is a harmless lunatic." However, Mohrenschildt was not exactly sure who it was who told him this.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Commission Hearings, volume 9, p. 235-236, [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0122a.htm Testimony of George S. de Mohrenschildt].&lt;/ref&gt; (When interviewed in 1978 by the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]], J.

At the time, he also had a manuscript that Lee Harvey Oswald had given him to read and realized this document might also have been photocopied in the search. His primary concern was that the CIA was behind the break-in. According to Mohrenschildt, J. Walton Moore flatly denied that the CIA was involved in any way.&lt;ref name="Epstein 1992 p. 559"&gt;[[Edward Jay Epstein|Epstein, Edward Jay]].

In October 1962, Mohrenschildt told Oswald that he would have a better chance of finding work in Dallas, after Oswald informed Mohrenschildt that he had lost his job in nearby Fort Worth, Texas. Oswald was soon hired by the Dallas photographic firm of Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall. George de Mohrenschildt's wife and daughter would later say that it had been Mohrenschildt who secured the job at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall for Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;Summers 1998 p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 1963, Mohrenschildt and his wife, Jeanne, visited the Oswalds' apartment. As Oswald's wife, Marina was showing Jeanne around the apartment, they discovered Oswald's rifle leaning against the wall inside a closet. Jeanne told George that Oswald had a rifle, and George joked to Oswald, "Were you the one who took a pot-shot at General Walker?" (General [[Edwin Walker]] was a conservative activist whom George de Mohrenschildt said he "knew that Oswald disliked.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0129a.htm Testimony of George de Mohrenschildt], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 9, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; When later asked by the Warren Commission about Oswald's reaction to his question, George de Mohrenschildt said that Oswald "smiled at that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh9/html/WC_Vol9_0129a.htm Testimony of George de Mohrenschildt], Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 9, pp. 249-250.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Edward Jay Epstein, Mohrenschildt claimed to have been in touch with the CIA about Oswald's attempted assassination of General Walker. "I spoke to the CIA both before and afterwards. It was what ruined me." &lt;ref name="Epstein 1992 p. 559"/&gt;  The Warren Commission concluded that on April 10, 1963, Oswald had attempted to kill General Walker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html#walker |title=Warren Commission Report p. 184-195 |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol12/html/HSCA_Vol12_0030b.htm Mohrenschildt's Activities in Haiti], House Select Committee on Assassinations - Appendix to Hearings, Volume 12, pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 1963, Mohrenschildt moved to [[Haiti]]. He never saw Oswald again.

After Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Mohrenschildt testified before the [[Warren Commission]] in April 1964. According to Colonel [[L. Fletcher Prouty]], then chief Pentagon-to-CIA liaison officer, Mohrenschildt had several private lunches with former CIA Director and Warren Commission member Allen Dulles while testifying before the Warren Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard B.

''The Man who Knew Too Much'' (New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2003), p. 202. {{ISBN|978-0786712427}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1966, Mohrenschildt left Haiti and returned to Dallas. During 1967, [[New Orleans]] District Attorney [[Jim Garrison]] interviewed Jeanne and George de Mohrenschildt as part of Garrison's [[Trial of Clay Shaw|prosecution of Clay Shaw]]. Garrison said that both of the Mohrenschildts insisted that Oswald had been the scapegoat in the assassination of President Kennedy. Garrison concluded from his conversation with them that George de Mohrenschildt had been one of Oswald's unwitting "baby-sitters ... assigned to protect or otherwise see to the general welfare of Oswald."&lt;ref name="Garrison 1998 55–56"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrison|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Garrison|title=On The Trail of the Assassins|year=1998|publisher=Sheridan Square Press|isbn=0-941781-02-X|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life, and Letter to CIA Director ==
George and Jeanne de Mohrenschildt obtained a divorce in Dallas, Texas on April 3, 1973, after nearly fourteen years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com.

Texas, US: Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not reported in the local newspapers, and the couple continued to present themselves as husband and wife.
{{Efn | For example, from the death investigation report by Thomas Neighbors of the [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] Sheriff's Office:
{{quote|At 2315 hours, on 29 March 1977, this writer made contact with the victim's wife, MRS. JEANNE de MOHRENSCHILDT, in California ... and advised her of her husband's demise; a fact which she had already been made aware of by several newsmen who had telephoned her seeking a story. She stated that she has been married to the victim for the past twenty-one years and noted that over the past several years he has been acting in an "insane manner."}}}}

On September 17, 1976, the CIA requested that the FBI locate Mohrenschildt, because he had "attempted to get in touch with the CIA Director."&lt;ref&gt;CIA Message Reference Number 915341.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 1976, Mohrenschildt had written a letter to the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, [[George H. W. Bush]], asking for his assistance. He was acquainted with the Bush family; George H.W. Bush had roomed with Mohrenschildt's nephew, Edward G. Hooker, at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker 2009 pp. 67–68, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; The letter said:

{{quote|You will excuse this hand-written letter. Maybe you will be able to bring a solution to the hopeless situation I find myself in. My wife and I find ourselves surrounded by some vigilantes; our phone bugged; and we are being followed everywhere. Either FBI is involved in this or they do not want to accept my complaints. We are driven to insanity by the situation. I have been behaving like a damn fool ever since my daughter Nadya died from [cystic fibrosis] over three years ago. I tried to write, stupidly and unsuccessfully, about Lee H Oswald and must have angered a lot of people — I do not know. But to punish an elderly man like myself and my highly nervous and sick wife is really too much. Could you do something to remove the net around us? This will be my last request for help and I will not annoy you any more. Good luck in your important job. Thank you so much.&lt;ref&gt;CIA MFR Raymond M. Reardon SAG 9.20.76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2009) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George H. W. Bush responded:

{{quote|Let me say first that I know it must have been difficult for you to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter. I believe I can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic death a few years ago, and the current poor state of your wife's health. I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances. In your situation I can well imagine how the attentions you described in your letter affect both you and your wife. However, my staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years. The flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren Commission has long subsided. I can only speculate that you may have become "newsworthy" again in view of the renewed interest in the Kennedy assassination, and thus may be attracting the attention of people in the media. I hope this letter had been of some comfort to you, George, although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely.|George Bush, [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]]. [CIA Exec Reg. # 76,51571 9.28.76]{{Efn | [[George H. W. Bush]] recalled, "I first met De Mohrenschildt in the early 1940s. He was an uncle to my [[Phillips Academy|Andover]] [[roommate]]." (The relationship would technically be "step-uncle" as the roommate, Edward G. Hooker, was actually Dimitri von Mohrenschildt's stepson).}}}}

On November 9, 1976, Jeanne had Mohrenschildt committed to a mental institution in Texas for three months, and listed in a notarized affidavit four previous suicide attempts while he was in the Dallas area. In the affidavit she stated that Mohrenschildt suffered from depression, heard voices, saw visions, and believed that the [[CIA]] and the [[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish Mafia]] were persecuting him. He was released at the end of the year, however.

According to the Dutch journalist [[Willem Oltmans]], in 1967 a "serious and famous Dutch clairvoyant" named [[Gerard Croiset]] had a vision of a conspirator who had manipulated Oswald;&lt;ref name= "Gallery magazine, April 1977"&gt;''[[Gallery (magazine)|Gallery]]'', April 1977&lt;/ref&gt; his description led Oltmans to Mohrenschildt, and the two stayed in touch. In 1977, Oltmans went to Texas and brought Mohrenschildt to the Netherlands.&lt;ref name= "Gallery magazine, April 1977"/&gt; Oltmans claimed that he had rescued Mohrenschildt from a mental institution to bring him to the "famous" clairvoyant, Croiset. According to Oltmans, Croiset agreed that Mohrenschildt was the man he saw in his vision.

Oltmans says that after Mohrenschildt arrived in the Netherlands, he invited him out with some Russian friends. They went to [[Brussels]] and had plans to go to [[Liège]], a city in the French-speaking part of Belgium. Oltmans owned a house in the countryside not far from Liège. Upon returning to Brussels, Mohrenschildt went for a short walk from which he failed to return. He had earlier agreed to meet Oltmans and his friends for lunch. Oltmans waited for him but he did not come back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fonzi|first=Gaeton|title=The Last Investigation|year=1993|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56025-052-6|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On March 16, 1977, Mohrenschildt returned to the United States from his trip. His daughter talked with him at length and found him to be deeply disturbed about certain matters, reporting that he had expressed a desire to kill himself. On March 29, Mohrenschildt gave an interview to author [[Edward Jay Epstein]], during which he claimed that in 1962, Dallas [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative J. Walton Moore and one of Moore's associates had handed him the address of Lee Harvey Oswald in nearby Fort Worth and then suggested that Mohrenschildt might like to meet him. Some help from the U.S. Embassy in Haiti would be greatly appreciated by him, he suggested to Moore. "I would never have contacted Oswald in a million years if Moore had not sanctioned it," Mohrenschildt said. "Too much was at stake."&lt;ref name="Epstein 1992 p. 559"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Kroth|Kroth, Jerry]].

In the book ''[[Killing Kennedy]]'' (2012), television personality [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] claimed he had been knocking at George de Mohrenschild's front door when he heard a shotgun blast that marked the suicide.

== House Select Committee on Assassinations ==
On April 2, 1977, Willem Oltmans told the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] that Mohrenschildt had implicated himself in the conspiracy to kill President Kennedy. And Pat S. Russell, who was Mohrenschildt's attorney, said "I definitely feel there was a conspiracy and that definitely was the opinion of George."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lawyer Says Texan Told Him Oswald Had Aid in '63 Plot |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 3, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oltmans testified for three hours behind closed doors and told the committee that Mohrenschildt had told him he had discussed the assassination of Kennedy with Oswald from A to Z. "De Mohrenschildt told me that Oswald acted at his (De Mohrenschildt's) instructions and that he knew Oswald was going to kill Kennedy," Oltmans said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Journalist tells of JFK Plots |newspaper=The Ledger |location=Lakeland, Florida |date=April 4, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 1978, Joseph Dryer told the House Select Committee on Assassinations that he and Mohrenschildt were associated with a woman named Jacqueline Lancelot. Dryer's relationship with Lancelot included passing messages for her to people in the United States whom Dryer assumed were connected in some way to the CIA. Dryer said in the interview that Lancelot told him shortly after the Kennedy assassination that a "substantial" sum of money, $200,000 or $250,000, had been deposited in Mohrenschildt's account. Dryer said that Mohrenschildt had claimed he came to Haiti to scout for oil, but Dryer stated that "I could never figure out what he did." Dryer expressed the belief that Mohrenschildt had "some intelligence connection".&lt;ref name="aarclibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol12/pdf/HSCA_Vol12_deMohren.pdf |title=HSCA Volume XII: George de Mohrenschildt |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressional researcher Gaeton Fonzi noted that in late 1963 "several large deposits popped up in de Mohrenschildt's Haitian bank account including one for two hundred thousand dollars from a Bahamian bank. This occurred when de Mohrenschildt and Charles were 'supposedly' running a sisal plantation, a derelict operation they never went near."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fonzi|first=Gaeton|title=The Last Investigation|year=1993|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56025-052-6|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1976 CIA internal memo regarding Mohrenschildt, Director George H. W. Bush stated: "At one time he had/or spent plenty of money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Russ|authorlink=Russ Baker|title=Family of Secrets|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59691-557-2|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Another backyard photo==
[[File:Lho-133A.jpg|thumb|Image CE-133A, one of three known "backyard photos". This is the same image sent by Oswald (as a first generation copy) to his friend George de Mohrenschildt in April 1963, dated and signed by Oswald on the back of the photo. In the image, Oswald holds a Carcano rifle in one hand, with markings which have been matched to the Carcano rifle that was found in the book depository and used in the assassination. Furthermore he holds two Marxist newspapers in the other hand: [[The Daily Worker|The Worker]], which followed closely a [[Soviet Union|Moscow]] party line (and up to being pro-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] until the death of Stalin), and [[The Militant]], a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] newspaper which followed an anti-Stalinist and anti-Moscow line.]]

On April 1, 1977, Jeanne de Mohrenschildt gave the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0078b.htm a print] of a photograph showing [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] standing in his Dallas backyard holding two newspapers and a rifle, and with a pistol on his hip – a photograph taken by Oswald's wife [[Marina Oswald Porter|Marina]]. While similar to other prints which had been found among Oswald's effects on November 23, 1963, the existence of this particular print was previously unknown. On the back was written ''To my friend George from Lee Oswald'', and the date "5/IV/63" (5 April 1963).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0079a.htm back of that print] at aarclibrary.org. This date was confirmed by Mohrenschildt in his memoir, see [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol12/pdf/HSCA_Vol12_deMohren.pdf pp. 254-262].&lt;/ref&gt; along with the words "Copyright Geo de M"' and a Russian phrase translated as "'Hunter of fascists, ha-ha-ha!" Handwriting specialists later concluded that the words "To my friend George ..." and Oswald's signature were written by Lee Harvey Oswald, but could not determine whether the rest was the writing of Lee Oswald, Mohrenschildt, or Marina Oswald.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=795}}  Mohrenschildt assumed that Marina had written it sarcastically.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=795}}

Mohrenschildt wrote in his manuscript (reference and pages cited above) that he had missed Oswald's photograph in packing for the move to Haiti in May, 1963, and this was why he had not mentioned it to the Warren Commission (though he had noted in his manuscript that Oswald had a rifle in April 1963, and scoffed to Oswald that he had missed [[General Walker]], remembering that Oswald had blanched at the joke). According to Mohrenschildt, the photograph was not found among his stored papers until he and his wife found it in February 1967. When analyzed by the HSCA in 1977, this photo turned out to be a first generation print of the backyard photo already known to the Warren Commission as "CE-133A" and which had probably been taken on March 31, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/reportvols/vol6/html/HSCA_Vol6_0077b.htm CE-133A]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memoir==

Jeanne de Mohrenschildt also gave the [[HSCA]] committee a copy of a draft manuscript called ''I Am a Patsy! I Am a Patsy!'' which George de Mohrenschildt had completed in the summer of 1976 about his relationship with his "dear, dead friend" Oswald, wherein he said that the Oswald he knew was rarely ever violent and would not have been the sort of person to have killed John F. Kennedy. In part this judgment was based on Mohrenschildt's estimation of Oswald's political views and Kennedy's liberal ideas. Until 2014 the memoir had never been published as a stand-alone book, but the entire typescript was published as an appendix in the HSCA report.&lt;ref name="aarclibrary.org"/&gt;

The primary focus of Mohrenschildt's text is a series of recollections about the brief time period between September 1962 and April 1963 that he and Jeanne were acquainted with the Oswalds. A secondary focus consists of a number of meditations on the corrosive effects knowing the Oswalds had on the professional and personal lives of the Mohrenschildts.  "It must be acknowledged that our brief friendship with the Oswalds had strange and adverse effects on our lives."  Only in a tertiary sense is the manuscript concerned with Oswald's guilt or innocence and who the "real criminals" might be. Stating Oswald was a "patsy not involved in any revenge", and referencing articles describing "organized murder for profit", readers are challenged to make up their own minds. This memoir by Mohrenschildt was edited and annotated as ''Lee Harvey Oswald As I Knew Him'', by Michael A. Rinella. It was released in November 2014 by the University Press of Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/demlee.html|title=Lee Harvey Oswald as I Knew Him|publisher=kansaspress.ku.edu|accessdate=October 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101548/http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/demlee.html|archivedate=October 28, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depictions in the popular media ==

Mohrenschildt was played by [[Willem Oltmans]] in the 1991 film, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', and by [[Bill Bolender]] in the 1993 TV movie, ''[[Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald]]''. He is also mentioned at length in the [[Stephen King]] novel, ''[[11/22/63]]'', a [[time travel]] novel about the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], and appears in the 2016 television adaptation, ''[[11.22.63]]'', played by [[Jonny Coyne]]. His Haitian experience is depicted in Hans Christoph Buch's novel ''Haïti Chérie'' ([[Suhrkamp]], 1990).

Mohrenschildt was discussed at length in the [[TruTV]] series, ''[[Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura]]''. The episode claims that George de Mohrenschildt was in fact a CIA handler for Lee Harvey Oswald.

In 1997, Dutch filmmaker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] released the film ''Willem Oltmans, De Eenmotorige Mug'' (''Willem Oltmans, the single-engined mosquito''). In the film, journalist Willem Oltmans makes claims about his contacts with Mohrenschildt (and the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald, Marguerite Oswald) until George de Mohrenschildt's death in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papierentijger.org/index.php?page_id=17&amp;show=news&amp;news_id=118&amp;style_id=0 |title=Willem Oltmans - Memoires Introductie|publisher=Papierentijger.org |accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Godfrey T. McHugh''' (September 30, 1911 – July 5, 1997) was a [[United States Air Force]] general, and served as military aide to President [[John F. Kennedy]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
McHugh was born in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], to American parents. He received a baccalaureate in science and languages from the [[University of Paris]] in 1929.

He was oil production supervisor for the West Texas Production Company in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] from 1938 to 1942.

===Military posts===
After the U.S. entered [[World War II]], McHugh joined the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] as a captain on January 31, 1942 and received pilot training.  During the war, he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was stationed in the European Theater.  After the war, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] for his service during the war.

He served as assistant executive and senior aide to Air Force Chief of Staff General [[Hoyt S. Vandenberg]] from 1948 to 1953.

He dated [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Bouvier]] (who was later to marry John F. Kennedy and become [[First Lady of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=L2G4a6pLItIC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=Godfrey+McHugh+dated+Bouvier&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O027pKWaRl&amp;sig=c11h3bjKuc-eNbvRVOtN2NnnjtY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AQetTKHUNsHflgeH5sWYCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

McHugh attended the [[National War College]] from 1953 to 1954.

===Kennedy administration===
He became Air Force Aide to President Kennedy, and was promoted to Brigadier General in 1961.
As military aide to the President, his duties included supervising [[Air Force One]]. He very often rode in the middle of the front seat of the [[Presidential State Car (United States)|Presidential State Car]] while transporting the President. While he was in [[Dallas, Texas]] during the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]], McHugh was moved farther back in the motorcade that day rather than riding in the President's car. He was also present during the president's autopsy.

After Kennedy's death, McHugh guarded Kennedy's body on Air Force One and until the President's body was returned to Washington, D.C.

In a 1978 oral history interview that McHugh gave to the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library]] (that was withheld from the public until 2009), McHugh provided detailed statements that once Kennedy's body was back on board Air Force One he did not know that [[Lyndon Johnson]] was also on board. Due to safety concerns that there was a conspiracy, [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]'s repeated requests, and the fact that the plane's interior cabin was quite warm, McHugh had requested that the plane take off. When the plane still had not taken off, McHugh went forward to again ask pilot James Swindal why the plane had not taken off and he was told that Johnson did not want the plane to take off yet. McHugh went to find Johnson and he soon found Johnson in a bathroom with Johnson saying repeatedly, "They're going to get us all. It's a plot. It's a plot. It's going to get us all." According to the General, Johnson "was hysterical, sitting down on the john there alone in this thing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive1.jfklibrary.org/JFKOH/McHugh,%20Godfrey%20T/JFKOH-GTM-02/JFKOH-GTM-02-TR.pdf Oral History Interview with Godfrey T. McHugh] pp.46–47 JFK Library&lt;/ref&gt; In a documented interview the previous week in 1978 McHugh had also stated to the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] investigator Mark Flanagan the same basic account of what he witnessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =A New Wrinkle in the JFK Assassination Story | publisher =Huffington Post 10-30-09 | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-m-gillon/a-new-wrinkle-in-the-jfk_b_339026.html | accessdate =2011-10-25 | date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jordan Marsh incident====
In the summer of 1963, a pregnant [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] was at the Kennedy family compound in Massachusetts.  Air Force personnel became concerned that if Mrs. Kennedy were to deliver the child at the [[Otis Air Force Base]] hospital, that the maternity ward furniture would be inferior for the newborn of the President and First Lady.  The Air Force then spent $5,000.00 of taxpayer money at [[Jordan Marsh|Jordan Marsh &amp; Company]] to purchase new furniture, and allowed media photographs of a navy aide standing next to the purchase.  After the photos made their way into the ''[[Washington Post]]'', an irate President Kennedy telephoned McHugh and ordered him to have the furniture returned.  Kennedy's curse-laden phone call with McHugh is now public.&lt;ref&gt;Archive audio of JFK call to McHugh on Furniture for J. Kennedy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtLTmg2vCzY&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
McHugh married Lillian Triplett Fall in 1967. The couple retired to [[Palm Beach, Florida]] in 1986.

General McHugh died in Palm Beach in 1997 and is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81739452 Find a Grave] &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Pershing Balloon Derby''' is a [[hot air balloon festival]] held each [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]] weekend near [[Brookfield, Missouri]]. The three-day festival draws balloonists from the midwest and as far away as [[Florida]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref name="KSHB"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clegg|first=Mark|url=http://www.kshb.com/dpp/news/state/missouri/brookfield,-missouri-hosts-34th-annual-great-pershing-balloon-derby|title=Brookfield, Missouri hosts 34th Annual Great Pershing Balloon Derby|publisher=KSHB-TV via website|date=6 September 2010|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named in honor of General [[John J. Pershing]], leader of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] in [[World War I]] and a native of nearby [[Laclede, Missouri]]. The Great Pershing Balloon Derby (GPBD) has been recognized as the longest running continually sanctioned ballooning event in the U.S. by the Balloon Federation of America.&lt;ref name="Rural"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Jason|url=http://www.ruralmissouri.org/2010Pages/10AugBrookfieldBalloonDerby.html|title=Great Pershing Balloon Derby|publisher=Rural Missouri magazine|date=August 2012|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The derby was first held from September 30 to October 2, 1977 with forty balloons launching from [[Pershing State Park]] west of Brookfield.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pershingballoonderby.com/event-history.html|title=Event History|publisher=Pershng Balloon Derby Association|year=2012|accessdate=4 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204183906/http://www.pershingballoonderby.com/event-history.html|archivedate=4 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Originally sponsored and organized by the [[Missouri Department of Natural Resources]] and the Pershing Memorial Development Association, it was held as a fundraiser for the Pershing Museum. The second year, and every thereafter, the derby was held over Labor Day weekend. By its third year the number of balloons participating nearly doubled to seventy.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In years two through eight the Derby was also held at a variety of temporary locations in [[Linn County, Missouri|Linn County]].

The 7th annual Great Pershing Balloon Derby was nearly the last, as fundraising and sponsorship problems arose.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; However, in early 1984 a group of balloonists and concerned area citizens worked together to keep the event going and formed Green Hills Ballooning Inc. to take over the Derby. Beginning in the 9th year, the Derby had a permanent home as well on land provided by the Myron Peacher family.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The Missouri DNR returned as a co-sponsor as well, and by 1986 attendance reached a peak of 14,000 spectators. During this time period more activities were added to the weekend schedule such as a queen contest, dances for balloonists and spectators, and a craft festival. The 17th Great Pershng Balloon Derby was the first year of the Sunday "Night Light" was added to the schedule of events.

== The GPBD today ==
[[File:Balloon night glow 2001 09.jpg|left|thumb|A "night glow" launch from the 2001 Great Pershing Balloon Derby.]]
The derby itself is held now at the Myron Peacher Memorial Launch Site, an open field on State Road FF about two miles north of [[U.S. Highway 36]] between Brookfield and Laclede. In recent years the number of participating balloons has stabilized at around forty-five.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; One highlight is the "South Main Night Flame", held in downtown Brookfield.&lt;ref name="Rural"/&gt; Balloonists and their craft line the street for a night burn. In 2011 and 2012 he derby was selected as site for the BFA North Central Regional Championship.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; 
The balloon derby is held in conjunction with many other festivities in nearby Brookfield including [[beauty contest]]s, [[concert]]s, [[parade]]s, and a [[Fly-In|fly-in]] at North Central Missouri Regional Airport. Launches are generally at dusk and dawn on Saturday and Sunday and at dawn on Monday (Labor Day).  A [[night glow]] is usually held at sunset on Sunday evening.

[[File:A01 High Beam Indicator.svg|thumb|Typical [[dashboard]] icon indicating that high beams are illuminated]]
'''Headlight flashing''' is the act of either briefly switching on the [[Headlamp|headlights]] of a car, or of momentarily switching between a headlight's [[Headlamp#High beam|high beams]] and [[Headlamp#Low beam|low beams]], in an effort to communicate with another driver or drivers. The signal is sometimes referred to in car manufacturers' manuals as an '''optical horn''', since it draws the attention of other drivers.

The signal can be intended to convey a variety of messages, including a warning to other drivers of road hazards, telling a driver they can pass through or alerting a driver of [[speed trap]]s, and it can also be a form of [[aggressive driving]]. The legality of headlight flashing varies by jurisdiction.

==History==
Headlight flashing might have come into more common use as a means of attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s,&lt;ref name=Farlam_3&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.smartdriving.co.uk/Driving/DefensiveDriving/Flashing_Headlamps/Flashers3.html |title=Know the code?|last=Farlam |first=John|year=2008 |work=SmartDriving |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502150247/http://www.smartdriving.co.uk/Driving/DefensiveDriving/Flashing_Headlamps/Flashers3.html |archivedate=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located on the [[steering column]]—typically activated by pulling the [[Automotive lighting#Turn signals|turn signal stalk]]—rather than the previous foot-operated pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the [[Momentary switch|momentary activation]] of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off.

==Uses==
Headlight flashing attracts attention, and so can be considered the visual equivalent of blowing the horn.  Indeed, some car owner's manuals identify headlight control on the steering column as the "optical horn". Like the horn, it has many uses.

Headlight flashing can let other drivers know of one's presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sligoweekender.ie/news/story/?trs=cwcwmhqlkf|title=Flash properly! |date=5 April 2005|work=[[Sligo Weekender]]|publisher=[[Thomas Crosbie Holdings]]|accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Flashing can acknowledge the presence or actions of other drivers.

Flashing can be a signal that the flashing driver is yielding the [[Traffic#Priority .28right of way.29|right of way]], for example at an intersection controlled by stop signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/caradvice/2727369/Honest-Johns-agony-column.html|title=Honest John's agony column|last=John|first=Honest|date=23 March 2004|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flashing can warn other drivers of road dangers, such as crashed cars or police [[speed traps]].&lt;ref name="Kwa"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asiaone.com/print/Motoring/Motorworld/Others/Story/A1Story20071014-29964.html|title=Where blinking lights rule but signal lights are optional|last=Kwa|first=Tion|date=13 October 2007|work=[[The Straits Times]]|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flashing can be used to give thanks. For example, when one is warned of police activity, it is sometimes considered courteous to flash back.&lt;ref name=Rojas/&gt;

Flashing can inform drivers of problems with their car, such as headlamps left off after dark, burned out or misaligned lights, or misuse of high beam rather than low beam in traffic;&lt;ref name=TDC/&gt; or to berate a driver who poses a risk to traffic.&lt;ref name="Kwa"/&gt; Headlight flashing coupled with blowing the car's horn can help clear [[deer]] from a driver's path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MWSB&amp;p_theme=mwsb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB82A1D6F0DFEE3&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=State motorists are warned to watch out for deer|date=13 October 1996|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Journal Communications]]|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some drivers attempt to communicate "I will continue my current behavior!" when flashing their headlights. For example, if such a driver flashes his or her headlights while slowing down, they intend to communicate to another driver who is waiting to merge in traffic: "Go on, I will let you merge!" On the other hand, if such a driver keeps his or her current speed and flashes headlights, they intend to communicate "Stay back, I am not slowing down!"

Headlight flashing may also indicate protest or celebration of an event or political position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/21/world/venezuelan-police-seize-businessman-who-led-2-month-strike.html|title=Venezuelan Police Seize Businessman Who Led 2-Month Strike|date=21 February 2003|work=[[The New York Times]]|pages=A7|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=aKIy7kdx_CcU&amp;refer=us|title=Red Sox Erase Curse With First World Series Title Since 1918 |last=Matuszewski|first=Erik|date=28 October 2004|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flashed headlamps can have ambiguous or contradictory meanings, with no way for the observing driver to tell for sure what the flashing driver is trying to say. It may mean, for example, that the flashing driver intends to yield the [[Traffic#Priority (right of way)|right of way]], or instead that he intends to take it.&lt;ref name="New Scientist"/&gt; Misinterpretation of the flashing driver's intent can cause [[Traffic collision|crashes]].&lt;ref name="Farlam_5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartdriving.co.uk/Driving/DefensiveDriving/Flashing_Headlamps/Flashers4.html|title=Doing as you're Told?|last=Farlam|first=John|year=2008|work=SmartDriving|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504022546/http://www.smartdriving.co.uk/Driving/DefensiveDriving/Flashing_Headlamps/Flashers4.html|archivedate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Headlight flashing to warn drivers of [[traffic enforcement camera]]s is [[Road speed limit enforcement in Australia|illegal]] in the state of [[Queensland]], carrying a $30 fine and one [[Point system (driving)|demerit point]], or a $1500 fine if the fine is unsuccessfully challenged in court.&lt;ref name="Dibben"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,20797,24550425-952,00.html?from=communities|title=Drivers illegally flash lights to warn of speed cameras|last=Dibben|first=Kay|date=26 October 2008|work=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officers may either fine a driver for improper use of headlights, or may even arrest and prosecute for hindering police.&lt;ref name=Dibben/&gt;

In the state of [[New South Wales]], headlight flashing by regular drivers (that is, not a police officer, etc.) for any reason is illegal, except in emergency purposes and immediately before overtaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_reg/arr210/s218.html|title=Australian Road Rules - Reg 218(2)|access-date=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
Headlight flashing is common in Bangladesh, where roads are sometimes narrow and lane discipline is lax. It is done by large vehicles such as buses or trucks to alert smaller, more maneuverable vehicles to their presence and to encourage them to make way, for example by moving to the side of the road.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Canada===
In [[Ontario]], the [[Highway Traffic Act (Ontario)|Highway Traffic Act]] does not prohibit "flashing head beams".&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/opinion/story.html?id=4d2e1b6e-6c74-4700-8130-4438b90a4e12|title=To flash your lights|last=Ward|first=Bruce|date=13 February 2008|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|publisher=[[Canwest]]|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have brought tickets to court, claiming the law only regulates the use of alternating lights in an attempt to impersonate emergency and law enforcement vehicles, and not a driver's manually flashing his car's headlamps to communicate with other drivers.&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt; The section that deals with alternating headlights in [[Ontario]] is Section 169 of the [[Highway Traffic Act (Ontario)|Highway Traffic Act]].

===India===
Headlight flashing in India is often used as a signal that the driver flashing you is offering to let you go first. Such use is however strongly discouraged because it can lead to accidents where the driver flashing has not seen the approach of another road user. It is also used to indicate to an oncoming vehicle to either stop or give way in narrow lanes.

===Jamaica===
On some occasions, motorists who flashed their headlights to warn of police activity have unwittingly helped fugitives evade police. In 2008, one of Jamaica's most wanted men went around police checkpoints which had been set up on his most likely routes after a driver had flashed his headlights to warn of police ahead.&lt;ref name=JamaicaObserver&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20080208T000000-0500_132321_OBS_FLASHING_HEADLIGHTS_HELPING_CRIMINALS__SAY_POLICE.asp|title=Flashing headlights helping criminals, say police|date=8 February 2008|work=[[The Jamaica Observer]]|accessdate=28 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211084740/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20080208T000000-0500_132321_OBS_FLASHING_HEADLIGHTS_HELPING_CRIMINALS__SAY_POLICE.asp |archivedate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drivers were warned that flashing headlights may result in "unwittingly facilitating criminal activity".&lt;ref name=JamaicaObserver/&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, although the legality of headlight flashing varies from state to state, a federal court ruled that flashing headlights was a constitutionally protected form of speech, issuing an injunction prohibiting a police department from citing or prosecuting drivers who flash their lights to warn of radar and speed traps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu-mo.org/en/node/479 |title= Ellisville Permanently Stopped from Ticketing Drivers who Flash Headlights to Communicate|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 9, 2014|website= Aclu-mo.org|publisher=[[ACLU]] |access-date=February 3, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/constitutional-right-to-flash-your-head-lights-gains-momentum |title=Constitutional right to flash your head lights gains momentum |last=Bomboy |first=Scott |date=April 16, 2014 |website= |publisher= [[National Constitution Center]]|access-date=February 3, 2018 |quote="The citation was clearly given to punish the Defendant for that expression,” the judge said in the case.

Some states consider that drivers have a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to flash their headlights.  In other states, law enforcement officers give citations for headlight flashing under three types of laws: (1) laws prohibiting a person from obstructing a police investigation, (2) laws prohibiting a person from having flashing lights on their vehicle, and (3) laws prohibiting shining a vehicle’s high beams at oncoming traffic.  The specific language of each law varies by state along with courts’ holdings on whether their respective laws prohibit headlight flashing.  Additionally, although not legally binding, the state driver’s manual of some states suggests flashing high beams under specific scenarios (e.g.  if an oncoming vehicle is using its high beams, driver’s manuals suggest a motorist flash his or her high beams momentarily).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dmv.state.pa.us/pdotforms/pa_driversmanual/chapter_3.pdf |title=Pennsylvania Driver's Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/dot/highways/hwy-v/HIDrvManV2DriversManual.pdf |title=Hawaii Driver's Manual |accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Arizona]], flashing high beams or headlights is a violation of A.R.S. Section 28-942.1 (Failure to Dim Headlights). However, A.R.S. Section 28-942.2. states: If the driver of a vehicle follows another vehicle within two hundred feet to the rear, ''except when engaged in the act of overtaking and passing'', the driver shall use a distribution of light permissible under this article other than the uppermost distribution of light specified in section 28-941, paragraph 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/SuperiorCourt/LowerCourtAndAdminAppeals/docs/constIssues/4/investDet/LC2002-000241-512-11192002.pdf|title=State v.

In [[California]], headlight flashing is legal in some situations and illegal in others. It is legal for a driver to flash his headlights to indicate intention to pass on a road which does not allow passing on the right.

New York Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 375 [3] requires that headlamps "shall  be  operated  so  that dazzling light does not interfere with the driver of the approaching  vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/new-york/vehicle-and-traffic/VAT0375_375.html|title=New York Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 375|accessdate=23 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220191724/http://law.onecle.com/new-york/vehicle-and-traffic/VAT0375_375.html|archivedate=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]] held that flipping or flicking high beams at approaching vehicles is insufficient to cause the "dazzling lights" prohibited under New York Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 375 [3].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ny.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.%5CNY%5CPLS%5C1994%5C19940707_0049795.NY.htm/qx|title=People v.

In [[North Dakota]], when an oncoming vehicle is within 500 feet, high-beam flashing for any length of time (including momentary flashes) and for any purpose at night is illegal under N.D.C.C.

In [[Ohio]], courts have held that the act of flashing one's headlights so as to alert oncoming drivers of a radar trap does not constitute the offense of obstructing a police officer in the performance of his duties, where there was no proof that the warned vehicles were speeding prior to the warning.&lt;ref&gt;Akron v.

In [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], flashing high beams could be considered illegal, as section 46.37.230 of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) states that drivers may not use their high beams within {{convert|500|ft|m}} of oncoming traffic, or within {{convert|300|ft|m}} of traffic in front of them. However, at least in the case of oncoming traffic, other courts interpreting a statute similar to this one have held that momentary headlight flashing which does not adversely affect the vision of the oncoming driver is not prohibited. Under Washington's law, violating RCW 46.37.230 may result in a $124 traffic infraction.[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.37.230 ]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattle911/archives/152560.asp|title=Dim it!

==Urban legend==
Beginning in the early 1980s, a widespread rumor regarding flashing headlights was spread mainly through [[fax]], and later on the Internet. The rumor stated that various gangs across the United States carry out an [[initiation]] wherein the initiate drives around at night with his headlights off. Whichever driver flashes his headlamps in response to the unlit car becomes the target; to complete the initiation, the prospective gang member must hunt down and shoot, kill, assault, or rape the target.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/crime/gangs/lightsout.asp|title=Lights Out!|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|date=8 December 2008|work=[[Snopes]]|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was widely spread by many government organizations, including the [[New Mexico State Police]].&lt;ref name="TDC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=abQKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ck0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6833,1021371&amp;dq=flashing+headlights|title=Flashing headlights at unlit cars could get gunfire for an answer|last=[[Associated Press]]|date=8 November 1998|work=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]]|pages=10C|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rumor has been proven an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref name="Ballard"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.herald-mail.com/2006-05-12/news/25040705_1_e-mail-claims-e-mail-warning-gang-initiations|title=E-mail warning of danger from gang initiations said to be hoax|last=Ballard|first=Pepper|date=12 May 2006|work=[[The Herald-Mail]]|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story originated in [[Montana]] in the early 1980s, where it was rumored that the [[Hells Angels]] bike gang was initiating recruits in this way. By 1984, the story had spread to [[Eugene, Oregon]], where it had morphed into a story of Latino and black gangs targeting whites.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; In August 1993, the story once again appeared, this time spread through fax and [[email forwarding]]. Warning of a "blood initiation weekend" on 25 and 26 September, the rumor this time led some police departments to issue warnings after having received the fake ones.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; In February 1994, a resident of [[Massillon, Ohio]] revived the rumor by issuing flyers which claimed that killings would take place at [[Westfield Belden Village]]. After a night of sending faxes to local businesses, the person was arrested for inducing panic.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;

The rumor once again spread in October 1998, when a new fax, this time claiming to originate with a [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education]] (DARE) officer in Texas. The rumor spread further when officials in the [[San Diego]] government circulated the fax among city agencies; this version of the fax, though quickly dismissed within city government when it was found that the Sheriff's office had no real connection to it, now appeared to be a legitimate government-issued document.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; Also in the fall of 1998, the Sheriff's office of [[Nassau County, Florida]] sent a warning about such gang initiation to the county fire department, who subsequently spread the fax to all county agencies. Police dispatcher Ann Johnson had thought the message urgent enough to send, but had not bothered to check its legitimacy.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;

The rumor provided inspiration for the 1998 film ''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'',&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; and served as a plot device in [[Mark Billingham|Mark Billingham's]] 2008 novel ''In The Dark''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markbillingham.com/dark.html|title=In The Dark}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An incident inspired by this legend is the catalyst for the 2007 film ''[[Death Sentence (2007 film)|Death Sentence]]''.

==1990s==
Major shake-ups occur in the who's-who of US game publishing and distribution.  [[Wizards of the Coast]], which started the decade as a small West Coast publisher, buys veteran [[Avalon Hill]] later in the decade, only to be bought up in turn by industry juggernaut [[Hasbro]].  [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] and [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] both collapse.

The [[collectible card game]] (CCG) became a dominant business model, first by ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' then by several rivals.  By the mid-nineties, hundreds of CCGs competed for market share, and most of these products were culled for weak sales.  Collectible gaming also expanded from cards into dice, tiles, and miniatures.

''[[The Settlers of Catan]]'' breaks Eurogaming into the American market, becoming an overnight bestseller and gateway game.  Publishers such as [[Mayfair Games]] and [[Rio Grande Games]] begin meeting the new market demand with titles from Europe.

Online retailing begins to pose a challenge to "brick and mortar" game stores, though the full effects of e-commerce will not be felt until the following decade.

==2000s==
The internet continues to shake up the publishing and distribution of games.  Online retailing becomes a serious threat to "brick and mortar" retailers.  Desktop publishing proves to be a boon for hobby game designers, and the door is opened for many small publishers producing their own game designs.  [[Z-Man Games]] and [[Fantasy Flight Games]] become major players in the US hobby game industry.  Miniatures games dominate the collectible games market.

Each wheel had 26 paddles and was {{convert|31|ft|m}} in diameter.  Her maximum speed was about  {{convert|16|kn|km/h}}.  The ship was usually manned by a crew of 22, including Captain William H. Van Schaick and two pilots.

==Service history==
''General Slocum'' was named for [[American Civil War|Civil War]] General&lt;ref name=encnyc&gt;Jackson, Kenneth T. "General Slocum" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, p.499&lt;/ref&gt; and New York [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Henry Warner Slocum]]. She operated in the New York City area as an excursion steamer for the next 13 years under the same ownership.

''General Slocum'' experienced a series of mishaps following her launch in 1891. Four months after her launching, she ran aground off [[Rockaway Inlet|Rockaway]]. [[Tugboat]]s had to be used to pull her free.

[[File:Victims of the General Slocum (1904).jpg|thumb|right|287px|Victims of ''General Slocum'' washed ashore at [[North Brother Island, East River|North Brother Island]].]]

A number of incidents occurred during 1894. On July 29, while returning from Rockaway with about 4,700 passengers, ''General Slocum'' struck a [[shoal|sandbar]] with enough force that her [[electrical generator]] went out. The next month, ''General Slocum'' ran aground off [[Coney Island]] during a storm. During this grounding, the passengers had to be transferred to another ship. In September 1894, ''General Slocum'' collided with the tug ''R. T. Sayre'' in the [[East River]], with ''General Slocum'' sustaining substantial damage to her steering.

In July 1898, another collision occurred when ''General Slocum'' collided with ''Amelia'' near [[Battery Park]]. On August 17, 1901, while carrying what was described as 900 intoxicated [[anarchists]] from [[Paterson, New Jersey]], some of the passengers started a riot on board and tried to take control of the vessel. The crew fought back and kept control of the ship. The captain docked the ship at the police pier, and 17 men were taken into custody by the police.

In June 1902, ''General Slocum'' ran aground with 400 passengers aboard. With the vessel unable to be freed, the passengers had to camp out overnight while the ship remained stuck.

==1904 disaster==

''General Slocum'' worked as a passenger ship, taking people on excursions around New York City. On Wednesday, June 15, 1904, the ship had been chartered for $350 by [[German Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Mark|St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in the [[Little Germany, New York|Little Germany]] district of [[Manhattan]]. This was an annual rite for the group, which had made the trip for 17 consecutive years, a period when German settlers moved out of Little Germany for the Upper East and West Sides. Over 1,400&lt;ref group=notes name="plaque" /&gt; passengers, mostly women and children, boarded ''General Slocum'', which was to sail up the East River and then eastward across the [[Long Island Sound]] to Locust Grove, a picnic site in [[Eatons Neck]], [[Long Island]].

The ship got underway at 9:30&amp;nbsp;am. As it was passing East 90th Street, a fire started in the Lamp Room&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Donnell | first = Edward | title = "Ship Ablaze: The Tragedy of the Steamboat "General Slocum" | location = New York | publisher = Broadway Books | year = 2003 | pages = 97–98 |isbn = 0-7679-0905-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the forward section, possibly caused by a discarded cigarette or match. It was fueled by the straw, oily rags, and lamp oil strewn around the room.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, pp.98–102.&lt;/ref&gt; The first notice of a fire was at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am; eyewitnesses claimed the initial blaze began in various locations, including a paint locker filled with flammable liquids and a cabin filled with gasoline. Captain Van Schaick was not notified until 10 minutes after the fire was discovered. A 12-year-old boy had tried to warn him earlier, but was not believed.

[[File:Recovery of victims from the General Slocum.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Carrying away a body from North Brother Island.]]

Although the captain was ultimately responsible for the safety of passengers, the owners had made no effort to maintain or replace the ship's safety equipment. The fire hoses had been allowed to rot, and fell apart when the crew tried to put out the fire. The crew had never practiced a fire drill, and the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] were tied up and inaccessible. (Some claim they were wired and painted in place.)&lt;ref name="O'Donnell, pp. 108-113"&gt;O'Donnell, pp. 108–113.&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors reported that the [[Lifebuoy|life preservers]] were useless and fell apart in their hands. Desperate mothers placed [[life jackets]] on their children and tossed them into the water, only to watch in horror as their children sank instead of floating.  Most of those on board were women and children who, like most Americans of the time, could not swim; victims found that their heavy wool clothing absorbed water and weighed them down in the river.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell, pp. 108-113"/&gt;

It has been suggested that the manager of the [[Personal flotation device|life preserver]] manufacturer placed iron bars inside the [[Cork (material)|cork]] preservers to meet minimum weight requirements at the time. Many of the life preservers had been filled with cheap and less effective granulated cork and brought up to proper weight by the inclusion of the iron weights. Canvas covers, rotted with age, split and scattered the powdered cork. Managers of the company (Nonpareil Cork Works) were indicted but not convicted. The life preservers had been manufactured in 1891 and had hung above the deck, unprotected from the elements, for 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Van Schaick decided to continue his course rather than run the ship aground or stop at a nearby landing.  By going into headwinds and failing to immediately ground the ship, he fanned the fire. Van Schaick later argued he was trying to avoid having the fire spread to riverside buildings and oil tanks. Flammable paint also helped the fire spread out of control.

Some passengers jumped into the river to escape the fire, but the heavy women's clothing of the day made swimming almost impossible and dragged them underwater to drown. Many died when the floors of the overloaded boat collapsed; others were battered by the still-turning paddles as they tried to escape into the water or over the sides.&lt;ref name=gentile&gt;Gentile, "Shipwrecks of New Jersey", 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time ''General Slocum'' sank in shallow water at [[North Brother Island, East River|North Brother Island]], just off the [[Bronx]] shore, an estimated 1,021 people had either burned to death or drowned. There were 321 survivors. Five of the 40 crew members died.

[[File:Community Synagogue St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church, built in 1857 for the German immigrant community of Little Germany, was converted to a synagogue in 1940 due to demographic changes in the neighborhood.]]

The 1904 Coast Guard Report estimated the following figures for casualties of a total of 1,388 persons in the disaster:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uscg.mil/history/docs/marinesafety/1904_General-Slocum-DeptCommerce.pdf |format= pdf |date= 1904 |publisher= US Coast Guard |title= General Slocum |work= Report |page= 30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The captain lost sight in one eye owing to the fire. Reports indicate that Captain Van Schaick deserted ''General Slocum'' as soon as it settled, jumping into a nearby [[tug]], along with several crew. Some say his jacket was hardly rumpled, but other reports stated that he was seriously injured. He was hospitalized at [[Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center|Lebanon Hospital]].

Many acts of heroism were committed by the passengers, witnesses, and emergency personnel. Staff and patients from the hospital on North Brother Island participated in the rescue efforts, forming human chains and pulling victims from the water.

===Aftermath===
Eight people were indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] after the disaster: the captain; two inspectors; and the president, secretary, treasurer, and commodore of the Knickerbocker Steamship Company. Only Captain Van Schaick was convicted. He was found guilty on one of three charges: [[criminal negligence]], for failing to maintain proper [[fire drill]]s and [[fire extinguisher]]s.  The jury could not reach a verdict on the other two counts of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.  He spent three years and six months at [[Sing Sing Correctional Facility|Sing Sing]] prison before he was paroled.  President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] declined to pardon Captain Van Schaick. He was not released until the federal parole board under the [[William Howard Taft]] administration voted to free him on August 26, 1911.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;Robinson, Eric. [[New-York Historical Society]] Library&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[presidential pardon#United States|pardoned]] by President Taft on December 19, 1912; the pardon became effective on Christmas Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|| date=December 20, 1912| title = Van Schaick Pardoned.

The Knickerbocker Steamship Company, which owned the ship, paid a relatively small fine despite evidence that they might have falsified inspection records. The disaster motivated federal and state regulation to improve the [[Boat safety#Safety|emergency equipment]] on passenger ships.

The neighborhood of Little Germany, which had been in decline for some time before the disaster as residents moved uptown,&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, pp. 26–34&lt;/ref&gt; almost disappeared afterward. With the trauma and arguments that followed the tragedy and the loss of many prominent settlers, most of the Lutheran Germans remaining in the Lower East Side eventually moved uptown. The church whose congregation chartered the ship for the fateful voyage was converted to a synagogue in 1940 after the area was settled by Jewish residents.

The victims were interred in cemeteries around New York, with 58 identified victims buried in the [[Cemetery of the Evergreens]] in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theevergreenscemetery.com/stories/shirtwaist-fire/the-general-slocum-disaster The General Slocum Disaster « The Evergreens Cemetery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many victims were buried at Lutheran Cemetery in [[Middle Village, Queens]] (now [[Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery]]) where an annual memorial ceremony is held at the historical marker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=7177 Slocum Disaster] International Historic Marker Database&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, a marble memorial fountain was erected in the north central part of [[Tompkins Square Park]] on Manhattan by the Sympathy Society of German Ladies, with the inscription: "They are Earth's purest children, young and fair."&lt;ref name=NY-Library&gt;{{cite web|last=Wingfield|first=Valerie|title=The General Slocum Disaster of June 15, 1904|url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/06/13/great-slocum-disaster-june-15-1904|work=NYC Neighborhoods :  Manuscripts and Archives Division|publisher=The New York Public Library|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=June 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sunken remains of ''General Slocum'' were salvaged and converted into a [[barge]] named '''''Maryland''''', which sank without loss of life in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the southeast coast of [[New Jersey]] near [[Strathmere, New Jersey|Strathmere]] and [[Sea Isle City, New Jersey|Sea Isle City]] during a storm on December 4, 1911, while carrying a cargo of [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, ''Shipwrecks of the Mid-Atlantic: Maryland, Delaware &amp; Southern New Jersey'' (poster), Sealake Products USA, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://njscuba.net/sites/site_genl_slocum.php New Jersey Scuba Diving: General Slcoum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survivors===
On January 26, 2004, the last surviving passenger from ''General Slocum'', [[Adella Wotherspoon]] (née Liebenow), died at the age of 100. At the time of the disaster, she was a six-month-old infant. Wotherspoon was the youngest survivor of the tragedy that took the lives of her two older sisters. When she was one year old, she unveiled the Steamboat Fire Mass Memorial on June 15, 1905, at [[Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery]], in [[Middle Village, Queens]].&lt;ref name="Unveiling"&gt;

{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}
'''Prime Minister's Questions''' (often abbreviated to '''PMQs''' and officially known as '''Questions to the Prime Minister''') is a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] in the [[United Kingdom]], currently held as a single session every Wednesday at noon when the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is sitting, during which the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] spends around half an hour answering questions from [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs).&lt;ref name="PMQ"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/a-z_of_parliament/p-q/82556.stm | title=Prime Minister's Questions|date=24 January 2006| work =[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Although prime ministers have answered questions in parliament for centuries, until the 1880s questions to the prime minister were treated the same as questions to other [[Ministers of the Crown]]: asked without notice, on days when ministers were available in whatever order MPs rose to ask them.&lt;ref name="Bercow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2010/07/speaker-delivers-speech-on-prime-ministers-questions/speech-new-parliament-new-opportunity/ |title=Speech: New Parliament, New Opportunity |last=Bercow |first=John |authorlink=John Bercow |date= 6 July 2010 |work=[[House of Commons Library]] |publisher=parliament.uk  |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 fixed time-limits for questions were introduced and questions to the prime minister were moved to the last slot of the day as a courtesy to the 72-year-old prime minister at the time, [[William Gladstone]], so he could come to the Commons later in the day. In 1953, when [[Winston Churchill]] was prime minister, it was agreed that questions would be submitted on fixed days (Tuesdays and Thursdays).&lt;ref name="Bercow"/&gt;

A [[Procedure Committee]] report in 1959 recommended that questions to the prime minister be taken in two fixed-period, 15-minute slots on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. The recommendations were put into practice under [[Harold Macmillan]] during a successful experiment from 18 July 1961 to the end of the session (4 August).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/jul/18/questions-to-the-prime-minister |house=House of Commons |date=18 July 1961 |column_start=1052 |column_end=1052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first question was delivered by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Fenner Brockway]], asking to which Minister the [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to South Africa#Ambassadors|UK Ambassador]] to [[South Africa]] would be responsible.&lt;ref name="Hansard 1961"&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Ambassador to South Africa |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/jul/18/ambassador-to-south-africa |house=House of Commons |date=18 July 1961 |column_start=1052 |column_end=1053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the Prime Minister's answer, Brockway said "May I express our appreciation of this new arrangement for answering Questions and the hope that it will be convenient for the Prime Minister as well as useful to the House?"&lt;ref name="Hansard 1961" /&gt; PMQs were made permanent in the following parliamentary session, with the first of these on 24 October 1961.&lt;ref name="Bercow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/oct/24/questions-to-the-prime-minister |house=House of Commons |date=24 October 1961 |column_start=740 |column_end=747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://number10.gov.uk/page1232 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080909000758/number10.gov.uk/page1232 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 September 2008 |title=What are Prime Minister's Questions? |date=21 January 2004 |publisher=number10.gov.uk |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style and culture of PMQs has changed gradually over time. According to [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] [[Selwyn Lloyd]], the now famous disorderly behaviour of MPs during PMQs first arose as a result of the personal animosity between [[Harold Wilson]] and [[Edward Heath]]; before this PMQs had been lively but comparatively civilised.&lt;ref name="Bercow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mr. Speaker, sir |last=Lloyd |first=Selwyn |authorlink=Selwyn Lloyd |coauthors= |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-224-01318-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, prime ministers often opted to transfer questions to the relevant minister, and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leaders of the Opposition]] did not always take their allocated number of questions in some sessions, sometimes opting not to ask any questions at all. This changed during the [[premiership of Margaret Thatcher]], when the prime minister chose not to transfer any questions to other members of her [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]] began asking more questions than his predecessors. His successor, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], established the precedent of always taking his full allocation of questions.&lt;ref name="Bercow"/&gt;
[[File:Prime Minister's Questions (Full Chamber).jpg|thumb|The chamber is much busier than at most other times.]]

One of [[Tony Blair]]'s first acts as prime minister was to replace the two 15-minute sessions with a single 30-minute session on Wednesdays, initially at 3 p.m. but since 2003 at noon.&lt;ref name="Bercow"/&gt; The allocated number of questions in each session for the Leader of the Opposition was doubled from three to six, and the leader of the third-largest party in the Commons was given two questions. The first PMQs to use this new format took place on 21 May 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo970521/debtext/70521-18.htm |house=House of Commons |date=21 May 1997 |column_start=702 |column_end=712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]-[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] from 2010–2015, the [[List of leaders of the Liberal Democrats|leader of the Liberal Democrats]], as a member of the government, did not ask questions during PMQs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4115878.stm |title=What is Prime minister's questions?|date=2 June 2010 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the leader of the second largest parliamentary opposition party at the time, [[Nigel Dodds]] of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP), usually asked a single question later in the session followed by at least one MP from another smaller party such as the [[Scottish National Party]] or [[Plaid Cymru]].

== Practice ==
[[File:British House of Commons Order Paper (24 June 2009).JPG|thumb|right|The [[Order Paper]] for Wednesday, 24 June 2009.]]
[[File:Opening of Prime Minister's Questions 2013-02-13.ogg|thumb|"Number One, Mr Speaker": The standard opening of Prime Minister's Questions, from 13 February 2013.]]

[[Backbencher|Backbench]] MPs wishing to ask a question must enter their names on the [[Order Paper]]. The names of entrants are then shuffled in a ballot to produce a random order in which they will be called by the Speaker. The Speaker will then call on MPs to put their questions, usually in an alternating fashion: one MP from the government benches is followed by one from the opposition benches. MPs who are not selected may be chosen to ask a supplementary question if they "catch the eye" of the Speaker, which is done by standing and sitting immediately before the prime minister gives an answer.

The [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] usually asks six questions at PMQs, either as a whole block or in two separate groups of three. If the first question is asked by a government backbencher, the Leader of the Opposition is the second MP to ask questions. If the first question is asked by an opposition MP, this will be followed by a question from a government MP and then by the questions from the Leader of the Opposition. The leader of the third largest parliamentary party (the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] until 1988, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] from 1988–2010 and the [[Scottish National Party]] from 2015) would then ask two questions.

The first formal question on the Order Paper, posed by simply saying "Number one, Mr. Speaker", is usually to ask the Prime Minister "if s/he will list his/her engagements for the day". The Prime Minister usually replies:{{bquote|This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others. In addition to my duties in the House, I shall have further such meetings later today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm198889/cmhansrd/1989-11-14/Orals-3.html  | house=House of Commons | date=1989-11-14 | column_start=178 | column_end=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199091/cmhansrd/1990-12-18/Orals-2.html | house=House of Commons | date=1990-12-18 | column_start=150 | column_end=151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo971119/debtext/71119-20.htm#71119-20_sbhd4 | house=House of Commons | date=1997-11-19 | column_start=318 | column_end=319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/debtext/71010-0002.htm#07101031000010 | house=House of Commons | date=2007-10-10 | column_start=286 | column_end=287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100630/debtext/100630-0002.htm#10063036000007 | house=House of Commons | date=2010-06-30 | column_start=852 | column_end=853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Questions to the Prime Minister | jurisdiction=United Kingdom | url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-10-12/debates/B2183E5C-B667-4130-8499-CDB2E7D60B7B/Engagements#contribution-E2111243-FC22-4338-8AF9-807CEFAE31A0 | house=House of Commons | date=2016-10-12 | column_start=293| column_end=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The reason for such a question is that, historically, the Prime Minister may be questioned only as to those matters for which he or she is directly responsible.  Such matters are relatively few in number, because many substantive matters are handled by the other Ministers in the Cabinet.  By requiring the Prime Minister to list his or her engagements, the members may then inquire whether the Prime Minister ought to be engaged in some other activity or be taking some other action.&lt;ref&gt;Biffen, John (1989) ''Inside the House of Commons: Behind the Scenes at Westminster''. London: Grafton. {{isbn|0246134798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before listing the day's engagements, the Prime Minister sometimes extends condolences or offers congratulations after significant events. During the [[Iraq War]], [[Tony Blair]] introduced the practice of naming any British military personnel who had been killed in service since the last time he addressed the House. This practice was continued by Blair's successors as prime minister. After this, the MP may ask a supplementary question about any subject which might occupy the Prime Minister's time. Most MPs [[Table (parliamentary procedure)#Example of Anglo.E2.80.90American confusion|table]] the same engagements question and so after it has been asked for the first time, any other MPs who have tabled the same question are simply called to ask an untabled question, meaning that the Prime Minister will not know what questions will be asked.&lt;ref name="Question Time"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/business/questions/ |title=Question Time |last= |first= |authorlink=|date= |work=[[House of Commons Library]] |publisher=parliament.uk  |accessdate=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the first question tabled is on a specific area of policy, not the engagements question. This, though, is quite rare as it would allow the Prime Minister to prepare a response in advance; the non-descript question allows some chance of catching him or her out with an unexpected supplementary question.&lt;ref name="Question Time"/&gt;

At times of national or personal tragedy or crisis, PMQs have been temporarily suspended. The last such suspension occurred on 25 February 2009 when the Speaker, at the request of Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], suspended the Commons until 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. as a mark of respect following the unexpected death of Opposition leader [[David Cameron]]'s son. Prime Minister's Questions was also suspended after the sudden death of the leader of the Labour Party, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Andrew Grice |title=Politics put on hold as House mourns death of leader's son |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/politics-put-on-hold-as-house-mourns-death-of-leaders-son-1632389.html |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=independent.co.uk |date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMQs has been filmed since 1989, and have been broadcast live since 1990.&lt;ref name="BBCamera"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27402902|title=Camera crews allowed into Prime Minister's Questions|date=14 May 2014|accessdate=8 November 2014|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|deadurl=no|archivedate=8 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108182332/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27402902}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are broadcast live in the United Kingdom on the [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC Parliament]] TV channels. It is also broadcast outside the United Kingdom, most notably on the US cable network [[C-SPAN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c-span.org/series/?PrimeMinisterQue |title=British House of Commons Prime Minister's Questions |author= |date= |work=[[C-SPAN]] |publisher= |accessdate=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been spoofed on the American late-night television sketch comedy ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snl.jt.org/skit.php-i=147.html |title=Prime Minister's Questions |author= |date= |work=The SNL Archives |publisher= |accessdate=25 July 2010 |postscript=&lt;!--nothing--&gt;}}, describing episodes of 22 March 1997 and 2 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In a C-SPAN interview in 1991, shortly after the network started to broadcast PMQs, US President [[George H. W. Bush]] said, "I count my blessings for the fact I don't have to go into that pit that [[John Major]] stands in, nose-to-nose with the opposition, all yelling at each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR7EUbnvNqY |title=George H. W. Bush on PMQs |work=[[w:C-SPAN|C-SPAN]]| publisher=[[w:YouTube|YouTube]]|date=20 December 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deputy Prime Minister's Questions=== 
If the Prime Minister is away on official business when PMQs is scheduled, their role is usually filled by the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="12 March"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime Minister's Questions: 12 March 2014|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2014/march/prime-ministers-questions-12-march-2014/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this office is not occupied or the Deputy Prime Minister is not available, the next most senior member of [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]] will receive questions (such as the [[First Secretary of State]] or the Deputy Leader of the government party).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williamson|first1=David|title=In a PMQs without the PM, William Hague and Harriet Harman join forces to love-bomb the Scots|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/pmqs-without-pm-william-hague-7749254|publisher=Wales Online|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of the Leader of the Opposition, the opposition questions will be led by the deputy leader of the opposition.&lt;ref name="12 March" /&gt;

In [[Cameron–Clegg coalition]], [[Nick Clegg]] has answered 15 PMQs and [[William Hague]] twice{{efn|20 June 2012 and 10 September 2014}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sxprs/episodes/guide?page=1|website=BBC|title=Deputy Prime Minister's Questions|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Second Cameron ministry]], [[George Osborne]] has answered 3 times.{{efn|17 June 2015, 9 December 2015 and 25 May 2016}}&lt;ref name="YouTube UK Parliament"&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/UKParliament/videos|title=UK Parliament|website=YouTube|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[second May ministry]], [[Damian Green]] has replied twice{{efn|12 July 2017 and 29 November 2017}} and three times for [[David Lidington]]{{efn|7 December 2016, 31 January 2018 and 11 July 2018}}.&lt;ref name="YouTube UK Parliament"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerns over noise levels ===
On 17 April 2014, Speaker Bercow told the [[BBC]] that the "histrionics and cacophony of noise" in PMQs were so bad that a number of female MPs had told him they would stop attending.  Bercow described it as being a "real problem" and that "A number of seasoned parliamentarians, who are not shrinking violets, not delicate creatures at all, are saying, 'This is so bad that I am not going to take part, I am not going to come along, I feel embarrassed by it.'"&lt;ref name=BBC-Bercow-female-MPs&gt;{{cite news|title=Female MPs shunning PMQs, says John Bercow|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27062577|accessdate=17 April 2014|date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since becoming Leader of the Opposition, [[Jeremy Corbyn]] has attempted to reform PMQs by using questions submitted by members of the public and attempting to reduce the theatrical element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34264683|title=Jeremy Corbyn asks David Cameron 'questions from public'|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=16 September 2015|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Guardian staff|authorlink1=The Guardian|title=The Guardian view on Jeremy Corbyn’s PMQs debut: a very reasonable start|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/16/the-guardian-view-on-jeremy-corbyns-pmqs-debut-a-very-reasonable-start|accessdate=16 September 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[YouGov]] polling of viewers in February 2017 suggested that Corbyn had failed in his attempts at reform, with 77% of respondents agreeing that it consists of 'too much point scoring'.&lt;ref name="Corbyn Fails To Change PMQ Culture"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardman|first1=Isabel|title=How Corbyn failed to transform PMQs {{!}} Coffee House|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/03/just-answer-question-public-thinks-pmqs/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=16 March 2017|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMQs Theatrics Worse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deacon|first1=Michael|title=PMQs is growing worse by the week.

== Leaders at the dispatch box since 1961 ==
The most high-profile contributors at Prime Minister's questions are the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, who speak opposite each other at the [[despatch box|dispatch box]]. Regular, fixed sessions have taken place since 1961, and the list below outlines the prime ministers since 1961 and Opposition party leaders they faced across the floor of the House of Commons, as well as the secondary opposition leader since 1997 (usually the leader of third largest party within the House of Commons):

'''''R v Dudley and Stephens''''' (1884) 14 QBD 273 DC is a leading English [[criminal law|criminal]] case which established a [[precedent]] throughout the [[common law]] world that [[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]] is not a defence to a charge of [[murder]]. It concerned survival [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]] following a [[shipwreck]] and its purported justification on the basis of a [[Custom of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Andrew: ''Is Eating People Wrong?: Great Legal Cases and How they Shaped the World''. Cambridge University Press, New York, 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-107-00037-7}} pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the culmination of a long history of attempts by the law, in the face of [[public opinion]] sympathetic to [[castaway]]s, to outlaw the custom and it became something of a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain.

Dudley and Stephens were shipwrecked along with two other men. When one of them, the cabin boy Richard Parker, fell into a coma, Dudley and Stephens decided to kill him for food. After a highly publicized trial they were convicted of murder and sentenced to death with a recommendation for clemency; the sentence was commuted to six months in prison.

==Facts==
The English [[yacht]] ''Mignonette'' was a 19.43 [[tonnage|net tonnage]], {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=on}} cruiser built in 1867.&lt;ref name="Simpson 1984 p.18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[inshore]] boat, not made for long voyages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Ultimate Taboo|url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/16/reviews/000416.16rawsont.html|date = April 16, 2000|website = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, she was purchased as a leisure vessel by Australian lawyer [[John Henry Want]].&lt;ref name="Simpson 1984 p.18"/&gt; The yacht could only reasonably be transported to Australia by sailing, but she was a small vessel and the prospect of a 15,000-mile (24,000-km) voyage hampered Want's initial attempts to find a suitable crew. She finally set sail for [[Sydney]] from [[Southampton]] on 19 May 1884 with a crew of four: Tom Dudley, the captain; Edwin Stephens; Edmund Brooks; and Richard Parker, the cabin boy. Parker was 17 years old, orphaned, and an inexperienced seaman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=37–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July, the yacht was running before a [[gale]], around {{convert|1600|mi|km}} northwest of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Though the weather was by no means extreme and the vessel was not in any difficulties, Dudley gave the order to [[Heaving to|heave to]] so that the crew could enjoy a good night's sleep. As the manoeuvre was completed, and Parker was sent below to prepare tea, a wave struck the yacht and washed away the lee [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bulwark]].

Dudley instantly realized that the yacht was doomed and ordered the single {{convert|13|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] to be lowered. The lifeboat was of flimsy construction, with boards only {{convert|0.25|in|mm|0}} thick and was holed in the haste to get it away. ''Mignonette'' sank within five minutes of being struck and the crew abandoned ship for the lifeboat, managing only to salvage vital navigational instruments along with two tins of [[turnips]] and no fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=46–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been various theories about the [[naval architecture|structural]] inadequacies of the yacht that led to such a catastrophic failure in routine weather.&lt;ref name="S1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=50–53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dudley managed to improvise a [[sea anchor]] to keep the lifeboat headed into the waves and maintain her stability. Over the first night, the crew had to fight off a shark with their oars. They were around {{convert|700|mi|km}} from the nearest land, being either [[St Helena]] or [[Tristan da Cunha]].&lt;ref name="S1"/&gt; Dudley kept the first tin of turnips until 7 July when its five pieces were shared among the men to last two days. On or around 9 July, Brooks spotted a turtle which Stephens dragged on board. The crew were resolutely avoiding [[Seawater#Human consumption|drinking seawater]] as it was then universally held to be fatal and, though they devoured the turtle, they forewent drinking its blood when it became contaminated with seawater. The turtle yielded about three pounds (1.4&amp;nbsp;kg) of meat each, though the crew ate even the bones, and, along with the second tin of turnips lasted until 15 or 17 July. The crew consistently failed to catch any rainwater and by 13 July, with no other source of fluid, they began to [[Urophagia|drink their own urine]]. It was probably on 20 July that Parker became ill through drinking seawater. Stephens was also unwell, possibly having experimented with seawater.&lt;ref name="Simpson 1984 pp57-60"&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=57–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mignonette lifeboat.jpg|thumb|Photograph of the lifeboat exhibited at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in 1884.]]
[[Sortition|Drawing lots]] in order to choose a sacrificial victim who would die to feed the others was possibly first discussed on 16 or 17 July, and debate seems to have intensified on 21 July but without resolution. On 23 or 24 July, with Parker probably in a coma, Dudley told the others that it was better that one of them die so that the others survive and that they should draw lots. Brooks refused. That night, Dudley again raised the matter with Stephens pointing out that Parker was probably dying and that he and Stephens had wives and families. They agreed to leave the matter until the morning.

The following day, with no prospect of rescue in sight, Dudley and Stephens silently signalled to each other that Parker would be killed. Killing Parker before his natural death would better preserve his blood to drink. Brooks, who had not been party to the earlier discussion, claimed to have signalled neither assent nor protest. Dudley always insisted that Brooks had assented. Dudley said a prayer and, with Stephens standing by to hold the youth's legs if he struggled, pushed his [[penknife]] into Parker's [[jugular vein]], killing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=57–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RichardParkerTombstone.jpg|thumb|Memorial stone to Richard Parker in [[Peartree Green]], [[Southampton]].]]
In some of the varying and confused later accounts of the killing, Parker murmured, "What me?" as he was slain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The three fed on Parker's body, with Dudley and Brooks consuming the most and Stephens very little. The crew even finally managed to catch some rainwater. Dudley later described the scene, "I can assure you I shall never forget the sight of my two unfortunate companions over that ghastly meal we all was like mad wolfs who should get the most and for men fathers of children to commit such a deed we could not have our right reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The crew sighted a sail on 29 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rescue and arraignment==
Dudley, Stephens and Brooks were picked up by the German sailing [[barque]] ''Montezuma'' which returned the men to [[Falmouth, Cornwall]] on Saturday 6 September ''en route'' to its destination in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=69–70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On arrival in Falmouth, the survivors attended the customs house and Dudley and Stephens entered statutory statements under the [[Merchant Shipping Act|Merchant Shipping Acts]], required in the event of a shipping loss. All three were candid, Dudley and Stephens believing themselves to be protected by a [[Custom of the Sea]].

[[Customs officer]] and Sergeant of the [[Falmouth Docks Police|Falmouth Harbour Police]] James Laverty was in the vicinity of the depositions and later questioned Dudley about the means by which he had killed Parker, taking custody of the knife and promising to return it. The depositions were [[telegraph]]ed to the [[Board of Trade]] and to the [[Registrar General of Shipping]] in [[Bassinghall Street]] in London. While the survivors were making arrangements to rejoin their families, Bassinghall Street advised that the men should be detained in Falmouth.

The Board of Trade gave conflicting advice to take no action but informed the [[Home Office]]. The Home Office was closed for the weekend. Meanwhile, Laverty was seeking [[arrest warrant|warrant]]s for the men's arrest for murder on the high seas, warrants he obtained later that day from mayor of Falmouth, Henry Liddicoat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=3–11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three men were held in the borough police station until they could appear before the [[magistrate]]s on the morning of Monday, 8 September. Dudley appears to have been confident that the magistrates would dismiss the charges and Liddicoat visited the men to apologise for their inconvenience, but all magistrates had recently been instructed to seek advice of the [[Treasury Solicitor]] in all murder cases and the clerk probably prompted Laverty to ask for a [[Detention of suspects|remand in custody]] and [[adjournment]] while advice was sought. Local [[solicitor]] Harry Tilly appeared for the men and requested [[bail]] but after the magistrates, including Liddicoat, had consulted, they were returned to the police cells until 11 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=73–76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[civil service]] had now returned from the weekend break and by Wednesday the file was passed to [[Home Secretary]] Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]]. That day Harcourt consulted with [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir [[Henry James, 1st Baron James of Hereford|Henry James]] and [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] Sir [[Farrer Herschell, 1st Baron Herschell|Farrer Herschell]]. Harcourt took the decision to prosecute, the lost opportunity to clarify the law through James Archer (see [[#James Archer|below]]) no doubt alive in his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of their appearance in front of the magistrates on 11 September, public opinion in Falmouth had swung firmly behind the defendants, especially after Parker's brother Daniel, also a seaman, appeared in court and shook hands with the three. The case was again adjourned until 18 September, though this time Tilly succeeded in obtaining bail, the Home Office having hinted to the court that this would be appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=78–80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The three men returned to their homes while the case began to appear across the British and worldwide press. It soon became clear that public opinion was with the three survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=81–83}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Harcourt was revolted by the public's sentiment and became even more intent on a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Otto Adolph Julius Danckwerts]], a barrister of only six years' [[call to the bar|call]] but with considerable experience in wreck inquiries, was briefed for the prosecution but soon realised that public sentiment and the lack of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] posed formidable difficulties. The only witnesses were the three defendants themselves and their [[right to silence]] would impede any formal proceedings. Furthermore, a [[confession (law)|confession]] was only admissible against the person making it, not his co-defendants, and the contents of the depositions was probably inadequate to convict.

When the case was heard by the magistrates on 18 September, Danckwerts told the court that he intended to offer no evidence against Brooks and requested that he be discharged so that he could be called as a [[witness]] for the prosecution. There is no evidence that Brooks had been canvassed about this and the magistrates agreed. Danckwerts opened the prosecution case and called as witnesses those who had heard the survivors' stories and Brooks. The magistrates committed Dudley and Stephens for [[trial (law)|trial]] at the winter Cornwall and [[Devon]] [[assizes]] in [[Exeter]], but extended their bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=89–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal background and theory==
The [[morality]], [[ethics]], and [[law|legality]] of the taking of another's life to increase one's own chances of survival have been discussed in [[thought experiment]]s from the [[Plank of Carneades]] to [[The Case of the Speluncean Explorers]], but there have been few legal cases where the question has been tested.

===Saint Christopher case===
In the early 17th century, seven Englishmen in the [[Caribbean]] embarked on an overnight voyage from Saint Christopher, but were blown out to sea and lost for 17 days. During this time, starving, they cast lots to see who would sacrifice his own life for the others. The lot fell to the man who had suggested the scheme, and he consented to his subsequent killing. His body sustained the rest until they made their way to [[Saint Martin]]. They were returned to Saint Christopher where they were put on trial for [[homicide]]. The judge [[pardon]]ed them, their crime being "washed away" by "inevitable necessity". Though this case was cited in defence of Dudley and Stephens, it was reported only anecdotally some years later in a medical work and not in the [[law report]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=122–123}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''U.S. v. Holmes''===
In 1841, the U.S. ship ''[[William Brown (ship)|William Brown]]'' sank after hitting an [[iceberg]]. Crewmen, including Alexander William Holmes, believed that their overloaded lifeboat was in danger of itself sinking and put 14 or 16 passengers overboard to their inevitable deaths in the frigid water. On his return to [[Philadelphia]], Holmes was arrested and charged with [[murder]]. The [[grand jury]] rejected the [[indictment]] and substituted [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Holmes (1842)|United States v. Holmes]]'' (1842) 1 Wallace Junior 1, 26 Fed. Cas. 360&lt;/ref&gt; The judge in the [[United States District Court]] for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania instructed the jury that necessity might be a complete defence but that "before the protection of the law of necessity can be invoked, a case of necessity must exist, the slayer must be faultless, he must owe no duty to the victim." The jury convicted Holmes and the principle of necessity was not tested by any higher court. He was sentenced to six months in jail and a $20 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/2482/Alexander-Holmes-Trial-1842.html |title=Alexander Holmes Trial: 1842 - Holmes Tried For Manslaughter |publisher=Law Library - American Law and Legal Information |accessdate=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case was also cited in defence of Dudley and Stephens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=162–175}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Archer===
[[File:The Euxine.jpg|thumb|The ''Euxine'']]
On 9 August 1874, the collier ''Euxine'' was lost, and its second mate James Archer took charge of one of the lifeboats with seven other survivors. Archer and four survivors were picked up on 31 August, and Archer was candid that he and August Muller had killed and butchered Francis Shufus, selected by drawing lots. They were ultimately landed at [[Batavia Road]] where the acting British [[consul]], William J. Fraser took their surprisingly honest [[Deposition (law)|deposition]]s.

The men were then shipped to Singapore along with Fraser's depositions and put into the hands of shipping master Henry Ellis, a character fictionalised in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[The Shadow Line]]''. Ellis consulted [[Attorney General for Singapore]] [[Thomas Braddell]] but then wrote to the [[Board of Trade]] in London that no further action was necessary and the men were free to find another ship to serve. Singapore Governor Sir [[Andrew Clarke (administrator)|Andrew Clarke]] had ordered the men arrested and when he informed the [[Colonial Office]], they insisted that he hold a judicial enquiry. Prosecution was started in Singapore but ultimately dropped after extended procedural wrangles as to whether Singapore or England was the most appropriate jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=176–194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law Commission===
The [[Law Commission|Criminal Law Commissioners]], who were attempting to define an [[English Criminal Code]], considered the matter several times:&lt;ref name="S235"&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1839, Fourth report, Digest of Law (Art.39) included necessity as a defence to [[homicide]];
*1843, Seventh report (Art.29) also included the defence;
*1846, Second report favoured leaving questions of necessity to the [[royal prerogative]] of [[clemency]] (Art.19);
*1878/ 1879, declined to codify the defence as it was "better to leave such questions to be dealt with when, if ever, they arise in practice by applying the principles of law to the circumstance of the particular case."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=201}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, [[James Fitzjames Stephen]] introduced a Homicide Law Amendment [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] that included a defence of necessity. But it was lost, and Stephen himself had changed his mind by 1884.&lt;ref name="S235"/&gt;

==Trial==
The trial of Dudley and Stephens opened in Exeter on 3 November before [[Baron Huddleston]]. Arthur Charles [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] led for the prosecution and Arthur J. H. Collins [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] for the defence, paid for out of a defence fund that had been established by public subscription. Huddleston was well aware of the passion of the local jury and probably aware of the case of the ''Euxine'' and the failed prosecution of James Archer, and was determined that the case not collapse and that the issue of necessity be settled. Sir [[William Robert Grove]] had initially been listed to take the [[assizes]] that session, and there has been speculation that Huddleston was substituted to ensure a "safe pair of hands". Huddleston had a reputation as a judge able to direct a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=195–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury was [[jury (England and Wales)#Empanelling and challenging jurors|empanelled]] and sworn, being composed of almost the same jurors as had sat with Huddleston the previous day in a murder case that had resulted in the [[death penalty]]. Dudley and Stephens pleaded not guilty. Charles opened for the prosecution, outlining the legal arguments and dismissing the defence of necessity. He also dismissed the [[insanity defence]]; it was clear from the depositions and Dudley's prayer that they were aware of the quality of their actions. Charles did not suppress the dreadful conditions on the boat and suggested an ultimate appeal to clemency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=205–206}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A discussion now took place between Huddleston and Collins which showed that Huddleston had made up his mind on the law and was not interested in hearing any submissions from the defence. In fact, Huddleston had already planned how he would ensure a guilty verdict and settle the law on necessity once and for all. He would invite, in robust terms, the jury to return a [[special verdict]], stating only the facts of the case as they found them but giving no opinion on guilt or otherwise. It would then be for the judge to decide whether the facts found amounted to guilt. Though special verdicts had once been common, none had been returned since 1785, and the jury in any case retained the right to return a general verdict.

Huddleston was further determined that the legal question would be settled by a bench of several judges in order to lend it authority. Hence, he planned to adjourn the trial after the special verdict and reconvene with fellow judges to pronounce guilt. Collins would have his opportunity to argue the law in front of the expanded bench.&lt;ref name="Simpson 1984 pp206-210"&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=206–210}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution produced the various accounts and depositions written by the defendants and the evidence that the ''Mignonette'' was registered in Britain, necessary to establish the court's [[jurisdiction]] under s.267 of the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1854]]. Charles then called evidence from the various people who had spoken to the defendants on their arrival in Falmouth before calling Brooks. Brooks provided a compelling account of Dudley and Stephens' actions and his own non-involvement. In [[cross-examination]], Collins did not challenge his account, but made him confirm the appalling conditions on the boat, Brooks' own cannibalism, their inevitable death without recourse to Parker's body and the belief that Parker would have died first.&lt;ref name="Simpson 1984 pp206-210"/&gt;

Though Collins addressed the jury on necessity in his closing speech, Huddleston presented them with a stark alternative: accept his direction to find the men guilty of murder or return a special verdict. Without waiting for the jury's decision, Huddleston produced a special verdict that he had written the night before and invited the jury to indicate their assent to each paragraph as he read it out. Silence was sufficient. Though the jury finally tried to add some facts to the verdict, Huddleston insisted, perhaps not entirely truthfully, that their observations were already incorporated. The final words of the verdict were, "But whether upon the whole matter, the prisoners were and are guilty of murder the jury are ignorant and refer to the Court." Huddleston then renewed the defendants' bail and adjourned the assizes to his rooms in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London for 25 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=212–217}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Huddleston's blunders==
[[File:SirJohnWalterHuddleston.jpg|thumb|[[John Walter Huddleston|Baron Huddleston]]]]

At some point after the trial, but before the special verdict was copied for the London review, Huddleston realised that he had made a potentially serious error. In his original draft, he had described the ''Mignonette'' as an "English Merchant vessel" but had altered this to read "yacht". Further, he had described the lifeboat as "an open boat" and not asserted its provenance on the ''Mignonette''. He now realised that he had omitted the critical finding necessary to give the court jurisdiction over Dudley and Stephens. Huddleston's solution was simply to alter his record of the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=218}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November, the Cornwall and Devon winter [[Assizes (England and Wales)|assizes]] reconvened at No. 2 Court, the Royal Courts of Justice in London. Attorney-General Sir Henry James appeared for the prosecution and immediately pointed out a problem. The [[Divisional Court]] of the [[Queen's Bench]] had an established authority to decide a matter of law with a panel of judges after referral from an inferior court. [[Statute]] only permitted this following a conviction, and there had been no conviction in Exeter. James suggested that an alternative was to hear the case as the Cornwall and Devon assizes, albeit at an unusual venue, but to add further judges to the bench as all [[High Court of England and Wales|High Court]] judges had authority to hear assize cases. Huddleston expressed his scepticism that judges could be added to a trial once it had begun. Moreover, he had been looking for affirmation from a superior court. By this time Collins had become suspicious of Huddleston's tampering with the record of the trial and requested the [[shorthand]] notes of the hearing. With the proceedings now in shambles, the case was listed for 4 December, and the defendants were ordered to attend in London, though on what authority is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=218–221}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a further hearing on 2 December, James withdrew his suggestion of an augmented assize court and gave the opinion that the court should sit as the Queen's Bench Divisional Court; this should only have allowed two or three judges, not the five who eventually sat. Collins seems not to have taken the opportunity to challenge the jurisdiction or constitution of the court, possibly because of some agreement with the prosecution and promise of clemency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=221–223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
[[File:johncoleridge.jpg|thumb|[[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]]]]

The Queen's Bench Division sat on 4 December under [[Lord Chief Justice]] [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]]. James appeared for the prosecution, leading Charles and Danckwerts. At the beginning of the hearing, the report of the Exeter trial was read out, at some length, in its entirety. This allowed Collins to submit that the special verdict had been altered. As much was ultimately admitted and it was eventually agreed that it was best that the special verdict be restored to the version agreed by the jury. Collins' attempt to challenge the jurisdiction of the court was rejected by the judges. Collins then submitted that the court was not competent to return a verdict as the Exeter jury had not given a conditional verdict asserting that the jury would find in accordance with the judge's ruling. Though this troubled the judges, especially Grove, the point was eventually dismissed as one of form only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=225–228}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

James submitted that there was no common law authority to support the proposition that necessity was a defence to murder. The Saint Christopher case was rejected as a precedent because it had not been formally recorded in the law reports. Before Collins started his submissions, Lord Coleridge instructed him to confine his remarks to murder, thereby dismissing the plausible alternative that necessity was a [[partial defence]] leading to a conviction for manslaughter by analogy with the partial defence of [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]]. Collins responded by citing ''[[William Brown (ship)|United States v. Holmes]]'' (1842) and discussing the various theoretical and ethical arguments in favour of the necessity defence. At the conclusion of Collins' submissions, the judges withdrew. They returned after a few moments and Lord Coleridge declared, "We are all of the opinion that the conviction should be affirmed but we will put our reasons in writing and give them on Saturday next." After some technical legal discussion, Lord Coleridge committed Dudley and Stephens to [[Holloway Prison]], then a men's institution, until Tuesday, 9 December, when the court would deliver its reasons and its [[sentence (law)|sentence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=229–237}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel of judges found that there was no common law defence of necessity to a charge of murder, either on the basis of legal precedent or the basis of ethics and morality.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;''R v. Dudley and Stephens'' [1884] 14 QBD 273 DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | To preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it. [[War]] is full of instances in which it is a man's duty not to live, but to die. The duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the passengers, of soldiers to women and children, as in the noble case of the ''[[HMS Birkenhead (1845)|Birkenhead]]''; these duties impose on men the moral necessity, not of the preservation, but of the sacrifice of their lives for others, from which in no country, least of all, it is to be hoped, in England, will men ever shrink, as indeed, they have not shrunk.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; }}

{{quotation | It would be a very easy and cheap display of commonplace learning to quote from [[Classics|Greek and Latin authors]], from [[Horace]], from [[Juvenal]], from [[Cicero]], from [[Euripides]], passage after passage, in which the duty of dying for others has been laid down in glowing and emphatic language as resulting from the principles of heathen ethics; it is enough in a [[Christianity|Christian]] country to remind ourselves of the Great Example &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Jesus Christ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; whom we profess to follow.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; }}

Further, the judges questioned who was qualified to make the decision of who should live and who should die, were the principle to be allowed. They further observed that such a principle might be the "legal cloak for unbridled passion and atrocious crime". They were sensible of the men's awful predicament.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

{{quotation | It must not be supposed that in refusing to admit temptation to be an excuse for crime it is forgotten how terrible the temptation was; how awful the suffering; how hard in such trials to keep the judgment straight and the conduct pure. We are often compelled to set up standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we could not ourselves satisfy. But a man has no right to declare temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it, nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner the legal definition of the crime.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt; }}

Dudley and Stephens were sentenced to the statutory death penalty with a recommendation for mercy.&lt;ref name="report"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Sir William Harcourt.jpg|thumb|upright| [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]]]]
Collins still had the option of moving a [[writ of error]] to raise the very arguable issues of jurisdiction and constitution of the court but he knew that the verdict in such an important case had been pre-decided and Dudley and Stephens still anticipated an immediate release. By 11 December, there was still no announcement and it seemed that, their having been convicted, public opinion was moving against the men. Any exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy would be exercised by [[Queen Victoria]] on the advice of the Home Secretary Harcourt.

Though Harcourt was personally in favour of abolition of the death penalty, he was conscientious in his official duties. He took the judgment of the court seriously, that the men were guilty of murder, and feared that commuting the sentence to anything other than [[life imprisonment]] would mock the law. 

On the other hand, Attorney-General Sir Henry James felt that a life sentence would not resist the attack of public opinion. He noted that the court had withheld a finding of manslaughter from the jury but that had it been available that would have been the jury's verdict and "no judge would have inflicted more than three months' [[imprisonment]]". Solicitor-General Sir Farrer Herschell concurred. 

Based on James and Herschell's advice, on 12 December, Harcourt decided on six months' imprisonment. Dudley and Stephens were advised the next day but were somewhat disappointed at so long in custody. Dudley never accepted the justice of his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=239–247}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two men were released around 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 20 May 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mignonette Case|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000159/18850520/025/0004|accessdate=21 August 2014|work=North-Eastern Daily Gazette|date=20 May 1885|page=4|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
The case is familiar among lawyers in the common law jurisdictions — that is, England and many, though not all, former British territories — and is universally studied by law students in such jurisdictions. Simpson observed that, though many murderers have become household names in Britain, the case is surprisingly unfamiliar to the public at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=306}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Parker is the name of several people in real life and fiction who became shipwrecked, with some of them subsequently being cannibalised by their fellow seamen. [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s only novel, ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'', published in 1838, features a character named Richard Parker, who, after a shipwreck, becomes a victim of cannibalism by the ship's remaining survivors. Writer [[Yann Martel]] in his 2001 novel ''[[Life of Pi]]'' picked up on these occurrences, and named the book's shipwrecked Bengal tiger [[Richard Parker (Life of Pi)|Richard Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/story?id=124838&amp;page=1|title=Q and A With 'Life of Pi' Author|date=2006-01-06|website=ABC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131110744/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/story?id=124838&amp;page=1|archive-date=2011-01-31|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was also the basis for a famous [[Monty Python]] [[Sketch comedy|sketch]], titled "[[Lifeboat sketch|Lifeboat (Cannibalism)/Still no Sign of Land]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/lifeboat.htm orangecow.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908023935/http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/lifeboat.htm |date=2009-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sketch, five sailors are on a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] after a [[shipwreck]], and the only way they can survive is through cannibalism. Once they decide whom to eat — and which body parts — a waitress is called over to take their orders, complete with vegetables. In ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', this is followed by the controversial "[[Undertakers sketch]]", which also features [[cannibalism]].

In 2004, the [[Avett Brothers]] named their album ''[[Mignonette (album)|Mignonette]]'' after the ship on which the incident occurred.

In 2017, Canadian author Peter Staadecker published ''The Twelve Man Bilbo Choir'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twelve Man Bilbo Choir|last=Staadecker|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-0-9959251-0-6|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twelve Man Bilbo Choir|last=Staadecker|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-0-9959251-1-3|location=Toronto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a novel inspired in part by the ''Mignonette'' incident.

[[The Case of the Speluncean Explorers]] is a famous hypothetical case created in 1949 by legal theorist [[Lon L. Fuller]] to illustrate divergent theories of law and morality in the context of facts heavily based around those in ''Dudley and Stephens''.

A plaque commemorating Richard Parker can be found in the churchyard of Jesus Chapel on [[Peartree Green]] in [[Southampton]], near to the site of [[Itchen Ferry Village]] whence he came.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13861">A '''review bomb''' is an [[Internet]] phenomenon in which large groups of people leave negative [[User review|user reviews]] for [[Video game|video games]] and other products in an attempt to harm their sales and popularity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://steamed.kotaku.com/steam-review-bombing-is-a-problem-1701088582|title=Steam 'Review Bombing' Is A Problem|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|work=Steamed|date=19 April 2015|access-date=2017-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a similar practise to [[vote brigading]], and review bombing shares characteristics with this practice. This is often done in response to an actual or perceived slight towards customers by the creator or publisher of a game, such as anti-consumer gameplay changes or insults, in an attempt to force them to listen when other attempts have failed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in some cases, it is simply done as a means of [[coercion]] or [[Internet troll|trolling]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Review bombing may be intended to affect sales of the game that is targeted: leaving a large number of negative reviews may lower the game's aggregate rating on the service, which could alter the choice to buy the game from consumers who use that aggregate rating as a principle part of their purchasing decision.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/xwgdek/valves-solution-to-review-bombing-ignores-steams-longstanding-problems | title = Valve's "Solution" to Review Bombing Ignores Steam's Longstanding Problems | first=  Patrick | last = Klepek | date = September 19, 2017 | accessdate = September 19, 2017 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see review bombs as a way to gain wider attention to a problem and draw in the developer to correcting an issue due to the bad publicity, if the developer does not otherwise have an open channel for players or seems unresponsive to direct player feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/4/16418832/pubg-firewatch-steam-review-bomb | title = The anatomy of a review bombing campaign | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | date = October 4, 2017 | accessdate = October 4, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing prevalence of review bombing was precipitated by the increase in influence of online user reviews in the main storefronts where games are sold, combined with little to no oversight of the content of these reviews. This is particularly true in the case of [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the predominant seller of [[PC game|PC games]], where user reviews are often the only way for [[Indie game|indie games]] to gain traction on the service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some cases, companies that run these storefronts or websites have intervened to stop review bombs and delete the negative reviews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, Valve has added review [[histogram]]s to Steam user review scores to show how these change over time; according to Valve's Alden Kroll, this can help a potential purchaser of a game recognize a short term review bomb that is not indicative of the game itself, compared to a game that has a long tail of bad reviews. Kroll said they did not want to silence the ability of users to leave reviews but recognized they needed to highlight phenomena like review bombs to aid consumers.&lt;Ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-09-19-steam-adds-histograms-to-address-review-bombing | title = Steam adds histograms to address review bombing | first = Brendan | last = Sinclair | date = September 19, 2017 | accessdate = September 19, 2017 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable examples ==
The website [[Metacritic]] was criticized in 2011 for poor oversight of their user reviews, leading to rampant review bombing on popular games such as ''[[Bastion (video game)|Bastion]]'' and ''[[Toy Soldiers: Cold War]]'' that brought their user rating to low levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/113289-Metacritic-Brings-Down-The-Hammer-On-Review-Bombers|title=Metacritic Brings Down The Hammer On "Review Bombers"|work=The Escapist|date=13 September 2011|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' was also review bombed on the site in 2012 due to controversy over its ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kotaku.com/5891060/metacritic-says-it-removed-rule-violating-mass-effect-3-user-reviews|title=Metacritic Says It Has Removed Rule-Violating Mass Effect 3 User Reviews|last=Schreier|first=Jason|work=Kotaku|date=6 March 2012|access-date=2017-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Titan Souls]]'' was review bombed in April 2015 by supporters of the [[List of YouTubers|YouTuber]] [[TotalBiscuit|John "TotalBiscuit" Bain]] after the indie game's artist Andrew Gleeson mocked a statement that Bain made saying the game was "absolutely not for me".

''[[Crusader Kings II]]'' and other Paradox games were review bombed in the same month by customers angry that they had raised the prices in some regions, and because of ongoing frustration about Paradox's DLC policy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, Valve changed their policies to make unpaid games of any kind not count towards the game's review scores. The developer of ''Defender's Quest'', Lars Doucet, stated that this policy prevented low priced games from being review bombed, but harmed the visibility of crowdfunded indie games.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''[[Dota 2]]'' was reviewed bombed in August 2017 after [[Marc Laidlaw]], a former [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] writer for the ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' series, posted a "fanfic" on his personal blog that several journalists deduced was the plot for ''Half-Life 2: Episode 3'', which had been planned for release in 2007, but appeared to have become [[vaporware]] within Valve.

In October 2017, ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'' was review bombed, primarily by Chinese players, after an advert for a [[VPN]] service was shown in game. As the [[Internet in China]] is highly regulated, VPN servers have been used by some players to bypass Chinese regulations and play on servers in other regions, which causes [[lag]] for players in those other regions, so the promotion of such VPN products is poorly received. The review bomb may also be tied to the fact that the product, which is not free-to-play, included advertising support, which has yet to occur for the game in any other region worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/pubg-review-bombed-on-steam-due-to-in-game-ads-found-in-china | title = PUBG Review Bombed on Steam Due to In-game ads Found in China | first = Matt | last = Kim | date = October 2, 2017 | accessdate = October 2, 2017 | work = [[US Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kerbal Space Program]]'' was similarly review bombed by Chinese players after the developers Squad changed a line of Chinese text on one of the game's assets, which was inspired by a quotation from Chairman [[Mao Zedong]], that some has perceived as sexist depending how the characters were translated; the replacement line which lacks such confusion but also lost its significance to the original quotation, leading those upset with the change to respond with negative review.&lt;ref name="pcgamesn oct2017"/&gt;{{Not in refs|date=May 2018}}

The Creative Assembly's ''[[Total War: Rome II]]'', initially released in 2013, had been patched in early 2018 to include the potential for women generals to emerge from the game's mechanics. When an image of the game showing one player's armies all led by female generals, users on Steam complained about the historical accuracy. A female community content manager stated the Creative Assembly's stance, that the game was meant to be "historically authentic, not historically accurate", but a portion of these users began to review bomb the title on Steam, believing that the content manager was pushing a personal agenda. Creative Assembly affirmed the content manager's statement providing the probability of how a situation like this could happen, and how players have the ability to modify the game to change that probability of women generals appearing, including setting it to zero if desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-25-total-war-rome-2-review-bombed-on-steam-over-female-characters-creative-assembly-says-its-working-as-intended | title = Steam users review bomb Total War: Rome 2 over female characters | first = Wesley | last =Yin-Poole | date = September 25, 2018 | accessdate = September 25, 2018 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
According to [[Steam Spy]], review bombing generally has little effect on a game's sales, and may in fact [[Streisand effect|even increase them]] due to the resulting wave of [[publicity]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, it may be a symptom of decreased consumer goodwill, which can have a more long-lasting effect on the publisher, developers or game series being criticized.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Depending on how such situations are resolved, the effects of a review bomb may be reversed by those users re-issuing positive reviews as in case of ''Titan Souls''.&lt;ref name="pcgamesn oct2017"/&gt;

[[File:St Basils Cathedral-500px.jpg|thumb|300px|[[St. Basil's Cathedral]] is a monument to the Russian conquest of Kazan in 1552]]

The '''Russo-Kazan Wars''' was a series of wars fought between the [[Khanate of Kazan]] and [[Muscovite Russia]] from 1438, until [[Kazan]] was finally captured by [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] and absorbed into Russia in 1552.

==General==
[[File:Volgarivermap.png|thumb|right|Volga basin showing Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan]]
Before it separated from the Golden Horde the Kazan region was part of [[Volga Bulgaria]] (c. 630–1240) and then the Bulgar Ulus of the Golden Horde (c. 1240–1438). They adopted Islam in  921, 67 years before Russia became Christian. The boundary between Muscovy and Kazan was near Nizhny Novgorod, about half way between the two cities. The land east of Nizhny Novgorod was fairly difficult. When the Tatars attacked they would first hit Nizhny Novgorod and then move on Murom, Ryazan and other places, only twice approaching Moscow. When the Russians attacked they would usually send two armies, one down the Volga and one over land. As Muscovy grew stronger, fighting shifted eastward. Before 1552 the Russians made no attempt to conquer Kazan and contented themselves with maintaining a pro-Russian khan. A pro-Russian khan meant peace and an anti-Russian khan meant independence and war. Kazan never established a stable dynasty. Pro-Russian khans often came from the [[Qasim Khanate]] while anti-Russian khans were brought in from Crimea and other khanates. There were usually pro- and anti-Russian factions, but they seem to have been temporary and unstable.

==Wars of Vasily II==
In 1438, a year after the khanate's foundation, the very first khan of Kazan, [[Olug Moxammat]], advanced on [[Moscow]] with a large army. [[Vasily II of Moscow]] fled from his capital across the [[Volga River]], but the Tatars refused to pursue the campaign and turned back to Kazan after devastating [[Kolomna]] and the locality.&lt;ref name="Bosworth280"&gt;{{harvnb|Bosworth|2007|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign of 1445 was disastrous for Muscovy and had major repercussions in Russian politics. Hostilities broke out when Khan [[Maxmut]] took the strategic fortress of [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and invaded Muscovy. Vasily II mustered an army and defeated the Tatars near [[Murom]] and [[Gorokhovets, Vladimir Oblast|Gorokhovets]]. Thinking the war over, he disbanded his forces and returned to Moscow in triumph, only to learn that the Tatars had besieged Nizhny Novgorod again.

A new army was mustered and marched towards [[Suzdal]], where they met the Russian generals who had surrendered Nizhny to the enemy after setting the fortress on fire. On 6 June 1445 the Russians and the Tatars clashed in the [[Battle of the Kamenka River]] near the walls of [[Monastery of Saint Euthymius|St. Euphemius Monastery]]. The battle was a resounding success for the Tatars, who took Vasily II prisoner. It took four months and an enormous ransom to salvage the monarch from captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1995|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wars of Ivan III==

===Qasim War (1467–1469)===
[[File:S. V. Ivanov. Campaign of Muscovites. XVI century. (1903).jpg|thumb|Medieval Russians used skis to facilitate transportation during their winter campaigns]]

A fragile peace was broken in 1467, when [[Ibrahim of Kazan]] came to the throne and [[Ivan III of Russia]] supported the claims of his ally or vassal [[Qasim Khan]]. Ivan's army sailed down the [[Volga]], with their eyes fixed on Kazan, but autumn rains and [[rasputitsa]] ("quagmire season") hindered the progress of Russian forces.  When frosty winter came, the Russian generals launched an invasion of the northern [[Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]] Region. The campaign fell apart for lack of unity of purpose and military capability.

The following year, the Russians set out from [[Kotelnich]] in the Vyatka woods. They sailed down the [[Vyatka River]] and the [[Kama River|Kama]] towards the Volga, pillaging merchant vessels on their way. In response, Ibrahim mounted a counter-offensive, overran Vyatka, and forced local inhabitants into slavery for the duration of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fennell|1962|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1469, a much stronger army was raised and, sailing down the Volga and the Oka, linked up in [[Nizhny Novgorod]]. The Russians marched downstream and ravaged the neighbourhood of [[Kazan]] but did not dare to lay siege to the Tatar capital, because Qasim's widow had pledged to negotiate an advantageous peace with Ibrahim (her son). In the meantime, the units from [[Yaroslavl]] and [[Veliky Ustyug]] vainly attempted to win Vyatka to the Russian side.  After negotiations were broken, the Tatars clashed with the Russians in two bloody but indecisive battles.

In autumn 1469 Ivan III launched a third invasion of the khanate. The Russian commander, Prince [[Daniil Kholmsky]], besieged Kazan, cut off water supplies and compelled Ibrahim to surrender. Under the terms of the peace settlement, the Tatars set free all the ethnic Christian Russians they had enslaved in the forty previous years.

===Siege of Kazan (1487)===
The Vyatka Region remained the principal bone of contention between Kazan and Moscow for decades to come. In 1478, shortly before his death, Ibrahim devastated the region. In revenge, Ivan III sent his generals to sack the neighbourhood of Kazan. At that time Ibrahim died and was succeeded by [[Ilham Ghali of Kazan|Ilham]], whilst his half-brother [[Moxammat Amin]] fled to Moscow. Ivan III allowed him to settle in [[Kashira]] and pledged his support for Moxammat's claims to the Tatar throne.

In 1484 Russia placed Moxammat Amin on the throne, but within a year Ilham regained power. In 1487 that Ivan again found it prudent to intervene into Kazan affairs and to replace Ilham with Moxammat Amin. Prince Kholmsky sailed down the Volga from Nizhny Novgorod and laid siege to Kazan on 18 May. The city fell to the Russians on 9 June. Ilham was sent in chains to Moscow before being imprisoned in [[Vologda]], while Moxammat Amin was proclaimed the new khan.&lt;ref name="Bosworth280"/&gt; In reference to this victorious campaign, Ivan III proclaimed himself "Lord of [[Volga Bulgaria]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Battles of Arsk Field (1506)===
The last war of Ivan's reign was instigated by Ilham's widow, who married Moxammat Amin and persuaded him to assert his independence from Moscow in 1505. The rebellion broke out into the open on Saint John's Day, when the Tatars massacred Russian merchants and envoys present at the annual Kazan Fair. A huge army of the Kazan and [[Nogai Tatars]] then advanced towards [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and besieged the city. The affair was decided by 300 Lithuanian archers, who had been captured by Russians in the [[Battle of Vedrosha]] and lived in Nizhny in captivity. They managed to put the Tatar vanguard into disarray: the khan's brother-in-law was killed in action and the horde retreated.

Ivan's death prevented hostilities from being renewed until May 1506, when Prince Fyodor Belsky led Russian forces against Kazan. After the Tatar cavalry attacked his rear, many Russians took flight or drowned in the Foul Lake (22 May). Prince [[Vasily Kholmsky]] was sent to relieve Belsky and defeated the khan on [[Arsk]] Field on June 22. Moxammat Amin withdrew to the Arsk Tower but, when the Russians started to celebrate their victory, ventured out and inflicted an excruciating defeat on them (June 25). Although it was the most brilliant Tatar victory in decades, Moxammat Amin – for some reason not clearly understood – resolved to sue for peace and paid homage to Ivan's successor, [[Vasily III of Russia]]. [[File:Коромыслова башня.jpg|thumb|265px|Tower of the [[Nizhny Novgorod]] [[kremlin]], built in 1500–1511 to repel attacks by the Kazan Tatars.]]

==Wars of Vasily III==
A new massacre of Russian merchants and envoys residing in Kazan took place in 1521. Vasily III was so enraged that he forbade his subjects to visit the [[Kazan Fair]] again. Instead, the famous [[Makariev Fair]] was inaugurated downstream from Nizhny Novgorod, an establishment which undermined the economical prosperity of Kazan, thus contributing to its eventual downfall.

In 1524, Prince [[Gediminid Belsky family|Ivan Belsky]] led the 150,000-strong Russian army against the Tatar capital. This campaign is described in detail by a foreign witness, [[Sigismund von Herberstein|Herberstein]]. Belsky's huge army spent 20 days encamped on an island opposite Kazan, awaiting the arrival of Russian cavalrymen. Then news came that part of the cavalry had been defeated, and the vessels loaded with provisions had been captured by the Tatars. Although the army suffered from hunger, Belsky at once laid siege to the city and soon the Tatars sent their envoys proposing terms. Belsky accepted them and speedily returned to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Solovʹev|1976|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Belsky returned to the walls of Kazan in July 1530. The khan had fortified his capital and built a new wall, yet the Russians set the city ablaze, massacring their rivals utterly (according to Russian chronicles) and causing their enemy, [[Safa Giray of Kazan|Safa Giray]], to withdraw to Arsk. The Tatars sued for peace, promising to accept any khan appointed from Moscow. The tsar put [[Canghali of Kazan|Canghali]], Shahgali's younger brother on the throne. He was murdered by the anti-Russian faction in 1535.

Russian chronicles record about forty attacks of Kazan khans on the Russian territories (mainly the regions of [[Nizhniy Novgorod]], [[Murom]], Vyatka, [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Kostroma]], [[Galich, Russia|Galich]]) in the first half of the 16th century. Half of Kazan raids occurred in 1530s and 1540s. Besides 1521 most ruinous Kazan attacks occurred in 1522, 1533, 1537, 1538, 1539, 1540, and 1541.&lt;ref&gt;The Full Collection of the Russian Annals, vol.13, SPb, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wars of Ivan IV==
[[File:Korovin kazan.jpg|thumb|Ivan IV under the walls of Kazan]]

While Ivan IV was a minor, border skirmishes continued unabated, but the leaders of both powers were reluctant to commit their troops to open conflicts. In 1536, the Russians and Tatars were on the brink of a new war and met near [[Lyskovo]], but the battle was averted. Over the following years, the Crimean khan constructed an offensive alliance with [[Safa Giray]] of [[Kazan]], his relative. When Safa Giray invaded [[Muscovy]] in December 1540, the Russians used [[Qasim Tatars]] to contain him. After his advance was stalled near [[Murom]], Safa Giray was forced to withdraw towards his own borders.

[[File:Russian troops departing for Kazan in 1545.gif|thumb|left|Russian troops departing for Kazan in 1545 (drawing from a contemporary manuscript).]]

These reverses undermined Safa Giray's authority in Kazan. A pro-Russian party, represented by [[Shahgali]], gained enough popular support to usurp the throne more than once. In 1545, Ivan IV mounted an expedition to the Volga River, mainly in order to flex muscles and to show his support for pro-Russian factions. Little was achieved during the campaign of 1547-48 and the story was much the same for 1549-50.

In 1551, detailed schemes for the eventual conquest of [[Kazan]] started to be aired. The tsar sent his envoy to the [[Nogai Horde]] and they promised to maintain neutrality during the impending war. The [[Ar begs]] and [[Udmurts]] submitted to Russian authority as well. In 1551, the wooden fort of [[Sviyazhsk]] was transported down the Volga from [[Uglich]] all the way to Kazan. It was used as the Russian ''place d'armes'' during the decisive campaign of 1552.

==Fall of Kazan (1552)==
{{Main|Siege of Kazan|Kazan War}}

On 16 June 1552 Ivan IV led a 150,000-strong Russian army from Moscow towards [[Kolomna]]. They routed the [[Crimean Tatars]] under [[Devlet I Giray|Devlet Giray]] near [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] before turning to the east. The tsar pressed on towards Kazan, and the final siege of the Tatar capital commenced on 30 August. Under the supervision of Prince [[Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky]], the Russians used ram weapons, a [[Siege tower|battery-tower]], [[Mining (military)|mines]], and 150 cannon. The Russians had the advantage of efficient [[military engineer]]s, such as [[Ivan Vyrodkov]], Nemchin Erazm ("Rozmysl")&lt;ref&gt;

The besiegers blocked the city's water supply and breached the walls  before the final storming on 2 October led to the taking of the city of Kazan, the razing of its fortifications, and the massacre of much of the population. The ''[[Kazan Chronicle]]'' reports the killing of 110,000 – both civilians and garrison – and the release of 60,000–100,000 Russians whom the khanate had held captive.

The fall of Kazan had as its primary effect the assertion of Moscow's control over the [[Volga region|Middle Volga]]. The [[Bashkirs]] accepted Ivan IV's authority two years later. The tsar celebrated his victory over Kazan by building several churches with oriental features, most famously [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on [[Red Square]] in Moscow. The siege of Kazan forms the subject of the longest poem in the Russian language, [[Mikhail Kheraskov]]'s epic ''Rossiada'' (1771–1779).

After the fall of Kazan a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] uprising known as the [[Kazan War]] started in the region, lasting several years until its final suppression in 1556. The Tsar responded with a policy of [[Christianization]] and [[Russification]] of his Tatar subjects and other indigenous peoples, an approach not reversed until the time of [[Catherine the Great]] (reigned 1762–1796).&lt;ref&gt;{{TES|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seeing Stars''''' is a short [[Animation|animated film]] distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]], and features [[Krazy Kat]]. Different from most shorts of the series, the cartoon features celebrities in their animated forms.

==Plot==
At a music hall, a trio of singers perform by their microphones while an orchestra behind them plays. Enjoying their act are guests who dance on a square similar to a boxing ring. When the musicians stop to play another song, the square carrying some of the guests gets moved out and replaced by another one.

A stuttering announcer, ([[Roscoe Ates]]), introduces the special guest of the event, none other than Krazy Kat. To entertain the crowd in attendance, Krazy plays some short tunes on a piano. The piano is carried to him by mice who look supisciously like miniature versions of [[Minnie Mouse]]. The first tune Krazy Kat plays is ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]''. After a first successful performance he is interrupted by [[Joe E. Brown]]'s high-pitched yelping, but Krazy literally zips his mouth shut. As he continues playing, [[the Marx Brothers]]:&lt;ref name=LH38/&gt; Groucho, Chico, Zeppo and Harpo pop out of the piano and shake hands with him before leaving on a [[tandem]] bicycle. Halfway Harpo hops off to run after a young woman. As she dashes into the kitchen, he follows her, but is kicked out by an African-American female cook.

When Krazy is about to continue playing his instrument, he is interrupted by a noise coming from one of the tables. At that table, [[Laurel and Hardy]] are eating peas and roast chicken. While Hardy is eating with ease, the other guy appears to be having difficulty. When Laurel scoops up peas with a spoon, they often fall off and make a sound that's quite loud to some.&lt;ref name=LH38/&gt; Bothered by this, Hardy provides assistance. Krazy then comes to their table and asks them to be as quiet as possible.

Thinking about having a little meal, Krazy sees a cross-eyed man ([[Ben Turpin]])&lt;ref name=LH38/&gt; eating spaghetti. Krazy comes to the man's table and decides to have a share of the food. While they eat, a waiter ([[Jimmy Durante]])&lt;ref name=LH38/&gt; carrying fruits in a bowl is passing by, and those nearby grab anything they can get. Krazy also tries to pick a fruit but mistakenly grabs the waiter's long nose instead, much to the latter's annoyance. In reply, the waiter mumbles a few words and splats the platter of spaghetti right on top of Krazy. As the cat is covered in spaghetti Harpo takes the opportunity to play him as a [[harp]], before getting distracted again by a woman passing by. Krazy gets cleaned up by someone from another table who uses a [[seltzer bottle]].

Still wandering the music hall, Krazy notices the orchestra is fast asleep. He then wakes them up with a gun, which wakes them up and motivates them to start playing again. Krazy starts dancing at the center of the floor, and all those he came across join him there. There are also some other stars who hadn't appeared earlier, namely [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Marie Dressler]], [[Tom Mix]], [[Maurice Chevalier]] and [[Harold Lloyd]]. Watching from the tables, the audience enjoy the celebration.

'''John Sobieski Stuart''' and '''Charles Edward Stuart''' were names used by John Carter Allen and Charles Manning Allen, two 19th-century brothers who are best known for their role in Scottish cultural history. As authors of a dubious book on Scottish tartans and clan dress, the ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'',{{efn|Full title: ''Vestiarium Scoticum: from the Manuscript formerly in the Library of the Scots College at Douay. With an Introduction and Notes, by John Sobieski Stuart''.}} they are the source of some current tartan traditions.

==Life and books==
John and Charles were born in Wales in the last decade of the 18th century. Later they would claim to have discovered in 1811 that they were descended from the Stuart kings, and on their 1871 census entry they gave [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] as their birthplace.  They moved to Scotland and changed their Allen surname to the more Scottish spelling Allan, then to Hay Allan, and Hay.  Their father, John Carter Allen, had Hay ancestry, and was said to have been related to the [[Earl of Erroll]].

In 1840, ''Genealogical table of the Hays'' was published by John, or at least under his name.{{Efn | Full title: ''Genealogical table of the Hays, from William de Haya, pincerna Domini Regis Scotiae, 1170 to 1840.''. The author of the copy in the National Library of Scotland is recorded as John H. Allan. This book is sometimes attributed to Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, a Scottish antiquarian who was attracted by the ''Vestiarium''.}}  The date of their arrival in Scotland is unclear, but they are known to have been there in 1822. This is the year John published ''The bridal of Caölchairn and other poems'', under the name John Hay Allan. Another edition was published, also in 1822, giving the author's name as "Walter Scott". This is now in the [[British Library]]'s category of "doubtful and supposititious works".

In 1829, they failed to persuade the real Sir [[Walter Scott]] of the authenticity of a document about clan tartans, the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'', which they said was a copy of a 15th century manuscript. The brothers liked to wear Highland dress themselves, apparently "in all the extravagance of which the Highland costume is capable".&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary observer quoted by {{Harvnb | Trevor-Roper | 1983}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1830s, they moved to [[Eilean Aigas]] on the [[River Beauly]] in Inverness-shire, to a hunting lodge granted them by [[Thomas Fraser, 12th Lord Lovat]]. Here they "held court" and surrounded themselves with royal paraphernalia: pennants, seals, even thrones. During their time here, they adopted the final version of their names",{{Sfn | Reynolds}} using the surname 'Stuart', and became practising Catholics (the Stuarts and their supporters, the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], were [[Roman Catholic]].) They got to know various important Highland chiefs and noble patrons, one of whom was [[Francis Stuart, 10th Earl of Moray]], and pursued the aristocratic pastime of deer-hunting. This was the inspiration for ''Lay of the Deer Forest'' (1848).{{Efn|Full title: ''Lay of the Deer Forest. With sketches of olden and modern deer-hunting''. The [[Thomas Fraser, 12th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] wrote an introduction to this.}}

They published the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' in 1842. This was followed in 1844 with a broader "study" of medieval highland Scotland, titled ''The Costume of the Clans'', which included the ideas from 1842.{{Efn|Full title: ''The Costume of the Clans. With observations upon the literature, arts, manufactures and commerce of the Highlands and Western Isles during the Middle Ages; and the influence of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries upon their present condition.''}} This involved "immense scholarship",{{Sfn | Reynolds}} but the historian [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] is just one of many who consider it full of "fantasy" and "forgery", "clearly bogus [but] much consulted".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Moffat |first=Alistair |title=The Borders: A History of the Borders from Earliest Times |date=2007 |orig-year=2002 |publisher=Birlinn |isbn= 978-1-84158-466-9 |page=462 |quote=clearly bogus and much consulted}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1847, their claims to royal blood were set out by implication in a work of historical fiction: ''Tales of the Century: or Sketches of the romance of history between the years 1746 and 1846.'' After this, a strong attack on them published in the ''Quarterly Review'' in 1847 caused severe damage to their reputation. John responded with ''A reply to the Quarterly Review upon the Vestiarium Scoticum'' in 1848,{{Efn | Also published as ''The genuineness of the Vestiarium Scoticum''.}} but the brothers soon were pressured to move away from Scotland, to live with relations in [[Prague]] and [[Pressburg]].  In the latter 1860s, they lived together in reduced circumstances after the death of Charles's wife and continued to occupy themselves with research, being famous figures in the British Library, using pens embellished with gold coronets, and wearing Highland dress or military tunics. Only after death did they return to Scotland, to be buried in Eskdale.

==Family: truth and fiction==
[[File:Chînm'tchiéthe Catholique, Saint Martîn, Jèrri 1.jpg|thumb|The gravestone of Charles Edward Louis Casimir Stuart and Lady Alice Hay shows the pretended title of ''Comte d'Albanie'']]
John and Charles were the sons of Naval Officer Thomas Hay Allen and his wife Catherine, daughter of the clergyman and [[antiquary]] [[Owen Manning]] who was vicar of [[Godalming]] for many years.  Thomas and Catherine also had a daughter Matilda.  John, Charles and Matilda were all born in Wales, and after the early death of their mother, Thomas remarried Ann Salmon and had five further children, many of whom took assumed names.  After this date Thomas is a shady and elusive character.  He may have invested poorly and have been plagued by debts, which would explain his living abroad and using an assumed name. He died in 1852 in [[Clerkenwell]], which at the time was well known for its printing industry.

John married the heiress Georgiana Kendall in 1845 but had no children. Charles married Anna Beresford (daughter of [[John Beresford (statesman)|John Beresford]]) in 1822 and had three daughters and a son, named Charles Edward Louis Casimir Stuart (1824–82). This son, the first to be christened a Stuart, married Lady Alice Hay (daughter of [[William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll]] by his wife [[Elizabeth Hay, Countess of Erroll|Elizabeth]], daughter of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]), but they had no children.  Two of his sisters died without issue, one becoming a nun.  His sister Louisa Sobieska (c. 1827–97) had a son with her husband Edouard von Platt who served in the Austrian imperial bodyguard.  There is no-one who could continue the "Stuart" brothers' claims to royal ancestry through the direct male line, although descendants remain.{{Sfn | Reynolds}}

The Allen/Stuart brothers implied that their grandfather, Admiral John Carter Allen, was merely foster father to Thomas, whose "true" father was Charles Edward Stuart, or [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]].

Sobieski is the surname of [[John III Sobieski]], the Polish king of the [[Sobieski family]], whose granddaughter Clementina ([[Maria Klementyna Sobieska]]) married a Stuart: the "Old Pretender", Prince [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Francis Edward]]. Their eldest son was [[Charles Edward Stuart]], the "Young Pretender", and the Allen brothers claimed him as their "true" grandfather.

John also called himself John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart. [[Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern]] was married to Bonnie Prince Charlie and is sometimes called the Countess of Albany. John, and others in the family, started to use the title Count d'Albanie, which "passed" to Charles on John's death at 52 Stanley Street (now Alderney Street), Pimlico, London in 1872. Charles died on board a steamer on a trip to France in 1880.  His son inherited the title and is buried as the Count d'Albanie.

There is a newspaper marriage notice which indicates that Charles Edward d' Albanie, son of Charles Edward Stuart, married Anna Beresford, who was the daughter of John De La Poer Beresford. The record indicates that this event occurred at Liverpool St Catherine, [[Liverpool]] on 25 May 1874.&lt;ref&gt;"British Newspaper Archive, Family Notices," database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QLSW-GYSV : 18 March 2018), Charles Edward Stuart in entry for Charles Edward D'Albanie and Anna Beresford, Liverpool St Catherine, Liverpool, Lancashire, England, United Kingdom; records extracted FamilySearch and images digitized by FindMyPast; citing Liverpool St Catherine, Liverpool, Lancashire, England, United Kingdom, 25 May 1874, The British Newspaper Archive, Ireland; FHL microfilm .&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Syrian Civil War infobox}}
The '''Syrian Civil War''' ({{lang-ar|الحرب الأهلية السورية}}, ''al-ḥarb al-ʾahlīyah as-sūrīyah'') is an ongoing multi-sided [[War|armed conflict]] in Syria fought between the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Ba'athist]] [[Syrian Arab Republic]] led by President [[Bashar al-Assad]], along with its allies, and various forces opposing both the government and each other in varying combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/syria-civil-war-explained-160505084119966.html |title=Syria's civil war explained from the beginning |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unrest in Syria, part of a wider wave of the 2011 [[Arab Spring]] protests, grew out of discontent with the Assad government and escalated to an armed conflict after protests calling for his removal were violently suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26116868 |title=Syria: The story of the conflict |date=11 March 2016 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/world/middleeast/26syria.html|title=Syrian Troops Open Fire on Protestors in Several Cities|date=25 March 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war is being fought by several factions: the Syrian government and its international allies, a loose alliance of [[Sunni]] rebel groups (including the [[Free Syrian Army]]), the majority-Kurdish [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF), [[Salafi jihadist]] groups (including [[al-Nusra Front]]), and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), with a number of [[Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War|countries in the region and beyond being either directly involved]] or providing support to one or another faction.

Iran, Russia and [[Hezbollah]] support the Syrian government militarily, with Russia conducting [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|air operations]] since September 2015.

Syria became [[Syrian Republic (1946–63)|an independent republic]] in 1946 following [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|years of French rule]] after [[World War II]], although democratic rule ended with [[March 1949 Syrian coup d'état|a coup in March 1949]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}, followed by two more coups the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Douglas Little |year=1990 |title=Cold War and Covert Action: The United States and Syria, 1945–1958 |journal=Middle East Journal |volume=44 |issue=1 |jstor=4328056}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/issue51/articles/51_12-13.pdf |title=1949–1958, Syria: Early Experiments in Cover Action, Douglas Little, Professor, Department of History, Clark University |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular [[1954 Syrian coup d'état|uprising]] against military rule in 1954 saw the army transfer power to civilians. From 1958 to 1961, a [[United Arab Republic|brief union with Egypt]] replaced Syria's parliamentary system with a centralized [[Presidential system|presidential government]].&lt;ref name=bbcsyriaprofile&gt;{{cite news |title=Syria Profile |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703995 |accessdate=13 September 2013 |publisher=BBC |date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secular [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Syrian Regional Branch]] government came to power through [[1963 Syrian coup d'état|a successful coup d'état in 1963]].

In March 1971, [[Hafez al-Assad]], an [[Alawite]], declared himself [[President of Syria|President]], a position that he held until his death in 2000. Since 1970, the secular Syrian Regional Branch has remained the dominant political authority in what had been a [[one-party state]] until the first [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[Syrian parliamentary election, 2012|election]] to the [[People's Council of Syria]] was held in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/05/2012524113941282101.html |title=Assad says Syria 'able' to get out of crisis |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=25 May 2012 |accessdate=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 1973, Hafez al-Assad implemented a new constitution, which led to a national crisis. Unlike previous constitutions, this one did not require that the president of Syria be a [[Muslim]], leading to fierce demonstrations in [[Hama]], [[Homs]] and Aleppo organized by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the ''[[ulama]]''. They labelled Assad the "enemy of [[Allah]]" and called for a ''[[jihad]]'' against his rule.{{sfn|Alianak|2007|p=55}}{{citation not found}} The government survived a series of [[Islamist uprising in Syria|armed revolts]] by [[Islamist]]s, mainly members of the Muslim Brotherhood, from 1976 until 1982.

Upon Hafez al-Assad's death in 2000, his son [[Bashar al-Assad]] was elected as President of Syria. Bashar al-Assad and his wife [[Asma al-Assad|Asma]], a Sunni Muslim born and educated in Britain,&lt;ref name=rose&gt;{{cite news |last=Golovnina |first=Maria |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/19/us-syria-asma-idUSBRE82I0MB20120319 |title=Asma al Assad, a "desert rose" crushed by Syria's strife |agency=Reuters |date=19 March 2012 |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially inspired hopes for democratic reforms.

President Bashar Al-Assad maintains that no 'moderate opposition' to his rule exists, and that all opposition forces are jihadists intent on destroying his [[Secularity|secular leadership]]. In an April 2017 interview with Croatian newspaper [[Večernji list|Vecernji List]] he reasserted his view that terrorist groups operating in Syria are 'linked to the agendas of foreign countries'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://leakofnations.com/president-bashar-al-assad-interview-with-croatian-newspaper-vecernji-list-syrian-civil-war/ |title=President Bashar al-Assad interview with Croatian newspaper Vecernji List |website=''leakofnations.com'' |access-date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographics ===
[[Syrian people|Syrian Arabs]], together with some 600,000 [[Palestinians in Syria|Palestinian]] Arabs, make up roughly 74 percent of the population (if [[Terms for Syriac Christians#Aramean identity|Syriac Christians]] are excluded).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sy.html |title=Syria |year=2007 |work=[[The World Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Syria's Muslims are 74 percent [[Sunni]]s (including [[Sufi]]s), and 13 percent [[Shia]]s (including 8–12 percent [[Alawites]] from which about 2 percent are [[Mershdis]]), 3 percent are [[Druze]], while the remaining 10 percent are Christians. Not all of Syria's Sunnis are Arabs. The Assad family is mixed. Bashar is married to a Sunni, with whom he has several children. He is affiliated with the sect that his parents belong to: the minority Alawite sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heneghan |first=Tom |date=3 December 2011 |title=Syria's Alawites is a secretive, unorthodox sect |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/23/us-syria-religion-alawites-idUSTRE7BM1J220111223 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alawites control Syria's security apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/10/20111010122434671982.html |title=Assad's Alawites: The guardians of the throne |author=Nir Rosen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/syrias-alawites-the-people-behind-assad-1435166941 Syria's Alawites: The People Behind Assad] The Wall Street Journal, 25 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Syria's Christians belong to the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian churches]], such as the branches of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]], [[Assyrian Church of the East]], and [[Armenian Orthodox Church]], which have existed in the region since the first century AD.&lt;ref name=IRFR2006&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71432.htm |title=Syria |work=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Syrian Kurds]], an ethnic minority making up approximately 9 percent of the population, have endured ethnic discrimination and the denial of their cultural and linguistic rights, as well as the frequent denial of their citizenship, for the history of the Syrian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/07/syra-kurds-leader-idUSLDE73613X20110407 |title=Syria Kurd leader vows to keep up democracy struggle |agency=Reuters |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/27/report-12-killed-syrian-port-city |title=US will not intervene in Syria as it has in Libya, says Hillary Clinton |work=The Guardian |date=27 March 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkmen are estimated to be 3-5% of the population.

Other ethnic groups include [[Armenians in Syria|Armenians]], [[Circassians in Syria|Circassians]], [[Syrian Turkmen|Turkmens]], [[Greeks in Syria|Greeks]], [[Mhallami]], [[Kawliya]], [[Yezidi]], [[Shabaks]], and [[Mandeans]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, David J.

=== Socioeconomic background ===
Socioeconomic inequality increased significantly after [[free market]] policies were initiated by Hafez al-Assad in his later years, and it accelerated after Bashar al-Assad came to power. With an emphasis on the [[service sector]], these policies benefited a minority of the nation's population, mostly people who had connections with the government, and members of the Sunni merchant class of Damascus and Aleppo.&lt;ref name="Poor rural rebels" /&gt; In 2010, Syria's nominal GDP per capita was only $2,834, comparable to Sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria and far lower than its neighbors such as Lebanon, with an annual growth rate of 3.39%, below most other developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/syria/gdp-per-capita CEIC Data].&lt;/ref&gt;

The country also faced particularly high youth unemployment rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/youth-exclusion-in-syria-economic/ |title=Youth Exclusion in Syria: Social, Economic, and Institutional Dimensions |publisher=Journalist's Resource |accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the war, discontent against the government was strongest in Syria's poor areas, predominantly among conservative Sunnis.&lt;ref name="Poor rural rebels"&gt;{{cite news |title=Rebels in Syria's largest city of Aleppo mostly poor, pious and from rural backgrounds |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/16/rebels-in-syria-largest-city-aleppo-mostly-poor-pious-and-from-rural/ |accessdate=28 January 2013 |publisher=Fox News Channel |agency=Associated Press |date=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included cities with high poverty rates, such as [[Daraa]] and [[Homs]], and the poorer districts of large cities.

=== Drought ===
This coincided with the most intense drought ever recorded in Syria, which lasted from 2006 to 2011 and resulted in widespread crop failure, an increase in food prices and a mass migration of farming families to urban centers.&lt;ref name="Kelley drought 2015"&gt;Kelley, C. P., Mohtadi, S., Cane, M. A., Seager, R., &amp; Kushnir, Y. (2015).  Syria had also received in the same period around 1.5&amp;nbsp;million refugees from Iraq.  By 2011, Syria was facing steep rises in the prices of commodities and a clear deterioration in the national standard of living.&lt;/ref&gt; This migration strained infrastructure already burdened by the influx of some 1.5 million refugees from the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/science/earth/study-links-syria-conflict-to-drought-caused-by-climate-change.html |title=Researchers Link Syrian Conflict to a Drought Made Worse by Climate Change |last=Fountain |first=Henry |date=2 March 2015 |work=The New York Times|access-date=1 May 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drought has been linked to [[anthropogenic global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241 |title=Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought |date=17 March 2015 |website=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://climateandsecurity.org/2012/02/29/syria-climate-change-drought-and-social-unrest/ |title=Syria: Climate Change, Drought and Social Unrest |date=29 February 2012 |website=The Center for Climate &amp; Security|access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleick|first=Peter H.|date=2014-07-01|title=Water, Drought, Climate Change, and Conflict in Syria|url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/WCAS-D-13-00059.1|journal=Weather, Climate, and Society|volume=6|issue=3|pages=331–340|doi=10.1175/wcas-d-13-00059.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adequate water supply continues to be an issue in the ongoing civil war and it is frequently the target of military action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19533112 |title=Aleppo water supply cut as Syria fighting rages |date=8 September 2012 |work=BBC News|access-date=1 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human rights ===
{{Main|Human rights in Syria|Human rights violations during the Syrian Civil War}}

The human rights situation in Syria has long been the subject of harsh critique from global organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2010 "World Report 2010 Human Rights Watch World Report 2010"], p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite hopes for democratic change with the 2000 [[Damascus Spring]], Bashar al-Assad was widely regarded as having failed to implement any improvements. A [[Human Rights Watch]] report issued just before the beginning of the 2011 uprising stated that he had failed to substantially improve the state of human rights since taking power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/16/syrian-human-rights-unchanged-assad |work=The Guardian |first=Ian |last=Black |title=Syrian human rights record unchanged under Assad, report says |date=16 July 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 about 12 million have left their homes in Syria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/06/no-one-can-stop-the-coming-bloodbath-in-idlib|title=No one can stop the coming bloodbath in Idlib|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and about half a million have died.

After 8 April, the emphasis in demonstration slogans shifted slowly towards demanding Assad's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/8574780/content/65292887-syria-s-president-bashar-al-assad-meets-danish-foreign-minister-lene-espersen-in-damascus | title = The Assad Poison | publisher = AllVoices | date=24 March 2011 |first= Saad |last= Zafar | accessdate=20 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511184554/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/8574780/content/65292887-syria-s-president-bashar-al-assad-meets-danish-foreign-minister-lene-espersen-in-damascus|archivedate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/18/bashar-assad-resignation-syria-protest_n_850657.html|title=Bashar Assad Resignation Called For By Syria Sit-In Activists|last=Mroue|first=Bassem|date=2011-06-18|website=The Huffington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231305/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/18/bashar-assad-resignation-syria-protest_n_850657.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests spread.

=== Early armed insurgency (July 2011 – April 2012) ===
{{Main|Early insurgency phase of the Syrian Civil War}}
{{See also|List of Syrian defectors}}
The [[early insurgency phase of the Syrian Civil War]] lasted from late July 2011 to April 2012, and was associated with the rise of armed oppositional militias across Syria and the beginning of armed rebellion against the authorities of the Syrian Arab Republic. The beginning of the insurgency is typically marked by formation of the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) on 29 July 2011, when a group of defected officers declared the establishment of the first organized oppositional military force. Composed of defected Syrian Armed Forces personnel, the rebel army aimed to remove Bashar al-Assad and his government from power.

This period of the war saw the initial civil uprising take on many of the characteristics of a civil war, according to several outside observers, including the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], as [[Free Syrian Army|armed elements]] became better organized and began carrying out successful attacks in retaliation for the crackdown by the Syrian government on demonstrators and defectors.&lt;ref name="nowin"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45514855/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/un-syria-now-civil-war/ |title=UN: Syria now in a civil war |publisher=MSNBC |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arab League]] [[Arab League monitors in Syria|monitoring mission]], initiated in December 2011, ended in failure by February 2012, as Syrian troops and [[Free Syrian Army|oppositional militants]] continued to do battle across the country and the [[Council of Ministers (Syria)|Syrian government]] prevented foreign observers from touring active battlefields, including besieged [[Syrian opposition|oppositional]] strongholds.

In early 2012, [[Kofi Annan]] acted as the UN–[[Arab League]] [[Special Envoy of the Secretary-General|Joint Special Representative for]] Syria. His peace plan provided for a ceasefire, but even as the negotiations for it were being conducted, the rebels and the Syrian army continued fighting even after the peace plan.&lt;ref name="deadly reprisals"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Deadly Reprisals: deliberate killings and other abuses by Syria's armed forces |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/041/2012/en/ |publisher=Amnesty International |date=June 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11|date=December 2012}} The United Nations-backed [[Kofi Annan Syrian peace plan|ceasefire]] was brokered by special envoy [[Kofi Annan]] and declared in mid-April 2012.

=== Ceasefire and escalation (April 2012 – December 2013) ===
{{Main|Siege of Eastern Ghouta}}
[[File:Blown out tank Aleppo.jpg|thumb|A destroyed tank on a road in Aleppo, October 2012]]
The [[2012–13 escalation of the Syrian Civil War]] was the third phase of the Syrian Civil War, which gradually evolved from U.N.-mediated cease fire attempt during April–May 2012, deteriorating into radical violence in June, escalating the conflict level to a full-fledged civil war.

Following the [[Houla massacre]] of 25 May 2012, in which 108 people were summarily executed, and the subsequent FSA ultimatum to the Syrian government, the ceasefire practically collapsed, as the FSA began nationwide offensives against government troops. On 1 June 2012, President Assad vowed to crush the anti-government uprising.&lt;ref name=aa0406&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/06/04/218430.html |title=Deadly violence flares in Syria as EU-Russia seek solutions |publisher=Al Arabiya |date=4 June 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705033042/http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/06/04/218430.html |archive-date=5 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 June 2012, the UN for the first time officially proclaimed Syria to be in a state of civil war.&lt;ref name=bbc12-6-12&gt;{{cite news |title=Syria in civil war, says UN official Herve Ladsous |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18417952 |work=BBC News|date=12 June 2012 |accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict began moving into the two largest cities, Damascus and Aleppo.

Following October 2012 cease-fire failure, during winter of 2012–13 and early spring of 2013, the rebels continued advances on all fronts. In mid-December 2012, American officials said that the Syrian military began firing [[Scud]] ballistic missiles at rebel fighters inside Syria. On 11 January 2013, Islamist groups, including al-Nusra Front, took full control of the [[Taftanaz]] air base in the Idlib Governorate, after weeks of fighting. In mid-January 2013, as clashes re-erupted between rebels and Kurdish forces in Ras al-Ayn, YPG forces moved to expel government forces from oil-rich areas in Hassakeh Province.&lt;ref name="main opposition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/5666.html |title=Kurdish Forces Clash with Main Syrian Opposition in Syria, Reports Say |last=van Wilgenburg |first=Wladimir |date=17 January 2013 |publisher=Rudaw |accessdate=4 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118175834/http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/5666.html |archivedate=18 January 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 6 March 2013, the rebels had captured the city of Raqqa, effectively making it the first provincial capital to be lost by the Assad government.

The advances of rebels were finally arrested in April 2013, as Syrian Arab Army could reorganize and initiate offensives. On 17 April 2013, government forces breached a six-month rebel blockade in Wadi al-Deif, near Idlib. Heavy fighting was reported around the town of Babuleen after government troops attempt to secure control of a main highway leading to Aleppo. The break in the siege also allowed government forces to resupply two major military bases in the region which had been relying on sporadic airdrops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jafrianews.com/2013/04/17/syrian-forces-loyal-to-asaad-break-rebel-blockade-in-north-syria/ |title=Syrian forces Loyal to Asaad break Rebel Blockade in North Syria |publisher=Jafria News |date=17 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103000045/http://jafrianews.com/2013/04/17/syrian-forces-loyal-to-asaad-break-rebel-blockade-in-north-syria/ |archivedate=3 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, government and [[Hezbollah]] forces, who have increasingly become involved in the fighting, launched [[Al-Qusayr offensive|an offensive]] to capture areas near al-Qusayr. On 21 April, pro-Assad forces captured the towns of Burhaniya, Saqraja and al-Radwaniya near the Lebanese border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/04/21/Syria-army-closes-in-on-Quasar-near-Lebanon-.html |title=Syria army closes in on Qusayr near Lebanon |publisher=Al Arabiya Network |date=21 April 2013 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |last=Yacoub |first=Khaled |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/21/us-syria-crisis-lebanon-idUSBRE93K0DN20130421 |title=Syria fighting flares both sides of Lebanese border |agency=Reuters |date=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Syria- two years of tragedy (8642756918).jpg|thumb|Aleppo, Karm al Jabal neighborhood, March 2013]]
From July 2013, however the situation became a stalemate, with fighting continuing on all fronts between various factions with numerous casualties, but without major territorial changes. On 28 June 2013, rebel forces captured a major military checkpoint in the city of Daraa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syrian army, backed by jets, launches assault on Homs |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/syrian-army-backed-by-jets-launches-assault-on-homs-1.532668 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Syrian opposition factions declared war on the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] which turned increasingly dominant throughout the war zone with indiscriminate killing of all – whether loyalist Assad or rebels. A major advance took place on 6 August 2013, as rebels captured [[Menagh Military Airbase]] after a 10-month siege. On 21 August [[2013 Ghouta attacks|a chemical attack]] took place in the Ghouta region of the Damascus countryside, leading to thousands of casualties and several hundred dead in the opposition-held stronghold. The attack was followed by a military offensive by government forces into the area, which had been hotbeds of the opposition.&lt;ref name="SyriaOffensive"&gt;{{cite news |work=The Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324619504579028621159392790 |author1=Sam Dagher |author2=Farnaz Fassihi |title=Syria Presses Offensive, Shrugs Off Gas Attack Claims |date=22 August 2013 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack, largely attributed to Assad forces caused the international community to seek disarmanent of the Syrian Arab Army from chemical weapons.

In late 2013, the period was marked by increased initiative of the Syrian Arab Army, which led offensives against opposition fighters on several fronts. The Syrian Arab Army along with its allies, Hezbollah and the [[Liwa Abu al-Fadhal al-Abbas|al-Abas brigade]], launched an offensive on Damascus and Aleppo in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Reuters |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/boosted-by-foreign-shiite-militia-assads-forces-advance-on-aleppo/1788908.html |title=Boosted by Foreign Shi'ite Militia, Assad's Forces Advance on Aleppo |publisher=Voice of America}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24927097 |title=Syria rebels urge Aleppo mobilisation to halt assault |publisher=BBC |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting between Kurdish forces, rebels and al-Nusra front continued in other locations.

=== SDF advances and Turkish military intervention (August–October 2016) ===
On 12 August 2016, the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] fully [[Manbij offensive|captured]] [[Manbij]] from ISIL. Some days later, the SDF announced a new offensive towards [[Al-Bab]], which could eventually connect the Kurdish regions in Northern Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://syriancivilwarmap.com/ |title=Syrian Civil War Map / Live Map of the Syrian Civil War |website=Syrian Civil War Map|access-date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days after, the [[Battle of al-Hasakah (2016)|battle of al-Hasakah]] began. On 22 August, the Kurdish YPG, having captured Ghwairan, the only major Arab neighborhood in Hasaka that had been in government hands, launched a major assault to seize the last government-controlled areas of the northeastern Syrian city of Hasaka, after a Russian mediation team failed to mend the rift between the two sides;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/syria-ypg-launches-assault-hasaka-160822041843880.html |title=Syria: YPG launches assault to take all of Hasaka |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the next day the capture of the city was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perry |first1=Tom |first2=Rodi |last2=Said |title=Syria Kurds win battle with government, Turkey mobilises against them |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/mideast-crisis-syria-kurds-idINKCN10Y12O |agency=Reuters India |accessdate=8 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days prior, the Pentagon admonished the Syrian government against "interfering with coalition forces or our partners" in that region, adding that the U.S. had the right to defend its troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ali |first1=Idrees |title=Coalition jets scrambled to defend U.S. forces from Syrian bombing |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-usa-aircraft-idUKKCN10U1OS?il=0 |agency=Reuters UK |accessdate=8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 2016, Turkey's armed forces invaded Syria in the [[Jarabulus]] area controlled by ISIL starting what the Turkish president called [[Battle of Jarabulus (2016)|Operation Euphrates Shield]], aimed against, according to his statement, both the IS and Kurdish "terror groups that threaten our country in northern Syria".&lt;ref name="tanksroll"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20160824-erdogan-says-syria-operation-aimed-jihadists-kurdish-pyd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825183523/http://www.france24.com/en/20160824-erdogan-says-syria-operation-aimed-jihadists-kurdish-pyd|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 August 2016 |title=Erdogan says Syria operation aimed at IS jihadists, Kurdish PYD |date=24 August 2016 |publisher=France 24}}&lt;br /&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37171995 Syria Jarablus: Turkish tanks roll into northern Syria] BBC. 24 August 2016.&lt;br /&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/24/turkey-launches-major-operation-against-isis-in-key-border-town Turkey sends tanks into Syria in operation aimed at Isis and Kurds] The Guardian, 24 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian government denounced the intervention as a "blatant violation of its sovereignty" and said that "fighting terrorism isn't done by ousting ISIS and replacing it with other terrorist organizations backed directly by Turkey".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sana.sy/en/?p=86277 Syria condemns Turkey’s breach of Syria’s sovereignty in Jarablos] Sana, 24 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The PYD leader [[Salih Muslim Muhammad|Salih Muslim]] said that Turkey was now in the "Syrian quagmire" and would be defeated like IS.&lt;ref name="tanksroll" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-to-pyd-those-issuing-threats-should-think-what-will-happen.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=103176&amp;NewsCatID=352 |title=Erdoğan to PYD: Those issuing threats should think about what will happen |work=Hürriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in Ankara the same day, US vice president [[Joe Biden]] indirectly endorsed Turkey's move and said that the U.S. had made it clear to the Syrian Kurdish forces that they should move back east across the Euphrates, or lose US support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/974651/middle-east |title=Biden orders Syrian Kurds to pull back; Assad govt slams Turkish incursion |date=24 August 2016 |publisher=arabnews.com}}&lt;br /&gt;[https://ria.ru/syria/20160824/1475162680.html Байден назвал условия, при которых США будут поддерживать курдов] [[RIA Novosti]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As Turkish troops and the Turkish-aligned Syrian rebels took control of Jarablus and moved further south towards the Syrian town of Manbij, they clashed with the Kurdish YPG, which led the U.S. officials to voice concern and issue a warning to both sides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-idUSKCN11305C Turkish forces deepen push into Syria, draw U.S. rebuke over their target] Reuters, 29 August 2016.&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/turkish-backed-syrian-rebels-advance-manbij-160829154225197.html |title=Turkish-backed Syrian rebels advance towards Manbij |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 August, U.S. Defense Secretary [[Ash Carter]] specified that the U.S. did not support Turkey's advance south of Jarablus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/a/us-condemns-clashes-between-turkish-and-allied-kurdish-forces/3484741.html |title=Carter Calls on Turkey to 'Stay Focused' on Islamic State |first=Carla |last=Babb |publisher=VoA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warning as well as an announcement made by the U.S. of a tentative ceasefire between the Turkish forces and the Kurds in the area of Jarablus were promptly and angrily dismissed by Turkey's officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2016/08/30/us-comments-about-turkeys-targets-in-syria-unacceptable-says-turkish-mfa |title=US' comments about Turkey's targets in Syria unacceptable, says Turkish MFA |work=Daily Sabah |date=30 August 2016 |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37231760 |title=Syria war: Turkey hits out at US over Kurds comments |publisher=BBC |date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, combat between the Turkish forces and the SDF died down, and instead Turkish forces moved West to confront IS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turkey pushes west in Syrian offensive |url=http://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/turkey-pushes-west-in-syrian-offensive/news-story/562f05093dd0dad72e6a2d4c7b09c597 |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |accessdate=8 January 2017 |date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime the SDF, including Western volunteers, continued to reinforce Manbij.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-city-idUSKCN1140EU |title=Syrian Kurdish spokesman says Manbij reinforced, but not by YPG |date=29 August 2016 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceasefire came into effect at 00:00 Syrian time (02:00 UTC) on 30 December. It does not include UN-designated terrorist groups, such as ISIL and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Syrian High Negotiations Committee representatives in Turkey confirmed that they were involved in the deal.

They said that although the government had initiated a program of rationing, they were concerned that safe water may not be accessible to everyone and called on parties to reach peaceful agreements to guarantee basic services.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

On 2 January 2017, rebel groups said that they would disengage from planned talks after alleged ceasefire violations by Government forces in the Wadi [[Barada]] valley near Damascus. The government says the region is excluded from the ceasefire because of the presence of Fatah al-Sham, but some local activists deny that they have a presence there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apnews.com/0f807697edfb426198bc347ff63b86d2/Syria-rebels-suspend-talks-over-alleged-truce-violations |title=Syria rebels suspend talks over alleged truce violations |last=Zeina |first=Karam |date=3 January 2017 |agency=Associated Press|access-date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of January, government forces managed to [[Siege of Wadi Barada|capture Wadi Barada]] and the water supply of Damascus was restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=59940 |title=The Syrian flag is raised in Al-Feja Spring |work=SOHR |date=28 January 2017 |accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AZcaptureWadi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/syrian-army-captures-wadi-barada-170129131830656.html |title=Syrian army captures Wadi Barada |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=29 January 2017 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March, Syrian military fired S-200 missiles at Israeli jets over Golan Heights. The Israeli military claimed that the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow]] anti-ballistic system intercepted one missile, while the Syrian military claimed that they had downed an Israeli jet.

The Syrian Arab Army entered Dayr Hafir, the last stronghold held by the Islamic State in East Aleppo, on 23 March, and secured it by 23 March. This opened up an opportunity to push south into the Ar-Raqqa governate where the Islamic State's de facto capital resides; however on 23 March, a Syrian Democratic Forces contingent landed on a peninsula west of Raqqa via boats and helicopters, in an effort to cut off the Syrian Arab Army from entering the Islamic State's de facto capital, Raqqa. On 28 March, an agreement was reportedly brokered by Qatar and Iran for the evacuation for four besieged towns in Syria, where around 60,000 people live. The deal involved evacuating the residents of [[al-Fu'ah]] and [[Kafriya]], two towns in the Idlib Governorate besieged by rebel forces, in exchange for the evacuation of residents and rebels in [[Zabadani]] and [[Madaya, Syria|Madaya]], two towns under siege by government forces in the Rif Dimashq Governorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39426162 |title=Syria conflict: 'Deal reached' for four besieged areas |work=BBC News|date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical weapons ===

{{See also|Syria chemical weapons program|Destruction of Syria's chemical weapons}}
[[Sarin]], [[mustard agent]] and [[Chlorine#Use as a weapon|chlorine gas]] have been used during the conflict. Numerous casualties led to an international reaction, especially the [[2013 Ghouta attacks]]. [[United Nations Mission to Investigate Alleged Uses of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic|A UN fact-finding mission]] was requested to investigate alleged chemical weapons attacks. In four cases the UN inspectors confirmed use of [[sarin]] gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About Sarin |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/basics/facts.asp|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, a confidential report by the United Nations and the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]] explicitly blamed the Syrian military of [[Bashar al-Assad]] for dropping chemical weapons (chlorine bombs) on the towns of Talmenes in April 2014 and Sarmin in March 2015 and [[ISIS]] for using sulfur mustard on the town of Marea in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/world/middleeast/syria-used-chlorine-in-bombs-against-civilians-report-says.html Syria Used Chlorine in Bombs Against Civilians, Report Says], ''The New York Times'', Rick Gladstone, 24 August 2016. Retrieved 25 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and the European Union have accused the Syrian government of conducting several chemical attacks. Following the 2013 Ghouta attacks and international pressure, the [[destruction of Syria's chemical weapons]] began. In 2015 the UN mission disclosed previously undeclared traces of sarin compounds in a "military research site".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11594763/UN-inspectors-find-undeclared-sarin-linked-chemicals-at-Syrian-military-site.html |title=UN inspectors find undeclared sarin-linked chemicals at Syrian military site |work=The Telegraph |date=9 May 2015 |accessdate=9 May 2015 |author=Louisa Loveluck |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the April 2017 [[Khan Shaykhun chemical attack]], the United States launched its first attack against Syrian government forces.

=== Cluster bombs ===
Syria is not parties to the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]] and does not recognize the ban on the use of [[cluster bomb]]s. The Syrian Army is alleged to have begun using cluster bombs in September 2012. Steve Goose, director of the Arms Division at [[Human Rights Watch]] said "Syria is expanding its relentless use of cluster munitions, a banned weapon, and civilians are paying the price with their lives and limbs", "The initial toll is only the beginning because cluster munitions often leave unexploded bomblets that kill and maim long afterward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/16/syria-mounting-casualties-cluster-munitions |title=Syria: Mounting Casualties from Cluster Munitions |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermobaric weapons ===
Russian [[thermobaric weapon]]s, also known as "fuel-air bombs", have been used by the government side during the war. On 2 December 2015, ''[[The National Interest]]'' reported that Russia was deploying the [[TOS-1]] Buratino multiple rocket launch system to Syria, which is "designed to launch massive thermobaric charges against infantry in confined spaces such as urban areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/russias-lethal-thermobaric-rocket-launchers-coming-syria-14493|title=Russia's Lethal Thermobaric Rocket Launchers: A Game Changer in Syria?|work=The National Interest}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[TOS-1|Buratino thermobaric rocket launcher]] "can obliterate a roughly {{convert|200|by|400|m|ft|abbr=off}} area with a single salvo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/russias-lethal-thermobaric-rocket-launchers-coming-syria-14493|title=Russia's Lethal Thermobaric Rocket Launchers: A Game Changer in Syria?|author=Dave Majumdar|date=2 December 2015|work=The National Interest|accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, rebels have said that the Syrian Air Force (government forces) is using thermobaric weapons against residential areas occupied by the rebel fighters, such as during the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–13)|Battle of Aleppo]] and also in [[Kafr Batna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4266902,00.html Syria rebels say Assad using 'mass-killing weapons' in Aleppo – Israel News, Ynetnews].

Before the uprising and war broke out, the Syrian Armed Forces were estimated at 325,000 regular troops and 280,000–300,000 reservists.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Of the regular troops, 220,000 were 'army troops' and the rest in the navy, air force and air defense force. Following defections as early as June 2011, the [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] estimated that by July 2012, tens of thousands of soldiers had defected, and a Turkish official estimated 60,000.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The ''Shabiha'' are unofficial pro-government militias drawn largely from Syria's [[Alawite]] minority group.

Formed on 23 August 2011, the National Council is a coalition of anti-government groups, based in Turkey. The National Council seeks the end of Bashar al-Assad's rule and the establishment of a modern, civil, democratic state. SNC has links with the [[Free Syrian Army]]. On 11 November 2012 in Doha, the National Council and other opposition groups united as the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]].&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/11/11/syrian-opposition-deal/1697693/ |title=Syrian opposition groups reach unity deal |work=USA Today |date=11 November 2012 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SNC has 22 out of 60 seats of the Syrian National Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syrian opposition groups reach unity deal |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/11/11/syrian-opposition-deal/1697693/ |newspaper=USA Today |date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, it was recognized as the legitimate government of Syria by numerous [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]] states.

The formation of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) was announced on 29 July 2011 by a group of defecting [[Syrian Army]] officers, encouraging others to defect in order to defend civilian protesters from violence by the state and effect government change.&lt;ref name=worldtribune1&gt;{{cite news |work=The World Tribune |url=http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2011/me_syria0973_08_03.asp |title=Defecting troops form 'Free Syrian Army', target Assad security forces |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127210252/http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2011/me_syria0973_08_03.asp |archivedate=27 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2011, estimates of the number of defectors to the FSA ranged from 1,000 to over 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blomfield |first=Adam |title=Syrian rebels strike heart of Damascus |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/8902832/Syrian-rebels-strike-heart-of-Damascus.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=21 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSA, initially "headquartered" in Turkey, moved its headquarters to northern Syria in September 2012, and functions more as an umbrella organization than a traditional military chain of command.

In March 2012, two reporters of ''The New York Times'' witnessed an FSA attack and learned that the FSA had a stock of able, trained soldiers and ex-officers, organized to some extent, but without the weapons to put up a realistic fight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/world/middleeast/bearing-witness-in-syria-a-war-reporters-last-days.html Bearing Witness in Syria: A Correspondent's Last Days (page 1)], ''The New York Times'' (3 March 2012); [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/world/middleeast/bearing-witness-in-syria-a-war-reporters-last-days.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0 "Bearing Witness in Syria", page 2], ''New York Times'', 3 March 2012; [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/world/middleeast/bearing-witness-in-syria-a-war-reporters-last-days.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=0 "Bearing Witness in Syria", page 3], [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/world/middleeast/bearing-witness-in-syria-a-war-reporters-last-days.html?pagewanted=4&amp;_r=0 "Bearing Witness in Syria", page 4].

In April 2013, the US announced it would transfer $123&amp;nbsp;million in nonlethal aid to Syrian rebels through defected general [[Salim Idriss]], leader of the FSA,&lt;ref name="McClatchySalimIdriss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/05/07/190602/syrian-rebel-leader-salim-idriss.html |title=Syrian rebel leader Salim Idriss admits difficulty of unifying fighters |agency=McClatchyDC |accessdate=19 September 2014 |date=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who later acknowledged "the rebels" were badly fragmented and lacked military skill. Idriss said he was working on a countrywide command structure, but that a lack of material support was hurting that effort. "Now it is very important for them to be unified. But unifying them in a manner to work like a regular army is still difficult", Idriss said. He acknowledged common operations with Islamist group [[Ahrar ash-Sham]] but denied any cooperation with Islamist group [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref name="McClatchySalimIdriss" /&gt;

Abu Yusaf, a commander of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] (IS), said in August 2014 that many of the FSA members who had been trained by United States' and Turkish and Arab military officers were actually joining IS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/08/18/the-terrorists-fighting-us-now-we-just-finished-training-them/ |title=The terrorists fighting us now?

In October 2015, shortly after the start of Russia's military intervention in Syria, a senior ex-US official was paraphrased as saying "the 'moderates' had collapsed long ago" in a piece by [[Robert Fisk]], who added that many fighters had defected to other rebel groups,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/syria-s-moderates-have-disappeared-and-there-are-no-good-guys-a6679406.html Syria’s ‘moderates’ have disappeared... and there are no good guys] ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; while Russia's foreign minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] called the FSA "an already phantom structure",&lt;ref name="doesnot4"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/news/317655-moscow-contacts-free-syrian-army/ |title=Moscow ready for contact with Free Syrian Army – FM Lavrov |publisher=RT News |accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later proclaimed that Russia was ready to aid the FSA with airstrikes against ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34627441 |title=Syria war: Russia 'is ready to assist FSA rebels' |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in December 2015, according to the American [[Institute for the Study of War]], groups that identify as FSA were still present around Aleppo and Hama [[Southern Front (Syrian rebel group)|and in southern Syria]], and the FSA was still "the biggest and most secular of the rebel groups."&lt;ref name="ISWDec2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/12/free-syrian-army-morale-russia-strikes.html|title=Can FSA get back on its feet after Russian intervention?|last=Alami|first=Mona|date=31 December 2015|publisher=Al-Monitor ([[Institute for the Study of War]])|accessdate=27 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084956/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/12/free-syrian-army-morale-russia-strikes.html|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2017, the [[Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army|FSA backed by Turkey]] finished clearing the Islamic State from the north of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/turkey-backed-rebels-enter-center-of-islamic-states-al-bab-strongholdin-syria/2017/02/23/e389a506-f9c3-11e6-9b3e-ed886f4f4825_story.html|title=Turkey-backed rebels seize Islamic State's al-Bab stronghold in Syria|date=23 February 2017|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=23 February 2017|first1=Louisa|last1=Loveluck|first2=Liz|last2=Sly}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, they turned to attempting to [[Turkish military operation in Afrin|take over Afrin canton from the YPG]].

In September 2013, leaders of 13 powerful salafist brigades rejected the Syrian National Coalition and called Sharia law "the sole source of legislation". In a statement they declared that "the coalition and the putative government headed by Ahmad Tomeh does not represent or recognize us". Among the signatory rebel groups were [[al-Nusra Front]], [[Ahrar ash-Sham]] and [[Al-Tawheed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/25/world/meast/syria-rebels/index.html |title=Syrian rebels reject interim government, embrace Sharia |date=25 September 2013 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Syrian Democratic Council was established on 10 December 2015 in [[al-Malikiyah]]. It was co-founded by prominent human rights activist [[Haytham Manna]] and was intended as the political wing of the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]].

The [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF) are an alliance of mainly [[Syrian Kurds|Kurdish]] but also [[Syrian people|Arab]], [[Assyrians in Syria|Syriac-Assyrian]], and [[Syrian Turkmen|Turkmen]] militias with mainly left-wing and democratic confederalist political leanings. They are opposed to the Assad government, but have directed most of their efforts against [[Al-Nusra Front]] and [[ISIL]].

The group formed in December 2015, led primarily by the predominantly Kurdish [[People's Protection Units]] (YPG).

On 21 August 2014, two days after US photojournalist [[James Foley (photojournalist)|James Foley]] was beheaded, the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] admitted a covert rescue attempt involving dozens of [[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Special Operations forces]] had been made to rescue Americans and other foreigners held captive in Syria by ISIL militants. The rescue attempt is the first known US military ground action inside Syria. The resultant gunfight resulted in one US soldier being injured. The rescue was unsuccessful as the captives were not in the location targeted. On 11 September 2014 the US Congress expressed support to give President Obama the $500 million he wanted to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels. The question of whether the president has authority to continue airstrikes beyond the 60-day window granted by the War Powers Resolution remained unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sherfinski |first1=David |title=Both sides of Congress have own red lines for Obama's action in Syria |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/11/both-sides-of-congress-have-own-red-lines-for-obam/ |work=The Washington Times |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=December 2015}} On 12 September, US Secretary of State John Kerry met Turkish leaders to secure backing for US-led action against ISIL, but Ankara showed reluctance to play a frontline role.

The plans revealed in September also involve Iraq in targeting ISIL. US warplanes have launched 158 strikes in Iraq over the past five weeks while emphasizing a relatively narrow set of targets.

During the early period of the civil war, The [[Arab League]], [[European Union]], the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/03/2011318231622114396.html |title=UN chief slams Syria's crackdown on protests |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many Western governments quickly condemned the Syrian government's violent response to the protests, and expressed support for the protesters' right to exercise [[free speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/media/aff/news-communiques/2011/113.aspx?lang=eng |title=Minister Cannon Condemns Ongoing Violence in Yemen, Bahrain and Syria |publisher=Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada |date=21 March 2011 |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, many Middle Eastern governments expressed support for Assad, but as the death toll mounted, they switched to a more balanced approach by criticizing violence from both government and protesters. Both the Arab League and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] suspended Syria's membership. Russia and China vetoed Western-drafted [[United Nations Security Council]] resolutions in 2011 and 2012, which would have threatened the Syrian government with targeted sanctions if it continued military actions against protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15177114 |title=China and Russia veto UN resolution condemning Syria |publisher=BBC |date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humanitarian aid ===
{{Main|Humanitarian aid during the Syrian Civil War}}
The conflict holds the record for the largest sum ever requested by UN agencies for a single humanitarian emergency, $6.5 billon worth of requests of December 2013.&lt;ref name="RW aid record"&gt;{{cite web |title=UN launches biggest humanitarian appeal, fearing deepening of Syrian crisis |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/un-launches-biggest-humanitarian-appeal-fearing-deepening-syrian-crisis |website=[[ReliefWeb]] |date=16 December 2013 |accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty of delivering humanitarian aid to people is indicated by the statistics for January 2015: of the estimated 212,000 people during that month who were besieged by government or opposition forces, 304 were reached with food.&lt;ref name="UNNC 26Mar2015"&gt;{{cite web |title=Syria crisis 'worsening' amid humanitarian funding shortfall, warns top UN relief official |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50436 |publisher=UN News Centre |date=26 March 2015 |accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international humanitarian response to the conflict in Syria is coordinated by the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (UNOCHA) in accordance with [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution 46/182.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 182 session 46 ''Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian emergency assistance of the United Nations on 19 December 1991''&lt;/ref&gt; The primary framework for this coordination is the Syria Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan (SHARP) which appealed for US$1.41&amp;nbsp;billion to meet the humanitarian needs of Syrians affected by the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/revised-syria-humanitarian-assistance-response-plan-sharp-january United Nations, Syria Humanitarian Assistance Response Plan (SHARP)].

[[USAID]] and other government agencies in US delivered nearly $385&amp;nbsp;million of aid items to Syria in 2012 and 2013. The United States has provided food aid, medical supplies, emergency and basic health care, shelter materials, clean water, hygiene education and supplies, and other relief supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/responding-times-crisis/where-we-work/syria |title=USAID/SYRIA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502071344/http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/responding-times-crisis/where-we-work/syria |archivedate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic Relief]] has stocked 30 hospitals and sent hundreds of thousands of medical and food parcels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irusa.org/emergencies/syrian-humanitarian-relief/ |title=SYRIAN HUMANITARIAN RELIEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries in the region have also contributed various levels of aid. Iran has been exporting between 500 and 800 tonnes of flour daily to Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130303/iran-sending-tonnes-flour-daily-syria-report |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306012357/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130303/iran-sending-tonnes-flour-daily-syria-report |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 March 2013 |title=Iran sending tonnes of flour daily to Syria: report |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=3 March 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has provided treatment to 750 Syrians in a field hospital located in [[Golan Heights]].

The [[World Health Organization]] has reported that 35% of the country's hospitals are out of service. Fighting makes it impossible to undertake the normal vaccination programs. The displaced refugees may also pose a risk to countries to which they have fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22766084 |title=WHO warns of Syria disease threat |publisher=BBC |date=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 400,000 civilians are isolated by the fighting in eastern Ghouta, resulting in acutely malnourished children according to the United Nations Special Advisor, [[Jan Egeland]],  who urges the parties for medical evacuations. 55,000 civilians are also isolated in Berm where they have last seen humanitarian relief in the early summer.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations.

On 2 January 2013, the United Nations stated that 60,000 had been killed since the civil war began, with UN [[High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Navi Pillay]] saying "The number of casualties is much higher than we expected, and is truly shocking."&lt;ref name=deathtolljump&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/02/world/meast/syria-civil-war/index.html |title=U.N.'s Syria death toll jumps dramatically to 60,000-plus |date=3 January 2013 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, the UN's updated figure for the death toll had reached 80,000.&lt;ref name=UN80000Dead&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22886730 |title=Syria death toll at least 93,000, says UN |work=BBC News|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 June 2013, the UN released an updated figure of people killed since fighting began, the figure being exactly 92,901, for up to the end of April 2013. [[Navi Pillay]], UN high commissioner for human rights, stated that: "This is most likely a minimum casualty figure."

=== Disease ===
Formerly rare [[infectious disease]]s have spread in rebel-held areas brought on by poor [[sanitation]] and deteriorating living conditions. The diseases have primarily affected children. These include [[measles]], [[typhoid]], [[hepatitis]], [[dysentery]], [[tuberculosis]], [[diphtheria]], [[whooping cough]] and the disfiguring [[skin disease]] [[leishmaniasis]]. Of particular concern is the contagious and crippling [[Poliomyelitis]]. As of late 2013 doctors and international public health agencies have reported more than 90 cases. Critics of the government complain that, even before the uprising, it contributed to the spread of disease by purposefully restricting access to [[vaccination]], sanitation and access to hygienic water in "areas considered politically unsympathetic".&lt;ref name=Suppressed&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sparrow |first=Annie |title=Syria's Polio Epidemic: The Suppressed Truth |journal=New York Review |date=20 February 2014 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/feb/20/syrias-polio-epidemic-suppressed-truth/?insrc=hpma |accessdate=23 January 2014 |quote=Even before the uprising, in areas considered politically unsympathetic like Deir Ezzor, the government stopped maintaining sanitation and safe-water services, and began withholding routine immunizations for preventable childhood diseases.

=== Refugee migration ===
{{Main|Refugees of the Syrian Civil War}}

[[File:Syrian refugees in lebanon.jpg|thumb|Syrian refugees in Lebanon living in cramped quarters (6 August 2012)]]

The violence in Syria caused millions to flee their homes. As of March 2015, Al-Jazeera estimate 10.9&amp;nbsp;million Syrians, or almost half the population, have been displaced.&lt;ref name=aljazeera-3-17-2015 /&gt; 3.8&amp;nbsp;million have been made refugees.&lt;ref name=aljazeera-3-17-2015 /&gt; {{As of|2013}}, 1 in 3 of Syrian refugees (about 667,000 people) sought safety in Lebanon (normally 4.8&amp;nbsp;million population).&lt;ref name=NYT5Sep&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/world/middleeast/Syrian-Refugees-in-Lebanon.html Syrian Refugees in Lebanon]," ''The New York Times'', 5 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Others have fled to Jordan, Turkey, and Iraq. Turkey has accepted 1,700,000 (2015) Syrian refugees, half of whom are spread around cities and a dozen camps placed under the direct authority of the Turkish Government. Satellite images confirmed that the first Syrian camps appeared in Turkey in July 2011, shortly after the towns of Deraa, Homs, and Hama were besieged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrium-geo.com/en/4807-syrian-refugee-camps-in-turkish-territory-interactive-web-report |title=Syrian refugee camps in Turkish territory tracked by satellite |publisher=Astrium-geo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, the UN stated that the number of Syrian refugees had exceeded 3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/29/us-syria-crisis-refugees-idUSKBN0GT0AX20140829 |title=Syrian refugees top 3 million, half of all Syrians displaced: U.N. |agency=Reuters |accessdate=2 October 2014 |date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], Sunnis are leaving for Lebanon and undermining Hezbollah's status.

=== Human rights violations ===
{{Main|Human rights violations during the Syrian Civil War}}
[[File:Ghouta massacre1.JPG|thumb|Victims of the [[Ghouta chemical attack]]]]
According to various human rights organizations and United Nations, human rights violations have been committed by both the government and the rebels, with the "vast majority of the abuses having been committed by the Syrian government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130313/un-must-refer-syria-war-crimes-icc-amnesty |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816193917/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130313/un-must-refer-syria-war-crimes-icc-amnesty |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 August 2013 |title=UN must refer Syria war crimes to ICC: Amnesty |work=GlobalPost |accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to three international lawyers,&lt;ref&gt;Sir Desmond de Silva QC, former chief prosecutor of the special court for Sierra Leone, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, the former lead prosecutor of former Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević, and Professor David Crane, who indicted President Charles Taylor of Liberia at the Sierra Leone court&lt;/ref&gt; Syrian government officials could face war crimes charges in the light of a huge cache of evidence smuggled out of the country showing the "systematic killing" of about [[2014 Syrian detainee report|11,000 detainees]].

UN reported also that "[[siege]] warfare is employed in a context of egregious human rights and international humanitarian law violations. The warring parties do not fear being held accountable for their acts." Armed forces of both sides of the conflict blocked access of humanitarian convoys, confiscated food, cut off water supplies and targeted farmers working their fields.

ISIS forces have been accused by the UN of using public executions, amputations, and lashings in a campaign to instill fear. "Forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham have committed torture, murder, acts tantamount to enforced disappearance and forced displacement as part of attacks on the civilian population in Aleppo and Raqqa governorates, amounting to crimes against humanity", said the report from 27 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/27/syria-isis-war-crimes-united-nations-un |title=Syria and Isis committing war crimes, says UN |date=27 August 2014 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, [[Amnesty International]] published a report which accused the Syrian government of murdering an estimated 13,000 persons, mostly civilians, at the [[Sednaya Prison|Saydnaya military prison]]. They said the killings began in 2011 and were still ongoing. Amnesty International described this as a "policy of deliberate extermination" and also stated that "These practices, which amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, are authorised at the highest levels of the Syrian government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/syria-13000-secretly-hanged-saydnaya-military-prison-shocking-new-report |title=Syria: 13,000 secretly hanged in Saydnaya military prison – shocking new report |publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, the United States State Department stated a [[crematorium]] had been identified near the prison.

=== ISIL and al-Qaeda executions ===
On 19 August, American journalist [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]] was executed by ISIL, who claimed it was in retaliation for the United States operations in Iraq. Foley was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012 by [[Shabiha]] militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbur.org/2013/05/03/foley-family-syrian-prison |title=N.H.

=== Sectarian threats ===
{{Main|Sectarianism and minorities in the Syrian Civil War}}

[[File:Syria Ethno-religious composition..jpg|thumb|Map of Syria's ethno-religious composition in 1976]]

The successive governments of Hafez and Bashar al-Assad have been closely associated with the country's minority [[Alawite]] religious group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Syria: Sunnis Threatening to Massacre Minority Alawites |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/151013 |publisher=Arutz Sheva |date=23 December 2011 |accessdate=11 March 2011 |first=Elad |last=Behari}}&lt;/ref&gt; an offshoot of Shia, whereas the majority of the population, and most of the opposition, is [[Sunni]]. Alawites started to be threatened and attacked by dominantly Sunni rebel fighting groups like [[al-Nusra Front]] and the [[Free Syrian Army|FSA]] since December 2012 (see [[Sectarianism and minorities in the Syrian Civil War#Alawites]]).

A third of 250,000 Alawite men of military age have been killed fighting in the Syrian civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11518232/In-Syrias-war-Alawites-pay-heavy-price-for-loyalty-to-Bashar-al-Assad.html |title=In Syria's war, Alawites pay heavy price for loyalty to Bashar al-Assad |work=The Daily Telegraph |last=Sherlock |first=Ruth |date=7 April 2015 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights|SOHR]] stated that out of 94,000 killed during the war, at least 41,000 were Alawites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/14/us-syria-crisis-deaths-idUSBRE94D0L420130514 |title=Syria Death Toll Likely As High As 120,000, Group Says |agency=Reuters |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2013 |first=Mariam |last=Karouny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Christianity in Syria|Syrian Christians]] reported that they had fled after they were targeted by the anti-government rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/19/syria-s-christians-flee-kidnappings-rape-executions.html |title=Syria's Christians Flee Kidnappings, Rape, Executions |last=Dettmet |first=Jamie |date=19 November 2013 |work=The Daily Beast |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[Sectarianism and minorities in the Syrian Civil War#Christians]].)

Al Jazeera reported that "The [[Druze]] accuse rebels of committing atrocities against their community in Syria ... Syria's Druze minority has largely remained loyal to President Bashar al-Assad since the war began in 2011."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/druze-israel-syria-ambulance-attacked-150623010047887.html |title=Druze attack Israeli ambulance carrying wounded Syrians |date=23 June 2015 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As militias and non-Syrian Shia—motivated by pro-Shia sentiment rather than loyalty to the Assad government—have taken over fighting the opposition from the weakened Syrian Army, fighting has taken on a more sectarian nature. One opposition leader has alleged that the Shia militias often "try to occupy and control the religious symbols in the Sunni community to achieve not just a territorial victory but a sectarian one as well"&lt;ref name="nelson-defector"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nelson |first1=Lara |title=The Shia jihad and the death of Syria's army |url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/shia-jihad-and-death-syria-s-army-1508759016 |accessdate=11 October 2016 |agency=Middle East Eye |date=18 November 2015 |quote=Without the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Lebanese Hezbollah the army could not stand up.

Only two to three percent are regular Syrian soldiers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;—allegedly occupying mosques and replacing Sunni icons with pictures of Shia leaders.&lt;ref name="nelson-defector" /&gt;

According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights human rights abuses have been committed by the militias including "a series of sectarian massacres between March 2011 and January 2014 that left 962 civilians dead".&lt;ref name="nelson-defector" /&gt;

=== Crime wave ===
[[File:Aleppo hospital.PNG|thumb|right|Doctors and medical staff treating injured rebel fighters and civilians in Aleppo]]

As the conflict has expanded across Syria, many cities have been engulfed in a wave of crime as fighting caused the disintegration of much of the civilian state, and many police stations stopped functioning. Rates of theft increased, with criminals looting houses and stores. Rates of kidnappings increased as well. Rebel fighters were seen stealing cars and, in one instance, destroying a restaurant in Aleppo where Syrian soldiers had been seen eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cave |first=Damein |title=Crime Wave Engulfs Syria as Its Cities Reel From War |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/world/middleeast/crime-wave-engulfs-syria-as-its-cities-reel-from-war.html |accessdate=26 August 2012 |work=The New York Times |date=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2012, the human rights group [[Women Under Siege]] had documented over 100 cases of rape and [[sexual assault]] during the conflict, with many of these crimes believed to have been perpetrated by the Shabiha and other pro-government militias. Victims included men, women, and children, with about 80% of the known victims being women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womenundersiegeproject.org/blog/entry/the-ultimate-assault-charting-syrias-use-of-rape-to-terrorize-its-people |title=The ultimate assault: Charting Syria's use of rape to terrorize its people |publisher=Women Under Siege |date=11 July 2012 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local [[National Defence Forces (Syria)|National Defense Forces]] commanders often engaged "in war profiteering through protection rackets, looting, and organized crime". NDF members were also implicated in "waves of murders, robberies, thefts, kidnappings, and extortions throughout government-held parts of Syria since the formation of the organization in 2013", as reported by the Institute for the Study of War.&lt;ref name=ISW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iswsyria.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/the-regimes-military-capabilities-part-1.html |title=The Regime's Military Capabilities: Part 1 |publisher=ISW |last=Kozak |first=Christopher |date=26 May 2015 |accessdate=31 May 2015 |quote=Local NDF commanders often engage in war profiteering through protection rackets, looting, and organized crime. NDF members have been implicated in waves of murders, robberies, thefts, kidnappings, and extortions throughout regime-held parts of Syria since the formation of the organization in 2013.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal networks have been used by both the government and the opposition during the conflict. Facing international sanctions, the Syrian government relied on criminal organizations to smuggle goods and money in and out of the country. The economic downturn caused by the conflict and sanctions also led to lower wages for Shabiha members. In response, some Shabiha members began stealing civilian properties and engaging in kidnappings.&lt;ref name="Organized crime" /&gt; Rebel forces sometimes rely on criminal networks to obtain weapons and supplies. [[Arms trafficking|Black market weapon prices]] in Syria's neighboring countries have significantly increased since the start of the conflict. To generate funds to purchase arms, some rebel groups have turned towards extortion, theft, and kidnapping.&lt;ref name="Organized crime" /&gt;

=== Cultural heritage ===
{{Main|Tourism in Syria|List of heritage sites damaged during the Syrian Civil War|Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL}}
In January 2018 [[Turkish Air Force|Turkish]] air strikes have seriously damaged an ancient Neo-[[Hittites|Hittite]] temple in Syria's Kurdish-held [[Afrin Region|Afrin]] region. It was built by the [[Arameans]] in the first millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42858265|title=Turkish strikes 'damage ancient temple'|date=29 January 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Temple of Bel, Palmyra 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Bel]] in Palmyra, which was destroyed by ISIL in August 2015]]

As of March 2015, the war has affected 290 heritage sites, severely damaged 104, and completely destroyed 24.

UNESCO listed all six Syria's [[World Heritage site]]s as endangered but direct assessment of damage is not possible. It is known that the [[Old City of Aleppo]] was heavily damaged during battles being fought within the district, while [[Palmyra]] and [[Krak des Chevaliers]] suffered minor damage. Illegal digging is considered a grave danger, and hundreds of Syrian antiquities, including some from Palmyra, appeared in Lebanon. Three archeological museums are known to have been looted; in Raqqa some artifacts seem to have been destroyed by foreign Islamists due to religious objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/17/world/middleeast/syrian-war-takes-heavy-toll-at-a-crossroad-of-cultures.html |title=Syrian War Takes Heavy Toll at a Crossroad of Cultures |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=18 April 2014 |work=The New York Times |first=Anne |last=Barnard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 and 2015, following the rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], several sites in Syria were destroyed by the group as part of [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|a deliberate destruction of cultural heritage sites]].

A late summer 2013 exhibition in London at the [[P21 Gallery]] showed some of this work, which had to be smuggled out of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Batty |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/22/syria-art-smuggled-exhibition-london-uk |title=Syrian art smuggled from the midst of civil war to show in London |work=The Guardian |date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spillover ===
{{Main|Spillover of the Syrian Civil War}}
In June 2014, members of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) crossed the border from Syria into northern Iraq, and [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|took control]] of large swaths of Iraqi territory as the [[Iraqi Army]] abandoned its positions. Fighting between rebels and government forces also spilled over into Lebanon on several occasions. There were repeated incidents of sectarian violence in the [[North Governorate]] of Lebanon between supporters and opponents of the Syrian government, as well as armed clashes between Sunnis and Alawites in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/world/middleeast/syrian-war-plays-out-along-a-street-in-lebanon.html |title=Syrian War Plays Out Along a Street in Lebanon |work=The New York Times |date=24 August 2012 |first=Damien |last=Cave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
While the war still ongoing, Syrian President [[Bashar Al-Assad]] claimed that Syria will be able to rebuild the war-torn country on its own. {{As of |July 2018}}, the reconstruction is estimated to cost a minimum of US$400 billion. Assad claims to be able to loan this money from friendly countries, Syrian diaspora and the state treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tass.com/world/1010788|title=Syrians will reconstruct country after war themselves, Assad says|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has expressed interest in helping rebuild Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/syria/2018/syria-180619-presstv02.htm|title=Iran will remain on Syria side in post-war reconstruction: VP|first=John|last=Pike|website=''globalsecurity.org''|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; International donors have been suggested as one financier of the reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/06/reconstructing-syria-break-mold-160614080700416.html|title=Reconstructing Syria: The need to break the mould|first=Yezid|last=Sayigh|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect of this the post war years will be how to repatriate the millions of refugees. The Syrian government has put forward a law commonly known as "[[law 10]]", which could strip refugees of property, such as damaged real estate. There are also fears among some refugees that if they return to claim this property they will face negative consequences, such as forced conscription or prison. The Syrian government has been criticized for using this law to reward those who have supported the government.

'''''The Gunpowder Plot: Exploding the Legend''''' was a British television show, hosted by [[Richard Hammond]] that recreated elements of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] in which [[Guy Fawkes]] attempted to blow up the [[Palace of Westminster|House of Lords]].

First aired on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] Network in 2005, this £1 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://moreresults.factiva.com/results/index/index.aspx?ref=DAISTA0020051031e1av0000t Factiva Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; programme centres on a reconstruction of the Houses of Parliament as they were in 1605 (the current ones had not yet been built at the time of the Gunpowder Plot), constructed using period equivalent methods wherever possible. This was stocked with mannequins to represent notable commoners, members and the king before the bomb was detonated. The programme was made to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the plot.

==Synopsis==
The programme explores through partial dramatization the plot itself, and the persons involved. It also answers the question of whether the plot would have actually worked: the Houses of Parliament would have been completely obliterated, and most of the windows in nearby [[Westminster Abbey]] would have been shattered.

The first hurdle to overcome was the actual recreation of the 17th-century Houses of Parliament. As the buildings were demolished to expand the current structures, Simon Carter, the Parliamentary Curator provided drawings of the original structures for the recreated structure to utilise using 650 tonnes of concrete. Explosives expert Sidney Alford helped to determine that thirty-six barrels containing one [[cubic ton]]&lt;ref name="manser"/&gt; of gunpowder were used in the plot. Alford further proved that the "decayed" powder was classified as such because it was unsuitable for infantry use, but could still detonate.&lt;ref name="plotterswish"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article584830.ece |title=Gunpowder plotters get their wish, 400 years on |accessdate=2008-07-10 |author=Adam Sherwin |date=31 October 2005 |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatic experiment, conducted on the [[RAF Spadeadam|Advantica Spadeadam]] test site and overseen by [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]], proved unambiguously that the explosion would have, at the very least, killed all those attending the State Opening of Parliament in the Lords chamber,&lt;ref name="plotterswish"/&gt; including, according to historical consultant Justin Pollard, [[James I of England|King James I and VI of Scotland]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[Richard Bancroft|Bancroft]], [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Lord Northampton]] and the philosopher [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.show.me.uk/gunpowderplot//adults_people_lc.htm The Gunpowder Plot: Parliament &amp; Treason 1605 - People&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/francis-bacon Francis Bacon: Biography and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gpp.blastradius montage.jpg|right|thumb|400px|The [[blast radius]] indicated in red would have killed everyone within it, while those in the blue-shaded area would likely be harmed by falling debris.]]
The power of the explosion, which surprised even gunpowder experts, was such that {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} solid concrete walls (made deliberately to replicate how archives suggest the walls in the old House of Lords were constructed) were reduced to rubble. Measuring devices placed in the chamber to calculate the force of the blast were themselves destroyed by the blast, while the skull of the [[mannequin]] representing King James, which had been placed on a throne inside the chamber surrounded by courtiers, peers and bishops, was found far from the site. According to the findings of the programme, no one within 100 metres of the blast would have survived, and all windows within a large distance of the palace would have been shattered, including the stained glass windows of Westminster Abbey. The power of the explosion would have been heard at least five miles away, and seen from much further. Even if only half the gunpowder had gone off, everyone in the House of Lords and its environs would have been killed instantly. The blast would have been mostly directed upwards, Arup blasting consultant David Haddon, pointed out, raining debris in a 200-meter radius.&lt;ref name="plotterswish" /&gt;

The later part of the programme addressed the [[Contrafactual history|contrafactual historical]] aspects, had the plot actually succeeded. Pollard notes that the conspirators ideally planned to use the bombing to create a Catholic monarchy, with [[Robert Catesby]] and the Catholics in power while James's nine-year-old daughter, princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], sat on the throne. Pollard speculates that English history would have therefore more closely resembled that of France, and a [[president]] would ultimately have been living in [[Buckingham Palace]]. However, Pollard points out that, in all likelihood, the result would have been much the same as what actually transpired, with the conspirators caught and executed. Additionally, had the plot succeeded, there would have been a massacre of Catholics, who accounted for 5% of the populace, leaving no Catholics in England at all: "In reality, the blast would have sent shockwaves through the Protestant community, bolstering their resolve against the hugely outnumbered Catholics and sparking ruthless revenge." Pollard concludes that the plot was a "stupid" plan, stating that "you can't change the politics of a whole country just by blowing up a few hundred people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2005/11/05/2003278905 Taipei Times - archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Exploding the Legend cast and crew.jpg|thumb|right|Presenter [[Richard Hammond]] and director [[Mike Slee]] with the cast and crew, shown during filming of the Tavern scene on location at [[Kentwell Hall]], [[Suffolk]].]]
When approached with the idea of building a full-size replica of Parliament, stuffing the basement with gunpowder and blowing it up, presenter Richard Hammond considered it a hoax.&lt;ref name="blastfromthepast"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16316997&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=blast-from-the-past-name_page.html |title=BLAST FROM THE PAST Richard Hammond recreates the Gunpowder Plot .. for real |accessdate=2008-07-10 |author=Richard Hammond |date=1 November 2005 |work=Daily Mirror |publisher=MGN Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; He "simply did not believe that anyone would be crazy enough to recreate the Gunpowder Plot."&lt;ref name="blastfromthepast" /&gt;

Production, historically and scientifically correct, took six months. While historical research was underway in England, Hammond and explosives expert [[Sidney Alford]] had to travel to Spain to buy some gunpowder, as not enough was available in the UK. They were stopped at the French border by [[customs]] because, as Hammond recounted, "our expert [unsurprisingly] turned out to be contaminated with traces of just about every form of explosive known to man, triggering a security alert."&lt;ref name="blastfromthepast" /&gt;

Hammond recounts that during filming the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London Bombings]] put the production in a different frame of reference:

{{cquote|There were those who said we should stop our project, that it was insensitive. I disagreed. This is, after all, the story of a young man who felt persecuted in his country, who travelled abroad to learn how to use explosives and returned prepared to perpetrate an appalling act of terrorism - and if that rings a bell, so it should.|30px|30px|[[Richard Hammond]]|''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="blastfromthepast" /&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''}} [[File:Gpp.exp montage.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|The power of the explosion surprised gunpowder experts.]]
Production designer Jo Manser built part of the House of Lords (the Westminster tower) to scale as it was in 1605, and then "blew it up to see if Guy Fawkes would have succeeded 400 years ago".&lt;ref name="manser"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastfreelancer.com/broadcast/content/ViewEditorialContentStory.do?contentId=1601 |title=In Profile: production designer Jo Manser |accessdate=2008-07-10 |work=Broadcast Freelancer |publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=5 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329220258/http://www.broadcastfreelancer.com/broadcast/content/ViewEditorialContentStory.do?contentId=1601 |archivedate=29 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manser said the set (11m by 23m and 16m high) required a production crew of 45 people, and cost £200k.&lt;ref name="manser" /&gt; The set was built between July and September 2005. AP [[Structural engineer]]s were consulted to assess the equations used building the structure to ensure accuracy and safety. Despite preparations, Manser noted that while sets are eventually discarded, "this was a more exciting way to dispose of it."&lt;ref name="manser" /&gt;

For the interior filming, fifteen small digital cameras were used, including [[Sony DSR-PD150|PD150s]]. For the external shots of the explosion, a [[slow motion]] camera was used, not the type typically used in television filming. Advanitca used them to study the explosions frame by frame.&lt;ref name="manser" /&gt;

==Reception==

[[Adam Nicolson]] of [[The Guardian]] wrote in August that the casting of Hammond was "eccentric."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/04/past.comment | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Guy Fawkes was also trained abroad | date=4 August 2005 | accessdate=25 May 2010 | first=Adam | last=Nicolson}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Thomas Sutcliffe]] of [[The Independent]] noted with "satisfaction" that the documentary was "irresistible to anyone with a weakness for the delicious combination of immediate spectacle and delayed climax."&lt;ref name="reviews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mikeslee.co.uk/reviews01.htm |title=Mike Slee Producer / Director / Writer | accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sunday Express]]' Adrian Pettet points out that ''Gunpowder'' is "a cross between [[Mechannibals]] and [[Timewatch]], it's great fun and there is a bit of proper history smuggled in there too".&lt;ref name="reviews" /&gt;
